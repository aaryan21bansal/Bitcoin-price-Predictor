"The headlines were terrifying. Hospitals facing intolerable pressures with patients left dying in corridors, the BBC reported. It got so bad that 68 leading A&E doctors wrote to the prime minister to spell out their concerns. This is not now though.It was the winter of 2017-18- the last bad flu season when more than 300 people a day were dying from that virus at one point. And that was not even a one-off.In January 2016hospitals were cancelling routine operations, telling patients to stay away from A&E if they could, and emergency treatment areas were being set up outside some units - just as they are now. The truth is the past decade has been a story of lengthening waits and declining performance. A&E waits are the best barometer of this. The proportion of patients waiting less than four hours - a key metric in measuring NHS effectiveness - has been gradually eroded. It is a similar story elsewhere in the UK - with performance even worse in Wales and Northern Ireland. This should not come as a surprise, as NHS spending has been squeezed. Between 2010 and 2019 the annual rises for health were well below those traditionally given since the birth of the NHS, making it difficult to keep up with the needs of the ageing population. During that period, the Tories have been in power - albeit with the Lib Dems for the first five years. But it is worth noting, in its 2010 and 2015 election manifestos, Labour was not proposing any tangibly higher increases in spending either. The financial crash of 2008 meant all the main political parties were signed up to the idea that spending had to be curtailed. This parliament has seen a change - annual rises are now planned to be close to 4% and will end up higher once the pandemic spending is taken into account. But the result of the squeeze in the 2010s is fewer doctors and nurses per head of population than our Western European neighbours. The turn of the year is always the hardest time. And with the latest data for A&E only covering November, we need to look elsewhere to judge how alarming the current pressures driven by the Omicron variant are. Since Christmas there have been reports of hospitals declaring critical incidents. At one point on Wednesday evening, one in seven hospital trusts in England were in this situation.

This data shows the proportion of ambulance patients who waited 30 minutes or more, in the week shown. It comes from daily situation reports which are published weekly during the winter in England. As this is fast-turnaround data, the NHS says only minimal validation can be carried out but it is considered fit for purpose. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do not publish ambulance queue data. Patients at A&E should be seen within four hours of arrival. This data shows the proportion of patients attending A&E who waited longer than four hours to be treated, discharged or admitted. This data is published monthly for England and Wales and weekly for Scotland. Northern Ireland publishes its data quarterly and Winter 2021 is not yet available. If a patient at A&E needs to be admitted, the wait from decision to admit to being given a bed on a ward is recorded in England. The bed waits figure is the proportion of patients admitted via A&E who waited longer than four hours for a ward bed. In Wales, bed wait data is not published, so the figure shown is the occupancy level in general and acute beds. Scotland and Northern Ireland do not publish bed wait or bed occupancy data. Data for England is show by NHS trust, where the trust includes at least one hospital with a Type 1 A&E department. Type 1 means a consultant-led 24 hour A&E service with full resuscitation facilities. When you enter a postcode for a location in England you will be shown a list of NHS trusts in your area. They will not necessarily be in order of your closest hospital as some trusts have more than one hospital. Data for Wales and Scotland are shown by NHS board. Comparative data from two years ago is shown where available. However, where trusts have merged there is no like-for-like comparison to show. Bed occupancy data in Wales only goes back to April 2020.

They are not normally made public and instead are there to alert local health systems that a service needs help. We have nothing to compare them to. If we look at the delays ambulances face when dropping off patients at A&E - this data is available in England up to last weekend - we can see the current difficulties are worse than the last winter before the pandemic hit. But it is also fair to say this does not represent the collapse of the NHS, despite all the headlines. The truth is the health service will not suddenly become overwhelmed. Instead, what is happening is that care is deteriorating bit by bit. The heart attack patients are waiting longer for an ambulance, more elderly patients are spending nights on a trolley in A&E and growing numbers of people are waiting for hip and knee replacements. The challenges are, of course, different from winters past. It is a pandemic after all. A mass vaccination campaign is underway, while the level of staff absence from Covid is bringing another added complexity - it is nearly twice what you would expect - and explains why the army has had to be brought in. Hospitals have also had to completely reconfigure their wards to create Covid and non-Covid areas. And the sheer numbers coming in are a problem. Traditionally winter would see around 1,000 admissions a day for all types of respiratory infections. Currently the NHS is seeing more than double that for Covid alone - although a chunk admittedly are people who are ill with something else, such as broken arms, strokes and cancer for example, and may well have come in anyway. But even if you discount these patients, you are still well above the 1,000 threshold. However, the NHS has been helped by lower pressures elsewhere. Flu is at rock-bottom levels. There are fewer than 50 patients in hospital with the virus in England. So what can we conclude? The challenges are certainly worse and that is translating into poorer quality services. But this is not the first year care has been compromised. What matters now is when Covid infections peak - that will determine just how bad this winter will be.

"Alice Byrne was last seen on New Year's Day The family of a woman who has been missing since New Year's Day have said they are ""shocked and distressed"" by her disappearance. Alice Byrne, 28, was last seen leaving a friend's flat in Marlborough Street, Portobello, Edinburgh, between 08:00 and 10:00 last Saturday. Detectives believe she potentially headed in the direction of the promenade and beach. But extensive searches have failed to find any trace of Ms Byrne. In a statement, released though Police Scotland, her family said: ""Alice has been missing for one week now and we are shocked and distressed by her disappearance. ""She always keeps in contact with us so we are extremely worried because we have not heard from her. We are desperate to know where she is. ""If Alice sees this, we want her to know how much we miss her. We just want her home safe and well."" Police say Alice was wearing similar clothes to those seen in this picture when she was last seen The family urged anyone who has seen Ms Byrne or who has any information to come forward. The statement concluded: ""We are very grateful for the support we have received during this upsetting time. ""We would like to thank everyone who has shared appeals to find her, the police for their professionalism and especially the local community for all the support they've given."" Chief Insp Kieran Dougal said no one has heard from Alice since she went missing. He added: ""As time passes we have become increasingly concerned for her wellbeing and safety."" Searches of the Portobello area have involved specialist resources including air support, police dogs and the marine unit. Officers carried out a fresh search along Portobello beach on Saturday Chief Insp Dougal added: ""We are aware that the beach and promenade area was busy on New Year's morning so appeal to anyone to review photos and call if they have any information that may assist in tracing Alice. ""Naturally Alice's friends and family are extremely concerned and we just want to trace her as soon as possible to ensure she is safe. ""Again, I would urge anyone who has seen Alice since Saturday, 1 January, or who has any information that may be relevant to our investigation tocontact us,externalas soon as possible.

"Mr Massimov is an ally of former President Nursultan Nazarbayev Kazakhstan's former intelligence chief has been arrested on suspicion of treason following nationwide anti-government protests. The detention of Karim Massimov was announced by the National Security Committee, a body he headed until his removal this week. Authorities now appear to be back in control of the largest city Almaty. But President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said ""terrorist"" attacks were still happening in some places. He made the comments in a phone call with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, who sent hundreds of troops to Kazakhstan this week to help restore order. President Tokayev has blamed foreign-trained ""terrorists"" for the unrest, without giving evidence. The presence of Russian troops has brought criticism from US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said ""one lesson of recent history is that once Russians are in your house, it's sometimes very difficult to get them to leave"". Russia's foreign ministry called Blinken's remarks offensive and responded with sharp words: ""When Americans are in your house, it can be difficult to stay alive and not be robbed or raped"". AT THE SCENE:'Like something from an apocalypse film' BACKGROUND:Kazakhstan country profile CONTEXT:Why is there unrest in Kazakhstan? The protests in Kazakhstan began in response to fuel hikes but grew to reflect discontent at the government and former President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who led the country for three decades and is still thought to retain significant influence. The Interior Ministry says 26 ""armed criminals"" and 18 security officers were killed in the clashes. More than 4,000 people have been detained, according to the ministry. The figures have not been independently verified. Phone lines and internet services were down during the protests making establishing a full picture of events difficult. Kazakh authorities gave no other details about why Mr Massimov was arrested. On top of his role as head of the intelligence agency, which grew out of the Soviet state security force the KGB, Mr Massimov was a close ally of President Nazarbayev, twice serving as his prime minister. His arrest has sparked rumours of a power struggle in the Kazakh government, the BBC's Carrie Davies in Moscow reports. Also this week President Tokayev removed Mr Nazarbayev from his role as head of the influential Security Council, appointing himself in his place. Where is it?Kazakhstan shares borders with Russia to the north and China to the east. It is a huge country the size of Western Europe. Why does it matter?A former Soviet republic which is mainly Muslim with a large Russian minority, it has vast mineral resources, with 3% of global oil reserves and important coal and gas sectors. Why is it making the news?Fuel riots, which have escalated to become broader protests against the government, have resulted in resignations at the top and a bloody crackdown on protesters.

"The former teacher is said to have handed over thousands of pounds to suspected terrorists A woman who supported terrorism has been banned from teaching for life. Miriam Sebbagh, who worked at Hunwick Primary School in Crook, County Durham, was found to have given money to people she knew were involved in terrorism. A teacher misconduct panelalso heard,externalshe tried to radicalise a friend. Ms Sebbagh was arrested in 2017 and investigated by police but the Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges, the panel heard. Counter Terrorism Policing North East (CTPNE) ""maintained a high level of concern regarding Ms Sebbagh's state of mind, the opinions which she espoused and her actions within the teaching arena"", its report said. The panel heard CTPNE had received information that Ms Sebbagh had given Â£2,500 to an individual linked to a proscribed terrorist organisation. She had made ""numerous"" other payments to individuals, charities, overseas accounts and crowd-funded donation sites. The panel heard CTPNE was concerned Ms Sebbagh was funding travel from the UK for people wanting to join ISIS or other extremist groups. It told the Teaching Regulation Authority that some of the payments were made to people who had been investigated or arrested for suspected terrorism related offences. The misconduct panel report said Ms Sebbagh believed violent jihad was the correct interpretation of Islamic teaching but lied about her beliefs and actions. She claimed not to know ISIS was a terrorist organisation and not to know a video she sent to one person promoted jihad, it said. She also claimed not to have known another individual was involved in encouraging hate against the West when she sent him money when in fact she shared his views. Ms Sebbagh provided the panel with no formal response or evidence to be considered and did not attend the hearing. The panel heard a court order had been made requiring her to forfeit Â£4,670 seized from her safe in June 2018 which she intended to donate to people she knew were involved in terrorism. She was also ordered to pay costs of Â£12,654. The teacher was found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct and conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute and was prohibited from teaching indefinitely. Hunwick Primary School headteacher Stuart Joyce said none of the allegations concerned her employment there. She had been suspended as soon as the school was informed of the allegations and then formally dismissed in October 2018, he said.

"Chester FC fans celebrate - but will they be stopped from watching matches at the Deva Stadium? Chester FC bosses have insisted the football club is English after the club was accused of breaking Welsh Covid rules. Chester, whose Bumpers Lane home straddles the England and Wales border, staged two home games over Christmas. The club has been warned about playing further home matches with crowds. Andy Morris, the club's chairman, said the location of the ground was no longer a joke and ""had become a very real problem"". On Saturday, the Welsh government insisted Chester FC's stadium was in Wales and the club's home games were therefore subject to Welsh Covid restrictions. Since rules capping the number of spectators at events in Wales took effect on 26 December, Chester have hosted two home fixtures at Bumpers Lane - against AFC Telford and AFC Fylde - both in front of 2,000-plus crowds. The club had insisted it had been told it was not eligible for financial support - from the Â£3m available for clubs in Wales impacted by fan restrictions - as it was an English club, but the Welsh government has now said: ""As a club based in Wales, Chester FC would be eligible for support."" Probe into perceived Chester Covid rule breach EFL chief Trevor Birch contacts Welsh government over fan ban Welsh Rugby Union considering hosting games in England Prior to the Covid pandemic, Mr Morris said the significance of the stadium's unique location had been regarded as little more than the answer to a common quiz question. ""It's something we've had for 30 years now since the stadium was built,"" he said. ""It was never a problem before we had devolution and changes in Covid rules."" The facts are: Chester, a former English Football side from 1930 to 2000, then again from 2004 to 2009, play in the English league pyramid system They are now affiliated only to the English Football Association and are not any longer affiliated to the Welsh FA The pitch is in Wales but the stadium is considered English The land of this now fan-owned club owned by Cheshire West and Chester Council Games are policed by Cheshire Constabulary ""We had a meeting on Friday morning with Cheshire police, Flintshire police and both local authorities,"" Morris told BBC Radio Merseyside. ""I get a feeling that nobody really knows what to do with the situation. It's a bit of a political football, with some of the wider Covid restrictions. ""The entrance to the stadium site is in England. The stadium is registered in England. It's actually owned by Cheshire West and Cheshire Council, so it's all very, very complicated at the moment."" ""I'm not really sure as to why it's become an issue. It hasn't been for the last two years whilst we wrestled through Covid. We haven't had access to any Welsh government support, Welsh funding, anything like that."" Chester vice-chairman Jim Green added: ""We were asked on Thursday to attend a meeting on Friday. ""We went into that meeting expecting it to be a conciliatory discussion to try and find a way forward. But we were presented with a letter on behalf of North Wales Police and Flintshire council warning us that, in their eyes, we had breached Coronavirus regulations in Wales and that, if we continued to play, that would mean further breaches. ""What we said in the meeting on Friday morning is that all parties need to take a step back, reflect and take some more legal advice."" ""We're not eligible for financial support from Sport Wales as we're not an affiliated Welsh club,"" said Morris. ""That's been made clear, so the impact would be massive, if we're told for a period of time we're not allowed spectators in. We don't have the revenues from central funding. ""Chester are a fan-owned club. The way we operate is financially sustainable. We don't operate with debt, we can't take on loans, we don't have an overdraft. So we rely on matchday income. ""If we're forced to play behind closed doors for a sustained period of time, that could mean the end of the football club."" ""The implications of this decision and any outcome are significant,"" added vice-chairman Green. ""In the short term, the biggest implication is that it's not viable for us to play without fans in the stadium. ""The bigger wider implication is over the border between England and Wales and how the law is applied on either side of the border and who is responsible for that. ""We're an English football club, based in an English city, playing in an English league and we would expect that English law would apply to us. ""It's going to need some cool heads and common sense thinking and hoping we can find a way forward."" Chester are confused as to why this situation, if it needed addressing, was not addressed 13 months ago during the first year of the Covid pandemic. ""We were aware of what the regulations were in Wales and what the regulations were in England,"" said Green. ""But, if we go back to December 2020, we played two home games with fans inside the stadium. in line with English restrictions at that time. ""Back then, Wales was still in lockdown and Welsh clubs were playing behind closed doors. So, for us, there is precedent there."" With attendances for sporting fixtures in Wales currently capped at 50 people, Morris claims that police advised setting up a fan zone. ""They said we can have 2,000 people stood watching a giant screen in a fan park like you see during World Cup years,"" he said. ""That's absolutely fine because that's in England, but we can't have socially distanced individuals in a Covid-secure compliance within a stadium. It's a farce.""

"Jack Dromey ""was a man of the people"", Labour MP Khalid Mahmood said in his tribute Birmingham has ""lost a dedicated servant"" withthe death of Jack Dromeyand ""will not be the same without him"", politicians have said as tributes pour in for the veteran Labour politician. The MP for Erdington died suddenly in his flat on Friday, the shadow minister's family said. Politicians from across the political spectrum in the West Midlands have paid tribute to the 73-year-old. ""Jack was a man of the people,"" Perry Barr's Labour MP Khalid Mahmood said. He added Mr Dromey was selected to stand for the Erdington seat in 2010 ""purely because of his record for helping working people"", winning him the respect of people across the country, from both sides of the political divide. Fellow Birmingham MPs echoed the view of Yardley's Labour MPJess Phillips, who tweeted his death had been a shock,external, adding the city would ""not be the same without him"". His death came just hours after Mr Dromey had spoken in a Commons debate on Afghan refugees and soon after he had attended a speech on Tuesday by Sir Keir Starmer. ""He was a bundle of energy, he was always on to the next thing, he always had an idea,"" Selly Oak's Steve McCabe told BBC Radio WM, adding that Dromey had always ""loved"" his constituency. Mr Dromey's passion and dedication to Birmingham was a theme of many tributes paid to him ""A true Labour man,"" the leader of Birmingham City Council, Labour'sIan Ward tweeted,external, ""who served the people of Erdington with passion and dedication"". The shadow minister is survived by his wife, fellow Labour MP Harriet Harman, and his three children. He made his name in politics in the union movement before winning the Erdington seat nearly 12 years ago and going on to serve in several senior Labour Party roles. Jack Dromey represented everything good about a serving MP. He campaigned steadfastly for his constituents, whether they voted for him or not. He happily worked alongside colleagues from other parties when they shared a common goal, whether to promote Erdington, Birmingham or the West Midlands. Contrary to the general view that politicians are in it for themselves, he was not untypical.  When I covered stories in which he was involved he was always honest, straightforward and helpful. He was also a pro. When in need of a clip for an imminent news item, you could say, ""Jack, could you sum that all up in 20 seconds?"" - and after a brief pause he would, in exactly 20 seconds. Andy Street, the Conservative West Midlands Mayor, described him as a ""dedicated servant"" of Birmingham and tweeted a statement describing Mr Dromey as ""a true democrat"". Allow Twitter content?

"The former teacher is said to have handed over thousands of pounds to suspected terrorists A woman who supported terrorism has been banned from teaching for life. Miriam Sebbagh, who worked at Hunwick Primary School in Crook, County Durham, was found to have given money to people she knew were involved in terrorism. A teacher misconduct panelalso heard,externalshe tried to radicalise a friend. Ms Sebbagh was arrested in 2017 and investigated by police but the Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges, the panel heard. Counter Terrorism Policing North East (CTPNE) ""maintained a high level of concern regarding Ms Sebbagh's state of mind, the opinions which she espoused and her actions within the teaching arena"", its report said. The panel heard CTPNE had received information that Ms Sebbagh had given Â£2,500 to an individual linked to a proscribed terrorist organisation. She had made ""numerous"" other payments to individuals, charities, overseas accounts and crowd-funded donation sites. The panel heard CTPNE was concerned Ms Sebbagh was funding travel from the UK for people wanting to join ISIS or other extremist groups. It told the Teaching Regulation Authority that some of the payments were made to people who had been investigated or arrested for suspected terrorism related offences. The misconduct panel report said Ms Sebbagh believed violent jihad was the correct interpretation of Islamic teaching but lied about her beliefs and actions. She claimed not to know ISIS was a terrorist organisation and not to know a video she sent to one person promoted jihad, it said. She also claimed not to have known another individual was involved in encouraging hate against the West when she sent him money when in fact she shared his views. Ms Sebbagh provided the panel with no formal response or evidence to be considered and did not attend the hearing. The panel heard a court order had been made requiring her to forfeit Â£4,670 seized from her safe in June 2018 which she intended to donate to people she knew were involved in terrorism. She was also ordered to pay costs of Â£12,654. The teacher was found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct and conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute and was prohibited from teaching indefinitely. Hunwick Primary School headteacher Stuart Joyce said none of the allegations concerned her employment there. She had been suspended as soon as the school was informed of the allegations and then formally dismissed in October 2018, he said.

"Activists have been gathering at the hotel in support of refugees As tennis star Novak Djokovic fights deportation from Australia, he has been sent to an immigration hotel where refugees and asylum seekers have long complained of poor conditions.

The account matched those of other people being held in the facility,who shared their experiences with Australia's SBS News last month.,external ""We keep telling them we can't eat this type of food but they've not been listening,"" an Iraqi asylum seeker told the news site. ""I've lost weight because I've just been eating nuts."" Djokovic's parents have called the accommodation ""terrible"" and claim their son is being treated like a prisoner. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said his government had asked that the athlete be moved from the ""infamous hotel"". The Australian Border Force and Home Affairs Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce told the BBC that rich people ""can't wander around the world thinking... they are above the laws"". It is not clear what conditions Djokovic is being held in, and activists have highlighted the difference between the tennis star's situation and that of others there. ""Novak Djokovic has spent just one night in immigration detention in Australia but some have been locked up... for years on end,"" tweeted Sophie McNeill from Human Rights Watch. ""Australia's treatment of asylum seekers is inhumane, deeply cruel & illegal under international law."" BACKGROUND:Australia pays compensation to asylum seekers FEATURE:The kids locked up for most of their childhood Chris Breen, an activist with the Refugee Action Collective, said the biggest problem for those being held there was the ""indefinite nature of their detention"". ""If you're only there for a couple of days, a room in a hotel is not the end of the world. But if you're stuck there, it's a very different story. ""Djokovic at least knows that at some point he'll get out - whether that's getting a visa or deported, but the refugees don't have that."" Mr Breen also said he suspected that staff would be ""a lot more careful"" with Djokovic in terms of things like food. The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre estimates that there are now 33 refugees and people seeking asylum inside the Park Hotel, among some 70 held across Australia's onshore detention centres. The Park Hotel has been housing refugees and asylum seekers since late 2020. Kurdish refugee Mostafa ""Moz"" Azimitabar, who spent more than a year in immigration hotels including two months at the Park Hotel, described his room there as a ""coffin"". He said he spent about 23 hours a day inside the room he shared with one other person, where the window was tinted and sealed shut. ""A hotel is a place for people who want to be comfortable and enjoy their time, but when they lock the place, that place becomes a prison, not a hotel,"" he said. The hotel hit headlines last year because of a Covid outbreak, which saw about half of the refugees and asylum seekers being held there test positive. Staff and those detained described the facility as an ""incubator"" for the virus. ""I sit in the room and I am afraid. We are all afraid,""Salah Mustafa told the Guardian newspaper at the time.,external A fire also broke out at the hotel in December. One person was hospitalised for smoke inhalation but there were no fatalities, reports say. As attention returned to the hotel on Thursday, detainees looked on from inside the building. Mehdi Ali told AFP news agency that Djokovic was his favourite tennis player, and that he was saddened by the idea of the star being held there. ""The media will talk about us more, the whole world probably, which is so sad, just because Djokovic would be here for a few days,"" he said.

"Russian officials say the 2,500 strong force will only remain in Kazakhstan temporarily US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has questioned Kazakhstan's decision to seek Russian military aid to deal with an ongoing wave of violent unrest. Dozens of people have been killed in protests triggered by a rise in fuel prices, but Mr Blinken said the US believes that the Kazakh government can deal with the protests itself. He told reporters that it was unclear why the deployment was happening. The first of about 2,500 Russian-led troops have arrived in Kazakhstan. Officials in Moscow have emphasised that the deployment of its forces under the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a Eurasian military alliance of five former Soviet republics and Russia, is temporary. This video can not be played Watch: The BBC's Abdujalil Abdurasulov hears gunfire as he visits the scene of clashes in Almaty President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev made the request for assistance after protesters stormed the mayor's office in Kazakhstan's largest city, Almaty, and overran the city's airport. But addressing reporters at a State Department briefing, Mr Blinken warned that ""one lesson of recent history is that once Russians are in your house, it's sometimes very difficult to get them to leave"". ""It would seem to me that the Kazakh authorities and government certainly have the capacity to deal appropriately with protests to do so in a way that respects the rights of protesters while maintaining law and order,"" Mr Blinken said. ""So it's not clear why they feel the need for any outside assistance. So we're trying to learn more about it."" Meanwhile, the US has authorised the departure of some non-essential staff from its consulate in Almaty amid safety concerns over the ongoing protests. 'Like something from an apocalypse film' Why have Russian troops been sent to Kazakhstan? Some Russian paratrooper units have already arrived in the country, and on Friday assisted Kazakh forces in retaking the airport from protesters. Kazakh troops have also taken firm action to regain control in Almaty. On Thursday, local media published videos showing government troops opening fire on protesters. The Interior Ministry says 26 ""armed criminals"" and 18 security officers have been killed so far in the clashes and President Tokayev  blamed what he called foreign ""terrorists"" for the unrest. Mass protests broke out on Sunday when the cost of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) - which many people in Kazakhstan use to fuel their cars - doubled. The government has since said that fuel price caps will be restored for six months. But the announcement has failed to end the protests, which have broadened to include other political grievances. There is no effective political opposition in Kazakhstan and most elections are won by the ruling party with almost 100% of the vote. The country's previous president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, ruled the country for 29 years and retained significant power since leaving office. Mr Tokayev has now removed him as head of the country's security council. It was also announced on Saturday that a former prime minister and security chief, Karim Massimov, had been arrested on Thursday on suspicion of treason, along with other officials. No further details of the arrests have been given. Where is it?Kazakhstan shares borders with Russia to the north and China to the east. It is a huge country the size of Western Europe. Why does it matter?A former Soviet republic which is mainly Muslim with a large Russian minority, it has vast mineral resources, with 3% of global oil reserves and important coal and gas sectors. Why is it making the news?Fuel riots, which have escalated to become broader protests against the government, have resulted in resignations at the top and a bloody crackdown on protesters.

"Stock image of Covid drive-thru testing site A US teacher has been arrested after allegedly locking her Covid-positive son in a car boot to protect herself from exposure to the virus as she drove to a testing site, say local media. Sarah Beam, 41, is reportedly charged with endangering a child. A witness called police after hearing someone in the vehicle's trunk on 3 January at the site in Harris County, Texas,according to click2Houston.com,external. The teacher reportedly opened the boot to reveal the boy lying inside. Ms Beam said her 13-year-old son had tested positive for Covid-19 and she was taking him to the Pridgeon Stadium location for another test to confirm the result, according to local media. She reportedly said she had placed the teenager in the car boot because she did not want to be infected herself. A health worker told her there would be no coronavirus test until the boy was allowed to sit in the back seat of the car,reports ABC affiliate KTRK-TV,external. Ms Beam has been working as a teacher at Cypress Falls High School since 2011, but is now on administrative leave, according to local media.

"This video can not be played Highlights: Khawaja's century leaves England battling to save fourth Test Fourth Ashes Test, Sydney (day four of five) Australia416-8 dec&265-6 dec(Khawaja 101*, Green 74; Leach 4-84) England294& 30-0(Crawley 22*, Hameed 8*) England need 358 more runs to win Scorecard Australia's Usman Khawaja hit another classy century to leave England needing to bat out the final day to save the fourth Ashes Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). Khawaja made an unbeaten 101 from 138 balls, to follow his 137 in the first innings, as Australia set England an unlikely 388 to win. With dark storm clouds closing in, England openers Zak Crawley and Haseeb Hameed survived a tricky 11 over and 50 minute period to reach 30-0 at stumps. Crawley will resume on 22 and Hameed eight when play resumes at 23:00 GMT on Saturday, with 98 overs scheduled on the final day, when theforecast is mixed. Khawaja shared a partnership of 179 with Cameron Green (74) for the fifth wicket as the hosts recovered from 86-4 to keep Australia's hopes of a 5-0 series clean sweep alive. Earlier in the day, England added 36 runs to their overnight 258-7, with Jonny Bairstow only able to add 10 more runs before feathering Scott Boland behind to fall for 113. That left a first-innings deficit of 122 and continued a dismal series with the bat, with the tourists yet to reach 300. Substitute Ollie Pope kept wicket for England - and did an excellent job, taking four catches - with Jos Buttler and Jonny Bairstow both spending the day off the field with hand injuries. They - along with Ben Stokes, who did field despite ongoing troubles with a left side strain - have had scans and will continue to be assessed before the fifth Test, which starts in Hobart on 14 January. Clips, reaction & analysis to day four Listen: Khawaja ton leaves England battling to save Test This video can not be played Khawaja reaches his second hundred of match - best shots Khawaja's innings was another masterclass and one that England's batters could do far worse than watch and learn from. The 35-year-old right-hander was hit by a venomous Mark Wood bouncer first ball and he started slowly and did not look fluent in his strokeplay, but importantly he was able to protect his wicket and guide the inexperienced Green, who was ragged for large parts of his innings, through a sticky period. Australia were always in control of the game, but at 86-4 the door was slightly ajar for England, who had bowled well and were controlling the scoring rate. The stand between Khawaja and Green firmly closed it again, and double padlocked it for good measure. Khawaja, who has now scored more runs than any England batter other than Joe Root in the series, reverse swept, pulled and drove through the covers with an elegant grace for a well-deserved 10th Test century. It marked a dream return to the Test fold for Australia and he was visibly emotional as he composed himself after the celebrations. Before the Test he spoke about Travis Head - who tested positive for Covid-19 - reclaiming his place for the final Test, but Khawaja must surely now feature in Hobart. Test Match Special commentator Geoff Lemon joked ""there will be fights on the streets"" if Australia try and drop him now. The fact Crawley and Hameed's unbroken partnership of 30 is England's highest opening stand of the series summarises a challenging four weeks. They had to battle, with the weather closing in and the light deteriorating, but there were very few scares. Hameed edged well short of the slip cordon, while a rising Boland delivery hit the shoulder of Crawley's bat and flew over the close catchers, but the openers have given England a chance of saving the Test. In the field, England were excellent in the morning session and in the first hour after lunch to restrict Australia and create an opening, but as has often the case, they were unable to capitalise. Wood again bowled well, taking 2-65, while Jack Leach had his best day of the series, in taking 4-84. England set better, more attacking fields, for the left-arm spinner, who was denied a chance to take a hat-trick when Pat Cummins declared after Green and Alex Carey fell in successive balls.

""I want the guys to enjoy the contest tomorrow - Australia will come hard and tonight was a good example of our players' temperament and technique being good."" Australia batter Usman Khawaja:""I couldn't stop smiling. I was grateful with one hundred, but I'll take the second one too. ""It reminds me of an old-school SCG wicket. Hopefully it will be a dry day and we can get some reverse swing. Nathan Lyon will hopefully come into the game."" BBC Cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew on TMS:""England do have a chance to save this game and people will be expecting them to. It would mean so much to them if they can."" Former Australia captain Ian Chappell on TMS:""I've been really impressed with Ollie Pope's wicketkeeping - he's been far and away above Jos Buttler. His footwork in particular has been impressive.""

"A number of green energy products are funded through charges on consumers' bills A group of green-minded Tory MPs says the government should fund environmental and social energy policies from the Treasury, instead of from consumer bills. The Conservative Environment Network (CEN), which includes 116 MPs, says the temporary measure would ease the surge in household costs. But the group opposes a separate proposal to abolish the 5% VAT on energy bills, saying it would effectively provide a subsidy for fossil fuels. I understand anxiety over rising prices - Sunak Labour steps up call for 5% energy bill VAT cut Energy firms call for end to green levies on bills The CEN is urging ministers to reduce bills and emissions in the long term by ensuring the UK's homes are better insulated. The plea is endorsed by the Energy Efficiency Infrastructure Group - an alliance of businesses and charities who will write to the prime minister on Monday, arguing better insulation for people in sub-standard housing could cut bills by Â£500 a year. But the current crisis over energy bills has revealed divisions among Conservative backbenchers. The plan to scrap VAT on energyhas been pushed by the Net Zero Scrutiny Group(NZSG) of Tory MPs and peers. The caucus, with around 20 followers, has been linked to the anti-green pressure group formerly known asthe Global Warming Policy Forum,external, which was founded by the former Chancellor Nigel Lawson. Although its numbers are small, it is well connected in Conservative media. Its leader, the Tory MP for South Thanet, Craig Mackinlay has regularly voted against measures to tackle climate change. He doesn't deny climate change science, but believes the costs of climate policies are falling unfairly on the UK. In December, Mr Mackinlay tweeted that he blamed ""the rush to Net Zero"" for creating the ""madness in the energy market"". But this view is disputed by the industry body Energy UK, which says the rise in gas prices has caused the crisis, not Net Zero policies. Craig Mackinlay leads the Net Zero Scrutiny Group of Tory MPs and peers Sam Hall, director of the environmental CEN, pointed out that his organisation had almost six times more members than the sceptic NZSG. He told BBC News: ""A clear majority of Conservative backbenchers supports the government's Net Zero agenda - the PM should know that we've got his back."" The director added: ""Last year, no Conservative MP voted against the government's sixth carbon budget, which aims to cut emissions by 78% by 2035. ""Although a small minority of MPs are raising concerns about the cost of achieving the target, it is perfectly possible to deliver Net Zero in a way that is fair and keeps down energy costs for consumers and businesses."" Mr Hall insisted the solution to the global gas crisis ""was not to deepen our dependence on gas by removing VAT"". Instead, he said the Treasury must urgently devise policies to fund environmental and social energy projects for the long term. The government has accepted that its current system of loading levies onto the cleaner fuel - namely electricity - is perverse. Mr Hall said when the price of gas settles, the levies should be shifted on to the dirtier home heating fuel, gas. ""Because of the government's Net Zero policy, the UK is set to reduce its gas demand significantly over coming decades,"" he said. ""This will protect UK consumers from future gas price shocks by making us less dependent on volatile international gas prices."" But Mr Mackinlay told BBC News he did not see any ""conflict"" between his group and the CEN, ""nor anything to be gained by an 'ours are bigger than yours' approach"". He added: ""We all want to leave the planet in a better place than we found it. ""The key difference is our perception of how best to achieve a lower carbon UK and to inject some realism when the UK is responsible for 1% of global CO2 whilst China, India, Indonesia go gangbusters for new coal."" Mr Hall said: ""Every country will need to hit Net Zero - and the UK should lead on this to gain the benefit of going first to develop new technology and services."" The government is urgently seeking solutions for the cost of living crisis, which is seeing bills and price tags rising in the UK. The idea of targeted financial support for fuel bills - along the lines of the current Warm Homes Discount scheme - is emerging as a frontrunner to tackle a cost of living squeeze, which could see households Â£1,200 a year worse off as a higher energy cap comes in at whilst taxes rise for workers and employers.

"Russian officials say the 2,500 strong force will only remain in Kazakhstan temporarily US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has questioned Kazakhstan's decision to seek Russian military aid to deal with an ongoing wave of violent unrest. Dozens of people have been killed in protests triggered by a rise in fuel prices, but Mr Blinken said the US believes that the Kazakh government can deal with the protests itself. He told reporters that it was unclear why the deployment was happening. The first of about 2,500 Russian-led troops have arrived in Kazakhstan. Officials in Moscow have emphasised that the deployment of its forces under the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a Eurasian military alliance of five former Soviet republics and Russia, is temporary. This video can not be played Watch: The BBC's Abdujalil Abdurasulov hears gunfire as he visits the scene of clashes in Almaty President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev made the request for assistance after protesters stormed the mayor's office in Kazakhstan's largest city, Almaty, and overran the city's airport. But addressing reporters at a State Department briefing, Mr Blinken warned that ""one lesson of recent history is that once Russians are in your house, it's sometimes very difficult to get them to leave"". ""It would seem to me that the Kazakh authorities and government certainly have the capacity to deal appropriately with protests to do so in a way that respects the rights of protesters while maintaining law and order,"" Mr Blinken said. ""So it's not clear why they feel the need for any outside assistance. So we're trying to learn more about it."" Meanwhile, the US has authorised the departure of some non-essential staff from its consulate in Almaty amid safety concerns over the ongoing protests. 'Like something from an apocalypse film' Why have Russian troops been sent to Kazakhstan? Some Russian paratrooper units have already arrived in the country, and on Friday assisted Kazakh forces in retaking the airport from protesters. Kazakh troops have also taken firm action to regain control in Almaty. On Thursday, local media published videos showing government troops opening fire on protesters. The Interior Ministry says 26 ""armed criminals"" and 18 security officers have been killed so far in the clashes and President Tokayev  blamed what he called foreign ""terrorists"" for the unrest. Mass protests broke out on Sunday when the cost of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) - which many people in Kazakhstan use to fuel their cars - doubled. The government has since said that fuel price caps will be restored for six months. But the announcement has failed to end the protests, which have broadened to include other political grievances. There is no effective political opposition in Kazakhstan and most elections are won by the ruling party with almost 100% of the vote. The country's previous president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, ruled the country for 29 years and retained significant power since leaving office. Mr Tokayev has now removed him as head of the country's security council. It was also announced on Saturday that a former prime minister and security chief, Karim Massimov, had been arrested on Thursday on suspicion of treason, along with other officials. No further details of the arrests have been given. Where is it?Kazakhstan shares borders with Russia to the north and China to the east. It is a huge country the size of Western Europe. Why does it matter?A former Soviet republic which is mainly Muslim with a large Russian minority, it has vast mineral resources, with 3% of global oil reserves and important coal and gas sectors. Why is it making the news?Fuel riots, which have escalated to become broader protests against the government, have resulted in resignations at the top and a bloody crackdown on protesters.

"Westminster Council said it missed ""clear and repeated warnings"" about overspending A tourist attraction that opened incomplete, over budget and led to resignations is set to close. The Marble Arch Mound, which was supposed to attract people back into the heart of the city, charged visitors up to Â£8 when it opened in July. However, the Â£6m artificial hill was forced to close temporarily when plants and grass began to die on the structure surrounded by scaffolding. Scheduled to run until January, it shuts for the final time on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Highlights: Khawaja's century leaves England battling to save fourth Test Fourth Ashes Test, Sydney (day four of five) Australia416-8 dec&265-6 dec(Khawaja 101*, Green 74; Leach 4-84) England294& 30-0(Crawley 22*, Hameed 8*) England need 358 more runs to win Scorecard Australia's Usman Khawaja hit another classy century to leave England needing to bat out the final day to save the fourth Ashes Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). Khawaja made an unbeaten 101 from 138 balls, to follow his 137 in the first innings, as Australia set England an unlikely 388 to win. With dark storm clouds closing in, England openers Zak Crawley and Haseeb Hameed survived a tricky 11 over and 50 minute period to reach 30-0 at stumps. Crawley will resume on 22 and Hameed eight when play resumes at 23:00 GMT on Saturday, with 98 overs scheduled on the final day, when theforecast is mixed. Khawaja shared a partnership of 179 with Cameron Green (74) for the fifth wicket as the hosts recovered from 86-4 to keep Australia's hopes of a 5-0 series clean sweep alive. Earlier in the day, England added 36 runs to their overnight 258-7, with Jonny Bairstow only able to add 10 more runs before feathering Scott Boland behind to fall for 113. That left a first-innings deficit of 122 and continued a dismal series with the bat, with the tourists yet to reach 300. Substitute Ollie Pope kept wicket for England - and did an excellent job, taking four catches - with Jos Buttler and Jonny Bairstow both spending the day off the field with hand injuries. They - along with Ben Stokes, who did field despite ongoing troubles with a left side strain - have had scans and will continue to be assessed before the fifth Test, which starts in Hobart on 14 January. Clips, reaction & analysis to day four Listen: Khawaja ton leaves England battling to save Test This video can not be played Khawaja reaches his second hundred of match - best shots Khawaja's innings was another masterclass and one that England's batters could do far worse than watch and learn from. The 35-year-old right-hander was hit by a venomous Mark Wood bouncer first ball and he started slowly and did not look fluent in his strokeplay, but importantly he was able to protect his wicket and guide the inexperienced Green, who was ragged for large parts of his innings, through a sticky period. Australia were always in control of the game, but at 86-4 the door was slightly ajar for England, who had bowled well and were controlling the scoring rate. The stand between Khawaja and Green firmly closed it again, and double padlocked it for good measure. Khawaja, who has now scored more runs than any England batter other than Joe Root in the series, reverse swept, pulled and drove through the covers with an elegant grace for a well-deserved 10th Test century. It marked a dream return to the Test fold for Australia and he was visibly emotional as he composed himself after the celebrations. Before the Test he spoke about Travis Head - who tested positive for Covid-19 - reclaiming his place for the final Test, but Khawaja must surely now feature in Hobart. Test Match Special commentator Geoff Lemon joked ""there will be fights on the streets"" if Australia try and drop him now. The fact Crawley and Hameed's unbroken partnership of 30 is England's highest opening stand of the series summarises a challenging four weeks. They had to battle, with the weather closing in and the light deteriorating, but there were very few scares. Hameed edged well short of the slip cordon, while a rising Boland delivery hit the shoulder of Crawley's bat and flew over the close catchers, but the openers have given England a chance of saving the Test. In the field, England were excellent in the morning session and in the first hour after lunch to restrict Australia and create an opening, but as has often the case, they were unable to capitalise. Wood again bowled well, taking 2-65, while Jack Leach had his best day of the series, in taking 4-84. England set better, more attacking fields, for the left-arm spinner, who was denied a chance to take a hat-trick when Pat Cummins declared after Green and Alex Carey fell in successive balls. This video can not be played Leach takes two in two as Australia declare England caretaker coach Graham Thorpe on TMS:""I'm confident [that we can draw] that if we have the right approach and if we don't go into our bunkers as well because I think when you're playing for the draw you must keep that intent because it makes you move better and allows you to make better decisions. ""I want the guys to enjoy the contest tomorrow - Australia will come hard and tonight was a good example of our players' temperament and technique being good."" Australia batter Usman Khawaja:""I couldn't stop smiling. I was grateful with one hundred, but I'll take the second one too. ""It reminds me of an old-school SCG wicket. Hopefully it will be a dry day and we can get some reverse swing. Nathan Lyon will hopefully come into the game."" BBC Cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew on TMS:""England do have a chance to save this game and people will be expecting them to. It would mean so much to them if they can."" Former Australia captain Ian Chappell on TMS:""I've been really impressed with Ollie Pope's wicketkeeping - he's been far and away above Jos Buttler. His footwork in particular has been impressive.""

"A number of green energy products are funded through charges on consumers' bills A group of green-minded Tory MPs says the government should fund environmental and social energy policies from the Treasury, instead of from consumer bills. The Conservative Environment Network (CEN), which includes 116 MPs, says the temporary measure would ease the surge in household costs. But the group opposes a separate proposal to abolish the 5% VAT on energy bills, saying it would effectively provide a subsidy for fossil fuels. I understand anxiety over rising prices - Sunak Labour steps up call for 5% energy bill VAT cut Energy firms call for end to green levies on bills The CEN is urging ministers to reduce bills and emissions in the long term by ensuring the UK's homes are better insulated. The plea is endorsed by the Energy Efficiency Infrastructure Group - an alliance of businesses and charities who will write to the prime minister on Monday, arguing better insulation for people in sub-standard housing could cut bills by Â£500 a year. But the current crisis over energy bills has revealed divisions among Conservative backbenchers. The plan to scrap VAT on energyhas been pushed by the Net Zero Scrutiny Group(NZSG) of Tory MPs and peers. The caucus, with around 20 followers, has been linked to the anti-green pressure group formerly known asthe Global Warming Policy Forum,external, which was founded by the former Chancellor Nigel Lawson. Although its numbers are small, it is well connected in Conservative media. Its leader, the Tory MP for South Thanet, Craig Mackinlay has regularly voted against measures to tackle climate change. He doesn't deny climate change science, but believes the costs of climate policies are falling unfairly on the UK. In December, Mr Mackinlay tweeted that he blamed ""the rush to Net Zero"" for creating the ""madness in the energy market"". But this view is disputed by the industry body Energy UK, which says the rise in gas prices has caused the crisis, not Net Zero policies. Craig Mackinlay leads the Net Zero Scrutiny Group of Tory MPs and peers Sam Hall, director of the environmental CEN, pointed out that his organisation had almost six times more members than the sceptic NZSG. He told BBC News: ""A clear majority of Conservative backbenchers supports the government's Net Zero agenda - the PM should know that we've got his back."" The director added: ""Last year, no Conservative MP voted against the government's sixth carbon budget, which aims to cut emissions by 78% by 2035. ""Although a small minority of MPs are raising concerns about the cost of achieving the target, it is perfectly possible to deliver Net Zero in a way that is fair and keeps down energy costs for consumers and businesses."" Mr Hall insisted the solution to the global gas crisis ""was not to deepen our dependence on gas by removing VAT"". Instead, he said the Treasury must urgently devise policies to fund environmental and social energy projects for the long term. The government has accepted that its current system of loading levies onto the cleaner fuel - namely electricity - is perverse. Mr Hall said when the price of gas settles, the levies should be shifted on to the dirtier home heating fuel, gas. ""Because of the government's Net Zero policy, the UK is set to reduce its gas demand significantly over coming decades,"" he said. ""This will protect UK consumers from future gas price shocks by making us less dependent on volatile international gas prices."" But Mr Mackinlay told BBC News he did not see any ""conflict"" between his group and the CEN, ""nor anything to be gained by an 'ours are bigger than yours' approach"". He added: ""We all want to leave the planet in a better place than we found it. ""The key difference is our perception of how best to achieve a lower carbon UK and to inject some realism when the UK is responsible for 1% of global CO2 whilst China, India, Indonesia go gangbusters for new coal."" Mr Hall said: ""Every country will need to hit Net Zero - and the UK should lead on this to gain the benefit of going first to develop new technology and services."" The government is urgently seeking solutions for the cost of living crisis, which is seeing bills and price tags rising in the UK. The idea of targeted financial support for fuel bills - along the lines of the current Warm Homes Discount scheme - is emerging as a frontrunner to tackle a cost of living squeeze, which could see households Â£1,200 a year worse off as a higher energy cap comes in at whilst taxes rise for workers and employers.

"Flat owners will not have to pay to remove dangerous cladding from lower-height buildings under new government plans, BBC Newsnight understands. It means leaseholders in buildings of between 11 and 18.5m will no longer be expected to take out personal loans to cover the cost of the work. Instead, the government will try to secure up to Â£4bn from developers towards the costs. It had already promised to pay to remove cladding in taller buildings. If ministers are unable to secure the funding from developers it may come out of the housing department's budget. What makes cladding unsafe and what are your rights? âLenders wonât touch us - my homeâs worth nothing' Delay removing dangerous cladding âsoul destroyingâ In the wake of the Grenfell fire, which killed 72 people in 2017, flammable cladding and other fire safety defects were discovered in hundreds of blocks of flats across the UK. Removing cladding can cost millions of pounds per block, with the cost often being borne by individual flat owners, under the leasehold system in England and Wales. Hundreds of thousands of people are still living in dangerous blocks more than four years on from Grenfell - while many flat owners have been left with spiralling insurance costs, service charges, and requirements for expensive 24-hour ""waking watch"" patrols in case of fire. In a new package of measures to be announced next week, Michael Gove, Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, will tell the Commons that if developers choose not to pay for cladding removals voluntarily the government will threaten them with legal compulsion. The BBC understands Mr Gove will warn them next week that he is putting them ""on notice"". Previously, the government had committed up to Â£5bn for the removal of dangerous cladding for buildings taller than 18.5m. Cladding campaigners have long asked that the government accept both the principle that buildings under 18.5m ought to be covered and that leaseholders should not have to pay. This video can not be played ""I didn't choose any cladding and now I'm going to be skint forever"" Newsnight has seen documents from Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke to Mr Gove where he says: That no new Treasury funding will be available to pay for this extra work That the cost of the extra cladding removal must not exceed Â£4bn That this new provision will cover cladding only, rather than other fire safety defects That if Mr Gove is unsuccessful in persuading or compelling developers to pay for the costs that it must be paid for from existing housing budgets and that ""safety should be prioritised over supply"" Experts question whether Â£4bn will be sufficient to cover cladding in buildings under 18.5m. And cladding is not the only or even main problem in thousands of buildings across the country. Neighbours Darren Matthews and Mandy Sandhu are two of those who could be helped by the changes, as their building is 13.5m tall. Mr Matthews told BBC Breakfast they faced bills of Â£101,500 per apartment and described the move as a ""step forward"", saying he was ""cautiously optimistic"" but that there was ""no absolute clarity about how developers are going to pay"". ""With the best will in the world this issue isn't going to be on a voluntary basis, it has to be enshrined in law with a legal obligation with proper stipulations to the building industry,"" he said. ""Leaseholders are the only innocent parties in this."" Ms Sandhu said she did not eat or sleep because of the stress and said despite the news they still needed clarification of what would be done. ""I won't believe it until I see it"", she added. It is unclear how those leaseholders will pay their bills, and how quickly any money that does come from developers will appear. Developers have largely insisted that their developments were built to regulations and that they are therefore not liable. Without immediate compulsion this process threatens to continue to be drawn out with leaseholders stuck in properties they cannot sell. Stewart Baseley, chairman of the Home Builders Federation - which represents developers, said the largest house builders had already spent or committed to spending Â£1bn to remediate affected buildings and said the most urgent action was for the government to define guidance on what work actually needed to be done to resolve issues for residents. He said while house builders were ""committed to playing their part"" there were other organisations involved in the construction of affected buildings which should also be involved in remediation costs, ""not least material manufacturers who designed, tested and sold materials that developers purchased in good faith that were later proved to not be fit for purpose"". Hundreds of thousands of leaseholders have already received bills for fire remediation works or will in the coming months. It is also not clear whether these measures will be enough to restore market and lender confidence in new-build properties. Campaigner Steve Day told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he and his neighbours were facing a Â£31,000 per flat bill for cladding costs, as well as about Â£5,000 per flat in non-cladding costs and an extra Â£3,000 a year service charge, which he said was huge for south-east London. ""People are facing arrears, and high levels of stress,"" he said. He said he was concerned voluntary contributions will ""just not be deliverable"", and called for a scheme where the government made developers pay if they breached regulations. Following the Grenfell fire flammable cladding and other fire safety defects were discovered in flat blocks across the UK Conservative MP Sir Peter Bottomley, chairman of the all party parliamentary group on leasehold and commonhold reform, said the government needed to tell the insurance companies to ""come to the table"" with Â£8bn - ""then innocent leaseholders will live in homes which are safe and saleable"". Matthew Pennycook, Labour's shadow housing minister,tweeted,externalthe new measures ""appear far less significant than they sound"", with ""nothing on non-cladding defects, no new developer levy and the position on leaseholder liability unchanged"". Many leaseholders have found their properties effectively worthless and unmortgageable. In November, Mr Govequestioned why flat owners should have to pay anything for dangerous cladding to be removedfrom their buildings. He said the government had a responsibility to help leaseholders - who were ""innocent parties"" - with the huge costs. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities declined to comment. Why must flat owners pay cladding bills, asks Gove Who has to pay to remove unsafe cladding? âLenders wonât touch us - my homeâs worth nothing' Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"The authorities appear to be back in control but the city is reeling from the violence Kazakhstan's biggest city Almaty looks like something from an apocalypse film. Driving around early on Friday morning, the smell of burnt vehicles was still in the air. Few people were about, many too afraid to come out into the streets. The army and police are blocking key sites in the city, which has been the focal point of nationwide protests against the government. When we approached soldiers at the main square they shouted at us and fired warning shots in the air, warning us not to come close. I've been coming to Almaty for years. It's normally a bustling city, with lots of greenery and places to eat out and drink. Now though shops and banks have been looted or destroyed. It will take some time for them to recover. Much of the damage is around the big main square that protesters first went to when the demonstrations began. Media buildings nearby were attacked and the mayor's office burnt down. It is pitch black now, having been engulfed by black smoke.

But we could still hear shooting and explosions, which may have been be stun grenades. When I first arrived I thought there was fog then realised it was more likely to be smoke from the grenades and fireworks. Several residents I spoke to were shocked and angry. These protests are unprecedented in Kazakhstan, and many here are surprised that they spread and turned violent so quickly. Some of those I spoke to are glad to see forces arrive from Russia and other neighbouring countries, hopeful they will restore order. One woman told me the government should have been firmer from the start. ""If they had used force in the very beginning, this unrest wouldn't have happened,"" she said. ""Maybe they were worried about condemnation, that they used weapons but you see now what this approach led to."" But amid the anger at the violence, there was sympathy for the protesters too. Many of the demonstrators come from rural areas, where pay is low and life is tough. ""I understand the demands of the protesters,"" said one man, a 22-year-old cook. ""We can see that our salaries are not growing and most of the population is struggling. But this is now looting and hooliganism, ordinary people are suffering now. It must be stopped."" Almaty residents now face food shortages, with the big supermarkets closed. Shops that are open only take cash, but it is difficult to find somewhere to withdraw money. There's no internet and even getting a taxi seems too risky. One of the looted shops in Almaty With the internet hit and phones not working properly, it is hard to find out what's happening outside the city. There are all sorts of rumours being shared that are impossible to check out. Kazakhstan has never seen protests of this scale. There's been unrest before, but largely localised. None of them resulted in the main airport being attacked. Plans to raise fuel prices triggered these demonstrations, but there is also widespread discontent about the government. After the resignation of Kazakhstan's first president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who held office from independence up to 2019, people hoped the new leader Kassym-Jomart Tokayev would bring change. These expectations were thwarted. In particular, the renaming of the capital Astana to Nur-Sultan, in honour of the former leader, was proof for many the old is elite is still in charge. For now, things are calming down and the authorities appear to be in control. But even if these protests have ended for now, the discontent will remain. Perhaps there will be another spark that fuels new ones. Where is it?Kazakhstan shares borders with Russia to the north and China to the east. It is a huge country the size of Western Europe. Why does it matter?A former Soviet republic which is mainly Muslim with a large Russian minority, it has vast mineral resources, with 3% of global oil reserves and important coal and gas sectors. Why is it making the news?Fuel riots, which have escalated to become broader protests against the government, have resulted in resignations at the top and a bloody crackdown on protesters.
