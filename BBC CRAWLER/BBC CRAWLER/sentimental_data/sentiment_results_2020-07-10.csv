"This video can not be played Dame Vera's cortege halted as it passed through her home town of Ditchling Two Spitfires flew over the funeral procession of Dame Vera Lynn as family, friends and fans said goodbye to the Forces' Sweetheart. Her cortege was accompanied by the Battle of Britain flypast as it travelled through Ditchling in East Sussex at midday. Dame Vera died last month at the age of 103 and her funeral was held at Woodvale Crematorium in Brighton. The World War Two fighter planes made three passes over the village. Hundreds of people had gathered to await the arrival of the cortege and the crowd applauded as the aircraft flew over. Representatives from the Royal British Legion stood with flags as they waited to honour Dame Vera. Shops in the village displayed portraits of Dame Vera The funeral procession stopped at the crossroads in the centre of Ditchling, where the singer lived for 50 years, to allow people to pay their respects. Later, as the procession made its way out of the village, there were shouts of ""hip hip hooray"" from the crowd. The cheers were followed by a spontaneous rendition of We'll Meet Again, one of the songs Dame Vera was well-known for. A private service at the crematorium chapel included music from a bugler from the Royal Marines. The family said a full memorial service would be held at a later date. People applauded as the Battle of Britain flypast took place Dame Vera's daughter, Virginia Lewis-Jones, said Ditchling had always been special to her mother. ""That is why we know she would be touched that so many people want to pay their respects,"" she said. She also urged people to continue to back the causes that were important to her mother, adding: ""We are sure her music will endure forever but most importantly, we hope that people will continue to support those charities that she cared about so much. ""It means so much to us to see my mother's legacy living on."" Dame Vera performing for servicemen in 1940 Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted footage of the flypast, saying it has been ""a farewell befitting a truly great Briton"". Allow Twitter content?

By Peter Whittlesea, BBC News The Spitfires made three passes over Ditchling as hundreds of people lined the streets Every lamppost in the narrow streets of Ditchling bears a large poppy. Union flags flutter in the breeze and shop windows display portraits of the woman who became known as the Forces' Sweetheart. Camera crews and photographers have descended on the village along with servicemen and women who have come to pay their respects. It is a fond farewell for Dame Vera. A picture of Dame Vera and a video were projected on to Dover's white cliffs ahead of her funeral. The lyrics of We'll Meet Again appeared as the music was played across the English Channel.

"The anonymous whistleblower said some factories had stayed open and taken on extra staff during the lockdown A whistleblower from Leicester's textile industry says some factories almost doubled their staffing to cope with online orders during the Covid-19 lockdown. The worker, who cannot be identified, said firms that ""maybe used to have 50 people working comfortably, now had 80 or 90 people in the same area"". Investigations are ongoing into employment practices at several firms. A lockdownwas enforced in Leicester after a spike in coronavirus cases. The worker told the BBC some factories had stayed open and taken on extra staff during the lockdown. ""If somebody did have Covid or wasn't well, they were still there passing it on to whoever's next to them,"" he said. ""During Covid we've had no social distancing whatsoever in the factories. ""They [factory bosses] were getting a lot of pressure from customers to produce garments as quickly as possible, in as much volume as possible, because people were shopping from home and they needed the goods to be in. ""So the pressure was on these suppliers to hire anybody that was walking around and just get somebody on a machine to make a garment. ""Garments go through, six, seven pairs of hands before they get packed and sealed, so a lot of people are touching the same things."" Latest news and stories from the East Midlands He said the situation had made already poor conditions worse. ""Very few factories, if any, have cleaners coming in and out,"" he said. ""I've seen people eating at their tables, then going straight back to work. There's no kitchens in a lot of these places, there's barely toilets, and it's all logged because it's all about productivity rather than humanity."" Concerns about working conditionshave prompted investigations by several agencies, including the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, Leicester City Council, the police and fire service, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and immigration enforcement. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Sundayhe was ""very worried about the employment practices in some factories"". The whistleblower said the falling price paid for products had led to a ""substantial"" decline in pay rates and working conditions over the past 10 years. ""The way the market is at the minute, it's the person who produces the good cheapest who gets the order,"" he said. Leicester was put on a local lockdown after Matt Hancock said it accounted for 10% of all positive Covid-19 cases in the country Lukasz Bemka, from the Bakers and Allied Workers Union, said they shared concerns about pay practices and safety at the factories. ""Some people are not getting their wage slips - just cash in hand,"" he said. ""There have been issues around providing the appropriate PPE during the pandemic and not carrying out the proper risk assessments."" He said some factories used CCTV cameras to alert factory bosses if the authorities paid a visit. ""In the case of a police raid or agency visit they can quickly get rid of uncomfortable people from the shop floor. ""They can even get rid of the whole workforce within minutes before the authorities hit the shop floor."" An HSE spokeswoman said it was investigating 10 textile businesses in Leicester. The whistleblower is not understood to have been referring to any of the businesses under investigation. The spokeswoman said: ""Since the start of the pandemic in March, we've made 80 workplace interventions with more than 45 site visits. Ten investigations are on-going. Enforcement action has been taken against 10 businesses. ""Following this particular outbreak in Leicester, HSE has engaged with 32 textile businesses and undertaken 30 site visits to assess compliance with health and safety legislation. ""Enforcement action of some kind is being taken at half of these businesses where non-compliance with health and safety requirements, including COVID-19 risk controls, was found.""

"The UK will not join the EU Covid-19 vaccine scheme, the UK's ambassador to the EU Sir Tim Barrow has said. Sir Tim said if the UK joined the scheme it would have no say on decisions including on price or which manufacturers to negotiate with. The UK would also be unable to ""pursue parallel negotiations with potential vaccine suppliers"", he saidin his letter to the European Commission,external. The EU scheme aims to secure supplies of potential coronavirus vaccines. The European Commission plans to enter into agreements with individual vaccine producers on behalf of the bloc's member states as part ofthe multi-million pound programme,external. In return for the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in an agreed timeframe and price, the Commission will finance a part of the vaccine producer's upfront costs. Reacting to earlier reports the UK will opt out of the initiative, the Wellcome Trust said countries ""urgently"" needed to work together ""if we're to stand any chance of delivering global equitable access to a Covid-19 vaccine"". How close to developing a vaccine are we? The EU coronavirus schemes the UK has opted out of In his letter, Sir Tim said the UK would not participate because the ""UK would be required to stop its negotiations with manufacturers with which the EU launched negotiations"". He said the commission had also confirmed it was ""not possible for the UK to have a role in the governance shaping decisions on which manufacturers to negotiate with, or the price, volume and delivery schedule negotiated"". Sir Tim added that there could still be collaboration between the UK and the EU on areas such as ""sharing of information on promising vaccine candidates"" and ""vaccine trials"" and ""manufacturing investments and capacity building"". Earlier, Alex Harris, head of global policy at the Wellcome Trust, said: ""The EU vaccine initiative's cap on how many doses participating countries get is the best way to ensure there is enough vaccine for those in need in the rest of the world. ""Delivering vaccine according to need and not who can pay the highest price, is not just morally right, but also the fastest way to end this pandemic. ""We urge the UK government to follow the EU's lead and only secure vaccine doses for those who need it most (healthcare workers, over 65s and other vulnerable groups)."" He said this approach was ""critical"" for the first ""six to nine months of early vaccine availability"" as global manufacturing capacity was ""unlikely to match demand"". In the UK, human trials of a vaccine are under way in London and Oxford. Worldwide, about 200 groups are working on vaccines and 18 are now being tested on people in clinical trials.

"This video can not be played Confused about what you can do when? This should help Pubs, cafes, restaurants and bars can reopen indoors in Wales from 3 August, providing coronavirus cases continue to fall. First Minister Mark Drakeford announced the date in a long list of changes to the country's coronavirus restrictions. Exemptions will also be made to Wales' 2m distancing law, with businesses that cannot meet it expected to take precautions. Hospitality businesses will be able to open outdoors from Monday. Mr Drakeford said the opening of pubs, restaurants and cafes indoors would depend on how well the initial phase goes. Live: Further easing of lockdown in Wales Recreational cricket to resume in Wales Campsites, hairdressers, beauty salons, cinemas and playgroundsare to reopen in the next three weeks,  and outdoor activities,including ""low-contact"" team sportsinvolving up to 30 people, can also resume from Monday. But Mr Drakeford said rugby scrums would not be permitted. Wales had previously been the only part of the UK not to set a date for the reopening of indoor hospitality. Pubs had reopened in England last weekend. In Scotland they will be able to fully reopen from 15 July. This video can not be played Pubs and cafes can reopen inside from 3 August In other announcements, outdoor gyms, playgrounds and community centres will be able to reopen on 20 July. Campsites and other accommodation with shared facilities can reopen from 25 July. On 27 July the following activities can restart: Close contact services, such as beauty salons, tattoo shops and nail parlours The viewing of occupied homes for rent or sale Cinemas, museums and galleries Rules requiring people to only meet one household when outdoors will remain in place. Mr Drakeford said looking at ""all the indicators together"", the chief medical officer for Wales Frank Atherton ""has confirmed we have some capacity to ease the restrictions further over the next three weeks"". Advisers have told the Welsh Government cases are falling by 2% every day. But the first minister urged ""a note of caution"", citing the example of Melbourne in Australiawhich is re-imposing a lockdownafter a fresh spike in cases. No announcement was made on indoor gyms. Ministers are understood to be in discussions with gym and leisure companies about the reopening of indoor gyms and swimming pools. The law enforcing the 2m social distancing rules in Wales will also be changed, so that businesses that cannot stick to the rule can use other measures to reduce the risk of transmission. Examples listed by Mr Drakeford included the installation of protective shields, increased cleaning, marshalls in outdoor hospitality venues and ""extra rules in relation to the policing of toilets"". He said firms that can take ""all reasonable measures to sustain a 2m distance"" would be required to stick to the rule. ""But we recognise that there will be some contexts and some businesses for whom that simply isn't practically possible, and in those circumstances what the law in Wales will require is that those businesses will have to take a series of other mitigating measures."" Playgrounds will be able to reopen ready for the summer holidays Welsh Conservatives Senedd leader Paul Davies said: ""Yesterday we published a list of 10 things we wanted the Welsh Government to deliver as part of its coronavirus restrictions review, and we have seen ministers adopt six out of 10 of our proposals - so we are pleased to see the Welsh Government following our lead."" Wales TUC, which represents trade unions in Wales, said the announcement ""will provide a level of certainty for the sector and help prevent future job losses"". And business body CBI Wales welcomed the easing of the social distancing rules: ""The move will have a material impact across tourism and hospitality who are desperate to get back on their feet."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the changes ""must be matched by a Test, Trace and Protect programme that is able keep up with increased demand. Without the ability to quickly stamp out any further outbreaks, this 'early warning system' is largely undermined and worse - we'll risk seeing a return to lockdown conditions."" Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon said: ""We are looking forward to reopening our pubs in Wales. We will work towards the government reopening date."" Shibber Ahmed said the date means his restaurant is losing out Shibber Ahmed, owner of the Blue Elephant in Llandudno, said his restaurant would be ""losing out"" from not being able to open until 3 August. ""The whole town is open,"" he said. ""There are lots of people around, but we are not able to take advantage of it and we desperately needed that to cover our winter costs."" Emlyn Roberts, owner of Hebog cafÃ© and restaurant in Beddgelert, has a one way system in its beer garden, ready for next week. ""We will be opening on Wednesday,"" he said, but ""if the weather's bad we will waste a lot of stock."" Paige Davies, a fitness instructor at Dowlais Community Centre in Merthyr Tydfil, said she was frustrated at the lack of a reopening date for indoor gyms. ""I do a lot of fitness myself and being able to get back into it is brilliant for me. You hear gym members say 'when can we come back to the gym', then you feel disappointed that you're unable to provide something for them."" She said her gym had removed some equipment to prepare for social distancing. ""We have to now limit how many would use the gym,"" she said. The first minister rejected claims pubs had not been given enough time to ready for the resumption of trading. ""This sector has had weeks to prepare for reopening outdoors, not three days. There is plenty of guidance out there for those intending to reopen,"" he said. There was an ""anxiety"", he claimed, among the public in Wales ""about going back to places where they may feel that their health and wellbeing would not be safely looked after"". Asked if the delay in announcing a date for indoor hospitality to reopen had risked thousands of jobs, he said the sector should spend the next three weeks doing things ""that are necessary to make a success of the changes that are being offered to it"" with outdoor opening. Campsites, beauty salons and cinemas get open date Give pubs and cafes re-opening date, say unions Fear pubs 'will go bust' because of two-metre rule England has first night out since lockdown Scottish pubs and restaurants to reopen in July Reopening guidance for pubs and hotels published Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Holiday airline Jet2 has suspended all flights to Spain from Scotland as a result of the 14-day quarantine rule. Passengers travelling into Scotland from Spain have to go into isolation for 14 days afterNicola Sturgeon confirmed she would not yet allow an ""air bridge""with the country. Spain and Serbia were left off the quarantine exemption list announced by the first minister earlier this week. They were omitted due to concerns about the prevalence of Covid-19. Flights from Glasgow and Edinburgh Airports will not resume until 25 July, according to the airline. A spokeswoman for Jet2 said: ""Our customers have been eagerly awaiting clarity about where they can travel to from Scotland for some time, and based on the demand we are experiencing it is clear that they are ready for their much-needed and well-deserved holidays. ""Because of the travel restrictions that are still in place to Spain as a result of this week's announcement by the Scottish government, we have taken the decision to recommence our flights and holidays programmes from Edinburgh and Glasgow Airports to Mainland Spain, the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands on 25 July 2020."" Nicola Sturgeon said cases entering Scotland from abroad was ""one of our biggest risk factors"" The company said that customers would offered a refund or the chance to rebook. Most of the company's flights from Scotland to holiday destinations are due to resume on 15 July. From today, Scots are able to travel to 57 other countries without having to self-isolate on returning. The first minister said it was a ""very difficult decision"" to make, but that it was needed to ""protect Scotland as far as possible from a resurgence of this virus in the weeks ahead"". Meanwhile, Edinburgh Airport has warned that about a third of its 7,000 jobs are under threat. Director of communications Gordon Robertson said the airport will not return to 2019 levels of business for another few years, and ""certainly not back to any kind of normality until 2021"". Redundancies are currently being negotiated, in consultation with unions. ""We employ 750 people there, and the airport employs around 7.000 people as a whole, and we think there will be up to a third of job losses across that, so it is a very challenging time,"" Mr Robertson told BBC Radio Scotland. He said Spain was ""one of our biggest markets"" and a big chunk of the summer schedules for airports like Edinburgh, Glasgow and Prestwick. ""More importantly, decisions made now means aircraft might move to England and not come back for next year's summer schedule,"" he added. ""It has long-lasting impacts and we hope the Scottish government can make decisions quickly so we can get back to flying to Spain soon.""

"Amazon has said an email sent to employees asking them to remove the video-sharing app TikTok from any mobile device that can access their company email was sent in error. An internal memo sent to staff earlier on Friday had said employees should delete the app over ""security risks"". The app, owned by a Chinese company, has come under scrutiny because of fears it could share data with China. TikTok said it did not understand Amazon's concerns. ""This morning's email to some of our employees was sent in error. There is no change to our policies right now with regard to TikTok"", a company spokesperson told the BBC. But earlier on Friday, a memo sent to staff seen by multiple news outlets stated that the app must be removed from mobile devices. ""Due to security risk, the TikTok app is no longer permitted on mobile devices that access Amazon email. ""If you have TikTok on your device, you must remove it by July 10 to retain mobile access to Amazon email"", it read. TikTok deleted 49 million 'rule-breaking' videos TikTok halts Hong Kong access after security law Could TikTok be banned in the US? TikTok said the company had not received any communication from Amazon before the email went out. Artificial intelligence-powered short video app TikTok is one of the most downloaded mobile apps in the world, and its popularity has only grown during the coronavirus lockdown. This has drawn the attention of the Trump administration - on Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News that it was considering a ban on Chinese social media apps. Mr Pompeo went so far as to say that TikTok users risk their private information ending up ""in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party"". TikTok is owned by Chinese start-up ByteDance, which has taken pains to point out that its chief executive is American. It has also said publicly several times that it has never, and will never, share TikTok users' data with the Chinese authorities. And on Friday, the firmdecided to halt its operations in Hong Kong- a move designed to show its distance from the Chinese government. But many people use their smartphones for both recreation and to access their work email accounts. TikTok is on many personal smartphones, and with rising numbers of cyber-security vulnerabilities regularly being discovered in both the Android and iOS mobile operating systems, perhaps Amazon is now starting to worry whether the app could perhaps be used to infiltrate devices. ""We still do not understand their concerns, we welcome a dialogue so we can address any issues they may have and enable their team to continue participating in our community,"" TikTok said. This video can not be played WATCH: Fans are accusing TikTok creators of exploiting them for cash TikTok was launched outside mainland China by Beijing-based ByteDance to reach a global audience. It increased its popularity during the global coronavirus lockdowns with about 315 million people downloading the app in the first three months of this year, according to research firm Sensor Tower. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and an Australian member of parliament have recently suggested the app needs more scrutiny over its data and privacy policies because its headquarters are in China. Mr Pompeo has banned Department of State employees from downloading the app and suggested it could also be banned in the US.

"Amazon has said an email sent to employees asking them to remove the video-sharing app TikTok from any mobile device that can access their company email was sent in error. An internal memo sent to staff earlier on Friday had said employees should delete the app over ""security risks"". The app, owned by a Chinese company, has come under scrutiny because of fears it could share data with China. TikTok said it did not understand Amazon's concerns. ""This morning's email to some of our employees was sent in error. There is no change to our policies right now with regard to TikTok"", a company spokesperson told the BBC. But earlier on Friday, a memo sent to staff seen by multiple news outlets stated that the app must be removed from mobile devices. ""Due to security risk, the TikTok app is no longer permitted on mobile devices that access Amazon email. ""If you have TikTok on your device, you must remove it by July 10 to retain mobile access to Amazon email"", it read.

"Emma Pratt's first appointment to register Skye's birth was cancelled due to lockdown ""It's been a weird feeling to know she technically doesn't exist,"" says Emma Pratt. Her newborn daughter, Skye, was born the week before lockdown began. She is now almost four months old, but her birth still hasn't been registered. Normally, babies have to be registered with the local council within 42 days of being born, or 21 days in Scotland. But during the coronavirus lockdown, many councils paused all birth registrations - and are only now starting up again. It means they're faced withbacklogs of thousands of babies to register.And for the parents, it can cause practical problems. ""It's just annoying,"" says Ms Pratt, 35, from Auchterarder in Perth and Kinross. ""It's something that should have been done within weeks of her being born and we are now four months. ""We can't open a bank account and my auntie had brought her premium bonds and we had to provide her identity, which we haven't been able to do. So that's been all cancelled. ""People have really kindly sent us cheques and we haven't been able to deposit them. It's really frustrating."" Ms Pratt finally managed to book an appointment to register the birth, face to face, for next Friday. ""It's funny because people have been saying she doesn't officially belong, and she doesn't,"" she adds. ""We could even change her name now if we wanted to, and that's crazy."" For new mum Olivia McDermott, 24, registering her son Elijah's birth meant the difference between continuing with her training to become a nurse. Ms McDermott would have had to drop out of her nurse training course if her baby wasn't registered Without a birth certificate, she could not apply for a childcare grant, and without the grant she said she would not be able to continue her course. ""Goodbye, dream job,"" says Ms McDermott, from Leeds. ""I'm meant to be going into my final year of training to be a nurse. I was just like, I won't be able to come in. ""There's a massive shortage of nurses, and the birth certificate is stopping me."" She and her partner checked the council website every morning to see when registrations would resume. She eventually got an appointment and registered her son on Wednesday. ""Now I'm able to register him I'm feeling a lot better,"" she says. Ms McDermott adds that it has been ""really hard"" having your first baby in lockdown. ""Normally, you have an idea in your head of what it will be like when you first have a baby, with all your friends and your family. But there wasn't any of that. Luckily I have a partner."" Despite the added hassle, Ms McDermott says she is now optimistic about the future. ""Although it caused me anxiety about the funding and not having his birth certificate, I'm just happy that they have managed to open safely as that is so important for this time that we are in."" Ms McDermott said she wouldn't have enough money to live on without the childcare grant One of the most common problems with the delay has been getting passports. Parents whose families live abroad are desperate to get a passport so they can introduce their babies. Agi, who did not want her second name used, wants to take her newborn son to Poland to meet her parents and elderly grandmother. ""It didn't occur to me, I almost booked flights for August,"" says Agi, who lives in south-east London. Concerns raised for babies born in virus lockdown Baby born in lockdown meets wider family Because her son was born two weeks ago, he will be ""at the back of the queue"" compared to the babies born at the beginning of lockdown, she adds. Many councils have resumed registrations but are prioritising babies by the dates they were born. Her council is currently only registering babies born before the end of March. ""This is the most frustrating aspect, the lack of communication and not knowing how big the delay I'm looking at,"" she says. ""Are we looking at weeks, a month, six months? I have an elderly grandmother who would ideally like to see her great grandson. ""There's talk of swimming pools, leisure centres and gyms opening but you can't register the birth of your child."" The Local Government Association, which represents councils, has urged the government to allow birth registrations to be done over the phone, to help clear the backlog. In a statement it said: ""With birth registrations having to be suspended for three months due to the pandemic, councils are experiencing a considerable backlog in registrations. Now that registrations have resumed, councils are offering appointments in some registration offices where they have been able to put in place safety measures to protect families as they work through this backlog, and are planning to open further offices soon. ""The registrations have to be done face to face, which is why we are urging government to consider allowing them to be done over the phone or online in the future, and as part of any further local or national lockdowns in response to the pandemic. ""Greater flexibility in the birth registration process would help councils reduce delays and families enjoy a smoother experience."" The government has warned parents they still may not be able to register a birth at the moment because of the virus, but ""you'll be able to register at a later date"". Despite this, councils say parents can still apply for child benefit and Universal Credit. And as lockdown is eased further, parents of newborn babies can begin introducing them to the wider world and their social circles. But for some parents, they will just have to wait a little longer before their baby becomes ""official"".

"One of Boohoo's largest shareholders is dumping stock in the fashion firm after it said the company had failed to address concerns about working conditions at a supplier in Leicester. Standard Life Aberdeen (SLA) criticised Boohoo's response to exploitation claims as ""inadequate in scope, timeliness and gravity"". Allegations of poor pay and conditions at a factoryemerged last weekend. Boohoo has since announced an independent review of its supply chain. The fast fashion retailer's share price fell 2% to 279.7p each. A Sunday Times report claimed workers at a factory in Leicester - currently in local lockdown following a spike in Covid-19 cases - were paid just Â£3.50 an hour, while being offered no protection from coronavirus. It was making clothes for Boohoo's Nasty Gal brand. Lesley Duncan, deputy head of UK equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments, SLA's fund management arm, said it had invested in Boohoo since its flotation in 2014. Boohoo dropped by Next, Asos and Zalando over exploitation claims Boohoo to investigate Leicester supplier over exploitation claims SLA holds a 3.3% stake in Boohoo, according to data provider Morningstar. Ms Duncan said it had lobbied the company over a number of years on issues such as supply chain transparency. ""While we would have liked progress to have been quicker we did feel that progress was being made,"" Ms Duncan said. Boohoo also owns PrettyLittleThing, which has collaborated with celebrities like Little Mix But she said that concerns had been growing in recent weeks ""which even before recent developments, had negatively impacted our conviction levels in the company"". ""Having spoken to Boohoo's management team a number of times this week in light of recent concerning allegations, we view their response as inadequate in scope, timeliness and gravity."" The company, which also owns the PrettyLittleThing brand, said it was ""appalled"" by the allegations and that it had asked a senior barrister to lead a review. However, other retailers have distanced themselves from Boohoo. Next, Asos and Zalando all announced on Tuesday that they hadstopped selling Boohoo clothes on their websites. The retailers said they were pausing relationships with Boohoo's brands, pending the outcome of the company's investigation.

"Royal Mail has been fined Â£1.5m by the regulator for being late with first class deliveries and overcharging customers for second class stamps. Ofcom said Royal Mail missed its target of delivering 93% of first class post within a day of collection. It also overcharged people Â£60,000 after raising the cost of a second class stamp before a price cap was officially lifted. Royal Mail admitted it was ""disappointed"" with its performance. In the 2019 financial year, Ofcom found that only 91.5% of first class post was on time. ""Royal Mail let its customers down, and these fines should serve as a reminder that we'll take action when companies fall short,"" said Gaucho Rasmussen, Ofcom's director of investigations and enforcement. The watchdog also found that the company increased its price for second class stamps by 1p to 61p seven days ahead of the official cap being lifted. Royal Mail estimates it overcharged people by Â£60,000 ""which it is unable to refund"". Royal Mail admitted it had made a mistake and donated the sum to the charity Action for Children. ""We worked with Ofcom throughout this investigation and lessons have been learned by us during this process,"" it said. Earlier this year, Royal Mail lifted the price of a first class stamp which now costs 11p more than second class postage. The price of a first class stamp for regular letters rose 6p to 76p and second-class went up by 4p to 65p. The 65p second-class stamp is the maximum under an Ofcom price cap. Commenting in the current financial year, Royal Mail said it would be on course to hit the 93% first class delivery target if it hadn't been for the coronavirus outbreak. ""Despite our best endeavours, some areas of the UK experienced a reduction in service levels during March,"" it said. ""Relevant factors included high levels of coronavirus-related absences and necessary social distancing measures."" Last month Royal Mail said it will cut 2,000 management jobs as it struggles to deal with the effects of the coronavirus crisis. The cuts, equal to around a fifth of the company's management roles, aim to save about Â£130m in costs from next year. Royal Mail said the pandemic accelerated the trend of more parcels and fewer letters being sent, and it had not adapted quickly enough to that.

"No new deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales have been announced for the second day this week, leaving the official total at 1,540 Pubs, cafes and restaurants will be able to open indoors from 3 August if virus cases continue to fall, the first minister has said They have already been cleared to open outdoor areas from next Monday, 13 July Campsites, hairdressers, beauty salons, cinemas and playgrounds in Wales are also to reopen in the next three weeks The county of Ceredigion, which avoided the brunt of Covid-19, balances the need to welcome back tourists while keeping people safe An intensive care doctor who recovered from coronavirus tells how his workplace resembles ""a scene from a science fiction film"" Catherine Evans and Gemma Ryall That's all from today's live page coverage, bringing you the latest developments on the coronavirus outbreak in Wales. The latest updates are:  Our live blog will be back on Monday - in the meantime you can keep up with all the latest on coronavirus via the BBC News website. If you're still not sure what will be happening and when with the easing of lockdown in Wales, this should help. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Wales' lockdown restrictions roadmap laid out More than 1,700 fines were handed out for lockdown breaches by Dyfed-Powys Police. Between 27 March,when fixed penalty notices were introduced, and 6 July, the force reported 1,710 people
for breaches of travel restrictions. Almost two thirds of these were
individuals who had travelled unnecessarily from outside the force area, with
the largest number of tickets being issued in Powys. In one weekend in May â when
strict travel restrictions were still in place across Wales - officers turned
away more than 1,000 cars from the area around Ystradfallte known as ""waterfall
country"". âOur officers have maintained a
consistent approach to engage with the public at every opportunity and explain
the regulations, with enforcement only as a last resort,â said deputy chief constable Claire Parmenter. âThis educational approach
became even more important as differences emerged between the rules around
travel in England and Wales."" The leader of Plaid Cymru says the ""increase in public freedom"" must be matched with a testing and tracing programme ""that is able to keep up with increased demand"". Adam Price MS said the Welsh Government was right to take acautious approach to easing lockdown. âWithout the ability to quickly stamp out any further outbreaks, this âearly warning systemâ is largely undermined and worse - weâll risk seeing a return to lockdown conditions,"" he said. âWe need a much clearer strategy for using the available testing capacity, and we need to speed up the turnaround of test results. We have previously called for universal testing of health and social care workers â a call which is backed up by BMA (British Medical Association) proposals."" He added that, as the tourist industry is reopened and travel increases, ""we have the mechanisms in place to not only gain the public confidence but to stop a resurgence of the virus"". But the work must be put in ""to strengthen this crucial protective shield,"" he said. A restaurant owner in north Wales says he ""won't be able to cash in"" on the start of the school holidays. Pubs, cafes, restaurants and barscan reopen indoors in Wales from 3 August, providing coronavirus cases continue to fall. Shibber Ahmed of the Blue Elephant restaurant in Llandudno  said: ""Itâs late, the school holidays have started and I think we wonât be able to cash in. ""The whole town is open - there are lots of people around but we are not able to take advantage of it and we desperately needed that to cover our winter costs. ""I was thinking it would be 20 July rather than 3 August [for reopening}, so for two weeks basically we are losing out. ""These two weeks are crucial because 20% of our business is during the school holidays."" Shibber Ahmed was hoping to open his restaurant two weeks sooner No new deaths of people with coronavirus have been reported in Wales for the second time this week. Tuesday was the first day since the outbreak began in March that no deaths in Wales were announced. The official total number of people who have diedremains at 1,540 according to Public Health Wales. This graph shows the daily number of deaths according to the day occurred, rather than the day they were announced. No new deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales have been reported in Wales for the second day this week. The official total from Public Health Wales remains at 1,540. This map shows the number of deaths in each health board area of Wales. It does not include residents of Powys who have died at hospitals over the border in England. There is ""no longer anxiety
about widespread community transmission of coronavirus around two north Wales
food plants, the first minister has said. There have been 634 confirmed Covid-19 cases at meat plants in Wales -283 at Rowan Foods in Wrexham, 134 at Kepak in Merthyr Tydfiland the 217 cases at 2 Sisters at Llangefni on Anglesey. Mark Drakeford said the latest
advice ""does indeed suggest that we are probably past the most concerning
time"" at Rowan Foods and 2 Sisters. On Rowan Foods, he said ministers
were hopeful that an update from the outbreak control team later today would ""confirm that the measures that we were looking to the company to
put in place have been put in place, and that it can continue to operate in
that new way"". Mr Drakeford said the
experience had shown the importance of accurate record-keeping for tracing
""when you are working with a population which is often drawn from countries
outside the United Kingdom"". ""Some of the people who we
have struggled the most to contact are people where names and addresses have
not been properly recorded, where the spelling of people's names is many and
various, where telephone numbers are not been properly transcribed,"" he
told the Welsh Government's daily coronavirus news conference. ""I think we've learned
something about being prepared to communicate in languages other than Welsh and
English. ""For some of the
workers at Rowan Foods being able to see information in their own language,
their native language, is important and we will be better prepared to do that
more quickly if we face a similar outbreak in the future."" Rowan Foods in Wrexham has seen 283 cases of coronavirus confirmed No new deaths of people with coronavirus have been reported in Wales for the second time this week. Tuesday was the first day since the outbreak began in March that no deaths in Wales were announced. The official total number of people who have diedremains at 1,540. Public Health Wales (PHW) figures also showed there were 10 new cases reported. The leader of the Conservative group in the Welsh Parliament has responsed to the latest lockdown easing plans by saying he was ""pleased to see the Welsh Government following our lead"". Paul Davies claimed the Labour-led administration had adopted six out of 10 proposals the Welsh Tories had outlined yesterday. He added: âWe are disappointed at the unnecessary delay in
implementing some of these changes so we see no reason why reopening campsites
and beauty salons, and restarting house viewings canât be brought forward. âAnd we are disappointed that thereâs still no clarity on
face coverings, relaxing social distancing, or driving tests and lessons in
Wales."" Pubs, cafes, restaurants and bars canreopen indoors in Wales from 3 August, providing coronavirus cases continue to fall. A series of reopening dates have also been announced for businesses includingcampsites, hairdressers, beauty salons and cinemas. Previous pledges on the reopening of self-contained accommodation and outdoor areas of pubs, cafes and restaurants have also been confirmed. First Minister Mark Drakeford said there was an anxiety among the public in Wales ""about going back to places
where they may feel that their health and wellbeing would not be safely looked
after"". Asked if the delay announcing a
date for indoor hospitality to reopen had risked thousands of jobs, he said the
sector should spend three weeks doing things ""that are necessary to make a
success of the changes that are being offered to it"" with outdoor opening. ""I'm sure they will focus on
what they can do, rather than focusing on what they can't do,"" Mr
Drakeford told journalists. ""And, in that way, they will
have a successful future still before them."" The Welsh Government's decision not to require people in Wales to wear coverings is not contradictory, according to the first minister. Mark Drakeford said the approach is about ""making different judgements about the balance of risks"". He said Wales' chief medical officer believes face coverings have ""at best, a marginal additional benefit in public health terms"". Mr Drakeford added: ""Nevertheless we continue to look at all the evidence. We continue to look at different contexts, some of which face coverings by members of the public may have advantages as part of an overall package. ""I hope to be able to say something about public transport in Wales on Monday of next week, where this issue has been most hotly debated. ""But nobody should think that wearing a face covering is somehow a way of absolving you from the responsibility to do all those other things which actually offer you greater protection from coronavirus in a face mask will ever do."" Businesses in Wales that are unable to maintain the two-metre social distancing rules will have ""to take a series of other mitigating measures"", according to the first minister. Mark Drakeford listed some examples, including the installation of protective shields, increased cleaning, marshals in outdoor hospitality venues and ""extra rules in relation to the policing of toilets"". ""Those practical things will have to be in place in order to make sure that people are still kept safe from a disease that hasn't gone away"", he added. But he said the ""two-metre rule remains the default position in Wales"". He said: ""If you are able to run a business taking all reasonable measures to sustain a two-metre distance that is what the law in Wales will require you to do. ""But we recognise that there will be some context and some business for whom that simply isn't practically possible and in those circumstances what the law in Wales will require is that those businesses will have to take a series of other mitigating measures."" Live coverage of today's coronavirus press briefing has now switched toBBC Two Wales. The body representing trade unions in Wales has welcomed a date for hospitality to reopen indoors. Wales TUC General Secretary
    Shavanah Taj said: ""Hospitality workers across Wales are concerned about their future
      employment prospects and anxious over job losses. ""Todayâs announcement
      will provide a level of certainty for the sector and help prevent future
      job losses."" She added: ""At the Wales TUC we support the Welsh Government's steady and
      evidence-driven approach. Workersâ safety must continue to be the top
      priority."" Ms Taj said personal protective equipment (PPE) and test and tracing were ""key to the success of reopening"". Pubs in Wales have all necessary guidance for reopening, says the first minister. Mark Drakeford said he did not agree that pubs have not had enough time to prepare to reopen outside from Monday. He added: âThis sector has had weeks to prepare for reopening outdoors, not three days. ""There is plenty of guidance out there for those intending to reopen.â Mr Drakeford has said specific guidance will be published which has been agreed and discussed âin great detailâ with the sector. âAny suggestion that the sector didnât know what needs to be done simply does not stand up to interrogation,â he said. Pubs, cafÃ©s and restaurants in Waleswill be able to open indoors from 3 August, providing cases of coronavirus continue to fall, First
Minister Mark Drakeford said today. The Welsh Government is
announcing a series of relaxations to the restrictions relating to the hospitality and tourism sector. âLooking at all the indicators together,
the Chief Medical Officer for Wales has confirmed we have some capacity to ease
the restrictions further over the next three weeks,â said Mr Drakeford. In
other changes: The law enforcing the 2m social
distancing rules will be altered to allow for the fact that some industries
like hairdressing will be unable to comply.   Other measures, including wearing masks, will be expected to be used
instead. Mr Drakeford said âa note of cautionâ
should be used, citing the example of Melbourne in Australia, which is
re-imposing a lockdown after a fresh spike in cases. Itâs understood ministers are still in discussions with gym and
leisure companies about the reopening of indoor gyms and swimming pools. A majority of Britonsfeel

National Statistics (ONS) survey suggests. Just over one in five of the 1,788 adults in England, Scotland and Wales asked said they would be happy to have a sit-down meal as restrictions ease. Some 60% said they would be uncomfortable or very uncomfortable eating indoors during the pandemic. It comes as the government prepares a Â£500m ""eat out to help out"" scheme. Meals eaten at participating restaurants on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays in Augustwill be subsidised up to Â£10 a head. Chancellor Rishi Sunak (centre) hopes his discount scheme will encourage people to visit restaurants First Minister Mark Drakeford is about to give the Welsh
Government's daily press briefing on how it's handling the coronavirus
situation. He is expected to confirm details of further easing of the
lockdown, withcampsites,
hairdressers, beauty salons, cinemas and playgrounds set to reopen in the next
three weeks. We'll update you with the main points here - you can also watch

"This video can not be played Confused about what you can do when? This should help Pubs, cafes, restaurants and bars can reopen indoors in Wales from 3 August, providing coronavirus cases continue to fall. First Minister Mark Drakeford announced the date in a long list of changes to the country's coronavirus restrictions. Exemptions will also be made to Wales' 2m distancing law, with businesses that cannot meet it expected to take precautions. Hospitality businesses will be able to open outdoors from Monday. Mr Drakeford said the opening of pubs, restaurants and cafes indoors would depend on how well the initial phase goes. Live: Further easing of lockdown in Wales Recreational cricket to resume in Wales Campsites, hairdressers, beauty salons, cinemas and playgroundsare to reopen in the next three weeks,  and outdoor activities,including ""low-contact"" team sportsinvolving up to 30 people, can also resume from Monday. But Mr Drakeford said rugby scrums would not be permitted. Wales had previously been the only part of the UK not to set a date for the reopening of indoor hospitality. Pubs had reopened in England last weekend. In Scotland they will be able to fully reopen from 15 July. This video can not be played Pubs and cafes can reopen inside from 3 August In other announcements, outdoor gyms, playgrounds and community centres will be able to reopen on 20 July. Campsites and other accommodation with shared facilities can reopen from 25 July. On 27 July the following activities can restart: Close contact services, such as beauty salons, tattoo shops and nail parlours The viewing of occupied homes for rent or sale Cinemas, museums and galleries Rules requiring people to only meet one household when outdoors will remain in place. Mr Drakeford said looking at ""all the indicators together"", the chief medical officer for Wales Frank Atherton ""has confirmed we have some capacity to ease the restrictions further over the next three weeks"". Advisers have told the Welsh Government cases are falling by 2% every day. But the first minister urged ""a note of caution"", citing the example of Melbourne in Australiawhich is re-imposing a lockdownafter a fresh spike in cases. No announcement was made on indoor gyms. Ministers are understood to be in discussions with gym and leisure companies about the reopening of indoor gyms and swimming pools. The law enforcing the 2m social distancing rules in Wales will also be changed, so that businesses that cannot stick to the rule can use other measures to reduce the risk of transmission. Examples listed by Mr Drakeford included the installation of protective shields, increased cleaning, marshalls in outdoor hospitality venues and ""extra rules in relation to the policing of toilets"". He said firms that can take ""all reasonable measures to sustain a 2m distance"" would be required to stick to the rule. ""But we recognise that there will be some contexts and some businesses for whom that simply isn't practically possible, and in those circumstances what the law in Wales will require is that those businesses will have to take a series of other mitigating measures."" Playgrounds will be able to reopen ready for the summer holidays Welsh Conservatives Senedd leader Paul Davies said: ""Yesterday we published a list of 10 things we wanted the Welsh Government to deliver as part of its coronavirus restrictions review, and we have seen ministers adopt six out of 10 of our proposals - so we are pleased to see the Welsh Government following our lead."" Wales TUC, which represents trade unions in Wales, said the announcement ""will provide a level of certainty for the sector and help prevent future job losses"". And business body CBI Wales welcomed the easing of the social distancing rules: ""The move will have a material impact across tourism and hospitality who are desperate to get back on their feet."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the changes ""must be matched by a Test, Trace and Protect programme that is able keep up with increased demand. Without the ability to quickly stamp out any further outbreaks, this 'early warning system' is largely undermined and worse - we'll risk seeing a return to lockdown conditions."" Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon said: ""We are looking forward to reopening our pubs in Wales. We will work towards the government reopening date."" Shibber Ahmed said the date means his restaurant is losing out Shibber Ahmed, owner of the Blue Elephant in Llandudno, said his restaurant would be ""losing out"" from not being able to open until 3 August. ""The whole town is open,"" he said. ""There are lots of people around, but we are not able to take advantage of it and we desperately needed that to cover our winter costs."" Emlyn Roberts, owner of Hebog cafÃ© and restaurant in Beddgelert, has a one way system in its beer garden, ready for next week. ""We will be opening on Wednesday,"" he said, but ""if the weather's bad we will waste a lot of stock."" Paige Davies, a fitness instructor at Dowlais Community Centre in Merthyr Tydfil, said she was frustrated at the lack of a reopening date for indoor gyms. ""I do a lot of fitness myself and being able to get back into it is brilliant for me. You hear gym members say 'when can we come back to the gym', then you feel disappointed that you're unable to provide something for them."" She said her gym had removed some equipment to prepare for social distancing. ""We have to now limit how many would use the gym,"" she said. The first minister rejected claims pubs had not been given enough time to ready for the resumption of trading. ""This sector has had weeks to prepare for reopening outdoors, not three days. There is plenty of guidance out there for those intending to reopen,"" he said. There was an ""anxiety"", he claimed, among the public in Wales ""about going back to places where they may feel that their health and wellbeing would not be safely looked after"". Asked if the delay in announcing a date for indoor hospitality to reopen had risked thousands of jobs, he said the sector should spend the next three weeks doing things ""that are necessary to make a success of the changes that are being offered to it"" with outdoor opening.

Wakefield Council said a number of residents at Urban House, in Love Lane, had tested positive for the virus, adding that those affected have been isolated and given treatment and support at another location.

""Being obese messes with your immune system,"" he tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""It's not just about reducing your risk of the nasty complications should you get the virus, it's also about ensuring the vaccine is going to work."" Dr Mosley says it's a ""fallacy"" that exercise is a good way of losing weight, however. ""Itâs great for all sorts of things - like improving your mood - but a pretty terrible way of losing weight because you have to do so much.

Zulfiqar AliBBC Reality Check Iran has seen a rapid surge in the numbers of coronavirus cases recently, with daily recorded deaths reaching new highs. In mid-June, daily reported deaths went above 100 - for the first time in two months. And since then, this figure has been going up, reaching 221 dead by 9 July. New reported infections averaged more than 3,000 a day in the first week of June - a 50% increase on the previous seven days. This figure reached a high of 3,574 on 4 June, before dropping slightly. There have been more than 2,000 cases a day since then. The epidemic was initially concentrated in Qom and the capital, Tehran. But now, a flare-up has been reported in the south-west, notably in Khuzestan province, an oil-rich region that borders Iraq. Officials have suggested the renewed surge in new cases could be down to more testing, and President Hassan Rouhani has said this means you will find more cases.

Two men have been arrested on suspicion of fraud and money laundering offences after police found evidence of suspected fake companies applying for coronavirusBounce Back loans,external. Ten accounts have been frozen so far, amounting to Â£553,305, as officers investigate and identify victims, London's Metropolitan Police says. Detectives launched an investigation after a routine drug search on a vehicle in Holland Park on 17 June. The officers found the vehicle's owner, a man in his early 20s, had travelled to meet a man in order to set up a bank account, for which he would be paid Â£300. Police identified the second man, who was in his late 40s, that he was due to meet and subsequently arrested both on suspicion of money laundering and fraud. The two men have since been released under investigation pending further enquiries. The number of new infection has risen by 228,102 during the last 24 hours, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) - a record increase. The biggest increases in cases were from the United States, Brazil, India and South Africa,the UN body said in its daily report.,external The previous WHO record for new cases was 212,326 on 4 July.

A lockdownwas enforced in Leicester last month after a spike in coronavirus cases.

He said the situation had made already poor conditions worse: ""Very few factories, if any, have cleaners coming in and out."" Investigations are ongoing into employment practices at several firms. Read his full accounthere. BBC News Channel There has been a ""surge"" in the number of calls to Childline from children and young people during lockdown, the counselling service's founder Dame Esther Rantzen says. Children have found themselves ""imprisoned in families where frankly they were either very unhappy or even unsafe"", she tells BBC News. ""School had always been a refuge for them, they tell us, or maybe the extended family... and during the lockdown of course they couldn't escape."" Her comments come as the NSPCC said a record number of people contacted its helpline with child welfare concerns in May, up roughly a third from pre-lockdown levels. More than 22,000 adults contacted the charity from April to June, with May seeing the highest number of contacts on record at 8,287. The government says it has provided Â£1.6 million to the NSPCC to expand and promote their helpline during the pandemic. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has spoken about theUK's decision to opt out of the EU Covid-19 vaccine scheme. He told Times Radio that signing up to the EU programme would have meant abandoning Britain's own procurement schemes, which were more developed. He said Britain would not have been allowed to ""have a say"" in ""the vaccines that were procured, the price, [or] the quantity of the delivery schedule"". He added that one of the ""conditions"" of the EU's scheme was that Britain would have had to stop its ""own negotiations and only do them through the European Commission, and we weren't prepared to do that"". He insisted: ""We think we will go faster this way."" Millions of pints of beer have gone off in pub cellars sincebusinesses were forced to shut in March due to the coronavirus lockdown. Now pubs and bars have to apply for permission to pour beer down drains. Water companies say they have been inundated with requests. Severn Trent has given consent for 3.5 million litres to be disposed of, while Thames Water has allowed three million. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) estimated in May that 70 million pints would be lost due to Covid-19. Emma McClarkin, from the BBPA, said: ""The need to destroy so much beer really shows how much our brewing and pub sectors have been affected by this crisis.""  UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged Britons to go back to work if they can, in a change of position. Speaking earlier during an online session of People's PMQs, Mr Johnson said it was ""very important"" people go back to work now ""if they can"", adding he wanted the public to do this as ""carefully as possible"". He said the public had followed the government's earlier mantra to ""stay at home if you can"", but it was now time they followed the message of ""go back to work if you can"". He said it was ""very important"" people try to live their lives ""more normally"" and for people to feel ""confident"" to go to shops, restaurants and back to work, provided ""we all follow the guidance"". Sir Tim Barrow, the UK's Ambassador to the European Union, has confirmed that the UK has decided not to join the EU scheme for Covid-19 vaccine procurement. In a letter to the Secretary-General of the European Commission, he said the UK would not participate because it ""would be required to stop its negotiations with manufacturers with which the EU launched negotiations"" and because the Commission said ""it is not possible for the UK to have a role in the governance shaping decisions on which manufacturers to negotiate with, or the price, volume and delivery schedule negotiated"". Sir Tim went on to write that there could still be collaboration between the UK and the EU on areas such as ""sharing of information on promising vaccine candidates"" and ""vaccine trials"" and ""manufacturing investments and capacity building"". Francesca GillettBBC News Olivia McDermott with her son Elijah ""It's been a weird feeling to know she technically doesn't exist,"" says Emma Pratt. Her newborn daughter, Skye, was born the week before lockdown began. She is now almost four months old, but her birth still hasn't been registered. Normally, babies have to be registered with the local council within 42 days of being born, or 21 days in Scotland. But during the coronavirus lockdown, many councils paused all birth registrations - and are only now starting up again. It means they're faced withbacklogs of thousands of babies to register. For parents, it can cause practical problems too. For new mum Olivia McDermott, 24, not being able to register her son Elijah's birth could have scuppered her future career. Without a birth certificate, she could not apply for a childcare grant, and without the grant she said she would not be able to continue her training to become a nurse. ""Goodbye, dream job,"" says Ms McDermott, from Leeds. ""I'm meant to be going into my final year of training. I was just like, I won't be able to come in."" She eventually got an appointment and registered her son on Wednesday. ""Now I'm able to register him I'm feeling a lot better,"" she says. Read more. It's understood the government's looking at whether to make face coverings mandatory in shops in England. Senior government sources said that while no decision has yet been made it's an issue that's being kept under review. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told an online session of ""People's PMQs"" on Friday: ""We need to be stricter in insisting that people wear face coverings in confined places where they are meeting people that they don't normally meet. ""So that's why it's mandatory already on on public transport and we're looking at ways of making sure that people really do observe, but you do have face coverings in, in, in, in shops for instance where, you know, there is a risk of transmission."" James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Yes. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant in pools and can easily disable viruses, including coronavirus, as well as more resilient bugs such as bacteria. The chemical has to be used at the right concentration, but this will be standard practice. There are two infection risks in the pool - other swimmers themselves and water they may have contaminated. Sage, the governmentâs science advisers, say the risk of catching the virus through water is ""negligible"". But being within 2m of other swimmers - perhaps when catching your breath in the shallow end - is a bigger risk. Remember the risks are about more than just the pool. Coronavirus is spread through close contact, so beware in a cramped changing room. And it can linger on surfaces such as lockers, benches, shower buttons and taps. The number of confirmed coronavirus infections in Russia has increased by 6,635 over the past 24 hours, officials say. It brings the total number of cases in the country to 713,936, Russia's coronavirus crisis response centre said. Over the same period, an additional 174 deaths were recorded, bringing the number of fatalities to 11,017, the centre added. Russia has also today reported year-on-year figures for deaths in the country for the month of May. Rosstat, the state statistics agency, said 18,375 more deaths were reported this year, of which it said 7,444 cases were directly attributed to Covid-19. More news on face coverings - Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called on the government to make face coverings mandatory in busy and enclosed public places. In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Sadiq Khan said he was ""frustrated"" the measures had not already been introduced. It was announced on 15 Juneanyone travelling on public transport in England must wear a face covering. However, Mr Khan said precautions needed to be implemented in shops and hairdressers. As pubs, gyms and restaurants reopen across England, the mayor said face coverings are ""vital for public health"" and ""could play an increasing role in supporting public confidence and our economic recovery"". He said: ""The widespread use of face coverings are a visible signal that Londoners are willing to take the steps needed to keep each other safe. ""They show how seriously, as a society, we are treating the threat of coronavirus and they are a physical reminder that the virus is still out there,"" he added. Reality Check The UK government is expected to
confirm later whether it will opt out of an EU scheme to secure potential
Covid-19 vaccine supplies. The EU has launched other schemes,
during the pandemic, to secure things like testing kits and personal protective
equipment (PPE) - negotiating with suppliers on behalf of EU member states. The UK was allowed to join these
(because it is still in a transition period with the EU)but chose not to,external. So, how are the schemes getting on? The European Commission says its
PPE procurement plan can potentially provide up to 20 million goggles, 12
million face shields and over 350 million masks of different types. It says the
ventilator schemecan deliver,external110,000 units. It
says orders so far include: Belgium placing one for 2.6 million FFP2 masks and Austria
for 500,000. Latviaâs
order for 25,000 goggles and 100,000 surgical masks was delivered in June. Bulgariaâs
order for 55 ventilators is expected to be delivered by the end of July. Luxembourg
has received its order for 1,000,000 gloves. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.7044193

Francesca GillettBBC News Olivia McDermott with her son Elijah ""It's been a weird feeling to know she technically doesn't exist,"" says Emma Pratt. Her newborn daughter, Skye, was born the week before lockdown began. She is now almost four months old, but her birth still hasn't been registered. Normally, babies have to be registered with the local council within 42 days of being born, or 21 days in Scotland. But during the coronavirus lockdown, many councils paused all birth registrations - and are only now starting up again. It means they're faced withbacklogs of thousands of babies to register. For parents, it can cause practical problems too. For new mum Olivia McDermott, 24, not being able to register her son Elijah's birth could have scuppered her future career. Without a birth certificate, she could not apply for a childcare grant, and without the grant she said she would not be able to continue her training to become a nurse. ""Goodbye, dream job,"" says Ms McDermott, from Leeds. ""I'm meant to be going into my final year of training. I was just like, I won't be able to come in."" She eventually got an appointment and registered her son on Wednesday. ""Now I'm able to register him I'm feeling a lot better,"" she says. Read more. It's understood the government's looking at whether to make face coverings mandatory in shops in England. Senior government sources said that while no decision has yet been made it's an issue that's being kept under review. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told an online session of ""People's PMQs"" on Friday: ""We need to be stricter in insisting that people wear face coverings in confined places where they are meeting people that they don't normally meet. ""So that's why it's mandatory already on on public transport and we're looking at ways of making sure that people really do observe, but you do have face coverings in, in, in, in shops for instance where, you know, there is a risk of transmission."" James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Yes. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant in pools and can easily disable viruses, including coronavirus, as well as more resilient bugs such as bacteria. The chemical has to be used at the right concentration, but this will be standard practice. There are two infection risks in the pool - other swimmers themselves and water they may have contaminated. Sage, the governmentâs science advisers, say the risk of catching the virus through water is ""negligible"". But being within 2m of other swimmers - perhaps when catching your breath in the shallow end - is a bigger risk. Remember the risks are about more than just the pool. Coronavirus is spread through close contact, so beware in a cramped changing room. And it can linger on surfaces such as lockers, benches, shower buttons and taps. The number of confirmed coronavirus infections in Russia has increased by 6,635 over the past 24 hours, officials say. It brings the total number of cases in the country to 713,936, Russia's coronavirus crisis response centre said. Over the same period, an additional 174 deaths were recorded, bringing the number of fatalities to 11,017, the centre added. Russia has also today reported year-on-year figures for deaths in the country for the month of May. Rosstat, the state statistics agency, said 18,375 more deaths were reported this year, of which it said 7,444 cases were directly attributed to Covid-19. More news on face coverings - Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called on the government to make face coverings mandatory in busy and enclosed public places. In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Sadiq Khan said he was ""frustrated"" the measures had not already been introduced. It was announced on 15 Juneanyone travelling on public transport in England must wear a face covering. However, Mr Khan said precautions needed to be implemented in shops and hairdressers. As pubs, gyms and restaurants reopen across England, the mayor said face coverings are ""vital for public health"" and ""could play an increasing role in supporting public confidence and our economic recovery"". He said: ""The widespread use of face coverings are a visible signal that Londoners are willing to take the steps needed to keep each other safe. ""They show how seriously, as a society, we are treating the threat of coronavirus and they are a physical reminder that the virus is still out there,"" he added. Reality Check The UK government is expected to
confirm later whether it will opt out of an EU scheme to secure potential
Covid-19 vaccine supplies. The EU has launched other schemes,
during the pandemic, to secure things like testing kits and personal protective
equipment (PPE) - negotiating with suppliers on behalf of EU member states. The UK was allowed to join these
(because it is still in a transition period with the EU)but chose not to,external. So, how are the schemes getting on? The European Commission says its
PPE procurement plan can potentially provide up to 20 million goggles, 12
million face shields and over 350 million masks of different types. It says the
ventilator schemecan deliver,external110,000 units. It
says orders so far include: Belgium placing one for 2.6 million FFP2 masks and Austria
for 500,000. Latviaâs
order for 25,000 goggles and 100,000 surgical masks was delivered in June. Bulgariaâs
order for 55 ventilators is expected to be delivered by the end of July. Luxembourg
has received its order for 1,000,000 gloves. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,4.319889e-16

""It's just annoying,"" says Ms Pratt, 35, from Auchterarder in Perth and Kinross. ""It's something that should have been done within weeks of her being born and we are now four months. ""We can't open a bank account and my auntie had brought her premium bonds and we had to provide her identity, which we haven't been able to do. So that's been all cancelled. ""People have really kindly sent us cheques and we haven't been able to deposit them. It's really frustrating."" Ms Pratt finally managed to book an appointment to register the birth, face to face, for next Friday. ""It's funny because people have been saying she doesn't officially belong, and she doesn't,"" she adds. ""We could even change her name now if we wanted to, and that's crazy."" For new mum Olivia McDermott, 24, registering her son Elijah's birth meant the difference between continuing with her training to become a nurse. Ms McDermott would have had to drop out of her nurse training course if her baby wasn't registered Without a birth certificate, she could not apply for a childcare grant, and without the grant she said she would not be able to continue her course. ""Goodbye, dream job,"" says Ms McDermott, from Leeds. ""I'm meant to be going into my final year of training to be a nurse. I was just like, I won't be able to come in. ""There's a massive shortage of nurses, and the birth certificate is stopping me."" She and her partner checked the council website every morning to see when registrations would resume. She eventually got an appointment and registered her son on Wednesday. ""Now I'm able to register him I'm feeling a lot better,"" she says. Ms McDermott adds that it has been ""really hard"" having your first baby in lockdown. ""Normally, you have an idea in your head of what it will be like when you first have a baby, with all your friends and your family. But there wasn't any of that. Luckily I have a partner."" Despite the added hassle, Ms McDermott says she is now optimistic about the future. ""Although it caused me anxiety about the funding and not having his birth certificate, I'm just happy that they have managed to open safely as that is so important for this time that we are in."" Ms McDermott said she wouldn't have enough money to live on without the childcare grant One of the most common problems with the delay has been getting passports. Parents whose families live abroad are desperate to get a passport so they can introduce their babies. Agi, who did not want her second name used, wants to take her newborn son to Poland to meet her parents and elderly grandmother. ""It didn't occur to me, I almost booked flights for August,"" says Agi, who lives in south-east London. Concerns raised for babies born in virus lockdown Baby born in lockdown meets wider family Because her son was born two weeks ago, he will be ""at the back of the queue"" compared to the babies born at the beginning of lockdown, she adds. Many councils have resumed registrations but are prioritising babies by the dates they were born. Her council is currently only registering babies born before the end of March. ""This is the most frustrating aspect, the lack of communication and not knowing how big the delay I'm looking at,"" she says. ""Are we looking at weeks, a month, six months? I have an elderly grandmother who would ideally like to see her great grandson. ""There's talk of swimming pools, leisure centres and gyms opening but you can't register the birth of your child."" The Local Government Association, which represents councils, has urged the government to allow birth registrations to be done over the phone, to help clear the backlog. In a statement it said: ""With birth registrations having to be suspended for three months due to the pandemic, councils are experiencing a considerable backlog in registrations. Now that registrations have resumed, councils are offering appointments in some registration offices where they have been able to put in place safety measures to protect families as they work through this backlog, and are planning to open further offices soon. ""The registrations have to be done face to face, which is why we are urging government to consider allowing them to be done over the phone or online in the future, and as part of any further local or national lockdowns in response to the pandemic. ""Greater flexibility in the birth registration process would help councils reduce delays and families enjoy a smoother experience."" The government has warned parents they still may not be able to register a birth at the moment because of the virus, but ""you'll be able to register at a later date"". Despite this, councils say parents can still apply for child benefit and Universal Credit. And as lockdown is eased further, parents of newborn babies can begin introducing them to the wider world and their social circles. But for some parents, they will just have to wait a little longer before their baby becomes ""official"".

"Holiday airline Jet2 has suspended all flights to Spain from Scotland as a result of the 14-day quarantine rule. Passengers travelling into Scotland from Spain have to go into isolation for 14 days afterNicola Sturgeon confirmed she would not yet allow an ""air bridge""with the country. Spain and Serbia were left off the quarantine exemption list announced by the first minister earlier this week. They were omitted due to concerns about the prevalence of Covid-19. Flights from Glasgow and Edinburgh Airports will not resume until 25 July, according to the airline. A spokeswoman for Jet2 said: ""Our customers have been eagerly awaiting clarity about where they can travel to from Scotland for some time, and based on the demand we are experiencing it is clear that they are ready for their much-needed and well-deserved holidays. ""Because of the travel restrictions that are still in place to Spain as a result of this week's announcement by the Scottish government, we have taken the decision to recommence our flights and holidays programmes from Edinburgh and Glasgow Airports to Mainland Spain, the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands on 25 July 2020."" Nicola Sturgeon said cases entering Scotland from abroad was ""one of our biggest risk factors"" The company said that customers would offered a refund or the chance to rebook. Most of the company's flights from Scotland to holiday destinations are due to resume on 15 July. From today, Scots are able to travel to 57 other countries without having to self-isolate on returning. The first minister said it was a ""very difficult decision"" to make, but that it was needed to ""protect Scotland as far as possible from a resurgence of this virus in the weeks ahead"". Meanwhile, Edinburgh Airport has warned that about a third of its 7,000 jobs are under threat. Director of communications Gordon Robertson said the airport will not return to 2019 levels of business for another few years, and ""certainly not back to any kind of normality until 2021"". Redundancies are currently being negotiated, in consultation with unions. ""We employ 750 people there, and the airport employs around 7.000 people as a whole, and we think there will be up to a third of job losses across that, so it is a very challenging time,"" Mr Robertson told BBC Radio Scotland. He said Spain was ""one of our biggest markets"" and a big chunk of the summer schedules for airports like Edinburgh, Glasgow and Prestwick. ""More importantly, decisions made now means aircraft might move to England and not come back for next year's summer schedule,"" he added. ""It has long-lasting impacts and we hope the Scottish government can make decisions quickly so we can get back to flying to Spain soon.""

"Dr Akhtar connects via video link from his home in Essex From his laptop at his home just outside London, Dr Tahir Akhtar is helping treat a coronavirus patient in Lahore, Pakistan. Via a video link, a doctor there shows Dr Akhtar around the intensive care unit at the city's Jinnah Hospital. Dr Akhtar is an intensive care unit consultant in Britain's National Health Service, and has helped lead the response to Covid-19 in Essex, where he lives. Now, in his free time, he is using telemedicine software to share his experiences with counterparts in his country of birth, Pakistan - advising doctors on the best way to treat their patients. ""We are very proud of the NHS service we are giving here,"" Dr Akhtar said. ""And because of our relationships both in medicine and otherwise, it was very important for us to help our colleagues and to help the people of Pakistan."" Dr Akhtar told the BBC the huge number of coronavirus cases meant that even in the UK it was not possible for intensive care doctors alone to treat seriously ill patients - doctors from different specialties also had to be drafted in. In Pakistan, the difficulties would be amplified, he said, making it useful for those doctors to have ""someone they can talk to, someone they can take advice from"". Dr Muhammad Ashraf Zia, who heads the Covid-19 ICU in Jinnah Hospital, told the BBC it was ""very useful"" to exchange ideas with Dr Akhtar - even though he is a senior doctor himself, as coronavirus is such a new disease. He said his team had begun using certain medicines to treat patients that they previously had not, and they were now producing ""very good results"". War-hit Afghanistan overwhelmed by Covid-19 Life-saving Covid-19 drugs sold on Delhi black market There have been about 250,000 coronavirus cases and 5,000 deaths recorded in Pakistan. That's substantially lower than in Britain, where more than 44,000 people have died, even though it is likely fatalities in Pakistan have been undercounted. However, Pakistan has far fewer doctors per capita than the UK, and at times hospitals there have been stretched. According to the World Health Organization, there are under 10 medical doctors per 10,000 of the population in Pakistan, about three times fewer than in the UK. Dr Suhail Chughtai, another UK-based doctor of Pakistani origin, built the telemedicine software used to connect to the intensive care unit in Lahore. The software allows doctors to talk via video link and exchange copies of case notes as they speak. His aim was ""to plug the gap"" in Pakistan caused by a relative lack of intensive care specialists, by ""importing"" those doctors from the UK via telemedicine, he said. Custom made software allows doctors to video chat and exchange files Dr Chughtai has also created a number of other similar projects. One, run in conjunction with the government in Punjab province, allows doctors in the UK, Ireland, US and Pakistan to hold free virtual consultations with coronavirus patients - meaning they don't need to risk travelling to a hospital or clinic and infecting others along the way. Doctors in the four countries have carried out 35,000 consultations since March, with members of the Association of Pakistani Physicians in the UK among those offering their services. And another recently launched project aims to connect patients visiting rural health clinics in Punjab with centralised teams of doctors in more urban centres. Dr Chughtai sees such schemes as the future of medicine. ""Where a doctor and patient can speak the same language, we can create a bridge no matter where they are, through telemedicine,"" he said. There are other groups of British-Pakistani doctors also spending their free time trying to boost healthcare capacity in Pakistan. The ""Midland Doctors"" charity was set up in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake in Pakistani-administered Kashmir in 2005, and established a hospital in the city of Muzaffarabad. Now, the charity's members in Britain have been using their expertise to offer online training to doctors in Pakistan, as well as holding ""virtual ward rounds"" of critical care units, said one member, Dr Farhan Rashid. He said that because the UK's coronavirus peak was well ahead of Pakistan's, the doctors were able to offer valuable lessons to their counterparts in Pakistan. Dr Chughtai, who founded a number of the telemedicine portals, said that many British-Pakistani doctors were keen to engage. ""They love the UK, but they also want to give back to the country they came from,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"One of Boohoo's largest shareholders is dumping stock in the fashion firm after it said the company had failed to address concerns about working conditions at a supplier in Leicester. Standard Life Aberdeen (SLA) criticised Boohoo's response to exploitation claims as ""inadequate in scope, timeliness and gravity"". Allegations of poor pay and conditions at a factoryemerged last weekend. Boohoo has since announced an independent review of its supply chain. The fast fashion retailer's share price fell 2% to 279.7p each. A Sunday Times report claimed workers at a factory in Leicester - currently in local lockdown following a spike in Covid-19 cases - were paid just Â£3.50 an hour, while being offered no protection from coronavirus. It was making clothes for Boohoo's Nasty Gal brand. Lesley Duncan, deputy head of UK equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments, SLA's fund management arm, said it had invested in Boohoo since its flotation in 2014. Boohoo dropped by Next, Asos and Zalando over exploitation claims Boohoo to investigate Leicester supplier over exploitation claims SLA holds a 3.3% stake in Boohoo, according to data provider Morningstar. Ms Duncan said it had lobbied the company over a number of years on issues such as supply chain transparency. ""While we would have liked progress to have been quicker we did feel that progress was being made,"" Ms Duncan said. Boohoo also owns PrettyLittleThing, which has collaborated with celebrities like Little Mix But she said that concerns had been growing in recent weeks ""which even before recent developments, had negatively impacted our conviction levels in the company"". ""Having spoken to Boohoo's management team a number of times this week in light of recent concerning allegations, we view their response as inadequate in scope, timeliness and gravity."" The company, which also owns the PrettyLittleThing brand, said it was ""appalled"" by the allegations and that it had asked a senior barrister to lead a review. However, other retailers have distanced themselves from Boohoo. Next, Asos and Zalando all announced on Tuesday that they hadstopped selling Boohoo clothes on their websites. The retailers said they were pausing relationships with Boohoo's brands, pending the outcome of the company's investigation.

"Royal Mail has been fined Â£1.5m by the regulator for being late with first class deliveries and overcharging customers for second class stamps. Ofcom said Royal Mail missed its target of delivering 93% of first class post within a day of collection. It also overcharged people Â£60,000 after raising the cost of a second class stamp before a price cap was officially lifted. Royal Mail admitted it was ""disappointed"" with its performance. In the 2019 financial year, Ofcom found that only 91.5% of first class post was on time. ""Royal Mail let its customers down, and these fines should serve as a reminder that we'll take action when companies fall short,"" said Gaucho Rasmussen, Ofcom's director of investigations and enforcement. The watchdog also found that the company increased its price for second class stamps by 1p to 61p seven days ahead of the official cap being lifted. Royal Mail estimates it overcharged people by Â£60,000 ""which it is unable to refund"". Royal Mail admitted it had made a mistake and donated the sum to the charity Action for Children. ""We worked with Ofcom throughout this investigation and lessons have been learned by us during this process,"" it said. Earlier this year, Royal Mail lifted the price of a first class stamp which now costs 11p more than second class postage. The price of a first class stamp for regular letters rose 6p to 76p and second-class went up by 4p to 65p. The 65p second-class stamp is the maximum under an Ofcom price cap. Commenting in the current financial year, Royal Mail said it would be on course to hit the 93% first class delivery target if it hadn't been for the coronavirus outbreak. ""Despite our best endeavours, some areas of the UK experienced a reduction in service levels during March,"" it said. ""Relevant factors included high levels of coronavirus-related absences and necessary social distancing measures."" Last month Royal Mail said it will cut 2,000 management jobs as it struggles to deal with the effects of the coronavirus crisis. The cuts, equal to around a fifth of the company's management roles, aim to save about Â£130m in costs from next year. Royal Mail said the pandemic accelerated the trend of more parcels and fewer letters being sent, and it had not adapted quickly enough to that.

"Darrell and Darren Roberts were taken into care aged 13 when their mother died Twin brothers born in London and brought up in state care could face deportation to two different Caribbean countries they have never visited. Siblings of Darrell and Darren Roberts, 24, said they had been issued with deportation notifications and could be put on planes when released from jail for grievous bodily harm. Darrell's lawyer said his client was British and had served his sentence. The Home Office denied it had issued a deportation order. ""Neither Darrell or Darren Roberts are currently detained under immigration powers nor are they subject to deportation orders,"" a spokesman said. ""The Home Office considers carefully all cases where an offender is suspected of being potentially liable for deportation and it has a particular responsibility where the offending is prolific or high harm."" But the BBC has seen a notice sent to one of the men that indicates the Home Office does intend to pursue deportation. ""They could pick and deport any one of us,"" says their sister Freya Valie Roberts The twins were born in west London to parents from the Caribbean islands of Dominica and Grenada, with neither parent having UK citizenship. They were taken into care by Ealing Council's social services at the age of 13 when their mother died and their father returned to Dominica. Darrell was sentenced to a six-year prison sentence for grievous bodily harm at the age of 17. His family said on his release he was served with the deportation notice to the Dominican Republic, a country he has no connection to. Darrell believes officials named it in error because his father was born on the island of Dominica. His twin Darren remains in prison on a separate sentence for grievous bodily harm. According to his family Darren has been warned he faces deportation to Grenada - the country where his mother was born - when he finishes the jail sentence. The twins were born in England, but neither their parents nor their carers applied for citizenship The Home Office automatically issues a deportation notice to anyone without citizenship who has been convicted of a reasonably serious offence with a sentence of more than 12 months. Children born in the UK to parents who are foreign nationals can be eligible for British citizenship but are not automatically citizens. Neither their parents nor social services applied, leaving Darrell and Darren technically stateless. Freya Valie Roberts, one of the twins' sisters, said she was ""disgusted, upset and insulted"" when she heard they were being threatened with deportation. ""If they're going to deport my brothers, I mean there are 11 of us in total, they could pick and deport any one of us,"" she said. She said she was scared of what would happen to them in a country they had never visited and said they were being ""just sent to a place and you're not allowed to come back"". 'Grave risk' of Windrush scandal repeat 'I feel I was punished twice when I was deported' 'Turning my brother's Windrush trauma into a TV drama' Darrell's lawyer, Andrew Sperling, compared what was happening to the twins to the 18th and 19th Century practice of penal transportation, where convicts were shipped to countries such as Australia. He said Darrell was British and had served his sentence in ""a society which apparently believes in rehabilitation and supporting people to reintegrate into the community"". ""This is what should be happening with this man. But instead, he's having to fight a complex, terrifying legal procedure,"" he said. Andrew Sperling says Darrell Roberts should be supported ""to reintegrate into the community"" Family members have launched a petition to gather support for the twins, who they say should be able to remain in the UK indefinitely. A spokesman for Ealing Council said its children's services team had ""repeatedly engaged with both Darren and Darrell"" to allow them to apply for immigration status. But he said ""neither of the young men signed the documentation to allow it to be progressed"". ""We always work with young people to secure their status as part of the pathway planning process,"" he said. ""Care leavers in Ealing are supported practically and financially to get the advice and support to progress their applications and any subsequent appeals they may make.""

"No new deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales have been announced for the second day this week, leaving the official total at 1,540 Pubs, cafes and restaurants will be able to open indoors from 3 August if virus cases continue to fall, the first minister has said They have already been cleared to open outdoor areas from next Monday, 13 July Campsites, hairdressers, beauty salons, cinemas and playgrounds in Wales are also to reopen in the next three weeks The county of Ceredigion, which avoided the brunt of Covid-19, balances the need to welcome back tourists while keeping people safe An intensive care doctor who recovered from coronavirus tells how his workplace resembles ""a scene from a science fiction film"" Catherine Evans and Gemma Ryall That's all from today's live page coverage, bringing you the latest developments on the coronavirus outbreak in Wales. The latest updates are:  Our live blog will be back on Monday - in the meantime you can keep up with all the latest on coronavirus via the BBC News website. If you're still not sure what will be happening and when with the easing of lockdown in Wales, this should help. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Wales' lockdown restrictions roadmap laid out More than 1,700 fines were handed out for lockdown breaches by Dyfed-Powys Police. Between 27 March,when fixed penalty notices were introduced, and 6 July, the force reported 1,710 people
for breaches of travel restrictions. Almost two thirds of these were
individuals who had travelled unnecessarily from outside the force area, with
the largest number of tickets being issued in Powys. In one weekend in May â when
strict travel restrictions were still in place across Wales - officers turned
away more than 1,000 cars from the area around Ystradfallte known as ""waterfall
country"". âOur officers have maintained a
consistent approach to engage with the public at every opportunity and explain
the regulations, with enforcement only as a last resort,â said deputy chief constable Claire Parmenter. âThis educational approach
became even more important as differences emerged between the rules around
travel in England and Wales."" The leader of Plaid Cymru says the ""increase in public freedom"" must be matched with a testing and tracing programme ""that is able to keep up with increased demand"". Adam Price MS said the Welsh Government was right to take acautious approach to easing lockdown. âWithout the ability to quickly stamp out any further outbreaks, this âearly warning systemâ is largely undermined and worse - weâll risk seeing a return to lockdown conditions,"" he said. âWe need a much clearer strategy for using the available testing capacity, and we need to speed up the turnaround of test results. We have previously called for universal testing of health and social care workers â a call which is backed up by BMA (British Medical Association) proposals."" He added that, as the tourist industry is reopened and travel increases, ""we have the mechanisms in place to not only gain the public confidence but to stop a resurgence of the virus"". But the work must be put in ""to strengthen this crucial protective shield,"" he said. A restaurant owner in north Wales says he ""won't be able to cash in"" on the start of the school holidays. Pubs, cafes, restaurants and barscan reopen indoors in Wales from 3 August, providing coronavirus cases continue to fall. Shibber Ahmed of the Blue Elephant restaurant in Llandudno  said: ""Itâs late, the school holidays have started and I think we wonât be able to cash in. ""The whole town is open - there are lots of people around but we are not able to take advantage of it and we desperately needed that to cover our winter costs. ""I was thinking it would be 20 July rather than 3 August [for reopening}, so for two weeks basically we are losing out. ""These two weeks are crucial because 20% of our business is during the school holidays."" Shibber Ahmed was hoping to open his restaurant two weeks sooner No new deaths of people with coronavirus have been reported in Wales for the second time this week. Tuesday was the first day since the outbreak began in March that no deaths in Wales were announced. The official total number of people who have diedremains at 1,540 according to Public Health Wales. This graph shows the daily number of deaths according to the day occurred, rather than the day they were announced. No new deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales have been reported in Wales for the second day this week. The official total from Public Health Wales remains at 1,540. This map shows the number of deaths in each health board area of Wales. It does not include residents of Powys who have died at hospitals over the border in England. There is ""no longer anxiety
about widespread community transmission of coronavirus around two north Wales
food plants, the first minister has said. There have been 634 confirmed Covid-19 cases at meat plants in Wales -283 at Rowan Foods in Wrexham, 134 at Kepak in Merthyr Tydfiland the 217 cases at 2 Sisters at Llangefni on Anglesey. Mark Drakeford said the latest
advice ""does indeed suggest that we are probably past the most concerning
time"" at Rowan Foods and 2 Sisters. On Rowan Foods, he said ministers
were hopeful that an update from the outbreak control team later today would ""confirm that the measures that we were looking to the company to
put in place have been put in place, and that it can continue to operate in
that new way"". Mr Drakeford said the
experience had shown the importance of accurate record-keeping for tracing
""when you are working with a population which is often drawn from countries
outside the United Kingdom"". ""Some of the people who we
have struggled the most to contact are people where names and addresses have
not been properly recorded, where the spelling of people's names is many and
various, where telephone numbers are not been properly transcribed,"" he
told the Welsh Government's daily coronavirus news conference. ""I think we've learned
something about being prepared to communicate in languages other than Welsh and
English. ""For some of the
workers at Rowan Foods being able to see information in their own language,
their native language, is important and we will be better prepared to do that
more quickly if we face a similar outbreak in the future."" Rowan Foods in Wrexham has seen 283 cases of coronavirus confirmed No new deaths of people with coronavirus have been reported in Wales for the second time this week. Tuesday was the first day since the outbreak began in March that no deaths in Wales were announced. The official total number of people who have diedremains at 1,540. Public Health Wales (PHW) figures also showed there were 10 new cases reported. The leader of the Conservative group in the Welsh Parliament has responsed to the latest lockdown easing plans by saying he was ""pleased to see the Welsh Government following our lead"". Paul Davies claimed the Labour-led administration had adopted six out of 10 proposals the Welsh Tories had outlined yesterday. He added: âWe are disappointed at the unnecessary delay in
implementing some of these changes so we see no reason why reopening campsites
and beauty salons, and restarting house viewings canât be brought forward. âAnd we are disappointed that thereâs still no clarity on
face coverings, relaxing social distancing, or driving tests and lessons in
Wales."" Pubs, cafes, restaurants and bars canreopen indoors in Wales from 3 August, providing coronavirus cases continue to fall. A series of reopening dates have also been announced for businesses includingcampsites, hairdressers, beauty salons and cinemas. Previous pledges on the reopening of self-contained accommodation and outdoor areas of pubs, cafes and restaurants have also been confirmed. First Minister Mark Drakeford said there was an anxiety among the public in Wales ""about going back to places
where they may feel that their health and wellbeing would not be safely looked
after"". Asked if the delay announcing a
date for indoor hospitality to reopen had risked thousands of jobs, he said the
sector should spend three weeks doing things ""that are necessary to make a
success of the changes that are being offered to it"" with outdoor opening. ""I'm sure they will focus on
what they can do, rather than focusing on what they can't do,"" Mr
Drakeford told journalists. ""And, in that way, they will
have a successful future still before them."" The Welsh Government's decision not to require people in Wales to wear coverings is not contradictory, according to the first minister. Mark Drakeford said the approach is about ""making different judgements about the balance of risks"". He said Wales' chief medical officer believes face coverings have ""at best, a marginal additional benefit in public health terms"". Mr Drakeford added: ""Nevertheless we continue to look at all the evidence. We continue to look at different contexts, some of which face coverings by members of the public may have advantages as part of an overall package. ""I hope to be able to say something about public transport in Wales on Monday of next week, where this issue has been most hotly debated. ""But nobody should think that wearing a face covering is somehow a way of absolving you from the responsibility to do all those other things which actually offer you greater protection from coronavirus in a face mask will ever do."" Businesses in Wales that are unable to maintain the two-metre social distancing rules will have ""to take a series of other mitigating measures"", according to the first minister. Mark Drakeford listed some examples, including the installation of protective shields, increased cleaning, marshals in outdoor hospitality venues and ""extra rules in relation to the policing of toilets"". ""Those practical things will have to be in place in order to make sure that people are still kept safe from a disease that hasn't gone away"", he added. But he said the ""two-metre rule remains the default position in Wales"". He said: ""If you are able to run a business taking all reasonable measures to sustain a two-metre distance that is what the law in Wales will require you to do. ""But we recognise that there will be some context and some business for whom that simply isn't practically possible and in those circumstances what the law in Wales will require is that those businesses will have to take a series of other mitigating measures."" Live coverage of today's coronavirus press briefing has now switched toBBC Two Wales. The body representing trade unions in Wales has welcomed a date for hospitality to reopen indoors. Wales TUC General Secretary
    Shavanah Taj said: ""Hospitality workers across Wales are concerned about their future
      employment prospects and anxious over job losses. ""Todayâs announcement
      will provide a level of certainty for the sector and help prevent future
      job losses."" She added: ""At the Wales TUC we support the Welsh Government's steady and
      evidence-driven approach. Workersâ safety must continue to be the top
      priority."" Ms Taj said personal protective equipment (PPE) and test and tracing were ""key to the success of reopening"". Pubs in Wales have all necessary guidance for reopening, says the first minister. Mark Drakeford said he did not agree that pubs have not had enough time to prepare to reopen outside from Monday. He added: âThis sector has had weeks to prepare for reopening outdoors, not three days. ""There is plenty of guidance out there for those intending to reopen.â Mr Drakeford has said specific guidance will be published which has been agreed and discussed âin great detailâ with the sector. âAny suggestion that the sector didnât know what needs to be done simply does not stand up to interrogation,â he said. Pubs, cafÃ©s and restaurants in Waleswill be able to open indoors from 3 August, providing cases of coronavirus continue to fall, First
Minister Mark Drakeford said today. The Welsh Government is
announcing a series of relaxations to the restrictions relating to the hospitality and tourism sector. âLooking at all the indicators together,
the Chief Medical Officer for Wales has confirmed we have some capacity to ease
the restrictions further over the next three weeks,â said Mr Drakeford. In
other changes: The law enforcing the 2m social
distancing rules will be altered to allow for the fact that some industries
like hairdressing will be unable to comply.   Other measures, including wearing masks, will be expected to be used
instead. Mr Drakeford said âa note of cautionâ
should be used, citing the example of Melbourne in Australia, which is
re-imposing a lockdown after a fresh spike in cases. Itâs understood ministers are still in discussions with gym and
leisure companies about the reopening of indoor gyms and swimming pools. A majority of Britonsfeel
uncomfortable at the prospect of eating at a restaurant,an Office for
National Statistics (ONS) survey suggests. Just over one in five of the 1,788 adults in England, Scotland and Wales asked said they would be happy to have a sit-down meal as restrictions ease. Some 60% said they would be uncomfortable or very uncomfortable eating indoors during the pandemic. It comes as the government prepares a Â£500m ""eat out to help out"" scheme. Meals eaten at participating restaurants on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays in Augustwill be subsidised up to Â£10 a head. Chancellor Rishi Sunak (centre) hopes his discount scheme will encourage people to visit restaurants First Minister Mark Drakeford is about to give the Welsh
Government's daily press briefing on how it's handling the coronavirus
situation. He is expected to confirm details of further easing of the
lockdown, withcampsites,
hairdressers, beauty salons, cinemas and playgrounds set to reopen in the next
three weeks. We'll update you with the main points here - you can also watch

"This video can not be played Dame Vera's cortege halted as it passed through her home town of Ditchling Two Spitfires flew over the funeral procession of Dame Vera Lynn as family, friends and fans said goodbye to the Forces' Sweetheart. Her cortege was accompanied by the Battle of Britain flypast as it travelled through Ditchling in East Sussex at midday. Dame Vera died last month at the age of 103 and her funeral was held at Woodvale Crematorium in Brighton. The World War Two fighter planes made three passes over the village. Hundreds of people had gathered to await the arrival of the cortege and the crowd applauded as the aircraft flew over. Representatives from the Royal British Legion stood with flags as they waited to honour Dame Vera. Shops in the village displayed portraits of Dame Vera The funeral procession stopped at the crossroads in the centre of Ditchling, where the singer lived for 50 years, to allow people to pay their respects. Later, as the procession made its way out of the village, there were shouts of ""hip hip hooray"" from the crowd. The cheers were followed by a spontaneous rendition of We'll Meet Again, one of the songs Dame Vera was well-known for. A private service at the crematorium chapel included music from a bugler from the Royal Marines. The family said a full memorial service would be held at a later date. People applauded as the Battle of Britain flypast took place Dame Vera's daughter, Virginia Lewis-Jones, said Ditchling had always been special to her mother. ""That is why we know she would be touched that so many people want to pay their respects,"" she said. She also urged people to continue to back the causes that were important to her mother, adding: ""We are sure her music will endure forever but most importantly, we hope that people will continue to support those charities that she cared about so much. ""It means so much to us to see my mother's legacy living on."" Dame Vera performing for servicemen in 1940 Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted footage of the flypast, saying it has been ""a farewell befitting a truly great Briton"". Allow Twitter content?

"The government has spent Â£15bn on protective equipment for medical and care workers The government is under pressure to review its personal protective equipment (PPE) deals after a Tory councillor received major contracts. The councillor's company, P14 Medical, was given contracts to supply face shields worth Â£120m in total. Labour said the government had ""serious questions"" to answer about the PPE procurement process. No 10 said the Department of Health and Social Care ""works closely with the Treasury to ensure value for money"". Cost of coronavirus support soars to Â£190bn Robust plan for PPE 'must be in place for winter' The prime minister's official spokesman said demand for PPE had been going up but the DHSC ""will have worked with the Treasury on spending conditions"". Asked what safeguards were in place where companies were run by Conservative Party members, he said: ""All contracts will be published by DHSC and their value."" The government has spent Â£15bn on PPE since the coronavirus pandemic began, according to a Treasury statement earlier this week. Of this, the details of PPE contracts worth Â£1.5bn have been published on the government's website. In responding to the coronavirus crisis, the government has forgone the tendering process under which contracts are usually handed out. Instead, it has tended to use an emergency procedure, in which contracts are handed directly to companies without competition. P14 Medical, based in Stroud, Gloucestershire, was awarded two contracts worth a total of Â£120m to supply PPE to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). The deal was the third largest PPE contract awarded by the DHSC that has been published so far. Steve Dechan, the director of P14 Medical, is a Conservative councillor on Stroud Town Council and campaigned for the local MP Siobhan Baillie at the 2019 election. The company, a specialist in pain management technologies, was handed the contracts despite recording significant losses in 2019. P14 told the Financial Times the losses were owing to heavy investment in new chronic pain technology that it plans to market in Europe and the Middle East this summer. It said it had saved the government Â£55m on its face shield contracts, which had been completed ""ahead of time and on budget"". The contracts were awarded directly to the company without a competitive tendering process. In an email, Mr Dechan told the BBC: ""We are an expert company that has been in medical supplies for eight years including PPE that has managed to deliver on a big contract that the 'big companies' could not. ""I only know a couple MPs through local campaigning on issues, only met ministers (no current ones) on [general election] campaign trails. Never discussed PPE."" He added: ""We are so proud that we stood up and unlike many got it done and protected our customers."" Labour shadow health minister Justin Madders said the contracts awarded to P14 Medical raised questions about transparency. ""On the face of it this company's connections to the Conservative Party appear to be stronger than their experience in delivering PPE. ""Serious questions need to be asked about how they managed to obtain such a lucrative contract without any track record to speak of. ""Ministers need to adopt total transparency and release all details of how these contracts were awarded. ""There is more than a sniff of contracts being awarded on the basis of who you know, which can only be answered by the government coming clean on the process they followed."" Questions have also been raised about large contracts awarded to other small firms with limited experience of supplying PPE. Campaigners are seeking a judicial review into the award of a Â£32m contract to PestFix Ltd, a pest control company in Sussex. In a statement, the Department for Health and Social Care said: ""We have been working around the clock to deliver PPE to protect people on the frontline during this global pandemic. ""Almost 28 billion items of PPE have been ordered from UK-based manufacturers and international partners to provide a continuous supply over the coming months. ""We have a robust process to ensure orders are of high-quality standard and meet commercial due diligence.""

"The government has spent Â£15bn on protective equipment for medical and care workers The government is under pressure to review its personal protective equipment (PPE) deals after a Tory councillor received major contracts. The councillor's company, P14 Medical, was given contracts to supply face shields worth Â£120m in total. Labour said the government had ""serious questions"" to answer about the PPE procurement process. No 10 said the Department of Health and Social Care ""works closely with the Treasury to ensure value for money"". Cost of coronavirus support soars to Â£190bn Robust plan for PPE 'must be in place for winter' The prime minister's official spokesman said demand for PPE had been going up but the DHSC ""will have worked with the Treasury on spending conditions"". Asked what safeguards were in place where companies were run by Conservative Party members, he said: ""All contracts will be published by DHSC and their value."" The government has spent Â£15bn on PPE since the coronavirus pandemic began, according to a Treasury statement earlier this week. Of this, the details of PPE contracts worth Â£1.5bn have been published on the government's website. In responding to the coronavirus crisis, the government has forgone the tendering process under which contracts are usually handed out. Instead, it has tended to use an emergency procedure, in which contracts are handed directly to companies without competition. P14 Medical, based in Stroud, Gloucestershire, was awarded two contracts worth a total of Â£120m to supply PPE to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). The deal was the third largest PPE contract awarded by the DHSC that has been published so far. Steve Dechan, the director of P14 Medical, is a Conservative councillor on Stroud Town Council and campaigned for the local MP Siobhan Baillie at the 2019 election. The company, a specialist in pain management technologies, was handed the contracts despite recording significant losses in 2019. P14 told the Financial Times the losses were owing to heavy investment in new chronic pain technology that it plans to market in Europe and the Middle East this summer. It said it had saved the government Â£55m on its face shield contracts, which had been completed ""ahead of time and on budget"". The contracts were awarded directly to the company without a competitive tendering process. In an email, Mr Dechan told the BBC: ""We are an expert company that has been in medical supplies for eight years including PPE that has managed to deliver on a big contract that the 'big companies' could not. ""I only know a couple MPs through local campaigning on issues, only met ministers (no current ones) on [general election] campaign trails. Never discussed PPE."" He added: ""We are so proud that we stood up and unlike many got it done and protected our customers."" Labour shadow health minister Justin Madders said the contracts awarded to P14 Medical raised questions about transparency. ""On the face of it this company's connections to the Conservative Party appear to be stronger than their experience in delivering PPE. ""Serious questions need to be asked about how they managed to obtain such a lucrative contract without any track record to speak of. ""Ministers need to adopt total transparency and release all details of how these contracts were awarded. ""There is more than a sniff of contracts being awarded on the basis of who you know, which can only be answered by the government coming clean on the process they followed."" Questions have also been raised about large contracts awarded to other small firms with limited experience of supplying PPE. Campaigners are seeking a judicial review into the award of a Â£32m contract to PestFix Ltd, a pest control company in Sussex. In a statement, the Department for Health and Social Care said: ""We have been working around the clock to deliver PPE to protect people on the frontline during this global pandemic. ""Almost 28 billion items of PPE have been ordered from UK-based manufacturers and international partners to provide a continuous supply over the coming months. ""We have a robust process to ensure orders are of high-quality standard and meet commercial due diligence.""

Thanks for joining us. As our live page draws to a close, have a look back at the day's main coronavirus-related developments: In the UK:  Around the world:  A ""small"" outbreak of Covid-19 has been reported at an accommodation centre for asylum seekers and refugees in Wakefield in West Yorkshire, northern England. Wakefield Council said a number of residents at Urban House, in Love Lane, had tested positive for the virus, adding that those affected have been isolated and given treatment and support at another location. Anna Hartley, Wakefield Councilâs director of public health, said: âA mobile testing unit is being set up at the site and weâre continuing to work closely with Mears Group, the Home Office and Public Health England to help limit any further potential spread. âPlease be reassured that the risk to those in the local area is very low, however, we ask everyone to please continue to follow government guidance on regular handwashing and social distancing to help keep yourself and others safe."" Gyms, nail bars, swimming pools and tattoo parlours have been among the places still closed in most of the UK. But they now have reopening dates in England. They are: Find outmore here. Englandâs deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries has suggestedlosing weight may be one way to protect yourself against coronavirus.,external But with gyms still closed in many parts of the UK, how easy is it to lose weight in lockdown? Science journalist Dr Michael Mosley says being obese puts you at a ""significantly greater risk"", and any vaccine against the virus is less likely to work. ""Being obese messes with your immune system,"" he tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""It's not just about reducing your risk of the nasty complications should you get the virus, it's also about ensuring the vaccine is going to work."" Dr Mosley says it's a ""fallacy"" that exercise is a good way of losing weight, however. ""Itâs great for all sorts of things - like improving your mood - but a pretty terrible way of losing weight because you have to do so much. It is about cutting calories and changing what youâre eating,"" he says. For more information visitthe NHS website,external. Zulfiqar AliBBC Reality Check Iran has seen a rapid surge in the numbers of coronavirus cases recently, with daily recorded deaths reaching new highs. In mid-June, daily reported deaths went above 100 - for the first time in two months. And since then, this figure has been going up, reaching 221 dead by 9 July. New reported infections averaged more than 3,000 a day in the first week of June - a 50% increase on the previous seven days. This figure reached a high of 3,574 on 4 June, before dropping slightly. There have been more than 2,000 cases a day since then. The epidemic was initially concentrated in Qom and the capital, Tehran. But now, a flare-up has been reported in the south-west, notably in Khuzestan province, an oil-rich region that borders Iraq. Officials have suggested the renewed surge in new cases could be down to more testing, and President Hassan Rouhani has said this means you will find more cases.

Two men have been arrested on suspicion of fraud and money laundering offences after police found evidence of suspected fake companies applying for coronavirusBounce Back loans,external. Ten accounts have been frozen so far, amounting to Â£553,305, as officers investigate and identify victims, London's Metropolitan Police says. Detectives launched an investigation after a routine drug search on a vehicle in Holland Park on 17 June. The officers found the vehicle's owner, a man in his early 20s, had travelled to meet a man in order to set up a bank account, for which he would be paid Â£300. Police identified the second man, who was in his late 40s, that he was due to meet and subsequently arrested both on suspicion of money laundering and fraud. The two men have since been released under investigation pending further enquiries. The number of new infection has risen by 228,102 during the last 24 hours, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) - a record increase. The biggest increases in cases were from the United States, Brazil, India and South Africa,the UN body said in its daily report.,external The previous WHO record for new cases was 212,326 on 4 July. More than 12.1 million cases have been reported by the WHO. Johns Hopkins University puts this figure at more than 12.3 million. The anonymous whistleblower said some factories had stayed open and taken on extra staff during the lockdown A whistleblower from Leicester's textile industry says some factories almost doubled their staffing to cope with online orders during the Covid-19 lockdown. The worker, who cannot be identified, said firms that ""maybe used to have 50 people working comfortably, now had 80 or 90 people in the same area"". A lockdownwas enforced in Leicester last month after a spike in coronavirus cases. ""If somebody did have Covid or wasn't well, they were still there passing it on to whoever's next to them,"" he said. ""During Covid we've had no social distancing whatsoever in the factories."" He said the situation had made already poor conditions worse: ""Very few factories, if any, have cleaners coming in and out."" Investigations are ongoing into employment practices at several firms. Read his full accounthere. BBC News Channel There has been a ""surge"" in the number of calls to Childline from children and young people during lockdown, the counselling service's founder Dame Esther Rantzen says. Children have found themselves ""imprisoned in families where frankly they were either very unhappy or even unsafe"", she tells BBC News. ""School had always been a refuge for them, they tell us, or maybe the extended family... and during the lockdown of course they couldn't escape."" Her comments come as the NSPCC said a record number of people contacted its helpline with child welfare concerns in May, up roughly a third from pre-lockdown levels. More than 22,000 adults contacted the charity from April to June, with May seeing the highest number of contacts on record at 8,287. The government says it has provided Â£1.6 million to the NSPCC to expand and promote their helpline during the pandemic. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has spoken about theUK's decision to opt out of the EU Covid-19 vaccine scheme. He told Times Radio that signing up to the EU programme would have meant abandoning Britain's own procurement schemes, which were more developed. He said Britain would not have been allowed to ""have a say"" in ""the vaccines that were procured, the price, [or] the quantity of the delivery schedule"". He added that one of the ""conditions"" of the EU's scheme was that Britain would have had to stop its ""own negotiations and only do them through the European Commission, and we weren't prepared to do that"". He insisted: ""We think we will go faster this way."" Millions of pints of beer have gone off in pub cellars sincebusinesses were forced to shut in March due to the coronavirus lockdown. Now pubs and bars have to apply for permission to pour beer down drains. Water companies say they have been inundated with requests. Severn Trent has given consent for 3.5 million litres to be disposed of, while Thames Water has allowed three million. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) estimated in May that 70 million pints would be lost due to Covid-19. Emma McClarkin, from the BBPA, said: ""The need to destroy so much beer really shows how much our brewing and pub sectors have been affected by this crisis.""  UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged Britons to go back to work if they can, in a change of position. Speaking earlier during an online session of People's PMQs, Mr Johnson said it was ""very important"" people go back to work now ""if they can"", adding he wanted the public to do this as ""carefully as possible"". He said the public had followed the government's earlier mantra to ""stay at home if you can"", but it was now time they followed the message of ""go back to work if you can"". He said it was ""very important"" people try to live their lives ""more normally"" and for people to feel ""confident"" to go to shops, restaurants and back to work, provided ""we all follow the guidance"". Sir Tim Barrow, the UK's Ambassador to the European Union, has confirmed that the UK has decided not to join the EU scheme for Covid-19 vaccine procurement. In a letter to the Secretary-General of the European Commission, he said the UK would not participate because it ""would be required to stop its negotiations with manufacturers with which the EU launched negotiations"" and because the Commission said ""it is not possible for the UK to have a role in the governance shaping decisions on which manufacturers to negotiate with, or the price, volume and delivery schedule negotiated"". Sir Tim went on to write that there could still be collaboration between the UK and the EU on areas such as ""sharing of information on promising vaccine candidates"" and ""vaccine trials"" and ""manufacturing investments and capacity building"". Francesca GillettBBC News Olivia McDermott with her son Elijah ""It's been a weird feeling to know she technically doesn't exist,"" says Emma Pratt. Her newborn daughter, Skye, was born the week before lockdown began. She is now almost four months old, but her birth still hasn't been registered. Normally, babies have to be registered with the local council within 42 days of being born, or 21 days in Scotland. But during the coronavirus lockdown, many councils paused all birth registrations - and are only now starting up again. It means they're faced withbacklogs of thousands of babies to register. For parents, it can cause practical problems too. For new mum Olivia McDermott, 24, not being able to register her son Elijah's birth could have scuppered her future career. Without a birth certificate, she could not apply for a childcare grant, and without the grant she said she would not be able to continue her training to become a nurse. ""Goodbye, dream job,"" says Ms McDermott, from Leeds. ""I'm meant to be going into my final year of training. I was just like, I won't be able to come in."" She eventually got an appointment and registered her son on Wednesday. ""Now I'm able to register him I'm feeling a lot better,"" she says. Read more. It's understood the government's looking at whether to make face coverings mandatory in shops in England. Senior government sources said that while no decision has yet been made it's an issue that's being kept under review. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told an online session of ""People's PMQs"" on Friday: ""We need to be stricter in insisting that people wear face coverings in confined places where they are meeting people that they don't normally meet. ""So that's why it's mandatory already on on public transport and we're looking at ways of making sure that people really do observe, but you do have face coverings in, in, in, in shops for instance where, you know, there is a risk of transmission."" James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Yes. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant in pools and can easily disable viruses, including coronavirus, as well as more resilient bugs such as bacteria. The chemical has to be used at the right concentration, but this will be standard practice. There are two infection risks in the pool - other swimmers themselves and water they may have contaminated. Sage, the governmentâs science advisers, say the risk of catching the virus through water is ""negligible"". But being within 2m of other swimmers - perhaps when catching your breath in the shallow end - is a bigger risk. Remember the risks are about more than just the pool. Coronavirus is spread through close contact, so beware in a cramped changing room. And it can linger on surfaces such as lockers, benches, shower buttons and taps. The number of confirmed coronavirus infections in Russia has increased by 6,635 over the past 24 hours, officials say. It brings the total number of cases in the country to 713,936, Russia's coronavirus crisis response centre said. Over the same period, an additional 174 deaths were recorded, bringing the number of fatalities to 11,017, the centre added. Russia has also today reported year-on-year figures for deaths in the country for the month of May. Rosstat, the state statistics agency, said 18,375 more deaths were reported this year, of which it said 7,444 cases were directly attributed to Covid-19. More news on face coverings - Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called on the government to make face coverings mandatory in busy and enclosed public places. In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Sadiq Khan said he was ""frustrated"" the measures had not already been introduced. It was announced on 15 Juneanyone travelling on public transport in England must wear a face covering. However, Mr Khan said precautions needed to be implemented in shops and hairdressers. As pubs, gyms and restaurants reopen across England, the mayor said face coverings are ""vital for public health"" and ""could play an increasing role in supporting public confidence and our economic recovery"". He said: ""The widespread use of face coverings are a visible signal that Londoners are willing to take the steps needed to keep each other safe. ""They show how seriously, as a society, we are treating the threat of coronavirus and they are a physical reminder that the virus is still out there,"" he added. Reality Check The UK government is expected to
confirm later whether it will opt out of an EU scheme to secure potential
Covid-19 vaccine supplies. The EU has launched other schemes,
during the pandemic, to secure things like testing kits and personal protective
equipment (PPE) - negotiating with suppliers on behalf of EU member states. The UK was allowed to join these
(because it is still in a transition period with the EU)but chose not to,external. So, how are the schemes getting on? The European Commission says its
PPE procurement plan can potentially provide up to 20 million goggles, 12
million face shields and over 350 million masks of different types. It says the
ventilator schemecan deliver,external110,000 units. It
says orders so far include: Belgium placing one for 2.6 million FFP2 masks and Austria
for 500,000. Latviaâs
order for 25,000 goggles and 100,000 surgical masks was delivered in June. Bulgariaâs
order for 55 ventilators is expected to be delivered by the end of July. Luxembourg
has received its order for 1,000,000 gloves. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0

"The government has spent Â£15bn on protective equipment for medical and care workers The government is under pressure to review its personal protective equipment (PPE) deals after a Tory councillor received major contracts. The councillor's company, P14 Medical, was given contracts to supply face shields worth Â£120m in total. Labour said the government had ""serious questions"" to answer about the PPE procurement process. No 10 said the Department of Health and Social Care ""works closely with the Treasury to ensure value for money"". Cost of coronavirus support soars to Â£190bn Robust plan for PPE 'must be in place for winter' The prime minister's official spokesman said demand for PPE had been going up but the DHSC ""will have worked with the Treasury on spending conditions"". Asked what safeguards were in place where companies were run by Conservative Party members, he said: ""All contracts will be published by DHSC and their value."" The government has spent Â£15bn on PPE since the coronavirus pandemic began, according to a Treasury statement earlier this week. Of this, the details of PPE contracts worth Â£1.5bn have been published on the government's website. In responding to the coronavirus crisis, the government has forgone the tendering process under which contracts are usually handed out. Instead, it has tended to use an emergency procedure, in which contracts are handed directly to companies without competition. P14 Medical, based in Stroud, Gloucestershire, was awarded two contracts worth a total of Â£120m to supply PPE to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). The deal was the third largest PPE contract awarded by the DHSC that has been published so far. Steve Dechan, the director of P14 Medical, is a Conservative councillor on Stroud Town Council and campaigned for the local MP Siobhan Baillie at the 2019 election. The company, a specialist in pain management technologies, was handed the contracts despite recording significant losses in 2019. P14 told the Financial Times the losses were owing to heavy investment in new chronic pain technology that it plans to market in Europe and the Middle East this summer. It said it had saved the government Â£55m on its face shield contracts, which had been completed ""ahead of time and on budget"". The contracts were awarded directly to the company without a competitive tendering process. In an email, Mr Dechan told the BBC: ""We are an expert company that has been in medical supplies for eight years including PPE that has managed to deliver on a big contract that the 'big companies' could not. ""I only know a couple MPs through local campaigning on issues, only met ministers (no current ones) on [general election] campaign trails. Never discussed PPE."" He added: ""We are so proud that we stood up and unlike many got it done and protected our customers."" Labour shadow health minister Justin Madders said the contracts awarded to P14 Medical raised questions about transparency. ""On the face of it this company's connections to the Conservative Party appear to be stronger than their experience in delivering PPE. ""Serious questions need to be asked about how they managed to obtain such a lucrative contract without any track record to speak of. ""Ministers need to adopt total transparency and release all details of how these contracts were awarded. ""There is more than a sniff of contracts being awarded on the basis of who you know, which can only be answered by the government coming clean on the process they followed."" Questions have also been raised about large contracts awarded to other small firms with limited experience of supplying PPE. Campaigners are seeking a judicial review into the award of a Â£32m contract to PestFix Ltd, a pest control company in Sussex. In a statement, the Department for Health and Social Care said: ""We have been working around the clock to deliver PPE to protect people on the frontline during this global pandemic. ""Almost 28 billion items of PPE have been ordered from UK-based manufacturers and international partners to provide a continuous supply over the coming months. ""We have a robust process to ensure orders are of high-quality standard and meet commercial due diligence.""

"Darrell and Darren Roberts were taken into care aged 13 when their mother died Twin brothers born in London and brought up in state care could face deportation to two different Caribbean countries they have never visited. Siblings of Darrell and Darren Roberts, 24, said they had been issued with deportation notifications and could be put on planes when released from jail for grievous bodily harm. Darrell's lawyer said his client was British and had served his sentence. The Home Office denied it had issued a deportation order. ""Neither Darrell or Darren Roberts are currently detained under immigration powers nor are they subject to deportation orders,"" a spokesman said. ""The Home Office considers carefully all cases where an offender is suspected of being potentially liable for deportation and it has a particular responsibility where the offending is prolific or high harm."" But the BBC has seen a notice sent to one of the men that indicates the Home Office does intend to pursue deportation. ""They could pick and deport any one of us,"" says their sister Freya Valie Roberts The twins were born in west London to parents from the Caribbean islands of Dominica and Grenada, with neither parent having UK citizenship. They were taken into care by Ealing Council's social services at the age of 13 when their mother died and their father returned to Dominica. Darrell was sentenced to a six-year prison sentence for grievous bodily harm at the age of 17. His family said on his release he was served with the deportation notice to the Dominican Republic, a country he has no connection to. Darrell believes officials named it in error because his father was born on the island of Dominica. His twin Darren remains in prison on a separate sentence for grievous bodily harm. According to his family Darren has been warned he faces deportation to Grenada - the country where his mother was born - when he finishes the jail sentence. The twins were born in England, but neither their parents nor their carers applied for citizenship The Home Office automatically issues a deportation notice to anyone without citizenship who has been convicted of a reasonably serious offence with a sentence of more than 12 months. Children born in the UK to parents who are foreign nationals can be eligible for British citizenship but are not automatically citizens. Neither their parents nor social services applied, leaving Darrell and Darren technically stateless. Freya Valie Roberts, one of the twins' sisters, said she was ""disgusted, upset and insulted"" when she heard they were being threatened with deportation. ""If they're going to deport my brothers, I mean there are 11 of us in total, they could pick and deport any one of us,"" she said. She said she was scared of what would happen to them in a country they had never visited and said they were being ""just sent to a place and you're not allowed to come back"". 'Grave risk' of Windrush scandal repeat 'I feel I was punished twice when I was deported' 'Turning my brother's Windrush trauma into a TV drama' Darrell's lawyer, Andrew Sperling, compared what was happening to the twins to the 18th and 19th Century practice of penal transportation, where convicts were shipped to countries such as Australia. He said Darrell was British and had served his sentence in ""a society which apparently believes in rehabilitation and supporting people to reintegrate into the community"". ""This is what should be happening with this man. But instead, he's having to fight a complex, terrifying legal procedure,"" he said. Andrew Sperling says Darrell Roberts should be supported ""to reintegrate into the community"" Family members have launched a petition to gather support for the twins, who they say should be able to remain in the UK indefinitely. A spokesman for Ealing Council said its children's services team had ""repeatedly engaged with both Darren and Darrell"" to allow them to apply for immigration status. But he said ""neither of the young men signed the documentation to allow it to be progressed"". ""We always work with young people to secure their status as part of the pathway planning process,"" he said. ""Care leavers in Ealing are supported practically and financially to get the advice and support to progress their applications and any subsequent appeals they may make.""

"This video can not be played Confused about what you can do when? This should help Pubs, cafes, restaurants and bars can reopen indoors in Wales from 3 August, providing coronavirus cases continue to fall. First Minister Mark Drakeford announced the date in a long list of changes to the country's coronavirus restrictions. Exemptions will also be made to Wales' 2m distancing law, with businesses that cannot meet it expected to take precautions. Hospitality businesses will be able to open outdoors from Monday. Mr Drakeford said the opening of pubs, restaurants and cafes indoors would depend on how well the initial phase goes. Live: Further easing of lockdown in Wales Recreational cricket to resume in Wales Campsites, hairdressers, beauty salons, cinemas and playgroundsare to reopen in the next three weeks,  and outdoor activities,including ""low-contact"" team sportsinvolving up to 30 people, can also resume from Monday. But Mr Drakeford said rugby scrums would not be permitted. Wales had previously been the only part of the UK not to set a date for the reopening of indoor hospitality. Pubs had reopened in England last weekend. In Scotland they will be able to fully reopen from 15 July. This video can not be played Pubs and cafes can reopen inside from 3 August In other announcements, outdoor gyms, playgrounds and community centres will be able to reopen on 20 July. Campsites and other accommodation with shared facilities can reopen from 25 July. On 27 July the following activities can restart: Close contact services, such as beauty salons, tattoo shops and nail parlours The viewing of occupied homes for rent or sale Cinemas, museums and galleries Rules requiring people to only meet one household when outdoors will remain in place. Mr Drakeford said looking at ""all the indicators together"", the chief medical officer for Wales Frank Atherton ""has confirmed we have some capacity to ease the restrictions further over the next three weeks"". Advisers have told the Welsh Government cases are falling by 2% every day. But the first minister urged ""a note of caution"", citing the example of Melbourne in Australiawhich is re-imposing a lockdownafter a fresh spike in cases. No announcement was made on indoor gyms. Ministers are understood to be in discussions with gym and leisure companies about the reopening of indoor gyms and swimming pools. The law enforcing the 2m social distancing rules in Wales will also be changed, so that businesses that cannot stick to the rule can use other measures to reduce the risk of transmission. Examples listed by Mr Drakeford included the installation of protective shields, increased cleaning, marshalls in outdoor hospitality venues and ""extra rules in relation to the policing of toilets"". He said firms that can take ""all reasonable measures to sustain a 2m distance"" would be required to stick to the rule. ""But we recognise that there will be some contexts and some businesses for whom that simply isn't practically possible, and in those circumstances what the law in Wales will require is that those businesses will have to take a series of other mitigating measures."" Playgrounds will be able to reopen ready for the summer holidays Welsh Conservatives Senedd leader Paul Davies said: ""Yesterday we published a list of 10 things we wanted the Welsh Government to deliver as part of its coronavirus restrictions review, and we have seen ministers adopt six out of 10 of our proposals - so we are pleased to see the Welsh Government following our lead."" Wales TUC, which represents trade unions in Wales, said the announcement ""will provide a level of certainty for the sector and help prevent future job losses"". And business body CBI Wales welcomed the easing of the social distancing rules: ""The move will have a material impact across tourism and hospitality who are desperate to get back on their feet."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the changes ""must be matched by a Test, Trace and Protect programme that is able keep up with increased demand. Without the ability to quickly stamp out any further outbreaks, this 'early warning system' is largely undermined and worse - we'll risk seeing a return to lockdown conditions."" Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon said: ""We are looking forward to reopening our pubs in Wales. We will work towards the government reopening date."" Shibber Ahmed said the date means his restaurant is losing out Shibber Ahmed, owner of the Blue Elephant in Llandudno, said his restaurant would be ""losing out"" from not being able to open until 3 August. ""The whole town is open,"" he said. ""There are lots of people around, but we are not able to take advantage of it and we desperately needed that to cover our winter costs."" Emlyn Roberts, owner of Hebog cafÃ© and restaurant in Beddgelert, has a one way system in its beer garden, ready for next week. ""We will be opening on Wednesday,"" he said, but ""if the weather's bad we will waste a lot of stock."" Paige Davies, a fitness instructor at Dowlais Community Centre in Merthyr Tydfil, said she was frustrated at the lack of a reopening date for indoor gyms. ""I do a lot of fitness myself and being able to get back into it is brilliant for me. You hear gym members say 'when can we come back to the gym', then you feel disappointed that you're unable to provide something for them."" She said her gym had removed some equipment to prepare for social distancing. ""We have to now limit how many would use the gym,"" she said. The first minister rejected claims pubs had not been given enough time to ready for the resumption of trading. ""This sector has had weeks to prepare for reopening outdoors, not three days. There is plenty of guidance out there for those intending to reopen,"" he said. There was an ""anxiety"", he claimed, among the public in Wales ""about going back to places where they may feel that their health and wellbeing would not be safely looked after"". Asked if the delay in announcing a date for indoor hospitality to reopen had risked thousands of jobs, he said the sector should spend the next three weeks doing things ""that are necessary to make a success of the changes that are being offered to it"" with outdoor opening. Campsites, beauty salons and cinemas get open date Give pubs and cafes re-opening date, say unions Fear pubs 'will go bust' because of two-metre rule England has first night out since lockdown Scottish pubs and restaurants to reopen in July Reopening guidance for pubs and hotels published Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"This video can not be played Dame Vera's cortege halted as it passed through her home town of Ditchling Two Spitfires flew over the funeral procession of Dame Vera Lynn as family, friends and fans said goodbye to the Forces' Sweetheart. Her cortege was accompanied by the Battle of Britain flypast as it travelled through Ditchling in East Sussex at midday. Dame Vera died last month at the age of 103 and her funeral was held at Woodvale Crematorium in Brighton. The World War Two fighter planes made three passes over the village. Hundreds of people had gathered to await the arrival of the cortege and the crowd applauded as the aircraft flew over. Representatives from the Royal British Legion stood with flags as they waited to honour Dame Vera. Shops in the village displayed portraits of Dame Vera The funeral procession stopped at the crossroads in the centre of Ditchling, where the singer lived for 50 years, to allow people to pay their respects. Later, as the procession made its way out of the village, there were shouts of ""hip hip hooray"" from the crowd. The cheers were followed by a spontaneous rendition of We'll Meet Again, one of the songs Dame Vera was well-known for. A private service at the crematorium chapel included music from a bugler from the Royal Marines. The family said a full memorial service would be held at a later date. People applauded as the Battle of Britain flypast took place Dame Vera's daughter, Virginia Lewis-Jones, said Ditchling had always been special to her mother. ""That is why we know she would be touched that so many people want to pay their respects,"" she said. She also urged people to continue to back the causes that were important to her mother, adding: ""We are sure her music will endure forever but most importantly, we hope that people will continue to support those charities that she cared about so much. ""It means so much to us to see my mother's legacy living on."" Dame Vera performing for servicemen in 1940 Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted footage of the flypast, saying it has been ""a farewell befitting a truly great Briton"". Allow Twitter content?

Chief of Defence Staff Sir Nick Carter said the Armed Forces would be ""forever grateful"" to Dame Vera, adding: ""Her lasting legacy of lifting spirits will remain."" By Peter Whittlesea, BBC News The Spitfires made three passes over Ditchling as hundreds of people lined the streets Every lamppost in the narrow streets of Ditchling bears a large poppy. Union flags flutter in the breeze and shop windows display portraits of the woman who became known as the Forces' Sweetheart. Camera crews and photographers have descended on the village along with servicemen and women who have come to pay their respects. It is a fond farewell for Dame Vera. A picture of Dame Vera and a video were projected on to Dover's white cliffs ahead of her funeral. The lyrics of We'll Meet Again appeared as the music was played across the English Channel. The projection on the 350ft cliffs was visible to ships and planes and could also be seen from the main road and some back gardens.

"A representative of the Choctaw nation - one of the Five Tribes of Oklahoma central to the court ruling, who have welcomed the ruling The US Supreme Court has ruled about half of Oklahoma belongs to Native Americans, in a landmark case that also quashed a child rape conviction. The justices decided 5-4 that an eastern chunk of the state, including its second-biggest city, Tulsa, should be recognised as part of a reservation. Jimcy McGirt, who was convicted in 1997 of raping a girl, brought the case. He cited the historical claim of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation to the land where the assault occurred. Thursday's decision in McGirt v Oklahoma is seen as one of the most far-reaching cases for Native Americans before the highest US court in decades. The ruling means some tribe members found guilty in state courts for offences committed on the land at issue can now challenge their convictions. Only federal prosecutors will have the power to criminally prosecute Native Americans accused of crimes in the area. Tribe members who live within the boundaries may also be exempt from state taxes, according to Reuters news agency. Some 1.8 million people - of whom about 15% are Native American - live on the land, which spans three million acres. Justice Neil Gorsuch, a conservative appointed by US President Donald Trump, sided with the court's four liberals and also wrote the opinion. He referred to the Trail of Tears, the forcible 19th Century relocation of Native Americans, including the Creek Nation, to Oklahoma. This video can not be played A photo album that took 25 years to make The US government said at the time that the new land would belong to the tribes in perpetuity. Justice Gorsuch wrote: ""Today we are asked whether the land these treaties promised remains an Indian reservation for purposes of federal criminal law. ""Because Congress has not said otherwise, we hold the government to its word."" The ruling overturned McGirt's prison sentence. He could still, however, be tried in federal court. McGirt, now 71, was convicted in 1997 in Wagoner County of raping a four-year-old girl. This video can not be played What happened to Olivia Lone Bear? He did not dispute his guilt before the Supreme Court, but argued that only federal authorities should have been entitled to prosecute him. McGirt is a member of the Seminole Nation. His lawyer, Ian Heath Gershengorn, told CNBC,external: ""The Supreme Court reaffirmed today that when the United States makes promises, the courts will keep those promises."" In a dissenting opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts said the decision would destabilise the state's courts. He wrote: ""The State's ability to prosecute serious crimes will be hobbled and decades of past convictions could well be thrown out. ""The decision today creates significant uncertainty for the State's continuing authority over any area that touches Indian affairs, ranging from zoning and taxation to family and environmental law."" An analysis by The Atlantic magazine,externalof Oklahoma Department of Corrections records found that 1,887 Native Americans were in prison as of the end of last year for offences committed within the boundaries of the tribal territory. But fewer than one in 10 of those cases would qualify for a new federal trial, according to the research. This video can not be played Can indigenous wellness help heal historical trauma? Jonodev Chaudhuri, a former chief justice of the Muscogee Nation's Supreme Court, dismissed talk of legal mayhem. He told the Tulsa World newspaper,external: ""All the sky-is-falling narratives were dubious at best. ""This would only apply to a small subset of Native Americans committing crimes within the boundaries."" In a joint statement, the Five Tribes of Oklahoma - Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw and Seminole and Muscogee Nation - welcomed the ruling. They pledged to work with federal and state authorities to agree shared jurisdiction over the land. ""The Nations and the state are committed to implementing a framework of shared jurisdiction that will preserve sovereign interests and rights to self-government while affirming jurisdictional understandings, procedures, laws and regulations that support public safety, our economy and private property rights,"" the statement said.

"No new deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales have been announced for the second day this week, leaving the official total at 1,540 Pubs, cafes and restaurants will be able to open indoors from 3 August if virus cases continue to fall, the first minister has said They have already been cleared to open outdoor areas from next Monday, 13 July Campsites, hairdressers, beauty salons, cinemas and playgrounds in Wales are also to reopen in the next three weeks The county of Ceredigion, which avoided the brunt of Covid-19, balances the need to welcome back tourists while keeping people safe An intensive care doctor who recovered from coronavirus tells how his workplace resembles ""a scene from a science fiction film"" Catherine Evans and Gemma Ryall That's all from today's live page coverage, bringing you the latest developments on the coronavirus outbreak in Wales. The latest updates are:  Our live blog will be back on Monday - in the meantime you can keep up with all the latest on coronavirus via the BBC News website. If you're still not sure what will be happening and when with the easing of lockdown in Wales, this should help. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Wales' lockdown restrictions roadmap laid out More than 1,700 fines were handed out for lockdown breaches by Dyfed-Powys Police. Between 27 March,when fixed penalty notices were introduced, and 6 July, the force reported 1,710 people
for breaches of travel restrictions. Almost two thirds of these were
individuals who had travelled unnecessarily from outside the force area, with
the largest number of tickets being issued in Powys. In one weekend in May â when
strict travel restrictions were still in place across Wales - officers turned
away more than 1,000 cars from the area around Ystradfallte known as ""waterfall
country"". âOur officers have maintained a
consistent approach to engage with the public at every opportunity and explain
the regulations, with enforcement only as a last resort,â said deputy chief constable Claire Parmenter. âThis educational approach
became even more important as differences emerged between the rules around
travel in England and Wales."" The leader of Plaid Cymru says the ""increase in public freedom"" must be matched with a testing and tracing programme ""that is able to keep up with increased demand"". Adam Price MS said the Welsh Government was right to take acautious approach to easing lockdown. âWithout the ability to quickly stamp out any further outbreaks, this âearly warning systemâ is largely undermined and worse - weâll risk seeing a return to lockdown conditions,"" he said. âWe need a much clearer strategy for using the available testing capacity, and we need to speed up the turnaround of test results. We have previously called for universal testing of health and social care workers â a call which is backed up by BMA (British Medical Association) proposals."" He added that, as the tourist industry is reopened and travel increases, ""we have the mechanisms in place to not only gain the public confidence but to stop a resurgence of the virus"". But the work must be put in ""to strengthen this crucial protective shield,"" he said. A restaurant owner in north Wales says he ""won't be able to cash in"" on the start of the school holidays. Pubs, cafes, restaurants and barscan reopen indoors in Wales from 3 August, providing coronavirus cases continue to fall. Shibber Ahmed of the Blue Elephant restaurant in Llandudno  said: ""Itâs late, the school holidays have started and I think we wonât be able to cash in. ""The whole town is open - there are lots of people around but we are not able to take advantage of it and we desperately needed that to cover our winter costs. ""I was thinking it would be 20 July rather than 3 August [for reopening}, so for two weeks basically we are losing out. ""These two weeks are crucial because 20% of our business is during the school holidays."" Shibber Ahmed was hoping to open his restaurant two weeks sooner No new deaths of people with coronavirus have been reported in Wales for the second time this week. Tuesday was the first day since the outbreak began in March that no deaths in Wales were announced. The official total number of people who have diedremains at 1,540 according to Public Health Wales. This graph shows the daily number of deaths according to the day occurred, rather than the day they were announced. No new deaths of people with coronavirus in Wales have been reported in Wales for the second day this week. The official total from Public Health Wales remains at 1,540. This map shows the number of deaths in each health board area of Wales. It does not include residents of Powys who have died at hospitals over the border in England. There is ""no longer anxiety
about widespread community transmission of coronavirus around two north Wales
food plants, the first minister has said. There have been 634 confirmed Covid-19 cases at meat plants in Wales -283 at Rowan Foods in Wrexham, 134 at Kepak in Merthyr Tydfiland the 217 cases at 2 Sisters at Llangefni on Anglesey. Mark Drakeford said the latest
advice ""does indeed suggest that we are probably past the most concerning
time"" at Rowan Foods and 2 Sisters. On Rowan Foods, he said ministers
were hopeful that an update from the outbreak control team later today would ""confirm that the measures that we were looking to the company to
put in place have been put in place, and that it can continue to operate in
that new way"". Mr Drakeford said the
experience had shown the importance of accurate record-keeping for tracing
""when you are working with a population which is often drawn from countries
outside the United Kingdom"". ""Some of the people who we
have struggled the most to contact are people where names and addresses have
not been properly recorded, where the spelling of people's names is many and
various, where telephone numbers are not been properly transcribed,"" he
told the Welsh Government's daily coronavirus news conference. ""I think we've learned
something about being prepared to communicate in languages other than Welsh and
English. ""For some of the
workers at Rowan Foods being able to see information in their own language,
their native language, is important and we will be better prepared to do that
more quickly if we face a similar outbreak in the future."" Rowan Foods in Wrexham has seen 283 cases of coronavirus confirmed No new deaths of people with coronavirus have been reported in Wales for the second time this week. Tuesday was the first day since the outbreak began in March that no deaths in Wales were announced. The official total number of people who have diedremains at 1,540. Public Health Wales (PHW) figures also showed there were 10 new cases reported. The leader of the Conservative group in the Welsh Parliament has responsed to the latest lockdown easing plans by saying he was ""pleased to see the Welsh Government following our lead"". Paul Davies claimed the Labour-led administration had adopted six out of 10 proposals the Welsh Tories had outlined yesterday. He added: âWe are disappointed at the unnecessary delay in
implementing some of these changes so we see no reason why reopening campsites
and beauty salons, and restarting house viewings canât be brought forward. âAnd we are disappointed that thereâs still no clarity on
face coverings, relaxing social distancing, or driving tests and lessons in
Wales."" Pubs, cafes, restaurants and bars canreopen indoors in Wales from 3 August, providing coronavirus cases continue to fall. A series of reopening dates have also been announced for businesses includingcampsites, hairdressers, beauty salons and cinemas. Previous pledges on the reopening of self-contained accommodation and outdoor areas of pubs, cafes and restaurants have also been confirmed. First Minister Mark Drakeford said there was an anxiety among the public in Wales ""about going back to places
where they may feel that their health and wellbeing would not be safely looked
after"". Asked if the delay announcing a
date for indoor hospitality to reopen had risked thousands of jobs, he said the
sector should spend three weeks doing things ""that are necessary to make a
success of the changes that are being offered to it"" with outdoor opening. ""I'm sure they will focus on
what they can do, rather than focusing on what they can't do,"" Mr
Drakeford told journalists. ""And, in that way, they will
have a successful future still before them."" The Welsh Government's decision not to require people in Wales to wear coverings is not contradictory, according to the first minister. Mark Drakeford said the approach is about ""making different judgements about the balance of risks"". He said Wales' chief medical officer believes face coverings have ""at best, a marginal additional benefit in public health terms"". Mr Drakeford added: ""Nevertheless we continue to look at all the evidence. We continue to look at different contexts, some of which face coverings by members of the public may have advantages as part of an overall package. ""I hope to be able to say something about public transport in Wales on Monday of next week, where this issue has been most hotly debated. ""But nobody should think that wearing a face covering is somehow a way of absolving you from the responsibility to do all those other things which actually offer you greater protection from coronavirus in a face mask will ever do."" Businesses in Wales that are unable to maintain the two-metre social distancing rules will have ""to take a series of other mitigating measures"", according to the first minister. Mark Drakeford listed some examples, including the installation of protective shields, increased cleaning, marshals in outdoor hospitality venues and ""extra rules in relation to the policing of toilets"". ""Those practical things will have to be in place in order to make sure that people are still kept safe from a disease that hasn't gone away"", he added. But he said the ""two-metre rule remains the default position in Wales"". He said: ""If you are able to run a business taking all reasonable measures to sustain a two-metre distance that is what the law in Wales will require you to do. ""But we recognise that there will be some context and some business for whom that simply isn't practically possible and in those circumstances what the law in Wales will require is that those businesses will have to take a series of other mitigating measures."" Live coverage of today's coronavirus press briefing has now switched toBBC Two Wales. The body representing trade unions in Wales has welcomed a date for hospitality to reopen indoors. Wales TUC General Secretary
    Shavanah Taj said: ""Hospitality workers across Wales are concerned about their future
      employment prospects and anxious over job losses. ""Todayâs announcement
      will provide a level of certainty for the sector and help prevent future
      job losses."" She added: ""At the Wales TUC we support the Welsh Government's steady and
      evidence-driven approach. Workersâ safety must continue to be the top
      priority."" Ms Taj said personal protective equipment (PPE) and test and tracing were ""key to the success of reopening"". Pubs in Wales have all necessary guidance for reopening, says the first minister. Mark Drakeford said he did not agree that pubs have not had enough time to prepare to reopen outside from Monday. He added: âThis sector has had weeks to prepare for reopening outdoors, not three days. ""There is plenty of guidance out there for those intending to reopen.â Mr Drakeford has said specific guidance will be published which has been agreed and discussed âin great detailâ with the sector. âAny suggestion that the sector didnât know what needs to be done simply does not stand up to interrogation,â he said. Pubs, cafÃ©s and restaurants in Waleswill be able to open indoors from 3 August, providing cases of coronavirus continue to fall, First
Minister Mark Drakeford said today. The Welsh Government is
announcing a series of relaxations to the restrictions relating to the hospitality and tourism sector. âLooking at all the indicators together,
the Chief Medical Officer for Wales has confirmed we have some capacity to ease
the restrictions further over the next three weeks,â said Mr Drakeford. In
other changes: The law enforcing the 2m social
distancing rules will be altered to allow for the fact that some industries
like hairdressing will be unable to comply.   Other measures, including wearing masks, will be expected to be used
instead. Mr Drakeford said âa note of cautionâ
should be used, citing the example of Melbourne in Australia, which is
re-imposing a lockdown after a fresh spike in cases. Itâs understood ministers are still in discussions with gym and
leisure companies about the reopening of indoor gyms and swimming pools. A majority of Britonsfeel
uncomfortable at the prospect of eating at a restaurant,an Office for
National Statistics (ONS) survey suggests. Just over one in five of the 1,788 adults in England, Scotland and Wales asked said they would be happy to have a sit-down meal as restrictions ease. Some 60% said they would be uncomfortable or very uncomfortable eating indoors during the pandemic. It comes as the government prepares a Â£500m ""eat out to help out"" scheme. Meals eaten at participating restaurants on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays in Augustwill be subsidised up to Â£10 a head. Chancellor Rishi Sunak (centre) hopes his discount scheme will encourage people to visit restaurants First Minister Mark Drakeford is about to give the Welsh
Government's daily press briefing on how it's handling the coronavirus
situation. He is expected to confirm details of further easing of the
lockdown, withcampsites,
hairdressers, beauty salons, cinemas and playgrounds set to reopen in the next
three weeks. We'll update you with the main points here - you can also watch

"The government's LGBT Action Plan promised in 2018 it would ban 'conversion therapy' Instagram and parent company Facebook will block the promotion of ""conversion therapy"", which tries to change a person's sexuality or gender identity, the social media firm has told the BBC. Campaigners are urging the government to act now on a two-year-old promise to make the practice illegal. This year, 200,000 people have signed an online petition calling for action. All major UK therapy professional bodies and the NHS oppose it on logical, ethical and moral grounds. Luke, 23, is gay and a youth worker who was raised in a strict Christian family in north-west England. ""In school I had quite a feminine voice, and feminine behaviour, and I was bullied because of it,"" he told  the BBC. ""I guess my dad knew the potential gay signs before I did, because he would force me to do stereotypically boyish things, which I hated. He knew I hated sports, but he didn't care, as long as his boy seemed less gay."" At 13, Luke's dad saw his internet search history on the family computer, which included forums for gay teens and gay pornography. ""When my dad scrolled through, he was physically sick. He took me to my youth pastor's house. I had been attending his church since birth, and he had always been so nice to me, which probably made this worse, because I completely trusted him."" Luke says he was made to feel dirty and disgusting for liking boys. His deeply religious family was determined to use him as an example for his wider community. ""Over a couple of years, my family and the church team totally damaged me. Beatings, exorcisms, fasting, online courses, everything."" ""They told me I was born straight but I had been damaged by my parents divorcing. They would put their hands on my head and tell me how evil I am. They would ask me to describe how I felt when I saw a guy I fancied on TV. I said I felt excited but a bit naughty, and they'd say that they were feelings from the Devil."" ""The worst thing is, I was grateful for their torture. My only goal was to be straight like everyone else in the world. I would say thank you to them after they abused me."" The term ""conversion therapy"" refers to any form of treatment or psychotherapy which aims to change a person's sexual orientation or to suppress a person's gender identity. While some violent practices which may be classed as conversion therapy, such as ""corrective rape"", are already covered by existing criminal offences, many religious practices, such as those experienced by Luke, are not. Puberty eventually made Luke's voice lower and he became more reserved, but inside, he still ""felt gay"". After attempting to take his life, another of Luke's pastors encouraged a more lenient approach. Luke was told that ""gay temptation"" is not in his control, but ""gay behaviour"" is, so as long as he didn't act on his urges, he could ""live a normal life"". Luke eventually fled to London. He has never returned to his hometown, but his family has since apologised over Facebook. Crying, Luke said that speaking to the BBC about his experiences made him realise how awful his teenage years were. In 2018, the government announced that ""gay conversion therapies"" were to be banned as part of a government plan to improve the lives of gay and transgender people, but activists are still waiting for action. The government has since said it will ""consider all options for ending the practice"". The new president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Dr Adrian James, said: ""Any intervention purporting to 'treat' something which is not a disorder is wholly unethical and should be banned."" Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Tara Hopkins, EMEA public policy director, Instagram, said the company is changing the way it handles conversion therapy content. ""We don't allow attacks against people based on sexual orientation or gender identity and are updating our policies to ban the promotion of conversion therapy services."" She continued: ""We are always reviewing our policies and will continue to consult with experts and people with personal experiences to inform our approach."" Earlier this year, Facebook and Instagram banned the promotion of conversion therapy in ads, where people don't choose what they see. From Friday, any content linked to it will now be banned across both it and Facebook. The company stresses that it will take time to update all of its policies to reflect this blanket ban, so while some content that users flag may not immediately be removed, overtime that should change. In a letter to the government, seen by the BBC and signed by celebrities and charities, Ban Conversion Therapy calls for conversion therapy ""finally"" to be made illegal. Signatories include Dua Lipa, Elton John, Stephen Fry and Jade Thirlwall. The new organisation, started by friends Harry Hitchens and Matthew Hyndman, has already attracted thousands of views on social media and has been backed by Stonewall, Europe's largest LGBT charity. Since posting a now-viral post on Instagram about conversion therapy still being legal in the UK, Harry received personal threats and hate messages from groups who found his address. ""So many people didn't know that conversion therapy is still legal in the UK, and every time a celebrity shared my post, there was another 24 hours of hate."" ""I received messages like 'you should've hid your address better, [expletive], we're coming to get you'. I haven't had the energy to report any of it to the police yet. I just wanted to hide from it all."" Ban Conversion Therapy is a new organisation set up by Matthew Hyndman (left) and Harry Hitchens (right) Matthew says the motivations for starting his organisation stemmed from his own religious experiences and a near miss with ""conversion therapy"". ""I grew up in rural Northern Ireland. There was a great sense of community, and it was very religious. I was in complete denial that I was gay."" While working as a missionary, Matthew was outed as gay. After refusing to publicly confess his ""sins"" and go through ""counselling"" he was eventually told he could no longer be a member of his church. ""The church can be a wonderful place. They support people to do a lot of good in the world. No matter whether the reason is religious or otherwise, to counsel someone to change their sexuality or gender identity is wrong. The UN has declared conversion therapy as torture. Are we happy to condone torture?"" ""We are writing to urge you to introduce a truly effective ban on conversion therapy for all lesbian, gay, bi, trans and gender diverse people in the UK,"" Ban Conversion's letter states. ""Any form of counselling or persuading someone to change their sexual orientation or gender identity should be illegal, no matter the reason, religious or otherwise - whatever the person's age."" Rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner wants conversion therapy banned immediately However, some people who counsel LGBT people in a supportive environment are concerned that a blanket ban of conversion therapy could lead to issues. One therapist who spoke to the BBC is concerned that if the government does ban conversion therapy, they will not be able to treat their trans clients without fear of being arrested. The therapist, who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of ""losing"" their career, said their work helping trans individuals come to terms with their acquired gender is legal and encouraged them to get Gender Recognition Certificates but it could be classed by critics as ""conversion therapy"". ""Where do we draw the line? Everybody agrees that conversion therapy is bad, but nobody knows how to define it,"" said the therapist. Senior faith leader Rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner ""completely disagrees."" ""It's a lie to call it therapy. It's not - what we're talking about banning is brainwashing."" ""There is a clear distinction between a therapist saying 'let's work together to see what's best for you' and them saying: 'I think you should be this.'"" Rabbi Janner-Klausner is a member of the newly formed Inter-religious Advisory Board on LGBT for the Ozanne Foundation, which works with religious organisations around the world to eliminate discrimination based on sexuality or gender. ""From where I stand as a religious leader, conversion therapy needs to be banned immediately. Anyone within my religion practicing this is wrong, and needs to be stopped. I don't want a state that starts restricting people's prayer, that's frightening, but if someone misuses their authority to get someone else to change, that's an abuse of power.""

Wakefield Council said a number of residents at Urban House, in Love Lane, had tested positive for the virus, adding that those affected have been isolated and given treatment and support at another location.

""Being obese messes with your immune system,"" he tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""It's not just about reducing your risk of the nasty complications should you get the virus, it's also about ensuring the vaccine is going to work."" Dr Mosley says it's a ""fallacy"" that exercise is a good way of losing weight, however. ""Itâs great for all sorts of things - like improving your mood - but a pretty terrible way of losing weight because you have to do so much. It is about cutting calories and changing what youâre eating,"" he says. For more information visitthe NHS website,external. Zulfiqar AliBBC Reality Check Iran has seen a rapid surge in the numbers of coronavirus cases recently, with daily recorded deaths reaching new highs. In mid-June, daily reported deaths went above 100 - for the first time in two months. And since then, this figure has been going up, reaching 221 dead by 9 July. New reported infections averaged more than 3,000 a day in the first week of June - a 50% increase on the previous seven days. This figure reached a high of 3,574 on 4 June, before dropping slightly. There have been more than 2,000 cases a day since then. The epidemic was initially concentrated in Qom and the capital, Tehran. But now, a flare-up has been reported in the south-west, notably in Khuzestan province, an oil-rich region that borders Iraq. Officials have suggested the renewed surge in new cases could be down to more testing, and President Hassan Rouhani has said this means you will find more cases.

Ten accounts have been frozen so far, amounting to Â£553,305, as officers investigate and identify victims, London's Metropolitan Police says. Detectives launched an investigation after a routine drug search on a vehicle in Holland Park on 17 June. The officers found the vehicle's owner, a man in his early 20s, had travelled to meet a man in order to set up a bank account, for which he would be paid Â£300. Police identified the second man, who was in his late 40s, that he was due to meet and subsequently arrested both on suspicion of money laundering and fraud. The two men have since been released under investigation pending further enquiries. The number of new infection has risen by 228,102 during the last 24 hours, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) - a record increase. The biggest increases in cases were from the United States, Brazil, India and South Africa,the UN body said in its daily report.,external The previous WHO record for new cases was 212,326 on 4 July. More than 12.1 million cases have been reported by the WHO. Johns Hopkins University puts this figure at more than 12.3 million. The anonymous whistleblower said some factories had stayed open and taken on extra staff during the lockdown A whistleblower from Leicester's textile industry says some factories almost doubled their staffing to cope with online orders during the Covid-19 lockdown. The worker, who cannot be identified, said firms that ""maybe used to have 50 people working comfortably, now had 80 or 90 people in the same area"". A lockdownwas enforced in Leicester last month after a spike in coronavirus cases. ""If somebody did have Covid or wasn't well, they were still there passing it on to whoever's next to them,"" he said. ""During Covid we've had no social distancing whatsoever in the factories."" He said the situation had made already poor conditions worse: ""Very few factories, if any, have cleaners coming in and out."" Investigations are ongoing into employment practices at several firms. Read his full accounthere. BBC News Channel There has been a ""surge"" in the number of calls to Childline from children and young people during lockdown, the counselling service's founder Dame Esther Rantzen says. Children have found themselves ""imprisoned in families where frankly they were either very unhappy or even unsafe"", she tells BBC News. ""School had always been a refuge for them, they tell us, or maybe the extended family... and during the lockdown of course they couldn't escape."" Her comments come as the NSPCC said a record number of people contacted its helpline with child welfare concerns in May, up roughly a third from pre-lockdown levels. More than 22,000 adults contacted the charity from April to June, with May seeing the highest number of contacts on record at 8,287. The government says it has provided Â£1.6 million to the NSPCC to expand and promote their helpline during the pandemic. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has spoken about theUK's decision to opt out of the EU Covid-19 vaccine scheme. He told Times Radio that signing up to the EU programme would have meant abandoning Britain's own procurement schemes, which were more developed. He said Britain would not have been allowed to ""have a say"" in ""the vaccines that were procured, the price, [or] the quantity of the delivery schedule"". He added that one of the ""conditions"" of the EU's scheme was that Britain would have had to stop its ""own negotiations and only do them through the European Commission, and we weren't prepared to do that"". He insisted: ""We think we will go faster this way."" Millions of pints of beer have gone off in pub cellars sincebusinesses were forced to shut in March due to the coronavirus lockdown. Now pubs and bars have to apply for permission to pour beer down drains. Water companies say they have been inundated with requests. Severn Trent has given consent for 3.5 million litres to be disposed of, while Thames Water has allowed three million. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) estimated in May that 70 million pints would be lost due to Covid-19. Emma McClarkin, from the BBPA, said: ""The need to destroy so much beer really shows how much our brewing and pub sectors have been affected by this crisis.""  UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged Britons to go back to work if they can, in a change of position. Speaking earlier during an online session of People's PMQs, Mr Johnson said it was ""very important"" people go back to work now ""if they can"", adding he wanted the public to do this as ""carefully as possible"". He said the public had followed the government's earlier mantra to ""stay at home if you can"", but it was now time they followed the message of ""go back to work if you can"". He said it was ""very important"" people try to live their lives ""more normally"" and for people to feel ""confident"" to go to shops, restaurants and back to work, provided ""we all follow the guidance"". Sir Tim Barrow, the UK's Ambassador to the European Union, has confirmed that the UK has decided not to join the EU scheme for Covid-19 vaccine procurement. In a letter to the Secretary-General of the European Commission, he said the UK would not participate because it ""would be required to stop its negotiations with manufacturers with which the EU launched negotiations"" and because the Commission said ""it is not possible for the UK to have a role in the governance shaping decisions on which manufacturers to negotiate with, or the price, volume and delivery schedule negotiated"". Sir Tim went on to write that there could still be collaboration between the UK and the EU on areas such as ""sharing of information on promising vaccine candidates"" and ""vaccine trials"" and ""manufacturing investments and capacity building"". Francesca GillettBBC News Olivia McDermott with her son Elijah ""It's been a weird feeling to know she technically doesn't exist,"" says Emma Pratt. Her newborn daughter, Skye, was born the week before lockdown began. She is now almost four months old, but her birth still hasn't been registered. Normally, babies have to be registered with the local council within 42 days of being born, or 21 days in Scotland. But during the coronavirus lockdown, many councils paused all birth registrations - and are only now starting up again. It means they're faced withbacklogs of thousands of babies to register. For parents, it can cause practical problems too. For new mum Olivia McDermott, 24, not being able to register her son Elijah's birth could have scuppered her future career. Without a birth certificate, she could not apply for a childcare grant, and without the grant she said she would not be able to continue her training to become a nurse. ""Goodbye, dream job,"" says Ms McDermott, from Leeds. ""I'm meant to be going into my final year of training. I was just like, I won't be able to come in."" She eventually got an appointment and registered her son on Wednesday. ""Now I'm able to register him I'm feeling a lot better,"" she says. Read more. It's understood the government's looking at whether to make face coverings mandatory in shops in England. Senior government sources said that while no decision has yet been made it's an issue that's being kept under review. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told an online session of ""People's PMQs"" on Friday: ""We need to be stricter in insisting that people wear face coverings in confined places where they are meeting people that they don't normally meet. ""So that's why it's mandatory already on on public transport and we're looking at ways of making sure that people really do observe, but you do have face coverings in, in, in, in shops for instance where, you know, there is a risk of transmission."" James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Yes. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant in pools and can easily disable viruses, including coronavirus, as well as more resilient bugs such as bacteria. The chemical has to be used at the right concentration, but this will be standard practice. There are two infection risks in the pool - other swimmers themselves and water they may have contaminated. Sage, the governmentâs science advisers, say the risk of catching the virus through water is ""negligible"". But being within 2m of other swimmers - perhaps when catching your breath in the shallow end - is a bigger risk. Remember the risks are about more than just the pool. Coronavirus is spread through close contact, so beware in a cramped changing room. And it can linger on surfaces such as lockers, benches, shower buttons and taps. The number of confirmed coronavirus infections in Russia has increased by 6,635 over the past 24 hours, officials say. It brings the total number of cases in the country to 713,936, Russia's coronavirus crisis response centre said. Over the same period, an additional 174 deaths were recorded, bringing the number of fatalities to 11,017, the centre added. Russia has also today reported year-on-year figures for deaths in the country for the month of May. Rosstat, the state statistics agency, said 18,375 more deaths were reported this year, of which it said 7,444 cases were directly attributed to Covid-19. More news on face coverings - Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called on the government to make face coverings mandatory in busy and enclosed public places. In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Sadiq Khan said he was ""frustrated"" the measures had not already been introduced. It was announced on 15 Juneanyone travelling on public transport in England must wear a face covering. However, Mr Khan said precautions needed to be implemented in shops and hairdressers. As pubs, gyms and restaurants reopen across England, the mayor said face coverings are ""vital for public health"" and ""could play an increasing role in supporting public confidence and our economic recovery"". He said: ""The widespread use of face coverings are a visible signal that Londoners are willing to take the steps needed to keep each other safe. ""They show how seriously, as a society, we are treating the threat of coronavirus and they are a physical reminder that the virus is still out there,"" he added. Reality Check The UK government is expected to
confirm later whether it will opt out of an EU scheme to secure potential
Covid-19 vaccine supplies. The EU has launched other schemes,
during the pandemic, to secure things like testing kits and personal protective
equipment (PPE) - negotiating with suppliers on behalf of EU member states. The UK was allowed to join these
(because it is still in a transition period with the EU)but chose not to,external. So, how are the schemes getting on? The European Commission says its

order for 55 ventilators is expected to be delivered by the end of July. Luxembourg

"A representative of the Choctaw nation - one of the Five Tribes of Oklahoma central to the court ruling, who have welcomed the ruling The US Supreme Court has ruled about half of Oklahoma belongs to Native Americans, in a landmark case that also quashed a child rape conviction. The justices decided 5-4 that an eastern chunk of the state, including its second-biggest city, Tulsa, should be recognised as part of a reservation. Jimcy McGirt, who was convicted in 1997 of raping a girl, brought the case. He cited the historical claim of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation to the land where the assault occurred. Thursday's decision in McGirt v Oklahoma is seen as one of the most far-reaching cases for Native Americans before the highest US court in decades. The ruling means some tribe members found guilty in state courts for offences committed on the land at issue can now challenge their convictions. Only federal prosecutors will have the power to criminally prosecute Native Americans accused of crimes in the area. Tribe members who live within the boundaries may also be exempt from state taxes, according to Reuters news agency. Some 1.8 million people - of whom about 15% are Native American - live on the land, which spans three million acres. Justice Neil Gorsuch, a conservative appointed by US President Donald Trump, sided with the court's four liberals and also wrote the opinion. He referred to the Trail of Tears, the forcible 19th Century relocation of Native Americans, including the Creek Nation, to Oklahoma. This video can not be played A photo album that took 25 years to make The US government said at the time that the new land would belong to the tribes in perpetuity. Justice Gorsuch wrote: ""Today we are asked whether the land these treaties promised remains an Indian reservation for purposes of federal criminal law. ""Because Congress has not said otherwise, we hold the government to its word."" The ruling overturned McGirt's prison sentence. He could still, however, be tried in federal court. McGirt, now 71, was convicted in 1997 in Wagoner County of raping a four-year-old girl. This video can not be played What happened to Olivia Lone Bear? He did not dispute his guilt before the Supreme Court, but argued that only federal authorities should have been entitled to prosecute him. McGirt is a member of the Seminole Nation. His lawyer, Ian Heath Gershengorn, told CNBC,external: ""The Supreme Court reaffirmed today that when the United States makes promises, the courts will keep those promises."" In a dissenting opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts said the decision would destabilise the state's courts. He wrote: ""The State's ability to prosecute serious crimes will be hobbled and decades of past convictions could well be thrown out. ""The decision today creates significant uncertainty for the State's continuing authority over any area that touches Indian affairs, ranging from zoning and taxation to family and environmental law."" An analysis by The Atlantic magazine,externalof Oklahoma Department of Corrections records found that 1,887 Native Americans were in prison as of the end of last year for offences committed within the boundaries of the tribal territory. But fewer than one in 10 of those cases would qualify for a new federal trial, according to the research. This video can not be played Can indigenous wellness help heal historical trauma? Jonodev Chaudhuri, a former chief justice of the Muscogee Nation's Supreme Court, dismissed talk of legal mayhem. He told the Tulsa World newspaper,external: ""All the sky-is-falling narratives were dubious at best. ""This would only apply to a small subset of Native Americans committing crimes within the boundaries."" In a joint statement, the Five Tribes of Oklahoma - Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw and Seminole and Muscogee Nation - welcomed the ruling. They pledged to work with federal and state authorities to agree shared jurisdiction over the land. ""The Nations and the state are committed to implementing a framework of shared jurisdiction that will preserve sovereign interests and rights to self-government while affirming jurisdictional understandings, procedures, laws and regulations that support public safety, our economy and private property rights,"" the statement said.

"The government's LGBT Action Plan promised in 2018 it would ban 'conversion therapy' Instagram and parent company Facebook will block the promotion of ""conversion therapy"", which tries to change a person's sexuality or gender identity, the social media firm has told the BBC. Campaigners are urging the government to act now on a two-year-old promise to make the practice illegal. This year, 200,000 people have signed an online petition calling for action. All major UK therapy professional bodies and the NHS oppose it on logical, ethical and moral grounds. Luke, 23, is gay and a youth worker who was raised in a strict Christian family in north-west England. ""In school I had quite a feminine voice, and feminine behaviour, and I was bullied because of it,"" he told  the BBC. ""I guess my dad knew the potential gay signs before I did, because he would force me to do stereotypically boyish things, which I hated. He knew I hated sports, but he didn't care, as long as his boy seemed less gay."" At 13, Luke's dad saw his internet search history on the family computer, which included forums for gay teens and gay pornography. ""When my dad scrolled through, he was physically sick. He took me to my youth pastor's house. I had been attending his church since birth, and he had always been so nice to me, which probably made this worse, because I completely trusted him."" Luke says he was made to feel dirty and disgusting for liking boys. His deeply religious family was determined to use him as an example for his wider community. ""Over a couple of years, my family and the church team totally damaged me. Beatings, exorcisms, fasting, online courses, everything."" ""They told me I was born straight but I had been damaged by my parents divorcing. They would put their hands on my head and tell me how evil I am. They would ask me to describe how I felt when I saw a guy I fancied on TV. I said I felt excited but a bit naughty, and they'd say that they were feelings from the Devil."" ""The worst thing is, I was grateful for their torture. My only goal was to be straight like everyone else in the world. I would say thank you to them after they abused me."" The term ""conversion therapy"" refers to any form of treatment or psychotherapy which aims to change a person's sexual orientation or to suppress a person's gender identity. While some violent practices which may be classed as conversion therapy, such as ""corrective rape"", are already covered by existing criminal offences, many religious practices, such as those experienced by Luke, are not. Puberty eventually made Luke's voice lower and he became more reserved, but inside, he still ""felt gay"". After attempting to take his life, another of Luke's pastors encouraged a more lenient approach. Luke was told that ""gay temptation"" is not in his control, but ""gay behaviour"" is, so as long as he didn't act on his urges, he could ""live a normal life"". Luke eventually fled to London. He has never returned to his hometown, but his family has since apologised over Facebook. Crying, Luke said that speaking to the BBC about his experiences made him realise how awful his teenage years were. In 2018, the government announced that ""gay conversion therapies"" were to be banned as part of a government plan to improve the lives of gay and transgender people, but activists are still waiting for action. The government has since said it will ""consider all options for ending the practice"". The new president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Dr Adrian James, said: ""Any intervention purporting to 'treat' something which is not a disorder is wholly unethical and should be banned."" Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Tara Hopkins, EMEA public policy director, Instagram, said the company is changing the way it handles conversion therapy content. ""We don't allow attacks against people based on sexual orientation or gender identity and are updating our policies to ban the promotion of conversion therapy services."" She continued: ""We are always reviewing our policies and will continue to consult with experts and people with personal experiences to inform our approach."" Earlier this year, Facebook and Instagram banned the promotion of conversion therapy in ads, where people don't choose what they see. From Friday, any content linked to it will now be banned across both it and Facebook. The company stresses that it will take time to update all of its policies to reflect this blanket ban, so while some content that users flag may not immediately be removed, overtime that should change. In a letter to the government, seen by the BBC and signed by celebrities and charities, Ban Conversion Therapy calls for conversion therapy ""finally"" to be made illegal. Signatories include Dua Lipa, Elton John, Stephen Fry and Jade Thirlwall. The new organisation, started by friends Harry Hitchens and Matthew Hyndman, has already attracted thousands of views on social media and has been backed by Stonewall, Europe's largest LGBT charity. Since posting a now-viral post on Instagram about conversion therapy still being legal in the UK, Harry received personal threats and hate messages from groups who found his address. ""So many people didn't know that conversion therapy is still legal in the UK, and every time a celebrity shared my post, there was another 24 hours of hate."" ""I received messages like 'you should've hid your address better, [expletive], we're coming to get you'. I haven't had the energy to report any of it to the police yet. I just wanted to hide from it all."" Ban Conversion Therapy is a new organisation set up by Matthew Hyndman (left) and Harry Hitchens (right) Matthew says the motivations for starting his organisation stemmed from his own religious experiences and a near miss with ""conversion therapy"". ""I grew up in rural Northern Ireland. There was a great sense of community, and it was very religious. I was in complete denial that I was gay."" While working as a missionary, Matthew was outed as gay. After refusing to publicly confess his ""sins"" and go through ""counselling"" he was eventually told he could no longer be a member of his church. ""The church can be a wonderful place. They support people to do a lot of good in the world. No matter whether the reason is religious or otherwise, to counsel someone to change their sexuality or gender identity is wrong. The UN has declared conversion therapy as torture. Are we happy to condone torture?"" ""We are writing to urge you to introduce a truly effective ban on conversion therapy for all lesbian, gay, bi, trans and gender diverse people in the UK,"" Ban Conversion's letter states. ""Any form of counselling or persuading someone to change their sexual orientation or gender identity should be illegal, no matter the reason, religious or otherwise - whatever the person's age."" Rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner wants conversion therapy banned immediately However, some people who counsel LGBT people in a supportive environment are concerned that a blanket ban of conversion therapy could lead to issues. One therapist who spoke to the BBC is concerned that if the government does ban conversion therapy, they will not be able to treat their trans clients without fear of being arrested. The therapist, who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of ""losing"" their career, said their work helping trans individuals come to terms with their acquired gender is legal and encouraged them to get Gender Recognition Certificates but it could be classed by critics as ""conversion therapy"". ""Where do we draw the line? Everybody agrees that conversion therapy is bad, but nobody knows how to define it,"" said the therapist. Senior faith leader Rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner ""completely disagrees."" ""It's a lie to call it therapy. It's not - what we're talking about banning is brainwashing."" ""There is a clear distinction between a therapist saying 'let's work together to see what's best for you' and them saying: 'I think you should be this.'"" Rabbi Janner-Klausner is a member of the newly formed Inter-religious Advisory Board on LGBT for the Ozanne Foundation, which works with religious organisations around the world to eliminate discrimination based on sexuality or gender. ""From where I stand as a religious leader, conversion therapy needs to be banned immediately. Anyone within my religion practicing this is wrong, and needs to be stopped. I don't want a state that starts restricting people's prayer, that's frightening, but if someone misuses their authority to get someone else to change, that's an abuse of power.""

"The Downie sisters are both current members of the GB gymnastics squad British Olympians Becky and Ellie Downie say abusive behaviour in gymnastics training became ""ingrained"" and ""completely normalised"". It comes after several gymnasts told BBC Sport aboutwhat they called a ""culture of fear""within the ""mentally and emotionally abusive"" sport. The Downies said they had previously been afraid to speak out. ""We certainly didn't realise how wrong it was at the time,"" they said. The World Championship medallists, both current members of the GB squad, added in a statement onTwitter,external: ""It's taken years and years to understand and come to terms with it. ""While exact experiences obviously vary, we both recognise the environment of fear and mental abuse those before us have described so bravely. ""For too long, the health and wellbeing of young girls has been of secondary importance to a dated, cruel, and - we'd argue - often ineffective culture within women's gymnastics training."" On Tuesday, British Gymnastics announced an independent review will take place following allegations of mistreatment from a number of athletes in recent days. The governing body told BBC Sport on Thursday: ""The behaviours we have heard about in recent days are completely contrary to our standards of safe coaching and have no place in our sport. ""It is clear that gymnasts did not feel they could raise their concerns to British Gymnastics and it is vital that an Independent Review helps us better understand why so we can remove any barriers as quickly as possible. ""This review will ensure that all those with concerns about safeguarding and abuse have the correct and proper channel to raise any issues."" Ellie Downie, 20, says she has been made to feel ""ashamed"" of her weight for almost all of her career, and to this day ""still hides food"". ""This never-ending focus on my weight has left deep scars which will never be healed, I suspect,"" she said. ""After a deep emotional battle, I've finally found a place to be happy with my body outside of the gym, but I'll always feel overweight whenever I'm in a gymnastics setting. ""We've seen too many girls descend into eating disorders and mental health problems because of this, and while this is changing, there is still a culture of less is best."" Her older sister Becky, 28, said it is only over the last few years that she has felt strong enough to ""stand up for herself"", adding that they are ""no longer routinely weighed"". They say they have raised their concerns and shared their experiences with British Gymnastics. ""We're speaking out now, just a year before the peak of our sport, the Olympic Games, because we have a duty to the wellbeing of the young children coming into gymnastics, and their safety is more important than any Olympic medal."" They added: ""We hope by speaking up today, we'll not only support those who have already done so, but also encourage others who may want to, but have so far felt unable to do so. ""We'll do everything in our power to see the sport showcase itself for what it should be: a place for boys and girls to have fun, be healthy and take it as far as they want to on their own terms."" The BBC has learned that UK Sport knew of allegations of abuse in gymnastics as recently as summer 2019. After several gymnasts spoke out earlier this week, UK Sport, which funds Olympic sports in the UK, responded saying the allegations were ""shocking and upsetting"". But the BBC has seen emails from last year in which two different parents separately emailed UK Sport's Head of Integrity in June and July 2019 regarding different allegations around safeguarding and alleged abuse. A face-to-face meeting was due to take place between the head of integrity and one parent - but was later cancelled by UK Sport. That parent said in an email: ""I still hope that one day someone will finally listen and prioritise the welfare of children over medals. Perhaps you will be that person?"" A spokesperson for UK Sport told the BBC: ""There is absolutely no place in sport for abuse or bullying of any description. ""It is important to note that UK Sport doesn't have the authority to intervene in employment matters within a sport, but we are absolutely committed to draw on all available measures to ensure that the high performance system is a safe environment for all athletes.""

Anna Hartley, Wakefield Councilâs director of public health, said: âA mobile testing unit is being set up at the site and weâre continuing to work closely with Mears Group, the Home Office and Public Health England to help limit any further potential spread. âPlease be reassured that the risk to those in the local area is very low, however, we ask everyone to please continue to follow government guidance on regular handwashing and social distancing to help keep yourself and others safe.""

Zulfiqar AliBBC Reality Check Iran has seen a rapid surge in the numbers of coronavirus cases recently, with daily recorded deaths reaching new highs. In mid-June, daily reported deaths went above 100 - for the first time in two months. And since then, this figure has been going up, reaching 221 dead by 9 July. New reported infections averaged more than 3,000 a day in the first week of June - a 50% increase on the previous seven days. This figure reached a high of 3,574 on 4 June, before dropping slightly. There have been more than 2,000 cases a day since then. The epidemic was initially concentrated in Qom and the capital, Tehran. But now, a flare-up has been reported in the south-west, notably in Khuzestan province, an oil-rich region that borders Iraq. Officials have suggested the renewed surge in new cases could be down to more testing, and President Hassan Rouhani has said this means you will find more cases.

BBC News Channel There has been a ""surge"" in the number of calls to Childline from children and young people during lockdown, the counselling service's founder Dame Esther Rantzen says. Children have found themselves ""imprisoned in families where frankly they were either very unhappy or even unsafe"", she tells BBC News. ""School had always been a refuge for them, they tell us, or maybe the extended family... and during the lockdown of course they couldn't escape."" Her comments come as the NSPCC said a record number of people contacted its helpline with child welfare concerns in May, up roughly a third from pre-lockdown levels. More than 22,000 adults contacted the charity from April to June, with May seeing the highest number of contacts on record at 8,287. The government says it has provided Â£1.6 million to the NSPCC to expand and promote their helpline during the pandemic. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has spoken about theUK's decision to opt out of the EU Covid-19 vaccine scheme. He told Times Radio that signing up to the EU programme would have meant abandoning Britain's own procurement schemes, which were more developed. He said Britain would not have been allowed to ""have a say"" in ""the vaccines that were procured, the price, [or] the quantity of the delivery schedule"". He added that one of the ""conditions"" of the EU's scheme was that Britain would have had to stop its ""own negotiations and only do them through the European Commission, and we weren't prepared to do that"". He insisted: ""We think we will go faster this way."" Millions of pints of beer have gone off in pub cellars sincebusinesses were forced to shut in March due to the coronavirus lockdown. Now pubs and bars have to apply for permission to pour beer down drains. Water companies say they have been inundated with requests. Severn Trent has given consent for 3.5 million litres to be disposed of, while Thames Water has allowed three million. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) estimated in May that 70 million pints would be lost due to Covid-19. Emma McClarkin, from the BBPA, said: ""The need to destroy so much beer really shows how much our brewing and pub sectors have been affected by this crisis.""  UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged Britons to go back to work if they can, in a change of position. Speaking earlier during an online session of People's PMQs, Mr Johnson said it was ""very important"" people go back to work now ""if they can"", adding he wanted the public to do this as ""carefully as possible"". He said the public had followed the government's earlier mantra to ""stay at home if you can"", but it was now time they followed the message of ""go back to work if you can"". He said it was ""very important"" people try to live their lives ""more normally"" and for people to feel ""confident"" to go to shops, restaurants and back to work, provided ""we all follow the guidance"". Sir Tim Barrow, the UK's Ambassador to the European Union, has confirmed that the UK has decided not to join the EU scheme for Covid-19 vaccine procurement. In a letter to the Secretary-General of the European Commission, he said the UK would not participate because it ""would be required to stop its negotiations with manufacturers with which the EU launched negotiations"" and because the Commission said ""it is not possible for the UK to have a role in the governance shaping decisions on which manufacturers to negotiate with, or the price, volume and delivery schedule negotiated"". Sir Tim went on to write that there could still be collaboration between the UK and the EU on areas such as ""sharing of information on promising vaccine candidates"" and ""vaccine trials"" and ""manufacturing investments and capacity building"". Francesca GillettBBC News Olivia McDermott with her son Elijah ""It's been a weird feeling to know she technically doesn't exist,"" says Emma Pratt. Her newborn daughter, Skye, was born the week before lockdown began. She is now almost four months old, but her birth still hasn't been registered. Normally, babies have to be registered with the local council within 42 days of being born, or 21 days in Scotland. But during the coronavirus lockdown, many councils paused all birth registrations - and are only now starting up again. It means they're faced withbacklogs of thousands of babies to register. For parents, it can cause practical problems too. For new mum Olivia McDermott, 24, not being able to register her son Elijah's birth could have scuppered her future career. Without a birth certificate, she could not apply for a childcare grant, and without the grant she said she would not be able to continue her training to become a nurse. ""Goodbye, dream job,"" says Ms McDermott, from Leeds. ""I'm meant to be going into my final year of training. I was just like, I won't be able to come in."" She eventually got an appointment and registered her son on Wednesday. ""Now I'm able to register him I'm feeling a lot better,"" she says. Read more. It's understood the government's looking at whether to make face coverings mandatory in shops in England. Senior government sources said that while no decision has yet been made it's an issue that's being kept under review. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told an online session of ""People's PMQs"" on Friday: ""We need to be stricter in insisting that people wear face coverings in confined places where they are meeting people that they don't normally meet. ""So that's why it's mandatory already on on public transport and we're looking at ways of making sure that people really do observe, but you do have face coverings in, in, in, in shops for instance where, you know, there is a risk of transmission."" James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Yes. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant in pools and can easily disable viruses, including coronavirus, as well as more resilient bugs such as bacteria. The chemical has to be used at the right concentration, but this will be standard practice. There are two infection risks in the pool - other swimmers themselves and water they may have contaminated. Sage, the governmentâs science advisers, say the risk of catching the virus through water is ""negligible"". But being within 2m of other swimmers - perhaps when catching your breath in the shallow end - is a bigger risk. Remember the risks are about more than just the pool. Coronavirus is spread through close contact, so beware in a cramped changing room. And it can linger on surfaces such as lockers, benches, shower buttons and taps. The number of confirmed coronavirus infections in Russia has increased by 6,635 over the past 24 hours, officials say.

More news on face coverings - Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called on the government to make face coverings mandatory in busy and enclosed public places. In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Sadiq Khan said he was ""frustrated"" the measures had not already been introduced. It was announced on 15 Juneanyone travelling on public transport in England must wear a face covering. However, Mr Khan said precautions needed to be implemented in shops and hairdressers. As pubs, gyms and restaurants reopen across England, the mayor said face coverings are ""vital for public health"" and ""could play an increasing role in supporting public confidence and our economic recovery"". He said: ""The widespread use of face coverings are a visible signal that Londoners are willing to take the steps needed to keep each other safe. ""They show how seriously, as a society, we are treating the threat of coronavirus and they are a physical reminder that the virus is still out there,"" he added. Reality Check The UK government is expected to
confirm later whether it will opt out of an EU scheme to secure potential
Covid-19 vaccine supplies. The EU has launched other schemes,
during the pandemic, to secure things like testing kits and personal protective
equipment (PPE) - negotiating with suppliers on behalf of EU member states. The UK was allowed to join these

""Being obese messes with your immune system,"" he tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""It's not just about reducing your risk of the nasty complications should you get the virus, it's also about ensuring the vaccine is going to work."" Dr Mosley says it's a ""fallacy"" that exercise is a good way of losing weight, however.

It is about cutting calories and changing what youâre eating,"" he says. For more information visitthe NHS website,external. Zulfiqar AliBBC Reality Check Iran has seen a rapid surge in the numbers of coronavirus cases recently, with daily recorded deaths reaching new highs. In mid-June, daily reported deaths went above 100 - for the first time in two months. And since then, this figure has been going up, reaching 221 dead by 9 July. New reported infections averaged more than 3,000 a day in the first week of June - a 50% increase on the previous seven days. This figure reached a high of 3,574 on 4 June, before dropping slightly. There have been more than 2,000 cases a day since then. The epidemic was initially concentrated in Qom and the capital, Tehran. But now, a flare-up has been reported in the south-west, notably in Khuzestan province, an oil-rich region that borders Iraq. Officials have suggested the renewed surge in new cases could be down to more testing, and President Hassan Rouhani has said this means you will find more cases.

Ten accounts have been frozen so far, amounting to Â£553,305, as officers investigate and identify victims, London's Metropolitan Police says. Detectives launched an investigation after a routine drug search on a vehicle in Holland Park on 17 June. The officers found the vehicle's owner, a man in his early 20s, had travelled to meet a man in order to set up a bank account, for which he would be paid Â£300. Police identified the second man, who was in his late 40s, that he was due to meet and subsequently arrested both on suspicion of money laundering and fraud. The two men have since been released under investigation pending further enquiries. The number of new infection has risen by 228,102 during the last 24 hours, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) - a record increase.

The anonymous whistleblower said some factories had stayed open and taken on extra staff during the lockdown A whistleblower from Leicester's textile industry says some factories almost doubled their staffing to cope with online orders during the Covid-19 lockdown. The worker, who cannot be identified, said firms that ""maybe used to have 50 people working comfortably, now had 80 or 90 people in the same area"". A lockdownwas enforced in Leicester last month after a spike in coronavirus cases. ""If somebody did have Covid or wasn't well, they were still there passing it on to whoever's next to them,"" he said. ""During Covid we've had no social distancing whatsoever in the factories."" He said the situation had made already poor conditions worse: ""Very few factories, if any, have cleaners coming in and out."" Investigations are ongoing into employment practices at several firms. Read his full accounthere. BBC News Channel There has been a ""surge"" in the number of calls to Childline from children and young people during lockdown, the counselling service's founder Dame Esther Rantzen says. Children have found themselves ""imprisoned in families where frankly they were either very unhappy or even unsafe"", she tells BBC News. ""School had always been a refuge for them, they tell us, or maybe the extended family... and during the lockdown of course they couldn't escape."" Her comments come as the NSPCC said a record number of people contacted its helpline with child welfare concerns in May, up roughly a third from pre-lockdown levels. More than 22,000 adults contacted the charity from April to June, with May seeing the highest number of contacts on record at 8,287. The government says it has provided Â£1.6 million to the NSPCC to expand and promote their helpline during the pandemic. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has spoken about theUK's decision to opt out of the EU Covid-19 vaccine scheme. He told Times Radio that signing up to the EU programme would have meant abandoning Britain's own procurement schemes, which were more developed. He said Britain would not have been allowed to ""have a say"" in ""the vaccines that were procured, the price, [or] the quantity of the delivery schedule"". He added that one of the ""conditions"" of the EU's scheme was that Britain would have had to stop its ""own negotiations and only do them through the European Commission, and we weren't prepared to do that"". He insisted: ""We think we will go faster this way."" Millions of pints of beer have gone off in pub cellars sincebusinesses were forced to shut in March due to the coronavirus lockdown. Now pubs and bars have to apply for permission to pour beer down drains. Water companies say they have been inundated with requests. Severn Trent has given consent for 3.5 million litres to be disposed of, while Thames Water has allowed three million. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) estimated in May that 70 million pints would be lost due to Covid-19. Emma McClarkin, from the BBPA, said: ""The need to destroy so much beer really shows how much our brewing and pub sectors have been affected by this crisis.""  UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged Britons to go back to work if they can, in a change of position. Speaking earlier during an online session of People's PMQs, Mr Johnson said it was ""very important"" people go back to work now ""if they can"", adding he wanted the public to do this as ""carefully as possible"". He said the public had followed the government's earlier mantra to ""stay at home if you can"", but it was now time they followed the message of ""go back to work if you can"". He said it was ""very important"" people try to live their lives ""more normally"" and for people to feel ""confident"" to go to shops, restaurants and back to work, provided ""we all follow the guidance"". Sir Tim Barrow, the UK's Ambassador to the European Union, has confirmed that the UK has decided not to join the EU scheme for Covid-19 vaccine procurement. In a letter to the Secretary-General of the European Commission, he said the UK would not participate because it ""would be required to stop its negotiations with manufacturers with which the EU launched negotiations"" and because the Commission said ""it is not possible for the UK to have a role in the governance shaping decisions on which manufacturers to negotiate with, or the price, volume and delivery schedule negotiated"". Sir Tim went on to write that there could still be collaboration between the UK and the EU on areas such as ""sharing of information on promising vaccine candidates"" and ""vaccine trials"" and ""manufacturing investments and capacity building"". Francesca GillettBBC News Olivia McDermott with her son Elijah ""It's been a weird feeling to know she technically doesn't exist,"" says Emma Pratt. Her newborn daughter, Skye, was born the week before lockdown began. She is now almost four months old, but her birth still hasn't been registered. Normally, babies have to be registered with the local council within 42 days of being born, or 21 days in Scotland. But during the coronavirus lockdown, many councils paused all birth registrations - and are only now starting up again. It means they're faced withbacklogs of thousands of babies to register. For parents, it can cause practical problems too. For new mum Olivia McDermott, 24, not being able to register her son Elijah's birth could have scuppered her future career. Without a birth certificate, she could not apply for a childcare grant, and without the grant she said she would not be able to continue her training to become a nurse. ""Goodbye, dream job,"" says Ms McDermott, from Leeds. ""I'm meant to be going into my final year of training. I was just like, I won't be able to come in."" She eventually got an appointment and registered her son on Wednesday. ""Now I'm able to register him I'm feeling a lot better,"" she says. Read more. It's understood the government's looking at whether to make face coverings mandatory in shops in England. Senior government sources said that while no decision has yet been made it's an issue that's being kept under review. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told an online session of ""People's PMQs"" on Friday: ""We need to be stricter in insisting that people wear face coverings in confined places where they are meeting people that they don't normally meet. ""So that's why it's mandatory already on on public transport and we're looking at ways of making sure that people really do observe, but you do have face coverings in, in, in, in shops for instance where, you know, there is a risk of transmission."" James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Yes. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant in pools and can easily disable viruses, including coronavirus, as well as more resilient bugs such as bacteria. The chemical has to be used at the right concentration, but this will be standard practice. There are two infection risks in the pool - other swimmers themselves and water they may have contaminated. Sage, the governmentâs science advisers, say the risk of catching the virus through water is ""negligible"". But being within 2m of other swimmers - perhaps when catching your breath in the shallow end - is a bigger risk. Remember the risks are about more than just the pool.

Thanks for joining us. As our live page draws to a close, have a look back at the day's main coronavirus-related developments: In the UK:  Around the world:  A ""small"" outbreak of Covid-19 has been reported at an accommodation centre for asylum seekers and refugees in Wakefield in West Yorkshire, northern England. Wakefield Council said a number of residents at Urban House, in Love Lane, had tested positive for the virus, adding that those affected have been isolated and given treatment and support at another location. Anna Hartley, Wakefield Councilâs director of public health, said: âA mobile testing unit is being set up at the site and weâre continuing to work closely with Mears Group, the Home Office and Public Health England to help limit any further potential spread. âPlease be reassured that the risk to those in the local area is very low, however, we ask everyone to please continue to follow government guidance on regular handwashing and social distancing to help keep yourself and others safe."" Gyms, nail bars, swimming pools and tattoo parlours have been among the places still closed in most of the UK. But they now have reopening dates in England. They are: Find outmore here. Englandâs deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries has suggestedlosing weight may be one way to protect yourself against coronavirus.,external But with gyms still closed in many parts of the UK, how easy is it to lose weight in lockdown? Science journalist Dr Michael Mosley says being obese puts you at a ""significantly greater risk"", and any vaccine against the virus is less likely to work. ""Being obese messes with your immune system,"" he tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""It's not just about reducing your risk of the nasty complications should you get the virus, it's also about ensuring the vaccine is going to work."" Dr Mosley says it's a ""fallacy"" that exercise is a good way of losing weight, however. ""Itâs great for all sorts of things - like improving your mood - but a pretty terrible way of losing weight because you have to do so much. It is about cutting calories and changing what youâre eating,"" he says. For more information visitthe NHS website,external. Zulfiqar AliBBC Reality Check Iran has seen a rapid surge in the numbers of coronavirus cases recently, with daily recorded deaths reaching new highs. In mid-June, daily reported deaths went above 100 - for the first time in two months. And since then, this figure has been going up, reaching 221 dead by 9 July. New reported infections averaged more than 3,000 a day in the first week of June - a 50% increase on the previous seven days. This figure reached a high of 3,574 on 4 June, before dropping slightly. There have been more than 2,000 cases a day since then. The epidemic was initially concentrated in Qom and the capital, Tehran. But now, a flare-up has been reported in the south-west, notably in Khuzestan province, an oil-rich region that borders Iraq. Officials have suggested the renewed surge in new cases could be down to more testing, and President Hassan Rouhani has said this means you will find more cases.

Two men have been arrested on suspicion of fraud and money laundering offences after police found evidence of suspected fake companies applying for coronavirusBounce Back loans,external. Ten accounts have been frozen so far, amounting to Â£553,305, as officers investigate and identify victims, London's Metropolitan Police says. Detectives launched an investigation after a routine drug search on a vehicle in Holland Park on 17 June. The officers found the vehicle's owner, a man in his early 20s, had travelled to meet a man in order to set up a bank account, for which he would be paid Â£300. Police identified the second man, who was in his late 40s, that he was due to meet and subsequently arrested both on suspicion of money laundering and fraud. The two men have since been released under investigation pending further enquiries. The number of new infection has risen by 228,102 during the last 24 hours, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) - a record increase. The biggest increases in cases were from the United States, Brazil, India and South Africa,the UN body said in its daily report.,external The previous WHO record for new cases was 212,326 on 4 July. More than 12.1 million cases have been reported by the WHO. Johns Hopkins University puts this figure at more than 12.3 million. The anonymous whistleblower said some factories had stayed open and taken on extra staff during the lockdown A whistleblower from Leicester's textile industry says some factories almost doubled their staffing to cope with online orders during the Covid-19 lockdown. The worker, who cannot be identified, said firms that ""maybe used to have 50 people working comfortably, now had 80 or 90 people in the same area"". A lockdownwas enforced in Leicester last month after a spike in coronavirus cases. ""If somebody did have Covid or wasn't well, they were still there passing it on to whoever's next to them,"" he said. ""During Covid we've had no social distancing whatsoever in the factories."" He said the situation had made already poor conditions worse: ""Very few factories, if any, have cleaners coming in and out."" Investigations are ongoing into employment practices at several firms. Read his full accounthere. BBC News Channel There has been a ""surge"" in the number of calls to Childline from children and young people during lockdown, the counselling service's founder Dame Esther Rantzen says. Children have found themselves ""imprisoned in families where frankly they were either very unhappy or even unsafe"", she tells BBC News. ""School had always been a refuge for them, they tell us, or maybe the extended family... and during the lockdown of course they couldn't escape."" Her comments come as the NSPCC said a record number of people contacted its helpline with child welfare concerns in May, up roughly a third from pre-lockdown levels. More than 22,000 adults contacted the charity from April to June, with May seeing the highest number of contacts on record at 8,287. The government says it has provided Â£1.6 million to the NSPCC to expand and promote their helpline during the pandemic. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has spoken about theUK's decision to opt out of the EU Covid-19 vaccine scheme. He told Times Radio that signing up to the EU programme would have meant abandoning Britain's own procurement schemes, which were more developed. He said Britain would not have been allowed to ""have a say"" in ""the vaccines that were procured, the price, [or] the quantity of the delivery schedule"". He added that one of the ""conditions"" of the EU's scheme was that Britain would have had to stop its ""own negotiations and only do them through the European Commission, and we weren't prepared to do that"". He insisted: ""We think we will go faster this way."" Millions of pints of beer have gone off in pub cellars sincebusinesses were forced to shut in March due to the coronavirus lockdown. Now pubs and bars have to apply for permission to pour beer down drains. Water companies say they have been inundated with requests. Severn Trent has given consent for 3.5 million litres to be disposed of, while Thames Water has allowed three million. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) estimated in May that 70 million pints would be lost due to Covid-19. Emma McClarkin, from the BBPA, said: ""The need to destroy so much beer really shows how much our brewing and pub sectors have been affected by this crisis.""  UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged Britons to go back to work if they can, in a change of position. Speaking earlier during an online session of People's PMQs, Mr Johnson said it was ""very important"" people go back to work now ""if they can"", adding he wanted the public to do this as ""carefully as possible"". He said the public had followed the government's earlier mantra to ""stay at home if you can"", but it was now time they followed the message of ""go back to work if you can"". He said it was ""very important"" people try to live their lives ""more normally"" and for people to feel ""confident"" to go to shops, restaurants and back to work, provided ""we all follow the guidance"". Sir Tim Barrow, the UK's Ambassador to the European Union, has confirmed that the UK has decided not to join the EU scheme for Covid-19 vaccine procurement. In a letter to the Secretary-General of the European Commission, he said the UK would not participate because it ""would be required to stop its negotiations with manufacturers with which the EU launched negotiations"" and because the Commission said ""it is not possible for the UK to have a role in the governance shaping decisions on which manufacturers to negotiate with, or the price, volume and delivery schedule negotiated"". Sir Tim went on to write that there could still be collaboration between the UK and the EU on areas such as ""sharing of information on promising vaccine candidates"" and ""vaccine trials"" and ""manufacturing investments and capacity building"". Francesca GillettBBC News Olivia McDermott with her son Elijah ""It's been a weird feeling to know she technically doesn't exist,"" says Emma Pratt. Her newborn daughter, Skye, was born the week before lockdown began. She is now almost four months old, but her birth still hasn't been registered. Normally, babies have to be registered with the local council within 42 days of being born, or 21 days in Scotland. But during the coronavirus lockdown, many councils paused all birth registrations - and are only now starting up again. It means they're faced withbacklogs of thousands of babies to register. For parents, it can cause practical problems too. For new mum Olivia McDermott, 24, not being able to register her son Elijah's birth could have scuppered her future career. Without a birth certificate, she could not apply for a childcare grant, and without the grant she said she would not be able to continue her training to become a nurse. ""Goodbye, dream job,"" says Ms McDermott, from Leeds. ""I'm meant to be going into my final year of training. I was just like, I won't be able to come in."" She eventually got an appointment and registered her son on Wednesday. ""Now I'm able to register him I'm feeling a lot better,"" she says. Read more. It's understood the government's looking at whether to make face coverings mandatory in shops in England. Senior government sources said that while no decision has yet been made it's an issue that's being kept under review. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told an online session of ""People's PMQs"" on Friday: ""We need to be stricter in insisting that people wear face coverings in confined places where they are meeting people that they don't normally meet. ""So that's why it's mandatory already on on public transport and we're looking at ways of making sure that people really do observe, but you do have face coverings in, in, in, in shops for instance where, you know, there is a risk of transmission."" James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Yes. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant in pools and can easily disable viruses, including coronavirus, as well as more resilient bugs such as bacteria. The chemical has to be used at the right concentration, but this will be standard practice. There are two infection risks in the pool - other swimmers themselves and water they may have contaminated. Sage, the governmentâs science advisers, say the risk of catching the virus through water is ""negligible"". But being within 2m of other swimmers - perhaps when catching your breath in the shallow end - is a bigger risk. Remember the risks are about more than just the pool. Coronavirus is spread through close contact, so beware in a cramped changing room. And it can linger on surfaces such as lockers, benches, shower buttons and taps. The number of confirmed coronavirus infections in Russia has increased by 6,635 over the past 24 hours, officials say. It brings the total number of cases in the country to 713,936, Russia's coronavirus crisis response centre said. Over the same period, an additional 174 deaths were recorded, bringing the number of fatalities to 11,017, the centre added. Russia has also today reported year-on-year figures for deaths in the country for the month of May. Rosstat, the state statistics agency, said 18,375 more deaths were reported this year, of which it said 7,444 cases were directly attributed to Covid-19. More news on face coverings - Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called on the government to make face coverings mandatory in busy and enclosed public places. In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Sadiq Khan said he was ""frustrated"" the measures had not already been introduced. It was announced on 15 Juneanyone travelling on public transport in England must wear a face covering. However, Mr Khan said precautions needed to be implemented in shops and hairdressers. As pubs, gyms and restaurants reopen across England, the mayor said face coverings are ""vital for public health"" and ""could play an increasing role in supporting public confidence and our economic recovery"". He said: ""The widespread use of face coverings are a visible signal that Londoners are willing to take the steps needed to keep each other safe. ""They show how seriously, as a society, we are treating the threat of coronavirus and they are a physical reminder that the virus is still out there,"" he added. Reality Check The UK government is expected to
confirm later whether it will opt out of an EU scheme to secure potential
Covid-19 vaccine supplies. The EU has launched other schemes,
during the pandemic, to secure things like testing kits and personal protective
equipment (PPE) - negotiating with suppliers on behalf of EU member states. The UK was allowed to join these
(because it is still in a transition period with the EU)but chose not to,external. So, how are the schemes getting on? The European Commission says its
PPE procurement plan can potentially provide up to 20 million goggles, 12
million face shields and over 350 million masks of different types. It says the
ventilator schemecan deliver,external110,000 units. It
says orders so far include: Belgium placing one for 2.6 million FFP2 masks and Austria
for 500,000. Latviaâs
order for 25,000 goggles and 100,000 surgical masks was delivered in June. Bulgariaâs
order for 55 ventilators is expected to be delivered by the end of July. Luxembourg
has received its order for 1,000,000 gloves. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"Playgrounds in Wales will open in just over a week's time Wales' campsites, hairdressers, beauty salons, cinemas and playgrounds are to reopen in the next three weeks. First Minister Mark Drakeford said playgrounds and community centres would reopen from 20 July. He said campsites would reopen on 25 July ""provided we make a success of self-contained accommodation"" which opens on Saturday. Cinemas, museums and galleries as well as beauty and tattoo parlours will be able to open on 27 July. He said house viewings with owners present would also be possible from 27 July. Churches in Wales can reopen for public worship from 19 July, if they can meet safety regulations. Baptisms and holy communion will be able to be given for the first time since lockdown. Safety measures will include social distancing, following hygiene and cleaning rules and undergoing a safety assessment. This means not all will be able to open. Church halls can reopen from 20 July. Confirmation that pubs, restaurants and cafes can resume trading outdoors from Monday, as well as hairdressers, was given atthe Welsh Government's daily coronavirus briefing. Outdoor sports, including team sports, can also resume - allowing up to 30 people to take part. It is understood ministers are still in discussions with gym and leisure companies about the reopening of indoor gyms and swimming pools. Mr Drakeford said there would be ""some limitations"" on the services beauticians can offer, calling some procedures ""particularly risky"". He told Sky News the government would discuss with the industry which measures will need to be in place. Sarah Bruton, from Captiva Spa in Caerphilly, said: ""What we don't know is which services we can offer, so while it's lovely to have a date, as a first step that's great, but we need some guidance."" Ms Bruton raised concerns that services on the face such as make-up and eyebrow shaping, may not be allowed - meaning some of her staff will still not be able to return to work. ""For us it's good because we can start bringing people back, we're already prepared because we expected this a few weeks ago, so that's brilliant."" Ms Bruton has half of her workers - the hairstylists - returning from Monday, with the other half still staying at home. ""It would be good to know we can bring the whole team back together, and we've had so many lovely messages from people saying how excited they are to come back for treatments and the social elements that come with it."" Sarah Bruton has invested in a temperature check gun and plastic screens to keep customers safe On driving lessons, Mr Drakeford said ministers were in discussions with the agency responsible and trade unions, adding: ""Those discussions will continue next week and I'm optimistic we will be able to say something pretty rapidly about that."" But Mr Drakeford said while outdoor gyms can reopen from Monday, indoor gyms are places where coronavirus is ""particularly likely to spread"". What do the latest lockdown rules mean? All pupils back in school full-time in September Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales ""We'll use the next three weeks to talk to indoor gym operators about how they could safely reopen,"" he told LBC radio. ""In a gym the nature of what you do me means that you breathe out heavily, and we've seen it in other parts of the world [that coronavirus can spread there]. ""That's why noisy environments are dangerous for coronavirus, because when people start shouting then the breath goes further.""

It was announced on 15 Juneanyone travelling on public transport in England must wear a face covering. However, Mr Khan said precautions needed to be implemented in shops and hairdressers. As pubs, gyms and restaurants reopen across England, the mayor said face coverings are ""vital for public health"" and ""could play an increasing role in supporting public confidence and our economic recovery"". He said: ""The widespread use of face coverings are a visible signal that Londoners are willing to take the steps needed to keep each other safe. ""They show how seriously, as a society, we are treating the threat of coronavirus and they are a physical reminder that the virus is still out there,"" he added. Reality Check The UK government is expected to
confirm later whether it will opt out of an EU scheme to secure potential
Covid-19 vaccine supplies. The EU has launched other schemes,
during the pandemic, to secure things like testing kits and personal protective
equipment (PPE) - negotiating with suppliers on behalf of EU member states. The UK was allowed to join these
(because it is still in a transition period with the EU)but chose not to,external. So, how are the schemes getting on? The European Commission says its
PPE procurement plan can potentially provide up to 20 million goggles, 12
million face shields and over 350 million masks of different types. It says the
ventilator schemecan deliver,external110,000 units. It
says orders so far include: Belgium placing one for 2.6 million FFP2 masks and Austria
for 500,000. Latviaâs
order for 25,000 goggles and 100,000 surgical masks was delivered in June. Bulgariaâs
order for 55 ventilators is expected to be delivered by the end of July. Luxembourg
has received its order for 1,000,000 gloves. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,1.9499315e-13
"Playgrounds in Wales will open in just over a week's time Wales' campsites, hairdressers, beauty salons, cinemas and playgrounds are to reopen in the next three weeks. First Minister Mark Drakeford said playgrounds and community centres would reopen from 20 July. He said campsites would reopen on 25 July ""provided we make a success of self-contained accommodation"" which opens on Saturday. Cinemas, museums and galleries as well as beauty and tattoo parlours will be able to open on 27 July. He said house viewings with owners present would also be possible from 27 July. Churches in Wales can reopen for public worship from 19 July, if they can meet safety regulations. Baptisms and holy communion will be able to be given for the first time since lockdown. Safety measures will include social distancing, following hygiene and cleaning rules and undergoing a safety assessment. This means not all will be able to open. Church halls can reopen from 20 July. Confirmation that pubs, restaurants and cafes can resume trading outdoors from Monday, as well as hairdressers, was given atthe Welsh Government's daily coronavirus briefing. Outdoor sports, including team sports, can also resume - allowing up to 30 people to take part. It is understood ministers are still in discussions with gym and leisure companies about the reopening of indoor gyms and swimming pools. Mr Drakeford said there would be ""some limitations"" on the services beauticians can offer, calling some procedures ""particularly risky"". He told Sky News the government would discuss with the industry which measures will need to be in place. Sarah Bruton, from Captiva Spa in Caerphilly, said: ""What we don't know is which services we can offer, so while it's lovely to have a date, as a first step that's great, but we need some guidance."" Ms Bruton raised concerns that services on the face such as make-up and eyebrow shaping, may not be allowed - meaning some of her staff will still not be able to return to work. ""For us it's good because we can start bringing people back, we're already prepared because we expected this a few weeks ago, so that's brilliant."" Ms Bruton has half of her workers - the hairstylists - returning from Monday, with the other half still staying at home. ""It would be good to know we can bring the whole team back together, and we've had so many lovely messages from people saying how excited they are to come back for treatments and the social elements that come with it."" Sarah Bruton has invested in a temperature check gun and plastic screens to keep customers safe On driving lessons, Mr Drakeford said ministers were in discussions with the agency responsible and trade unions, adding: ""Those discussions will continue next week and I'm optimistic we will be able to say something pretty rapidly about that."" But Mr Drakeford said while outdoor gyms can reopen from Monday, indoor gyms are places where coronavirus is ""particularly likely to spread"". What do the latest lockdown rules mean? All pupils back in school full-time in September Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales ""We'll use the next three weeks to talk to indoor gym operators about how they could safely reopen,"" he told LBC radio. ""In a gym the nature of what you do me means that you breathe out heavily, and we've seen it in other parts of the world [that coronavirus can spread there]. ""That's why noisy environments are dangerous for coronavirus, because when people start shouting then the breath goes further.""

Wakefield Council said a number of residents at Urban House, in Love Lane, had tested positive for the virus, adding that those affected have been isolated and given treatment and support at another location. Anna Hartley, Wakefield Councilâs director of public health, said: âA mobile testing unit is being set up at the site and weâre continuing to work closely with Mears Group, the Home Office and Public Health England to help limit any further potential spread. âPlease be reassured that the risk to those in the local area is very low, however, we ask everyone to please continue to follow government guidance on regular handwashing and social distancing to help keep yourself and others safe.""

Dr Mosley says it's a ""fallacy"" that exercise is a good way of losing weight, however.

It is about cutting calories and changing what youâre eating,"" he says. For more information visitthe NHS website,external. Zulfiqar AliBBC Reality Check Iran has seen a rapid surge in the numbers of coronavirus cases recently, with daily recorded deaths reaching new highs. In mid-June, daily reported deaths went above 100 - for the first time in two months. And since then, this figure has been going up, reaching 221 dead by 9 July. New reported infections averaged more than 3,000 a day in the first week of June - a 50% increase on the previous seven days. This figure reached a high of 3,574 on 4 June, before dropping slightly. There have been more than 2,000 cases a day since then. The epidemic was initially concentrated in Qom and the capital, Tehran. But now, a flare-up has been reported in the south-west, notably in Khuzestan province, an oil-rich region that borders Iraq. Officials have suggested the renewed surge in new cases could be down to more testing, and President Hassan Rouhani has said this means you will find more cases.

Two men have been arrested on suspicion of fraud and money laundering offences after police found evidence of suspected fake companies applying for coronavirusBounce Back loans,external. Ten accounts have been frozen so far, amounting to Â£553,305, as officers investigate and identify victims, London's Metropolitan Police says. Detectives launched an investigation after a routine drug search on a vehicle in Holland Park on 17 June. The officers found the vehicle's owner, a man in his early 20s, had travelled to meet a man in order to set up a bank account, for which he would be paid Â£300. Police identified the second man, who was in his late 40s, that he was due to meet and subsequently arrested both on suspicion of money laundering and fraud. The two men have since been released under investigation pending further enquiries. The number of new infection has risen by 228,102 during the last 24 hours, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) - a record increase. The biggest increases in cases were from the United States, Brazil, India and South Africa,the UN body said in its daily report.,external The previous WHO record for new cases was 212,326 on 4 July. More than 12.1 million cases have been reported by the WHO. Johns Hopkins University puts this figure at more than 12.3 million. The anonymous whistleblower said some factories had stayed open and taken on extra staff during the lockdown A whistleblower from Leicester's textile industry says some factories almost doubled their staffing to cope with online orders during the Covid-19 lockdown. The worker, who cannot be identified, said firms that ""maybe used to have 50 people working comfortably, now had 80 or 90 people in the same area"". A lockdownwas enforced in Leicester last month after a spike in coronavirus cases. ""If somebody did have Covid or wasn't well, they were still there passing it on to whoever's next to them,"" he said. ""During Covid we've had no social distancing whatsoever in the factories."" He said the situation had made already poor conditions worse: ""Very few factories, if any, have cleaners coming in and out."" Investigations are ongoing into employment practices at several firms. Read his full accounthere. BBC News Channel There has been a ""surge"" in the number of calls to Childline from children and young people during lockdown, the counselling service's founder Dame Esther Rantzen says. Children have found themselves ""imprisoned in families where frankly they were either very unhappy or even unsafe"", she tells BBC News. ""School had always been a refuge for them, they tell us, or maybe the extended family... and during the lockdown of course they couldn't escape."" Her comments come as the NSPCC said a record number of people contacted its helpline with child welfare concerns in May, up roughly a third from pre-lockdown levels. More than 22,000 adults contacted the charity from April to June, with May seeing the highest number of contacts on record at 8,287. The government says it has provided Â£1.6 million to the NSPCC to expand and promote their helpline during the pandemic. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has spoken about theUK's decision to opt out of the EU Covid-19 vaccine scheme. He told Times Radio that signing up to the EU programme would have meant abandoning Britain's own procurement schemes, which were more developed. He said Britain would not have been allowed to ""have a say"" in ""the vaccines that were procured, the price, [or] the quantity of the delivery schedule"". He added that one of the ""conditions"" of the EU's scheme was that Britain would have had to stop its ""own negotiations and only do them through the European Commission, and we weren't prepared to do that"". He insisted: ""We think we will go faster this way."" Millions of pints of beer have gone off in pub cellars sincebusinesses were forced to shut in March due to the coronavirus lockdown. Now pubs and bars have to apply for permission to pour beer down drains. Water companies say they have been inundated with requests. Severn Trent has given consent for 3.5 million litres to be disposed of, while Thames Water has allowed three million. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) estimated in May that 70 million pints would be lost due to Covid-19. Emma McClarkin, from the BBPA, said: ""The need to destroy so much beer really shows how much our brewing and pub sectors have been affected by this crisis.""  UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged Britons to go back to work if they can, in a change of position. Speaking earlier during an online session of People's PMQs, Mr Johnson said it was ""very important"" people go back to work now ""if they can"", adding he wanted the public to do this as ""carefully as possible"". He said the public had followed the government's earlier mantra to ""stay at home if you can"", but it was now time they followed the message of ""go back to work if you can"". He said it was ""very important"" people try to live their lives ""more normally"" and for people to feel ""confident"" to go to shops, restaurants and back to work, provided ""we all follow the guidance"". Sir Tim Barrow, the UK's Ambassador to the European Union, has confirmed that the UK has decided not to join the EU scheme for Covid-19 vaccine procurement. In a letter to the Secretary-General of the European Commission, he said the UK would not participate because it ""would be required to stop its negotiations with manufacturers with which the EU launched negotiations"" and because the Commission said ""it is not possible for the UK to have a role in the governance shaping decisions on which manufacturers to negotiate with, or the price, volume and delivery schedule negotiated"". Sir Tim went on to write that there could still be collaboration between the UK and the EU on areas such as ""sharing of information on promising vaccine candidates"" and ""vaccine trials"" and ""manufacturing investments and capacity building"". Francesca GillettBBC News Olivia McDermott with her son Elijah ""It's been a weird feeling to know she technically doesn't exist,"" says Emma Pratt. Her newborn daughter, Skye, was born the week before lockdown began. She is now almost four months old, but her birth still hasn't been registered. Normally, babies have to be registered with the local council within 42 days of being born, or 21 days in Scotland. But during the coronavirus lockdown, many councils paused all birth registrations - and are only now starting up again. It means they're faced withbacklogs of thousands of babies to register. For parents, it can cause practical problems too. For new mum Olivia McDermott, 24, not being able to register her son Elijah's birth could have scuppered her future career. Without a birth certificate, she could not apply for a childcare grant, and without the grant she said she would not be able to continue her training to become a nurse. ""Goodbye, dream job,"" says Ms McDermott, from Leeds. ""I'm meant to be going into my final year of training. I was just like, I won't be able to come in."" She eventually got an appointment and registered her son on Wednesday. ""Now I'm able to register him I'm feeling a lot better,"" she says. Read more. It's understood the government's looking at whether to make face coverings mandatory in shops in England. Senior government sources said that while no decision has yet been made it's an issue that's being kept under review. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told an online session of ""People's PMQs"" on Friday: ""We need to be stricter in insisting that people wear face coverings in confined places where they are meeting people that they don't normally meet. ""So that's why it's mandatory already on on public transport and we're looking at ways of making sure that people really do observe, but you do have face coverings in, in, in, in shops for instance where, you know, there is a risk of transmission."" James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Yes. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant in pools and can easily disable viruses, including coronavirus, as well as more resilient bugs such as bacteria. The chemical has to be used at the right concentration, but this will be standard practice. There are two infection risks in the pool - other swimmers themselves and water they may have contaminated. Sage, the governmentâs science advisers, say the risk of catching the virus through water is ""negligible"". But being within 2m of other swimmers - perhaps when catching your breath in the shallow end - is a bigger risk. Remember the risks are about more than just the pool. Coronavirus is spread through close contact, so beware in a cramped changing room. And it can linger on surfaces such as lockers, benches, shower buttons and taps. The number of confirmed coronavirus infections in Russia has increased by 6,635 over the past 24 hours, officials say. It brings the total number of cases in the country to 713,936, Russia's coronavirus crisis response centre said. Over the same period, an additional 174 deaths were recorded, bringing the number of fatalities to 11,017, the centre added. Russia has also today reported year-on-year figures for deaths in the country for the month of May. Rosstat, the state statistics agency, said 18,375 more deaths were reported this year, of which it said 7,444 cases were directly attributed to Covid-19.

"This video can not be played Trump: Supreme Court ruling a 'witch hunt' and 'hoax' The US Supreme Court has ruled that President Trump's financial records can be examined by prosecutors in New York. In a related case, the court ruled that this information did not have to be shared with Congress. Mr Trump has come under fire for not making his tax returns public like his predecessors. His lawyers had argued that he enjoyed total immunity while in office and that Congress had no valid justification to seek the records. How did Donald Trump make his fortune? Five claims in Trump niece's tell-all book Two Democratic-controlled House of Representatives committees and New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance - also a Democrat - had demanded Mr Trump's tax documents over several years in order to determine whether current conflict-of-interest laws on a US president were tough enough. Mr Trump, a Republican, denies wrongdoing and has called the investigation into his tax affairs a ""witch hunt"". ""The Supreme Court sends case back to Lower Court, arguments to continue. This is all a political prosecution,""he wrote in a series of tweets following the court rulings.,external In the case regarding the request from the New York prosecutors, the Supreme Court ruled by a majority of seven to two that the president did not have absolute immunity from criminal investigation. ""Two hundred years ago, a great jurist of our Court established that no citizen, not even the President, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding,"" the court said. ""We reaffirm that principle today."" But the two cases regarding Congressional committees were closely watched, as they could have had implications on how far US lawmakers could scrutinise the activities of a sitting president. The court ruled that Congress had significant, but not limitless, power to request the president's personal information. In this case, the court returned the case to the lower courts. Those wanting to see President Donald Trump's tax returns before the November presidential election shouldn't hold their breath. In a series of high-stakes rulings on Thursday, the US Supreme Court swatted down the president's defence that, by dint of his high office, he was somehow above the law when it came to state-level criminal subpoenas. That's good news for the president's critics, advocates of limited executive power, and New York prosecutors seeking to investigate Trump's personal finances. The opinion is not-so-good news for anyone wanting a quick resolution to this case, however. Chief Justice John Roberts sent the lawsuit back down to the lower courts and offered a few new legal avenues for Mr Trump's lawyers to pursue that could continue to put off a day when the president's accounting firm ultimately hands over the documents. And if that day comes, there's still no guarantee that the request, by a secret grand jury, will ever lead to a public disclosure. In the other case, involving a request by congressional Democrats for Mr Trump's financial records, the court was even more circumspect. It simply punted the case down to the lower court with instructions to further balance presidential privileges with legislative power. The gears of justice will grind even more slowly there. While legally these decisions may have been, at best, a draw for the president, by pushing the final day of reckoning further down the road, it's a political win. Two of the cases centred on the ability of the House intelligence, oversight and financial services committees to compel Deutsche Bank and Mazars USA, Mr Trump's long-time accounting firm, to turn over his tax and financial documents. The committees argued that they needed this information to determine whether current conflict-of-interest laws on a US president were sufficiently rigorous. The case of Trump v Vance was based on on Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance's criminal subpoena - an order to hand over evidence. Mr Vance argued Mr Trump's documents were needed to determine if financial records had been doctored to cover up hush-money payments to two women in 2016 who say they had affairs with Mr Trump. Following the ruling Mr Vance said the investigation into Mr Trump's financial affairs would resume. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said she would continue to campaign for Mr Trump's financial records to be handed over to Congress. ""Congress will continue to conduct oversight for the people, upholding the separation of powers that is the genius of our constitution,"" she told reporters. It is not clear whether this will happen. Even if Mr Trump's financial records are turned over to prosecutors, they may remain hidden from public view until charges are filed.

The worker, who cannot be identified, said firms that ""maybe used to have 50 people working comfortably, now had 80 or 90 people in the same area"". A lockdownwas enforced in Leicester last month after a spike in coronavirus cases. ""If somebody did have Covid or wasn't well, they were still there passing it on to whoever's next to them,"" he said. ""During Covid we've had no social distancing whatsoever in the factories."" He said the situation had made already poor conditions worse: ""Very few factories, if any, have cleaners coming in and out."" Investigations are ongoing into employment practices at several firms. Read his full accounthere. BBC News Channel There has been a ""surge"" in the number of calls to Childline from children and young people during lockdown, the counselling service's founder Dame Esther Rantzen says. Children have found themselves ""imprisoned in families where frankly they were either very unhappy or even unsafe"", she tells BBC News. ""School had always been a refuge for them, they tell us, or maybe the extended family... and during the lockdown of course they couldn't escape."" Her comments come as the NSPCC said a record number of people contacted its helpline with child welfare concerns in May, up roughly a third from pre-lockdown levels. More than 22,000 adults contacted the charity from April to June, with May seeing the highest number of contacts on record at 8,287. The government says it has provided Â£1.6 million to the NSPCC to expand and promote their helpline during the pandemic. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has spoken about theUK's decision to opt out of the EU Covid-19 vaccine scheme. He told Times Radio that signing up to the EU programme would have meant abandoning Britain's own procurement schemes, which were more developed. He said Britain would not have been allowed to ""have a say"" in ""the vaccines that were procured, the price, [or] the quantity of the delivery schedule"". He added that one of the ""conditions"" of the EU's scheme was that Britain would have had to stop its ""own negotiations and only do them through the European Commission, and we weren't prepared to do that"". He insisted: ""We think we will go faster this way."" Millions of pints of beer have gone off in pub cellars sincebusinesses were forced to shut in March due to the coronavirus lockdown. Now pubs and bars have to apply for permission to pour beer down drains. Water companies say they have been inundated with requests. Severn Trent has given consent for 3.5 million litres to be disposed of, while Thames Water has allowed three million. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) estimated in May that 70 million pints would be lost due to Covid-19. Emma McClarkin, from the BBPA, said: ""The need to destroy so much beer really shows how much our brewing and pub sectors have been affected by this crisis.""  UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged Britons to go back to work if they can, in a change of position. Speaking earlier during an online session of People's PMQs, Mr Johnson said it was ""very important"" people go back to work now ""if they can"", adding he wanted the public to do this as ""carefully as possible"". He said the public had followed the government's earlier mantra to ""stay at home if you can"", but it was now time they followed the message of ""go back to work if you can"". He said it was ""very important"" people try to live their lives ""more normally"" and for people to feel ""confident"" to go to shops, restaurants and back to work, provided ""we all follow the guidance"". Sir Tim Barrow, the UK's Ambassador to the European Union, has confirmed that the UK has decided not to join the EU scheme for Covid-19 vaccine procurement. In a letter to the Secretary-General of the European Commission, he said the UK would not participate because it ""would be required to stop its negotiations with manufacturers with which the EU launched negotiations"" and because the Commission said ""it is not possible for the UK to have a role in the governance shaping decisions on which manufacturers to negotiate with, or the price, volume and delivery schedule negotiated"". Sir Tim went on to write that there could still be collaboration between the UK and the EU on areas such as ""sharing of information on promising vaccine candidates"" and ""vaccine trials"" and ""manufacturing investments and capacity building"". Francesca GillettBBC News Olivia McDermott with her son Elijah ""It's been a weird feeling to know she technically doesn't exist,"" says Emma Pratt. Her newborn daughter, Skye, was born the week before lockdown began. She is now almost four months old, but her birth still hasn't been registered. Normally, babies have to be registered with the local council within 42 days of being born, or 21 days in Scotland. But during the coronavirus lockdown, many councils paused all birth registrations - and are only now starting up again. It means they're faced withbacklogs of thousands of babies to register. For parents, it can cause practical problems too. For new mum Olivia McDermott, 24, not being able to register her son Elijah's birth could have scuppered her future career. Without a birth certificate, she could not apply for a childcare grant, and without the grant she said she would not be able to continue her training to become a nurse. ""Goodbye, dream job,"" says Ms McDermott, from Leeds. ""I'm meant to be going into my final year of training. I was just like, I won't be able to come in."" She eventually got an appointment and registered her son on Wednesday. ""Now I'm able to register him I'm feeling a lot better,"" she says. Read more. It's understood the government's looking at whether to make face coverings mandatory in shops in England. Senior government sources said that while no decision has yet been made it's an issue that's being kept under review. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told an online session of ""People's PMQs"" on Friday: ""We need to be stricter in insisting that people wear face coverings in confined places where they are meeting people that they don't normally meet. ""So that's why it's mandatory already on on public transport and we're looking at ways of making sure that people really do observe, but you do have face coverings in, in, in, in shops for instance where, you know, there is a risk of transmission."" James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Yes. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant in pools and can easily disable viruses, including coronavirus, as well as more resilient bugs such as bacteria. The chemical has to be used at the right concentration, but this will be standard practice. There are two infection risks in the pool - other swimmers themselves and water they may have contaminated. Sage, the governmentâs science advisers, say the risk of catching the virus through water is ""negligible"". But being within 2m of other swimmers - perhaps when catching your breath in the shallow end - is a bigger risk. Remember the risks are about more than just the pool. Coronavirus is spread through close contact, so beware in a cramped changing room. And it can linger on surfaces such as lockers, benches, shower buttons and taps. The number of confirmed coronavirus infections in Russia has increased by 6,635 over the past 24 hours, officials say. It brings the total number of cases in the country to 713,936, Russia's coronavirus crisis response centre said. Over the same period, an additional 174 deaths were recorded, bringing the number of fatalities to 11,017, the centre added. Russia has also today reported year-on-year figures for deaths in the country for the month of May. Rosstat, the state statistics agency, said 18,375 more deaths were reported this year, of which it said 7,444 cases were directly attributed to Covid-19. More news on face coverings - Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called on the government to make face coverings mandatory in busy and enclosed public places. In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Sadiq Khan said he was ""frustrated"" the measures had not already been introduced. It was announced on 15 Juneanyone travelling on public transport in England must wear a face covering. However, Mr Khan said precautions needed to be implemented in shops and hairdressers. As pubs, gyms and restaurants reopen across England, the mayor said face coverings are ""vital for public health"" and ""could play an increasing role in supporting public confidence and our economic recovery"". He said: ""The widespread use of face coverings are a visible signal that Londoners are willing to take the steps needed to keep each other safe. ""They show how seriously, as a society, we are treating the threat of coronavirus and they are a physical reminder that the virus is still out there,"" he added. Reality Check The UK government is expected to
confirm later whether it will opt out of an EU scheme to secure potential
Covid-19 vaccine supplies. The EU has launched other schemes,
during the pandemic, to secure things like testing kits and personal protective
equipment (PPE) - negotiating with suppliers on behalf of EU member states. The UK was allowed to join these
(because it is still in a transition period with the EU)but chose not to,external. So, how are the schemes getting on? The European Commission says its
PPE procurement plan can potentially provide up to 20 million goggles, 12
million face shields and over 350 million masks of different types. It says the
ventilator schemecan deliver,external110,000 units. It
says orders so far include: Belgium placing one for 2.6 million FFP2 masks and Austria
for 500,000. Latviaâs
order for 25,000 goggles and 100,000 surgical masks was delivered in June. Bulgariaâs
order for 55 ventilators is expected to be delivered by the end of July. Luxembourg
has received its order for 1,000,000 gloves. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.99999166
"This video can not be played The BBC visits the camps where Chinaâs Muslims have their ""thoughts transformed"" The US has announced sanctions against Chinese politicians who it says are responsible for human rights violations against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. China is accused of mass detentions, religious persecution and forced sterilisation of Uighurs and others. The sanctions target the US-connected financial interests of regional Communist Party boss Chen Quanguo and three other officials. China denies any mistreatment of Muslims in far-western Xinjiang. Authorities there are thought to have detained about a million people in re-education camps in recent years. They say ""vocational training"" is needed to counter radicalism and separatism. Mr Chen, who sits on the Chinese Communist Party's powerful Politburo, is the highest-ranking Chinese official ever to be hit by US sanctions, the Trump administration says. He is seen as the architect of Beijing's policies against minorities, and was previously in charge in Tibet. China's hidden camps Uighurs 'detained for beards and veils' The other officials targeted are Wang Mingshan, director of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau; Zhu Hailun, a senior party member in Xinjiang, and former security official Huo Liujun. It is now a crime in the US to conduct financial transactions with all of them, and they will have their US-based assets frozen. However Mr Huo will not be subjected to visa restrictions that bar the others and their families from entering the US. Sanctions have also been placed on the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau as a whole. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US was acting against ""horrific and systematic abuses"",externalin the region. ""The United States will not stand idly by as the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] carries out human rights abuses targeting Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs and members of other minority groups in Xinjiang,"" he said in a statement. Mike Pompeo said Beijing was trying to ""erase the culture"" of minorities in the far west He said the US was also placing additional visa restrictions on other unnamed Communist Party officials believed to be responsible for abuses in Xinjiang. Their family members may also be subject to the restrictions. Tensions between the US and China are already high over the coronavirus pandemic and China's decision to introduce a national security law in Hong Kong that has faced significant criticism from the West. Rights groups say up to a million Muslims have been detained in high-security prison camps across Xinjiang province. Last year, the BBC saw leaked documents that showed15,000 people from southern Xinjiang were sent to the camps in one week alone. The same documents showed inmates can be released only when they ""understand deeply the illegal, criminal and dangerous nature of their past activity"". The Chinese authorities say the Uighurs are being educated in ""vocational training centres"" in order to combat violent religious extremism. However evidence shows many are being detained for simply expressing their faith - for example, praying or wearing a veil - or for having overseas connections to places like Turkey. This video can not be played The BBC's John Sudworth meets Uighur parents in Turkey who say their children are missing in China Uighurs, who are mostly Muslim, are ethnically Turkic and make up about 45% of Xinjiang's population. Last month a report by China scholar Adrian Zenz found China was forcing women in Xinjiangto be sterilised or fitted with contraceptive devices. The report has prompted international calls for the United Nations to investigate.

"Vanita Parti was ready to open her beauty bars last weekend Gyms, nail bars and various other businesses in England were disappointed last month when the government failed to give them the go-ahead to open at the same time as pubs and hairdressers. Now the government has given them new guidance - but it's not as straightforward as it initially seemed. Beauty salons, tattooists and tanning salons can reopen from Monday 13 July. Gyms, indoor swimming pools and leisure centres will have to wait until Saturday 25 July. But in the wake of the government's announcement, it has emerged that not all forms of beauty treatment have been approved. Pools, gyms, team sport and outdoor gigs to return Why haven't nail bars, gyms and pools been open? Vanita Parti is founder and chief executive of the Blink Brow Bar walk-in beauty bar chain, which has 11 shops in London. At first, she welcomed the announcement as ""fantastic news"", but then she got an email from the British Beauty Council telling her that no treatments on the face will be permitted. This includes eyebrow treatments, one of her company's specialities. ""I'm furious,"" she told the BBC. ""We can't reopen... This will kill so many businesses. I wish they'd consulted us."" Face waxing, sugaring or threading services Facial treatments Advanced facial technical (electrical or mechanical) Eyelash treatments Make-up application Dermarolling Dermaplaning Microblading Electrolysis on the face Eyebrow treatments Intricate detailing, outlining or shaving of beards Advanced beauty therapy and aesthetic treatments Source: Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Ms Parti was already feeling the loss of business from not being able to reopen earlier in the month. ""We had to cancel 2,000 appointments in the first week of July, That's Â£50,000 that we had to write off,"" she said. ""A lot of people have escaped on holiday and they were looking forward to getting a beauty treatment before they travelled, which they didn't get."" The UK's biggest tanning business, the Feel Good Group, with more than 90 tanning salons and more than 400 staff, is allowed to reopen next Monday, but questions why it took so long. Adam Mooney, group's founder and chief executive, said: ""While we welcome the decision to finally allow us to reopen, the government could have allowed us to open last week, when hairdressers reopened. ""We are ready to reopen today, not next week."" More than 25,000 people are employed in the tanning sector across the UK Mr Mooney added: ""More than 90% of our staff are women, and most in the 18 to 25-year-old age group, which is the demographic which has been worst hit financially by the pandemic, and they are very keen to get back to work."" However, he anticipated keen demand, given the recent ""dismal"" weather in the UK and the difficulties in travelling abroad. ""Perhaps our tanning salons will be the suntan saviour of staycationing Brits this summer,"" he said. Indoor gyms and swimming pools will have to wait a little longer before they can reopen, although outdoor facilities can reopen from this Saturday. Huw Edwards, chief executive of health body UK Active, told the BBC that the government's announcement brought ""welcome relief"" for his members. He said many gym owners and staff had felt ""understandable frustration"" not to have been included in the first wave of lockdown easing, but added: ""We are where we are."" Mr Edwards said the reopening of gyms was ""an important moment for the health of the nation"". ""This is a health crisis, so we now look forward to playing our central role - using our facilities and staff to help combat Covid-19 by strengthening the physical and mental health of people in every community."" However, he said that like the hospitality industry, the fitness industry would be looking for ""urgent financial and regulatory support from the government to ensure that reopening is financially viable, both for private and public operators"". Gym manager Rob Ward has socially distanced workout areas in preparation for reopening Rob Ward, who runs YourGym, an independent fitness centre in Lytham, Lancashire, says he is ready to welcome people back to work out from 25 July, but they will find there are some changes. ""They'll be noticing lots more sanitising stations around,"" he says, while equipment has been moved to comply with social distancing rules. ""We've got our own app and they'll have to book their space to avoid congestion at busy times."" The only trouble is that he's not quite sure yet what time of day that peak demand is likely to be. ""We think there will be a new normal. The busy times then may not be the busy times now,"" he says. ""People still on furlough may be more flexible with their time."" Mr Ward's staff are returning from furlough, so they will have to get used to that ""new normal"" as well. ""Everyone's on a learning curve when they get back,"" he told the BBC. ""The journey will be a little different, there will be time between classes, so it's not exactly as it used to be, but we will adapt.""
