"This video can not be played Arsene Wenger: Arsenal manager will decide on future in March or April Arsene Wenger says he will definitely be managing next season, whether at Arsenal ""or somewhere else"". Wenger, 67, was speaking at the end of one of the most turbulent weeks of his two-decade tenure as Gunners boss. After Wednesday's5-1 Champions League defeatby Bayern Munich, several ex-players said they believedhis time in charge was coming to an end. The Frenchman's contract expires at the end of this season and he said he would decide on a new deal in March or April. ""No matter what happens I will manage for another season. Whether it's here or somewhere else, that is for sure,"" Wenger said on Friday. ""If I said March or April it is because I didn't know. I do not want to come back on that. ""I am used to the criticism. I think in life it's important to do what you think is right and all the rest is judgement. I am in a public job and I have to accept that, but I have to behave with my values."" Background: BBC Sport's David Ornstein answers your questions on Wenger's future,external 21 years and out? Key questions for Arsenal and Wenger 'Outclassed', 'lowest point', 'embarrassing' - is Wenger's time up? Wenger is a complete one-man band - Redknapp Howe not ready for Arsenal job - ex-Bournemouth boss Wenger, who has been in charge of Arsenal since 1996, said: ""We let everyone judge and criticise, we have to deal with that. We have to bounce back, that is what life is about. ""Even if I go, Arsenal will not win every single game in the future. It is not like before I arrived Arsenal had won five times in the European Cup. ""What is important is that the club makes the right decision for the future. I care about this club and its future and it is very important the club is in safe hands. ""The main emotion is everyone has a big disappointment. We have to regroup and refocus on the next game, and to take care of the consequences a disappointing result can have on everyone's spirit. ""We have to focus on the real problems and they are the way we play football, not my future. ""It is always important not to look for wrong excuses in life."" Arsenal have not won the Premier League since 2004, with FA Cups in 2005, 2014 and 2015 the only major silverware Wenger has secured since. However, he has consistently qualified for the lucrative Champions League and the club has continued to grow financially, despite the pressures of building a new stadium. The Gunners reached the knockout stage of Europe's elite club competition for a 14th year in a row this season, but the last-16 first-leg thrashing at German champions Bayern leaves them with little hope of progressing. The performance, coupled with earlier damaging league defeats by Chelsea and Watford, prompted several former Arsenal players - some of whom played under Wenger - to suggest his time was up. Former Gunners captain Martin Keown described the defeat as Wenger's ""lowest point"", while ex-defender Lee Dixon said: ""This team is getting no response from him. I've never seen him like that."" In the Premier League, they are 10 points adrift of leaders Chelsea. Afterthe Blues beat them 3-1on 4 February, ex-England defender Danny Mills said Arsenal ""have settled for fourth again"". Earlier, former striker Ian Wright, who scored 185 goals for the club between 1991 and 1998, said he believed Wenger's time as Arsenal boss was ""coming to the end"", although the Frenchman later denied giving any indication of his future plans. Arsenal's trophies under Wenger Premier League (3) 1997-98, 2001-02, 2003-04 FA Cup (6) 1997-98, 2001-02, 2002-03, 2004-05, 2013-14, 2014-15 Community Shield (6) 1998, 1999, 2002, 2004, 2014, 2015 Meanwhile, Wenger also said defender and captain Laurent Koscielny will have a scan on the injury he suffered against Bayern. The France international was replaced by Gabriel after limping off just after half-time, and within seven minutes Arsenal conceded twice to go 3-1 down. The Gunners travel to National League Sutton United in the FA Cup fifth round on Monday (19:55 GMT kick-off). The match is live on BBC One.

"Gabriel Jesus scored in his first two league starts for Manchester City Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola says forward Gabriel Jesus may not play again this season after breaking a metatarsal bone in his foot. Jesus, 19, had surgery in Barcelona on Thursday after being taken off after 15 minutes of Monday's 2-0 Premier Leaguewin at Bournemouth. ""He comes back at the end of the season or next season. People say between two and three months,"" said Guardiola. The Brazil international completeda Â£27m move from Palmeirasin January. Metatarsal injuries and recovery times Kasper Schmeichel (2014): predicted six weeks; returned after 14 weeks Michael Owen (2006): Fifth metatarsal - predicted six to eight weeks; returned after 17 weeks Wayne Rooney (2004): Fifth metatarsal - predicted eight weeks; returned after 14 weeks David Beckham (2002): Second metatarsal - predicted six weeks; returned after seven weeks Jesus completed his move to Manchester City from Palmeiras in January Metatarsals are the five long bones in the forefoot which connect the ankle bones to those of the toes. The first is linked to the big toe and the fifth, on the outer foot, links to the little toe. Together, the five metatarsals act as a unit to help share the load of the body, and they move position to cope with uneven ground. Injuries usually occur as a result of a direct blow to the foot, a twisting injury or over-use. Medical experts recommend rest with no exercise and sport for four to eight weeks. The patient might be asked to wear walking boots or stiff-soled shoes to protect the injury while it heals. If the cause is over-use, then treatment can vary hugely. Training habits, equipment used and athletic technique should all be investigated. It all depends on the damage and which metatarsal bone is involved. It is impossible to put a timescale on recovery from a stress injury. With an impact fracture, after the plaster and protective boot is not needed (usually after four to six weeks), it will be a case of exercise and increasing weight-bearing activities. Ice packs, strapping and even the use of oxygen tents can be used to assist recovery. Full return to action can be anything from another four weeks and upwards - depending on the extent of initial damage. Young bones heal quicker.

"Dick Bruna (above) was still writing Miffy stories in his old age The Dutch creator of Miffy the cartoon rabbit has died aged 89, his publishers have announced. Writer and illustrator Dick Bruna died peacefully in his sleep on Thursday night in the Dutch city of Utrecht. He created the much loved character in 1955 as a story to entertain his young son. More than 80 million Miffy books have been sold globally. Over the years, Bruna wrote more than 100 books but Miffy was by far his most popular and enduring character. At first, he was uncertain whether the rabbit was a boy or a girl, but settled the matter by putting her in a dress for the sixth book, Miffy's Birthday, in 1970. Mourners gathered outside the Nijntje Museum, or Miffy Museum, in Utrecht as news of Mr Bruna's death spread Miffy's success was in part due to the simplicity of Dick Bruna's design Bruna's characters were adored by adults and children alike Dick Bruna was all about doing more with less. Economy of line was the key behind the much loved Miffy character. Through only a few simple shapes, heavy graphic lines and primary colours, Bruna was able to capture and convey a huge amount of personality and character. Miffy delights adults and children alike and we hope that her innocent and loving personality will continue to resonate - she is such a great example of the universal language of illustration. In the Netherlands, she is called Nijntje (""little rabbit"" as a Dutch toddler might say it). It was her first English translator, Olive Jones, who christened her Miffy. Bruna was still writing Miffy stories in his old age and his books have been translated into more than 50 languages. The museum dedicated to her name in Utrecht,externalhastweeted a picture of the white rabbit,external, arms behind her back, a single tear below her left eye. Dutch publisher Marja Kerkhof told the AP news agency that he used ""very clear pictures, almost like a pictogram"". She said his illustrations were often best characterised by what he left out, allowing him ""to go to the essence of things"" while simultaneously using ""very strong powerful primary colours"". ""Even today if you see it in a store you would think, 'hey this looks different to a lot of other things out there',"" she said. ""There is no clutter, it's all very clear."" Stories about Miffy are enjoyed by children all over the world Is especially popular in Japan, where shehas her own web page section,externalin The Japan Times, as well asa cafe serving food dedicated to her name,externalin Tokyo Is also popular in China,where train carriages in Guangzhou were decorated in her image in 2015,externalto celebrate her 60th birthday Was in 2004 appointed the official ""family tourist ambassador"" to New York City Germany is one of numerous European countries to havea dedicated Miffy website,external Does not like to be mistaken for her rival,the Japanese character Hello Kitty Miffy books to be updated in UK miffy.com Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over a national inquiry into grooming gangs Thousands flee LA wildfires as forecasters warn worst is yet to come Inside neighbourhood totally lost in LA fires How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

"The troops were taking part in a training operation in Tallinn The Ministry of Defence (MoD) provided British soldiers with a guide to strip clubs in the Estonian capital, a freedom of information request to the department has revealed. The advice featured in a booklet titled ""Tallinn guide for friendly forces"", given to troops taking part in a Nato Steadfast Javelin training operation. The operation took place in May 2015. The MoD would not comment on the guide but said advice on ""staying safe"" was routinely given to troops while abroad. The BBC requested copies of various documents concerning the operation, also known as Exercise Hedgehog. In its response, the department provided the guide, which includes a section detailing three strip clubs in Tallinn. Lasso Baar was said to be a ""big strip bar with one of the prettiest dancers"" and Soho was identified as the ""biggest strip club in Estonia"". X Club was billed as ""the most professional strip club with various elements"". The guide also gave British troops further advice on what to expect at Estonian strip clubs. Those visiting strip clubs were advised to ""use cash"" Troops were informed that ""all strip clubs offer private rooms for individual dances"", and that ""the average level of rolling tips to girls is 5 to 20 euros"". They were also advised ""to use cash in such places"". Asked if it was appropriate for the government to provide such material, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defence said: ""As you would expect, we routinely provide guidance to our people about staying safe while on deployment."" The department would not comment on who had produced the guide, how it had been distributed to troops, or whether it would be issued to troops serving in Estonia in future. The guide included other nightlife tips, such as pubs Mad Murphy's and Hell Hunt, or visiting the city's historic Old Town for a dash of Baltic culture. It also offered a warning on public drinking, saying that to avoid a police fine, ""when you want to drink spirits in the street it is wise to cover the bottles"". And it includes gift ideas for British troops. It suggests a visit to a shop called Bonbon Lingerie as a good place to pick up something special for wives and girlfriends. In terms of a bottle of something to bring home, it suggests Vana Tallinn or Old Tallinn liquor, of which the guide says, ""Finns just love it and some of them use it as a sleeping pill."" A spokesperson for the Estonian embassy in London said the Estonian government had not produced the guide. ""According to the information received from the Estonian Defence Forces this is not an official document produced by or for the Government of Estonia."" Operation Steadfast Javelin was a major Nato training exercise, in which 13,000 troops and reserves defended positions against a simulated attack by land and air.

"Star Wars fans, we have a new film update for you. You'll know by now that the new film - episode VIII, out this December - will be called Star Wars: The Last Jedi. When that title was revealed, there was massive speculation over who that Jedi was. But with the release of the international language titles, eagle-eyed enthusiasts have noted that the word Jedi is plural - that suggests we're getting more than one. They revealed that the new film will be called Les Derniers Jedi.,external If you remember your high-school French, you'll know that ""derniers"" is referring to plural Jedi. We assume Luke is one of said Jedi. But to find out whether that means that there are multiple ""last Jedi"" or just one other (is it Rey?), we'll probably have to wait until the film is released - or at least until the trailer comes out. Their version is called Los Ultimos Jedi.,external Again, anyone who's spent more than a weekend in Magaluf will recognise that the Jedi referred to are plural. The Italian translation is Gli Ultimi Jedi.,external Probably less familiar language-wise, but we can assure you it means the same thing.

"Rain Dove did not set out to become a model, but now she appears on the catwalk for some of the biggest names in fashion. The former firefighter is making it her mission to change how we see gender through clothes. ""I'm not what you'd consider to be a 'pretty girl' so I've always just felt a little alien,"" she tells Newsbeat. Despite modelling for Elle, Vogue and Calvin Klein, she says she is still fighting discrimination. Rain models men's and women's clothes for some of the biggest brands on earth (photo: Steven D. Feist) The 27-year-old New Yorker has taken an unusual route into fashion. A former genetic engineering student, she became a model by accident after losing a bet with a friend during an American football game. ""She told me that if I lost the bet I'd have to go to a casting call for Calvin Klein."" At the time she didn't realise what a big deal that was. And she got another surprise - the casting directors had mistaken her for a man. ""Not only did they cast me for a men's show, but it turned out it was a men's underwear show,"" she explains. So she decided to walk the show topless. At this point her career took off but she still faced rejection for being androgynous - partly male and partly female in appearance. Walking for designer Jackson Wiederhoeft in New York ""People [in the fashion industry] are constantly trying to tell me to be 'more like' the sex or gender they're marketing to,"" she explains. ""So it's like 'You need to be more delicate', or [for menswear] 'you need to be stronger, more powerful'."" At 6ft 2in, with broad shoulders, muscular arms, and 32DD breasts, Rain doesn't conform to either men's or women's modelling sizes. She often posts photos of herself in men's and women's clothes to her 92,000 Instagram followers to promote gender equality.,external ""I need to maintain my body at this weight in order to do what we consider to be menswear, because their sizes are a little bit bigger than women's.

Feist Rain Dove has turned down high-profile jobs because designers wanted her to change her identity.

"Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberghas spoken to the BBCabout how people are withdrawing from the ""connected world"". In the interview, accompanied by a 5,500-word letter about the future of Facebook, he considers the failures of globalisation. It can't quite be called regret, but the entrepreneur is certainly looking back with mixed feelings. And he's not the only tech inventor to question their creation. Here are five of the most surprising. Sir Tim Berners Lee, the man behind the world wide web,was asked back in 2009,externalwhat he'd do differently if he had a second chance. We've all probably got things we'd love change about the internet, but his answer was a lot more minimal. He said he'd get rid of the of the ""//"" after ""http:"" at the start of web addresses. That's it. The double-slash was commonplace in programming back in the day but doesn't really do anything. Sir Tim argues we could have saved countless hours of effort, and countless trees from making paper, if he'd just left it out. We probably should have put a trigger warning on this As short-lived mobile game crazes go, Flappy Bird was up there with the best of them (*cough* Pokemon Go *cough). If you never played it, the idea was to guide a poorly-animated bird through some poorly animated pipes. The extremely simple, but extremely frustrating appwas downloaded 50 million times. At the height of its popularity in 2013, its Vietnamese creator Dong Nguyen was reportedly earning $50,000 (Â£30,450) a day from advertising. But he apparently couldn't take the number of people writing to him saying the game was ruining their lives. In February 2014 he Tweeted: ""I am sorry 'Flappy Bird' users, 22 hours from now, I will take 'Flappy Bird' down. I cannot take this anymore"".,external Okay, so maybe this one is less surprising. In 2014, a man called Ethan Zuckerman wrote an essay calledThe Internet's Original Sin.,external In it he explains that back in 1990s he ""wrote the code to launch [a new] window and run an ad in it"". In other words - he invented the pop-up. ""I'm sorry. Our intentions were good,"" he goes on. We don't think sorry is quite going to cut it, Ethan. Think of professor Scott Fahlman as the great grandfather of the emoji. At 11:44am on 19 September 1982, while working at a university in the US, he sent this mass email: ""I propose the following character sequence for joke markers: :-) Read it sideways."" It's the first known use of a smiley and it was designed to make it easier to distinguish between serious and silly messages. But Professor Fahlam isn't such a joker when it comes to the little yellow faces that his invention spawned. ""I think [emojis] are ugly,""he told The Independent in 2013,external. ""They ruin the challenge of trying to come up with a clever way to express emotions using standard keyboard characters."" A few years on, it seems almost unbelievable that there was once aworld-wide movementto ban the font Comic Sans. It makes you wonder why people in 2010 didn't have better things to do with their time. Still, the inventor of the ""world's most-hated font"" has admitted he toohas reservations,externalabout what he created. Vincent Connare came up with it in the early 1990s, while trying to make a short-lived computer dog called Microsoft Bob more exciting.

"Nurdles may sound cute and often look beautiful but the small plastic pellets are a sinister presence on three-quarters of beaches in the UK. Volunteer nurdle hunters on the Great Winter Nurdle Hunt searched their local shorelines in early February and thesurveyhas found that 73% of 279 shorelines contain the plastics. In one 100m-stretch of beach in Cornwall, beachcombers found 127,500 of the lentil-sized pellets - but that is just a fraction of the 53 billion nurdles that are estimated to escape into the UK environment each year. The microplastics pose a significant threat to fish and animals that ingest the plastic. Experts warn that nurdles can soak up chemical pollutants from their surroundings and then release the toxins into the animals that eat them. After the BBC reported the story some nurdle hunters have been getting in touch to explain why they do what they do. Sarah Marshall, a 49-year-old former speech and language therapist, started collecting nurdles two years ago and says she is now addicted to finding the pellets. ""They look like tiny eggs, some are bigger than others, some are thicker, and they are all different colours,"" she says. ""They congregate on the tide line and I often use my hands to pick them up - whenever I go to the beach, I cannot help but pick them up. ""I even found some in Martinique. My daughter says 'mum let's go look for nurdles' - it's like a competition between us,"" she adds. Christine Hyland, Naomi Hyland and Sarah Marshall at Compton beach on the Isle of Wight The threat posed by nurdles to wildlife and the marine ecosystem is the main motivation for Sarah to spend her time picking them up from beaches. She normally throws away the collected nurdles but she has also sent samples to theInternational Pellet Watch,externalwho analyse nurdles for the presence of toxic chemicals. Sarah Marshall has been collecting nurdles from beaches in the Isle of Wight for two years Jay Lowein, who is 59 and runs a business, is a recent recruit to the Great Nurdle Hunt. She went on her first hunt in Shanklin on the Isle of Wight in February and explained that she used tweezers to pick up the pellets. Together with a friend, she collected over 1500 nurdles in one hour. Nurdles on Shanklin beach in the Isle of Wight ""I'd never even seen them but when I went on the nurdle hunt, I was really shocked at how many there are,"" says Jay. ""I collect them because I think it's horrible that there is all this plastic floating around. ""I want to do my bit - I don't want to eat fish that has ingested plastic pellets"", she explains. Daniel Moore, a 29-year-old PhD student in Durham, found these nurdles at James Bay in March 2015. Nurdles found by Daniel Moore on a beach hunt at James Bay in Millport, Cumbrae Maranda, a self-employed embroider, took part in her first nurdle hunt this year in the freezing Scottish rain by her house at Dunnet Sands at Britain's most northerly point. ""I go beachcombing every day - but on this hunt I collected 355 nurdles in 45 minutes,"" she explains. ""It is back-breaking work - my hands get cold from the freezing water and my specs are always falling down. ""I do it because I care about the environment - I want to do a bit of good for the world when I'm out there,"" she adds. A close up of nurdles collected from a beach in Caithness in January Maranda, who is 44, uses some of the refuse for craft, including twine to make pictures, and she recycles the plastic rubbish she finds. Nurdles are not the only plastic material occupying beaches in the UK. Emily Cunningham, a 26-year-old marine biologist in Durham, found plastic ribbon and latex from 101 balloons on a beach in Anglesey. She believes that they are the remains of balloons sent into the air on mass balloon releases. Emily collects nurdles almost weekly, whenever she visits the beach, and says that often she finds more plastic than seaweed on Britain's beaches. Ribbon and latex from 101 balloons found by Rhosneigr on the west coast of Anglesey Tina Triggs, who is 44 and works in a supermarket, found 66 plastic cotton buds on a beach in February at Barmouth in north Wales.

"""The next time you plan to cross a border, leave your phone at home."" That is the rather startling advice in ablogpost,externalthat is being widely shared right now. Its author, Quincy Larson, is a software engineer, who has previously written about the importance of protecting personal data. He now fears that data could be at risk every time you cross a border. His concerns were sparked by the story of Sidd Bikkannavar, an American-born Nasa engineer, who flew home from a trip to Chile last month. On arrival in Houston, he was detained by the border police and,by his own account,external,  put under great pressure to hand over the passcode to his smartphone, despite the fact that the device had been issued to him by Nasa. Eventually, Bikkannavar did hand over both the phone and the passcode. It was taken away for 30 minutes and then returned, and he was free to go. Larson sees this as a very dangerous precedent: ""What we're seeing now is that anyone can be grabbed on their way through customs and forced to hand over the full contents of their digital life."" We also know that the new homeland security secretary, John Kelly, has talked of requiring visa applicants to hand over passwords to their social media accounts - though whether that could apply at the border too is not clear. How much private data is on your smartphone? And on Thursday, a new Republican congressman took to Twitter to announce proudly that he had introduced his first bill - to require the review  of visa applicants' social media. Larson predicts that a policy where travellers are asked to download the contents of their phones will soon become commonplace, not just in the United States but around the world. Hence his advice to leave your mobile phone and laptop at home and rent devices when you get to your destination. Which seems a little extreme. I can't imagine being separated from my smartphone on a flight - and I'm sure many others feel the same. So I decided to seek some advice from the UK Foreign Office and the US embassy in London. Was there a danger that I would be forced by border officials to unlock my phone or hand over my social media passwords? The Foreign Office told me their travel advice did not cover this subject because they had not received any calls about it. But they did suggest that if I happened to be trapped in immigration at JFK airport with a border agent demanding my passcode, I could call the British embassy and arrange a lawyer. As for the American embassy, well I called before lunchtime on Thursday and got a perfectly pleasant response. They would need to speak to Washington and would get back to me later about the matter of my smartphone and my Facebook and Twitter accounts. As I write, it's Friday morning and I've heard nothing. Perhaps Washington has other matters on its mind. So perhaps I'd better take what I believe is known as a ""burner"" phone the next time I fly across the Atlantic. Update: Forty-eight hours after my first enquiry, I have now received a response to my questions from the US embassy in London. Here it is: ""All international travellers arriving to the US are subject to US Customs & Border Protection inspection. This inspection may include electronic devices such as computers, disks, drives, tapes, mobile phones and other communication devices, cameras, music and other media players and any other electronic or digital devices. Keeping America safe and enforcing our nation's laws in an increasingly digital world depends on our ability to lawfully examine all materials entering the US. ""US Customs & Border Protection realises the importance of international travel to the US economy and we strive to process arriving travellers as efficiently and securely as possible while ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing the international arrival process.""

"The claim:More businesses will win than lose as a result of business rates revaluation. Reality Check verdict:More businesses will see their bills fall than will see their rates rise. On 1 April 2017, the amount that businesses have to pay in rates will change to reflect a revaluation of premises that has been carried out by the government. The changes will be relatively large because it has been seven years since the last one. The government has now said that it will have revaluations at least every three years. There have been loud complaints from business owners who will have to pay more, but on the Today Programme, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, David Gauke, said: ""Across the country as a whole, far more businesses are benefiting from these changes than are losing out."" Mr Gauke is only talking about England because, while there are also revaluation processes underway in Scotland and Wales (Northern Ireland did it in 2015), he has no power over them. Business rates are a tax on non-residential property such as pubs, restaurants, warehouses, factories, shops and offices, but not farms or places of worship. The amount they pay is based on how much annual rent could be charged on the premises, which is known as the rateable value. There have been objections, from some business groups, to changes in the regime for appealing against the rateable value attached to particular premises. On average, all areas are seeing their rates fall, except London, where bills will rise an average 11% this year. In the 2016 Budget, the government said it would spend Â£6.7bn on reducing business rates by 2020-21. Among the changes, premises with a rateable value of Â£12,000 or less do not have to pay any rates at all - they previously had to pay 50%. The government says that covers about 600,000 businesses. The proportion of business rates that must be paid increases gradually, between a rateable value of Â£12,000 and Â£15,000, affecting another 50,000 businesses. There will also be an increase in the amount businesses can earn before they go from the standard rate to the higher rate. The government has also changed the measure of inflation that it uses to increase rates every year - it has switched from the retail prices index (RPI) to the consumer prices index (CPI), which will usually mean smaller increases for businesses. And it has introduced transitional arrangements to protect businesses from seeing their rates increasing too much straight away. In order to fund this, it has also prevented businesses' rates from falling more than a certain amount. The Department for Communities and Local Government says that 520,000 ratepayers will see their bills increase as a result of the revaluation, while 920,000 will see their bills fall and 420,000 will see no change. The government says that the revaluation will not earn it any extra money.

"More than 100 people have been killed across Pakistan since Sunday in a series of deadly militant attacks As Pakistan picks up the pieces from Thursday evening's devastating bomb attack at the 800-year-old shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, the country's managers are looking for scapegoats abroad. And the military has openly taken charge of the proceedings, relegating pretentions of political propriety to the background. Soon after the bombing, army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa vowed that ""each drop of [the] nation's blood shall be avenged, and avenged immediately"". There would be ""no more restraint for anyone"", he said. The object of his remark was clear an hour later when the military announced that Pakistan had closed its border with Afghanistan to all traffic, including pedestrians. On Friday morning, Afghan embassy officials were summoned to the army's headquarters in Rawalpindi. They were handed a list of 76 ""terrorists"" said to be hiding in their country, with the demand that they be arrested and handed over to Pakistan, the military says. The fiery reaction came after a series of deadly militant attacks in five days from Sunday killed more than 100 people across Pakistan, including civilians, the police and soldiers. This is the worst spell of violence since 2014, when Pakistan launched an operation to eliminate militant sanctuaries in its north-western tribal region. The numerous militant attacks this week have raised questions about the authorities' security strategy Violence decreased considerably as a result, with Pakistani leaders claiming the militants had been defeated. But this week, that sense of security has been blown away. The latest surge in attacks comes amid reports of the reunification of some powerful factions of the Pakistani Taliban. Some of them have links with the Afghanistan-Pakistan chapter of the so-called Islamic State, which itself emerged from a former faction of the Pakistani Taliban. Most of these groups have hideouts in border areas of Afghanistan, where they relocated after Pakistan launched its anti-militant operations. Pakistan now accuses Afghanistan of tolerating these sanctuaries. It also blames India for funding these groups. Officials say India and Afghanistan want to hurt Pakistan economically and undermine China's plans to build a multi-billion dollar ""economic corridor"" through the country. At least 80 people were killed in the Sufi shrine attack on Thursday in Sehwan, Sindh province But many in Pakistan and elsewhere don't buy that argument. They believe that militancy in Pakistan is actually tied to the country's own covert wars that sustain the economy of its security establishment. In Kashmir, for example, the BBC has seen militants living and operating out of camps located close to army deployments. Each camp is placed under the charge of an official from what locals describe as the ""launching wing"" of the intelligence service. In Balochistan, which has been under de-facto military control for nearly a decade, state agencies have allegedly been promoting Islamist militants to counter an armed separatist insurgency by secular ethnic Baloch activists. Last year the regional police compiled a report on militant sanctuaries across several parts of Balochistan, but an operation recommended by the police in those areas was never launched. This video can not be played Amateur footage from inside the shrine shows people fleeing the scene Likewise, the world knows about the safe havens which the Afghan Taliban continue to enjoy in the Quetta region and elsewhere in Balochistan province, as well as in some parts of the tribal region in the north-west, from where they continue to launch raids inside Afghanistan. Will Pakistan ever stamp out extremism? Pakistan's Sufis under attack from Islamic hard-liners What is Sufism? Many observers believe that the Pakistani military uses militant proxies to advance its wars in Afghanistan and Kashmir, and takes advantage of the domestic security situation to control political decision making. This is important, they say, if the military is to sustain a vast business, industrial and real estate empire which they believe enjoys unfair competitive advantages, state patronage and tax holidays. The military establishment rejects such arguments. But with such a cocktail of militant networks in the border region, many find it hard to buy the Pakistani line that India and Afghanistan are to blame. All militants on the ground - from disputed Kashmir to Quetta and Afghanistan - come from the same stock. They are the second-generation standard bearers of an armed Islamist movement that was formed on Pakistani soil during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1980s. They may have regional affiliations or partisan loyalties, but all have been raised under the influence of Wahhabi Islam and its various ideological offshoots, imported here by Arab warriors who came to help liberate Afghanistan. As such, they are capable of forming complex group-alliances and cross-border linkages with each other. And they are all united in considering Shia Muslims and Sunni adherents of native Sufi Islam as misguided and heretical. This may also partly answer the riddle as to how these groups manage to survive and operate even though they do not command popular support in any part of Afghanistan or Pakistan.

"Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has launched a campaign to try to persuade the British people to change their minds about leaving the European Union. It comes just weeks before the government intends to trigger the departure mechanism. In a speech in London, he said that he respected the will of the people, but voters hadn't been given details about the terms on which Britain would exit the EU. Mr Blair argued that what he called the ""cost"" of Brexit was only now becoming clear. The referendum vote, he said, was based on ""imperfect knowledge"" which would now become ""informed knowledge"". It's true that we don't yet know the details of the UK's future relationship with the rest of the EU - that will depend on the deal that is negotiated - but lots was said during the referendum campaign about what Brexit would mean in more general terms. In particular, leading figures in both campaigns said leaving the EU would entail leaving the single market. Mr Blair suggested that immigration was the main issue that propelled Leave to victory in the referendum campaign. But, he argued, the effect of quitting would probably have only a modest impact on overall immigration levels. He pointed out that just over half of migration into the UK comes from outside the EU. That's confirmed by official statistics from the ONS. In the year to June 2016 net migration - the difference between the number of people who arrived and the number of people who left - was 196,000 from outside the EU, compared with 189,000 from inside the EU. The same is true for the gross migration statistics - ie just looking at how many citizens from different parts of the world arrived in the UK. Again, there were slightly more from outside the EU (289,000) than from inside (284,000) along with a smaller number of British citizens returning to live in the UK (77,000). And only an estimated 82,000 or 12.6% of the 650,000 total were EU citizens who arrived looking for work. Theresa May has ruled out introducing a points-based migration system but the government hasn't published details of what it does want to implement. If the new system continues to allow in EU migrants with job offers, as well as students and people coming to join spouses, then Mr Blair's 12% would be, broadly speaking, correct. There could be a bigger impact if the government opts for a capped number of work permits. But about half of total migration will be unaffected no matter what arrangements are made with the EU. This isn't really a fair quotation. It's a reference to an interview given by Philip Hammond on ITV's Peston on Sunday on 26 June. Mr Hammond said: ""I believe it's essential that we protect our access to the single European market. Whether we like it or not, our economy, over 40 years, has become shaped by that access, and to lose that access now would be catastrophic."" But note that he was talking about access to the single market. That's not the same as membership. You don't have to be a member of the single market to have access to it, although the level of access that Britain would have after leaving the single market would depend on what trade relationship was negotiated. It's true that the pound has fallen against the dollar and the euro since the referendum, although not by quite as much as Mr Blair said. It has recovered from its lowest point. Against the dollar, the pound is currently down about 16% compared with its pre-referendum level. Against the euro, it's about 10.5% down. It's also worth noting that the pound/euro exchange rate was at a similar level to now between 2009 and the middle of 2011, so it's hardly unprecedented. Against the dollar, though, the pound has hit multi-decade lows in recent months.

"This video can not be played Bayern Munich 5-1 Arsenal: Wenger on Gunners 'nightmare' After Arsenal's humiliating 5-1 defeat by Bayern Munich in the Champions League, there have been fresh questions about manager Arsene Wenger's future. But with a new contract offer remaining on the table, what is the situation around their manager of almost 21 years? BBC sports news reporter David Ornstein addresses some of the biggest questions facing the club. Arsenal, a post Christmas wobble and a probable Champions League last-16 exit. We've been here before. Is it any different this time? For Arsenal, 2016-17 is turning into a carbon copy of the past six seasons - and even resembles the four before that. The difference now is that it could genuinely spell the end for Arsene Wenger.Wednesday's defeat has badly stung the 67-year-old Frenchmanand senior figures at the club, while the anger, pain and disillusionment among supporters is stronger than ever. Though the Gunners are not yet out of Europe, remain in the FA Cup and are fourth in the Premier League, it seems a growing majority of the fanbase believes Wenger should leave when his contract expires in the summer. Neither the Arsenal board nor Wenger have ever been swayed by such opinion, but for the first time in his tenure I think there will be serious doubt on both sides about whether he should continue. This video can not be played Bayern Munich 5-1 Arsenal... in memes Should we read anything into so many former players, previously so loyal, saying they feel Wenger is coming to the end? Given how well the likes of Ian Wright, Martin Keown and Lee Dixon know Wenger, their views should not be discarded. These are prominent and respected past squad members who, over the years, have tended to support the Frenchman and do still see him behind closed doors. But, equally, views are not facts and these ex-players do not actually know what is going to happen. Wenger has a very small circle of people he trusts and it is understood even they are in the dark over his intentions because, put simply, he is yet to make a decision. I will be managing next season, here or elsewhere - Wenger Background: BBC Sport's David Ornstein answers your questions on Wenger's future,external 'Outclassed', 'lowest point', 'embarrassing' - is Wenger's time up? Inside the club, what is thought to be the feeling of both the squad and officials on all the speculation? The message from Arsenal is 'business as usual' before Monday's FA Cup trip to Sutton United, which suddenly carries even greater importance. However, there can be no hiding from the sense of deja vu, and those I spoke to on Thursday sounded both depressed by what they had witnessed in Munich and sick of the negativity engulfing the club again. I hear of confusion among players and staff as to what is going on - there is no clear plan on or off the pitch - and certain individuals have sought information on Wenger's future to no avail. Some around the club think he will stay; others are adamant he is finished. Meanwhile, reports of angry post-match scenes in the dressing room will only add to what has become a tense and unhealthy environment. With Wenger having a contract extension offer on the table, to what extent does he remain the master of his own future? Who else is key and what will be the key factors in any decision? As the most successful and longest-serving manager in Arsenal history, Wenger will have the biggest say. However, it will not be the only say. He and the board have enough respect for one other to hold mature discussions over whether signing a new contract is in the best interests of the club. In that sense, it will be a mutual decision. The board comprises chairman Sir Chips Keswick, chief executive Ivan Gazidis and directors Ken Friar, Lord Harris of Peckham, Stan Kroenke and his son, Josh. All will have a stance, the most important being that of owner Kroenke Sr. He is said to be in favour of Wenger staying on, so if the manager is to leave it will likely have to be his own call. Wenger assesses his position at the end of each campaign, so the next three months will be pivotal. Other possible considerations include his desire, Arsenal's realistic prospects, the atmosphere inside and outside the club, and the state of any succession plans. Decision on Wenger future at end of season Ozil is already on record as saying Wenger is important to his future at the club. How important is Wenger to keeping some of the other star players? Mesut Ozil has scored nine goals in 29 appearances for Arsenal this season In Wenger's earlier years, many players joined Arsenal specifically to work under the Frenchman. They were fiercely loyal to him and if his future was in doubt then so was theirs. They openly spoke about it and, to this day, many credit him for their rise. That pulling power has endured to an extent, yet for various reasons related to Wenger, Arsenal and the transfer market, it is not as strong. Ozil praised his manager but did not say the 67-year-old was key to his future, more that he wanted to know who would be in charge as he ponders a new contract himself. I can't think of any other current player who has even mentioned Wenger when discussing their future. Arsenal are confident they are now big enough to attract and retain players without needing to rely on the lure of Wenger. Ozil 'thinks he is being made scapegoat' Goal-shy Ozil lacks confidence - Wenger Three Premier League titles, six FA Cups and never finishing outside the top four in 21 years. That's quite a legacy. How much of a concern is the prospect of the unknown quantity of a post-Wenger era? This must be a huge worry to Arsenal. Wenger has transformed the club into a major global power on and off the pitch, keeping them competitive in top-level domestic and European competition, with a new stadium built along the way. It is an astonishing achievement - but such is the position that Wenger has put Arsenal in, especially financially, it is clear the board fear how they would fare without him. If not, and they were serious about winning the Premier League and Champions League, surely with only three FA Cups to show for the past 12 years they would have given somebody else a go? The reality is there is no guarantee the next manager will do better than Wenger and that is presumably why Arsenal have retained his services for so long. Arsenal's trophies under Wenger Premier League (3) 1997-98, 2001-02, 2003-04 FA Cup (6) 1997-98, 2001-02, 2002-03, 2004-05, 2013-14, 2014-15 Community Shield (6) 1998, 1999, 2002, 2004, 2014, 2015 Have we any indication what succession planning has been done and the sort of names or manager types Arsenal have in mind? Gazidis used to joke about a drawer in his office containing contingency plans in the event of Wenger leaving, which he hoped would stay locked for many years. However, now that is a realistic prospect, it would be remiss of Gazidis not to have updated his files. It has been reported that Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel leads a four-man shortlist. The other three candidates are said to be Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri, Bayer Leverkusen's Roger Schmidt and Monaco manager Leonardo Jardim. And finally, next up are Sutton United, Liverpool and Bayern Munich. How key are those three games to this situation? For Arsenal, losing to Sutton does not bear thinking about. It would rank as one of greatest upsets of all time and is surely no way for Wenger to go out. The Gunners are obviously clear favourites, but after the events of Munich the pressure will be even higher. This video can not be played FA Cup: Sutton boss Doswell wins battle to scout Arsenal and not watch EastEnders Liverpool away is huge for both sides in their quest for a top-four finish. Defeat, against a rival managed by Jurgen Klopp, who Arsenal have been linked with in the past, would further ratchet up the scrutiny surrounding Wenger's position. The return leg against Bayern has echoes of Arsenal's tie against AC Milan in 2012, when they lost the first leg 3-0 and therefore needed four unanswered goals to progress. They almost did it, but this Bayern side are far superior to that Milan team and they should confirm Arsenal's exit in what may be Wenger's final European game as the club's manager.

"If Jenny ever gets married, there will be no dad walking her down the aisle and, if she gets her way, no mention of him on her marriage certificate either. This is because, according to the twenty-something professional, the man who sexually abused her for 18 months from the age of seven ""lost any right to be called my father"". Despite his horrific betrayal of the relationship between father and daughter, the current law gives the option for only his name and occupation to be recorded on her future marriage certificate - but not that of her mother ""who has been mum and dad all wrapped up in one"". This system, of recording only the names of the father of the bride and groom on the certificate, dates back to the early years of Queen Victoria's reign. While either party can ask for a line to be put through that box if they have never known their father or been brought up by a step-father, it's an inequality many people like Jenny feel should be addressed. It is also an issue that has provoked anger among MPs from all parties, who have spent several years attempting to bring about a change in the law to allow both parents to have their names and occupations recorded. Their campaign was given a boost when a petition on Change.org, calling for mothers' names to be added to marriage certificates, collected 70,600 signatures in January 2014. The petition said ""marriage should not be seen as a business transaction between the father of the bride and the father of the groom"". Former Prime Minister David Cameron said later that year that he would address this ""inequality in marriage"", adding that the exclusion of mothers' names from marriage registers in England and Wales did ""not reflect modern Britain"". Mr Cameron was gone from Downing Street before any action was taken and it now seems that Conservative MP Edward Argar's Registration of Marriage Bill is the most likely vehicle to overturn the law. A brief history of marriage: Marriage Act of 1836 - allowed non-conformists and Catholics to be married in their own places of worship Ages of Marriage Act 1929 - Parliament raised the age limit to 16 for both sexes Civil Partnership Act 2004 -  granted civil partnerships to same-sex couples in the UK with rights and responsibilities identical to civil marriage Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 - introduced civil marriage for same-sex couples in England and Wales There were 240,854 marriages in 2013, a decrease of 8.6% compared with 2012 and the first decline since 2009 The average age for a first marriage was 32.5 years for men and 30.6 years for women in 2013 His bill, which would update the Marriage Act of 1949, would move the solely paper-based system to a central electronic register online, which would allow the mother's name to be included. It would also bring England and Wales into line with the rest of the UK. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, couples are asked to give the names of both parents on marriage documentation. The same applies for those entering a civil partnership. Similar attempts by Labour and Conservative MPs to change the law fell in 2015 after failing to get ministers' support. Labour frontbencherChristina Rees'private member's bill focused on the narrow point about putting the mother on the certificate. Former Conservative cabinet ministerDame Caroline Spelman's bill,externalwanted marriages listed in a single electronic register instead of in marriage register books. Former home office minister Richard Harrington said at the time ""a combination"" of the two bills ""could deal with things quickly"". Am I cut out for marriage? Why choose civil partnership over marriage? Married couples failing to claim tax perk, says HMRC Unlike his predecessors', Mr Argar's bill - which is more like Dame Caroline's attempt - has succeeded in getting government backing because it will create a more secure system for keeping marriage records. ""The whole point of this bill is the mothers and fathers of the bride and groom will be registered,"" said the Charnwood MP. ""In the great scheme of things it's a minor change, but it's symbolically very important for a large number of people who want a recognition of the role their mother played in their upbringing."" Mr Argar hopes for a change in the law by the summer He added: ""It will also give victims of abuse, children of single mothers or errant fathers, the choice over whether to include their mother's names and not their father's. ""You will see virtually no outward change in the form of the marriage ceremony, just in the manner that things are recorded. By moving to an online schedule system, we can easily amend the paper documentation - and it's more secure because it doesn't rely on the old parish register that is at risk of theft from the village church. ""The church is supportive of the move, and over time it will save the taxpayer millions of pounds in administrative costs."" The bill is set to return to the Commons for its detailed committee stage after the half-term recess, and Mr Argar is hopeful it will receive Royal Assent - and so become law - by the summer. A spokesman for the Home Office said it wanted to see mothers' names recorded on marriage certificates ""as soon as possible"". Mum's done everything For Jenny, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, the law change cannot come soon enough. ""My dad's a rapist and he abused me and my sisters, so I never want any reference to him appearing on anything about my future,"" she said. ""He has no right to that - he lost that right many years ago. ""I was only seven when the attacks started, and my siblings were much younger. It ended after I told my mother when I was eight and a half. ""I've tried to block out what he did to me. ""I have a partner and I'm sure we will get married eventually, but I don't want my father involved in any way.  I'd only want my mum's name on the marriage certificate because as far as I'm concerned she's done everything for us.""

"This video can not be played ""My own darling boy"" - a greeting in one of the letters While on military training during World War Two, Gilbert Bradley was in love. He exchanged hundreds of letters with his sweetheart - who merely signed with the initial ""G"". But more than 70 years later, it was discovered that G stood for Gordon, and Gilbert had been in love with a man. At the time, not only was homosexuality illegal, but those in the armed forces could be shot for having gay sex. The letters, which emerged after Mr Bradley's death in 2008, are therefore unusual and shed an important light on homosexual relationships during the war. What do we know about this forbidden love affair? Wednesday January 24th 1939 My darling, ... I lie awake all night waiting for the postman in the early morning, and then when he does not bring anything from you I just exist, a mass of nerves... All my love forever, G. Information gleaned from the letters indicate Mr Bradley was a reluctant soldier. He did not want to be in the Army, and even pretended to have epilepsy to avoid it. His ruse did not work, though, and in 1939 he was stationed at Park Hall Camp in Oswestry, Shropshire, to train as an anti-aircraft gunner. He was already in love with Gordon Bowsher. The pair had met on a houseboat holiday in Devon in 1938 when Mr Bowsher was in a relationship with Mr Bradley's nephew. Mr Bowsher was from a well-to-do family. His father ran a shipping company, and the Bowshers also owned tea plantations. When war broke out a year later he trained as an infantryman and was stationed at locations across the country. February 12 1940, Park Grange My own darling boy, There is nothing more than I desire in life but to have you with me constantly... ...I can see or I imagine I can see, what your mother and father's reaction would be... the rest of the world have no conception of what our love is - they do not know that it is love... But life as a homosexual in the 1940s was incredibly difficult. Gay activity was a court-martial offence, jail sentences for so-called ""gross indecency"" were common, and much of society strongly disapproved of same-sex relationships. It was not until the Sexual Offences Act 1967 that consenting men aged 21 and over were legally allowed to have gay relationships - and being openly gay in the armed services was not allowed until 2000. The letters, which emerged after Mr Bradley's death in 2008, are rare because most homosexual couples would get rid of anything so incriminating, says gay rights activist Peter Roscoe. In one letter Mr Bowsher urges his lover to ""do one thing for me in deadly seriousness. I want all my letters destroyed. Please darling do this for me. Til then and forever I worship you."" Mr Roscoe says the letters are inspiring in their positivity. ""There is a gay history and it isn't always negative and tearful,"" he says. ""So many stories are about arrests - Oscar Wilde, Reading Gaol and all those awful, awful stories. ""But despite all the awful circumstances, gay men and lesbians managed to rise above it all and have fascinating and good lives despite everything."" February 1st, 1941 K . C. Gloucester Regiment, Priors Road, Cheltenham My darling boy, For years I had it drummed into me that no love could last for life... I want you darling seriously to delve into your own mind, and to look for once in to the future. Imagine the time when the war is over and we are living together... would it not be better to live on from now on the memory of our life together when it was at its most golden pitch. Your own G. But was this a love story with a happy ending? Probably not. At one point, Mr Bradley was sent to Scotland on a mission to defend the Forth Bridge. He met and fell in love with two other men. Rather surprisingly, he wrote and told Mr Bowsher all about his romances north of the border. Perhaps even more surprisingly, Mr Bowsher took it all in his stride, writing that he ""understood why they fell in love with you. After all, so did I"". Although the couple wrote throughout the war, the letters stopped in 1945. However, both went on to enjoy interesting lives. Mr Bowsher moved to California and became a well-known horse trainer. In a strange twist, he employed Sirhan Sirhan, who would go on to be convicted ofassassinating Robert Kennedy. Mr Bradley was briefly entangled with the MP Sir Paul Latham, who was imprisoned in 1941 following a court martial for ""improper conduct"" with three gunners and a civilian. Sir Paul was exposed after some ""indiscreet letters"" were discovered. Mr Bradley moved to Brighton and died in 2008. A house clearance company found the letters and sold them to a dealer specialising in military mail. The letters were finally bought by Oswestry Town Museum, when curator Mark Hignett was searching on eBay for items connected with the town. He bought just three at first, and says the content led him to believe a fond girlfriend or fiancÃ© was the sender. There were queries about bed sheets, living conditions - and their dreams for their future life together. Gilbert Bradley was stationed at Park Hall Camp in Oswestry in 1939 When he spotted there were more for sale, he snapped them up too - and on transcribing the letters for a display in the museum, Mr Hignett and his colleagues discovered the truth. The ""girlfriend"" was a boyfriend. The revelation piqued Mr Hignett's interest - he describes his experience as being similar to reading a book and finding the last page ripped out: ""I just had to keep buying the letters to find out what happened next."" Although he's spent ""thousands of pounds"" on the collection of more than 600 letters, he believes in terms of historical worth the correspondence is ""invaluable"". ""Such letters are extremely rare because they were incriminating - gay men faced years in prison with or without hard labour,"" he says. ""There was even the possibility that gay soldiers could have been shot."" Work on a book is already under way at the museum, where the letters will also go on display. Perhaps most poignantly, one of the letters contains the lines: ""Wouldn't it be wonderful if all our letters could be published in the future in a more enlightened time. Then all the world could see how in love we are.""

"In a letter, a group of mental health professionals said Mr Trump was incapable of serving as president It seems an incredible question to ask of a man who ran a multi-billion-dollar business and vanquished seasoned political opponents on his way to highest office in the US. But experts are debating the mental health of the US president. The discussion of Donald Trump's mental health has come to the fore following an open letter from dozens of professionals who say his ""grave emotional instability"" makes him unfit for the presidency. The call seems to break a long-standing rule among experts of not diagnosing public people, and has been condemned by a leading psychiatrist, who described the ""psychiatric name-calling"" as an insult to the mentally ill. Debate over Mr Trump's mental fitness is nothing new, andexisted even before his election,external, last November. But the majority of mental health professionals have refrained from making public statements, following a self-imposed principle known as the ""Goldwater rule"", adopted by theAmerican Psychiatric Association (APA),externalin 1973. It prohibits psychiatrists from giving diagnosis about someone they have not personally evaluated. It was instated after a magazine asked thousands of experts in 1964 whether Republican nominee Barry Goldwater was psychologically fit to be president. The APA warned last year that breaking the rule in trying to analyse the candidates in the presidential election was ""irresponsible, potentially stigmatising, and definitely unethical"". Psychiatrists were warned against making assumptions about the mental health of the candidates But now, some professionals have spoken out, including those who have signed a petition asking for Mr Trump's removal. It has now gathered more than23,000 signatures,external. Some have suggested,externalthat Mr Trump has Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). People with this condition often show some of the following characteristics, according toPsychology Today,external: Grandiosity, a lack of empathy for other people and a need for admiration They believe they are superior or may deserve special treatment They seek excessive admiration and attention, and struggle with criticism or defeat In aletter to the New York Times,external, 35 mental health professionals warned that the ""grave emotional instability"" indicated in Mr Trump's speech and actions made him ""incapable of serving safely as president"". They said experts had remained silent because of the Goldwater rule, but that it was time to speak out. ""This silence has resulted in a failure to lend our expertise to worried journalists and members of Congress at this critical time. We fear that too much is at stake to be silent any longer."" 24 things Trump believes Are things as bad as Trump says? The letter says Mr Trump has demonstrated an inability to tolerate different views The letter added: ""Mr Trump's speech and actions demonstrate an inability to tolerate views different from his own, leading to rage reactions. His words and behaviour suggest a profound inability to empathise. ""Individuals with these traits distort reality to suit their psychological state, attacking facts and those who convey them (journalists, scientists)."" Earlier this week, Democratic Sen Al Franken said that ""a few"" of his Republican colleagues had expressed concern to him about Mr Trump's mental health. The concerns, he said, stemmed from questions about the president's truthfulness and the suspicion that Mr Trump ""lies a lot"". Apart from theapparent break of the Goldwater rule,external, other professionals say the psychiatric diagnosis of Mr Trump is an insult to the mentally ill. Also in aletter to the NYT,external, Dr Allen Frances, who helped write the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV, one of the main key manuals used to classify mental disorders, said that ""most amateur diagnosticians have mislabelled"" Mr Trump with the diagnosis of ""narcissistic personality disorder"". ""He may be a world-class narcissist, but this doesn't make him mentally ill, because he does not suffer from the distress and impairment required to diagnose mental disorder."" He added: ""Mr Trump causes severe distress rather than experiencing it and has been richly rewarded, rather than punished, for his grandiosity, self-absorption and lack of empathy. ""It is a stigmatising insult to the mentally ill (who are mostly well behaved and well meaning) to be lumped with Mr Trump (who is neither). ""Bad behaviour is rarely a sign of mental illness, and the mentally ill behave badly only rarely. Psychiatric name-calling is a misguided way of countering Mr Trump's attack on democracy.""

"Punch's cartoon about the so-called cadaver factory Think fake news is a new phenomenon? Think again. Dr David Clarke from Sheffield Hallam University looks at a 100-year-old story that fooled the world. Fake news, false stories that masquerade as real news are not new. In the spring of 1917 some of Britain's most influential newspapers published a gruesome story that has been called ""the master hoax"" - and I think we finally have proof about where it came from. Britain was at the time trying to bring China into the war on the Allied side. In February a story appeared in the English-language North China Daily News that claimed the Kaiser's forces were ""extracting glycerine out of dead soldiers"". Rumours about processing dead bodies had been in circulation since 1915 but had not been presented as facts by any official source. That changed in April when the Times and the Daily Mail published accounts from anonymous sources who claimed to have visited the Kadaververwertungsanstalt, or corpse-utilisation factory. The Times ran the story under the headline Germans and their Dead, attributing the claim to two sources - a Belgian newspaper published in England and a story that originally appeared in a German newspaper, Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger on 10 April. That German account by reporter Kal Rosner described an unpleasant smell ""as if lime was being burnt"" as he passed the corpse factory. Rosner used the word ""kadaver"", which referred to the bodies of animals - horses and mules - not human bodies. Later, The Times carried a longer article quoting from an unnamed Belgian source who described in grim detail how the corpses were processed. A cartoon published soon afterwards by Punch presented the ghoulish story with the caption ""cannon fodder - and after"". The German government protested loudly against these ""loathsome and ridiculous"" claims. But their protests were drowned out by public expressions of horror from the Chinese ambassador.   China declared war against Germany on 14 August 1917. However, until now no one has been able to discover conclusive proof that would settle the mystery of who created the story - and who authorised its transformation from a false rumour to officially-sanctioned ""fact"". I believe we now can. It was in 1925 that Sir Austen Chamberlain admitted, in a Commons statement, there was ""never any foundation"" for what he called ""this false report"". In the same year the Conservative MP John Charteris - who served as head of intelligence - reportedly admitted, while on a lecture tour of the US, that he had fabricated the story. The New York Times revealed how Charteris said he had transposed captions from one of two photographs found on captured German soldiers. One showed a train taking dead horses to be rendered, the other showed a train taking dead soldiers for burial. The photo of the horses had the word ""cadaver"" written upon it and Charteris reportedly said he ""had the caption transposed to the picture showing the German dead, and had the photograph sent to a Chinese newspaper in Shanghai"". On his return to Britain, Charteris denied making the remarks. Since that time, no one has been able to discover the photographs or any clear documentary evidence that would prove the intelligence services connived with the press to promote the corpse factory lie. Cuttings from the Times, Daily Mail and Daily Express reporting the ""corpse factory"" But I have found what I believe to be one of the photographs mentioned by Charteris in a collection of Foreign Office files at The National Archives. The black and white image, dated 17 September 1917, clearly shows bodies of German soldiers, tied in bundles, resting on a train behind the front line just as Charteris had described in 1925. The covering letter, from a military intelligence officer at Whitehall, is addressed to the government's Director of Information, Lt Col John Buchan, author of The 39 Steps. The letter from MI7, the military's propaganda unit, offers the War Office ""a photograph of Kadavers, forwarded by General Charteris for propaganda purposes"". In 1917 MI7 employed 13 officers and 25 paid writers, some whom moonlighted as ""special correspondents"" for national newspapers. One of their most talented agents was Major Hugh Pollard who combined his work in the propaganda department with the role of special correspondent for the Daily Express. After the war Pollard confessed his role in spreading the corpse factory lie to his cousin, Ivor Montague. Writing in 1970, Montague recalled ""we laughed at his cleverness when he told us how his department had launched the account of the German corpse factories and of how the Hun was using the myriads of trench-war casualties for making soap and margarine."" But lies have consequences. During the 1930s the corpse factory lie was used by the Nazis as proof of British lies during the Great War. Historians Joachim Neander and Randal Marlin remind us how these false stories ""encouraged later disbelief when early reports circulated about the Holocaust under Hitler"".

"Fake news writers are producing strange, static videos that appear designed to boost pro-Donald Trump Facebook groups. It was billed as the city of fake news. After the election of Donald Trump, journalists descended on Veles in Macedonia, which hosteda disproportionate number of fake news websites. Now it appears that people in Veles have developed a new tactic to try to make their Facebook posts go viral and thus raise the popularity of false stories. Several are using Facebook's live broadcasting tool to produce long, silent clips. The posts typically ask questions about President Trump or former President Obama and ask users to click ""like"", ""angry"", ""haha"" or another Facebook reaction button in order to register their preferences. For instance, one of these video polls asked: ""Who is the best president in our country America?"". The video itself showed still pictures of Trump, Obama and former President George W Bush, along with a running tally of the ""votes"". BBC Trending found that video, and others made by people from Veles, in pro-Donald Trump Facebook groups. Here's a sample of what the videos look like: This video can not be played Odd Facebook videos 'promote fake news' The key to understanding what's going on here is the mechanism by which the posts solicit reactions. Making users click ""like"" or another reaction button to vote in the ""poll"" affects the Facebook algorithm and would tend to increase the chances that the video is seen by other people. But the producers of the videos may be slightly behind trend. In December, Facebook responded to users who complained that looping or static videos weren't very interesting. ""Given this feedback, we're now taking steps to reduce the visibility of Live streams that consist entirely of graphics with voting,""the company said,external. ""If you post a Live video with graphics-only polls, it may not show up as high in people's News Feeds."" Visit theTrending Facebook page,external The poll videos look like they are gauging opinion, although given that they are being posted in pro-Trump Facebook groups, the outcomes would seem to be foregone conclusions. At the same time, most of the time the content of the videos isn't faked or misrepresentative, like it has been in some more notorious cases. One Facebook Live video posted in October 2016, for instance,pretended to be a broadcast from the International Space Station. But by driving traffic to the posts in pro-Trump groups, the videos might also aid the spread of fake news stories. In fact, the videos often sit side-by-side with stories that are false or have deeply misleading headlines. For instance, this story, a hoax about university students threatening to cut off their genitals if Trump carries out his plans to build the US-Mexico boarder wall, wasdebunked by the urban legends website Snopes,externalandothers,external. Clicking on the link to the story leads not to the text of the news story, but rather to a page of advertising: In some cases, the video polls have a false premise at their heart. One example: Obamahas never asked to be on the $1 note,external(and anyway, even if he wanted to,US Treasury rules prohibit living people from appearing on currency,external). The post contains another falsehood as well: ""You need to SHARE this LIVE post before you React."" Although you don't have to share any Facebook post before you react to it, claiming that you do might trick some people into doing both - thus giving the video a further boost according to the network's algorithm. Several of the people sharing the polls declare Veles connections in their Facebook profiles. A report by Buzzfeed, the news outlet that initiallyidentified the Veles cluster,external, said that before the US election, the most popular false news storieswere shared on Facebook more times,externalthan the most popular stories from mainstream media outlets. Facebook and other social networks have since started to put in placea number of measures to combat the spread of false stories, and there have also been a host of independent initiatives totry to tackle the problem. Veles gained notoriety as a centre for false news production As for the fake news writers of Veles, it appears they're motivated more by profit than politics. ""Teenagers in our city don't care how Americans vote,""one fake news writer in the city told the BBCin December. ""They are only satisfied that they make money and can buy expensive clothes and drinks!"" BBC Trending tried to contact some of the people in Veles sharing the videos, but none responded. The ""poll"" videos also aren't limited to Macedonians or pro-Trump groups. They appear in non-political contexts, and Trending has also seen them in groups supporting Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, a populist leader whose online machinewas a key factor in his election victory in 2016. This online poll asks if respondents have more trust in Duterte or a rival Filipino politician, Antonio Trillanes.

"28 January: President Trump (left) speaks to Vladimir Putin on the White House phone For several months, the pro-Kremlin media had nothing but praise for Donald Trump. During the US election campaign, Russian state TV bulletins and pro-government newspapers portrayed him as some kind of David taking on the Goliath of a ""corruptâ¦ Russia-hating"" Washington elite. They welcomed his calls for warmer US-Russian relations. They played down some of his more outlandish comments. It was almost as if a US presidential candidate, and subsequently a new US president, had become the golden boy of Russian politics. In January he even received more mentions in the Russian media than President Vladimir Putin. But I detect a change in tone. On Friday, Russia's most popular tabloid, Komsomolskaya Pravda, accused President Trump of making ""contradictory"" statements about Nato. The paper points out: ""(During the election campaign) Trump had called the Alliance obsolete and useless. Less than two months have passed since he moved into the Oval Office and he's already expressed full support for Nato. ""As the saying goes, you need to be drunk to understand the true position of America's president."" Friday's edition of the Russian government paper, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, notes: ""Recently the White House has been making many contradictory and incompatible statements about the foreign policy direction of Trump's team, including issues that affect Russia's interests."" Reporting Thursday's meeting in Bonn between Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and the new US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, the paper emphasises ""it was obvious how tense and, at the same time, confused Tillerson looked"". US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (left) and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met in Bonn on Thursday Meanwhile, Nezavisimaya Gazeta warns against ""excessive Trumpophilia"". And with President Trump under sustained pressure back home over alleged links to Russia, the business daily Vedomosti doubts he will have ""flexibilityâ¦ in talks with Russia. ""Every step he takes, particularly any concessions, will be examined under a microscope. It's even hard to believe now that there ever was a window of opportunity (to improve relations) that made it seem worth raising our glasses and toasting Trump's victory."" In recent days there has been noticeably less Trump on Russian TV. The resignation of the president's national security adviser Michael Flynn on Tuesday may have made headlines around the world. But it was not mentioned in Russian state TV's 45-minute evening news bulletin. That is extraordinary, considering that Russia was central to the story. December 2015: Gen Flynn (left) sits next to President Putin at a dinner in Moscow There are reports that state television has been instructed to scale back its coverage of the US president. The Kremlin has dismissed these as ""rumours"". ""I was told by someone closely connected to one of Russia's main state TV companies that such instructions exist and were issued in the wake of Flynn's departure,"" says Konstantin Eggert, a political commentator for the independent channel TV Rain. ""As far as I know, the idea is not so much to present him in a negative light, but to scale down coverage of the United States in general. Inevitably I think there's going to be a scaling down of positive coverage of Trump, too. The Kremlin's idea is to reduce expectations from this much-anticipated detente between Moscow and Washington."" ""Everything's a muddle in the White House"", says Moskovsky Komsomolets President Putin's spokesman told the BBC reports of Kremlin meddling were ""absolute rubbish"" and ""fake news"". ""TV channels and the Russian media have total independence to decide their own editorial policy,"" Dmitry Peskov told me. I asked him whether he thought it was odd that Russian TV channels appeared to have reduced their coverage of Mr Trump. ""To be honest, we don't study so closely the proportions in which different stories are reported,"" he replied. US sets out cautious approach to Russia Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake Where Trump stands on key issues Last November one Russian official admitted to me having celebrated Mr Trump's victory - with a cigar and bottle of champagne. So why has the champagne gone flat? Judging by the angry reaction of senior Russian politicians, Moscow was disappointed by Michael Flynn's departure. The Trump adviser had championed closer US-Russian ties. Then came White House comments about Crimea, making clear that President Trump expects Russia to return the annexed peninsula to Ukraine. To Russia it seemed a sudden 180-degree turn. During the election campaign Donald Trump had told ABC television: ""The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were."" Crimea, March 2014: pro-Russian troops in unmarked uniforms seized key buildings And on Thursday senior members of the Trump administration sounded less than enthusiastic about the idea of a rapprochement with Moscow. US Defence Secretary James Mattis said Washington was ""not in a position right now to co-operate on the military levelâ¦ Russia's aggressive actions have violated international law and are destabilising."" US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson indicated that America ""will consider working with Russia"". That is hardly a ringing endorsement. Yet Donald Trump has made it clear he still believes a better relationship with Vladimir Putin and Russia is good for America. Could he once again becoming the American darling of the Russian media? That will partly depend on whether the two presidents can strike up a good relationship when they eventually meet. But it depends, too, on how much pressure President Trump will be under by then, over his team's alleged Russian connections.

"Once doted on by his father, Kim Jong-nam had a long fall from grace as a man On Monday, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was killed in Malaysia. The BBC's Karishma Vaswani in Kuala Lumpur dissects a week of mystery and intrigue. It's been almost a week since the mysterious death of a Korean man at Kuala Lumpur airport and there are still no real answers. Initially, Malaysia refused to identify the dead man as Kim Jong-nam, saying just that the passport he had on him was under the name Kim Chol. This despite South Korea's insistence that it was indeed him, killed on the orders of North Korea's brutal regime. Malaysia finally confirmed for the first time on Wednesday that the dead man was indeed the half-brother of the North Korean leader. Zahid Hamidi, Malaysia's deputy prime minister, told reporters: ""I think he carries two different identities. Probably this [passport] is an undercover document."" Kim Jong-nam: North Korea's critic in exile Death in a dynasty: What led to the demise of Kim Jong-nam? North Korea's foreign assassinations Malaysia's cautious handling of this case has been evident from the start. The police have been sparing with their details, with official statements about arrests coming hours after they've already been widely reported. Kim Jong-nam had openly criticised North Korea and called for it to open up There have also been conflicting and often contradictory accounts from different divisions of the police - national and district - adding more confusion to the story. But here's what we do know:three people have been arrested so far.Two women are amongst them. Police say one is Indonesian while the other was carrying a Vietnamese passport. A third suspect - a Malaysian man police say is the boyfriend of the Indonesian - has also been detained. Police have detained the suspects for seven days for further questioning. One suspect wore a shirt with ""LOL"" - ""laugh out loud"" - written on it Still, nothing is known about how closely connected they are to the death of Kim Jong-nam, nor indeed why and exactly how he died. Malaysian police have told me that the two women were both identified from CCTV camera footage captured at the scene of the alleged crime. I went to the airport terminal where the attack happened to see for myself how it might be possible to get away with murder in broad daylight. The facts in this case are murky to say the least. But based on police reports, this is what appears to have happened. On Monday, Kim Jong-nam was about to board a flight. He is thought to have arrived in Kuala Lumpur on 6 February and was on his way back to Macau, where it is believed he lived. But while he was at the airport, some police reports say at least one woman is thought to have accosted him, and covered his face with a cloth doused in some sort of burning or poisonous chemical. He then went to the information counter and is thought to have asked for help. Subsequently it appears he was taken to the medical clinic in the airport from where he was sent to hospital, dying en route. All eyes are now on the forensic department of the hospital analysing Mr Kim's body But when I spoke to staff at the airport who may have witnessed what happened, no-one was willing to talk to me. At least two people said they had been told by police and their bosses not to speak to the media or divulge any details of what happened. So there's a lot we still don't know. What kind of chemical was used in the apparent poisoning? How exactly did he die? The post-mortem examination of his body has been completed, but details have yet to be released to the public. We also don't know what he was doing in Malaysia, although we understand that he did come here fairly frequently. I tried to track some of Kim Jong-nam's old haunts in Kuala Lumpur, which led me to a Korean restaurant in the centre of town. At the restaurant, the mainly Bangladeshi and Burmese staff had no idea who Kim Jong-nam was. But the owner of the restaurant is Korean, and he did speak to me. He refused to meet me in person though, choosing to speak to me on the phone. He also didn't want to be filmed or named because he was afraid of being linked to Mr Kim. But he said Mr Kim was a regular customer at his restaurant, and that he would bring bodyguards with him. In halting English, he told me Mr Kim often spoke to him and told him he feared for his life. ""Scared, yes,"" he told me. ""He was sure scared, because Kim Jong-un planned to kill him since so far five years."" The case has attracted intense interest in South Korea North Korea hasn't said anything about the death and it's highly unlikely it ever will. All we have heard about what Pyongyang wants is from Malaysian officials, who have said they will turn the body over if a formal written request is made. Instead, the focus in Pyongyang this week has been on the 75th anniversary celebrations of the current leader's father, Kim Jong-il. In North Korea's secretive regime, unanswered questions are a way of life. Kim Jong-nam: North Korea's critic in exile Death in a dynasty: What led to the demise of Kim Jong-nam?

"The BBC's Johny Cassidy began to lose his eyesight when he was in his teens Across the world up to 1.2 billion people live with some sort of disability, it is estimated. That's equivalent to the population of China. In the UK, it is thought that some seven million people of working age have a disability, which all adds up to an awful lot of spending power. Latest figures from the UK's Department of Work and Pensions estimate that this spending power, the so-called ""purple pound"", is worth Â£249bn to the economy. So what should businesses be doing to try to get a share of this money? That's what we'll be asking during Disability Works week from the BBC's business and economics unit. This video can not be played The power of the ""purple pound"" explained We'll be looking at how businesses work with people with disabilities and how disabled people have made business work for them. I gradually began to lose my eyesight when I was in my teens so I understand the difficulties for disabled people getting into work. I've been a producer in the BBC's business and economics unit for nearly nine years. I'm keen to address the stereotype of disabled people that we all too often see in the media. For every one of the superheroes climbing mountains or the wheelchair marathon runners, there are dozens of people quietly getting on with running their own business. There are also likely to be a lot of disabled people watching the news who miss out on seeing people like themselves reflected in bulletins. I'm hoping that this week will go some way to addressing that. Jacob Anthony has ataxic cerebral palsy - he's set up his own bakery but it's not been easy We'll be talking to disabled men and woman who have decided to start their own businesses, from the Welsh baker just at the start of his journey into entrepreneurship, right the way through to the Christmas tree farmer who's been selling trees for over 20 years. Many big businesses realise that by simply listening to and understanding the needs of their disabled customers, a rich new revenue stream can be opened up. It is not about charity, though. It makes hard business sense to address the needs of this demographic. Diversity in a workforce has long been said to be beneficial to a company. The need to reflect your customer base within the workforce brings empathy and understanding, and far from being a hindrance to a business, this diversity can bring a strength. We'll look at the UK fragrance house that has teamed up with a college for the blind in Mumbai in India in order to train people to become perfumers and the South African business that is training disabled welders. Ravi Vanniyar's company uses blind people like himself to check the smell of raw materials that go into making perfumes The whole idea is to show that with a little bit of adaptation and understanding, disabled people can and do add to the economy. The BBC's business and economics unit is looking at how businesses work with people with disabilities and how disabled people have made business work for them A range of stories will feature across online, TV and radio from 20-24 February 2017 On Twitter and Facebook you can follow the hashtag #DisabilityWorks and at the end of the week you can download theOuch podcast More Disability stories The interesting thing though is that these difficulties are more often than not the catalyst that enables people to start their own business, and we will also try to offer some advice to disabled people who are thinking of doing so. This is often a preferred route for many people as running your own business offers the flexibility that a nine-to-five job might not give you. The bigger difficulty for many is the barriers that other people put in the way. Advances in access technology have taken away many of these physical barriers, but there's still a lot to be done to take away the social ones.

"Strawberry Field is one of the stops on the city's Beatles landmarks tour The children's home immortalised by John Lennon in The Beatles hit Strawberry Fields Forever is to be redeveloped by the Salvation Army. An Â£8m scheme has been unveiled for the home, where Lennon played as a child. The venture will combine an education centre for young people with learning difficulties and an exhibition on the home, the song and Lennon's early life. The gates at the site, which is closed to the public, are a popular attraction for Beatles fans visiting Liverpool. The plans were announced on the 50th anniversary of the release of the single, which was a double-A side with Penny Lane, reaching number two in the UK charts and number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the USA. John Lennon was inspired by the venue to write his 1967 hit The original home in Woolton was demolished in the early 1970s and replaced with a smaller building. Major Drew McCombe, divisional leader for the North West branch of the charity, said: ""Strawberry Field is special in the hearts of many people in Liverpool, the UK and across the world, and we at the Salvation Army are aiming to redevelop the site to do justice to the many people that have been supported by the children's home or formed a connection with the iconic Beatles song."" According to Blue Badge Beatles tour guide Neil McDonald, the gates are one of the must-see Beatles sights in the city. He said: ""It is a unique atmosphere. I've seen some people burst into tears and even proposals of marriage."" According to Hunter Davies's biography of The Beatles, one of Lennon's childhood treats was the garden party that took place each summer on the grounds of Strawberry Field. His Aunt Mimi recalled: ""As soon as we could hear the Salvation Army band starting, John would jump up and down shouting 'Mimi, come on. We're going to be late.'"" The musician is said to have found a place of peace and refuge from his troubled childhood in the woods around the home, where he went to play with friends, climb trees and dream the hours away. The song's refrain ""and nothing to get hung about"" is said to be a reference to Lennon's retort ""they can't hang you for it"" to Mimi about playing on the property. Official fundraising for the project begins later this year. Strawberry Field is a popular attraction for tourists The new development will include a Lennon display alongside a learning centre Lennon fields song gates removed The Salvation Army Call 999 if you see this missing man Opticians bring festive spirit to home visit customers facing holiday isolation Three ambitious young entrepreneurs open Clockworks in Liverpool this January Man and woman charged as 'true gentleman' dies in motorbike crash on M62 Floral Pavilion to host Liverpool City Region Culture and Creativity Awards 2025 Fresh police appeal over man missing since November who 'could be in St Helens' Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over a national inquiry into grooming gangs Thousands flee LA wildfires as forecasters warn worst is yet to come Inside the neighbourhood totally lost in LA fires How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

"Mount Cook, the highest peak of New Zealand - and Zealandia You think you know your seven continents? Think again, as there's a new contender hoping to join that club. Say hello to Zealandia, a huge landmass almost entirely submerged in the southwest Pacific. It's not a complete stranger, you might have heard of its highest mountains, the only bits showing above water: New Zealand. Scientists say it qualifies as a continent and have now made a renewed push for it to be recognised as such. In a paperpublished in the Geological Society of America's Journal,,externalresearchers explain that Zealandia measures five million sq km (1.9m sq miles) which is about two thirds of neighbouring Australia. Some 94% of that area is underwater with only a few islands and three major landmasses sticking out above the surface: New Zealand's North and South Islands and New Caledonia. You might think being above water is crucial to making the cut as a continent, but the researchers looked at a different set of criteria, all of which are met by the new kid in town. elevation above the surrounding area distinctive geology a well-defined area a crust thicker than the regular ocean floor New Zealand as captured from space by astronaut Tim Peake The main author of the article, New Zealand geologist Nick Mortimer, said scientists have been researching data to make the case for Zealandia for more than two decades. ""The scientific value of classifying Zealandia as a continent is much more than just an extra name on a list,"" the researchers explained. ""That a continent can be so submerged yet unfragmented"" makes it useful for ""exploring the cohesion and breakup of continental crust"". So how then to get Zealandia into the canon of continents? Should text books authors get nervous again? After all, just a few years ago, Pluto gotkicked off the list of planets, changing what had been taught in schools for decades. There is in fact no scientific body that formally recognises continents. So it could only change over time if future research accepts Zealandia on par with the rest so that eventually we might be learning about eight, not seven, continents. NZ whales: Why did so many die?

"Retired teacher Tony Lloyd started collecting magnets in 1987. About 600 were given to him by his pupils Tony Lloyd's compulsion for collecting fridge magnets has seen him amass up to 5,000 mementoes in his home. The retired teacher started collecting them in 1987 while on a exchange trip to Australia and now they dominate three rooms in his house. His passion was even passed on to his students, who would bring back magnets from holidays for him. The 64-year-old from Cardiff says he can remember the story behind each one and which pupil gave each magnet. Mr Lloyd, a father of two from Rhiwbina, reckons his collection was bolstered by about 600 thanks to the pupils' efforts. He used to display the magnets on the walls of his primary school in Cowbridge. The collection contains magnets from at least 100 countries but Mr Lloyd could not find one in Mozambique ""I've a primary school teacher's mind and for most of them I remember the child who gave it to me and the story behind it,"" he says. ""Parents would say the [purpose] of the holidays was finding a magnet for Mr Lloyd. I had that story half a dozen times, whether it was the Greek islands or New York."" And when he was presented with the gift? ""I always treated every magnet as if I was enthralled by it. ""It wasn't the magnet but the thought behind it. Those kids remembered and bothered and that's priceless and shows mutual respect."" Tony Lloyd quickly ran out of space on his fridge He was inspired to start the collection when he saw the fridge of an Australian couple who had picked up magnets during a year's travel around their country. Mr Lloyd was able to cover his fridge after spending a year in Australia on his exchange trip. Most of his magnets are now displayed on steel panels. The keen traveller has discerning tastes, preferring geographically informative souvenirs. ""I wouldn't buy anything cheap or tacky like animals dressed up or boiled eggs. ""In Windsor and London they have teddies dressed as kings and queens. It's an abomination,"" he jokes. Mr Lloyd was given a special collection by a stranger he met when travelling in the US On one occasion 30 were given to him in an unexpected way. ""I met a guy on the way from Detroit to New York and he told me his wife had recently died. ""We got talking about my magnets and he said his wife had had quite a collection."" Six months later a package arrived in the post, the postage costing $17 (at today's rates Â£13.60), he says. ""He wanted the magnets to go somewhere special. She had collected Broadway shows - Jersey Boys and Chicago. ""He said 'You've obviously got a passion'. I felt very touched by that."" Asked why he does it he says ""It's a typical male compulsive disorder. I collect full-size flags as well."" And what do his friends make of it? ""They think it's slightly eccentric. It's a talking point."" The world record for the largest collection of fridge magnets is held by Louise J Greenfarb from Las Vegas. She has 35,000 non-duplicated fridge magnets that she has been collecting since the 1970s, according to Guinness World Records. Mr Lloyd, who is retired, teaches English as a foreign language and is a tour guide, and does not expect he will ever match that achievement. But his next trip abroad will take him to his 101st international destination, the Maldives. He racked up his 100th, Cuba, last year. And there are no prizes for guessing what he will bring home.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""I inherited a mess"" Today totally typified the unexpected and unpredictable nature of covering the 45th president of the United States. I was at home, working on a book I am trying to finish when there was a flash on the TV: Donald Trump to hold unscheduled news conference in an hour's time. I legged it down to the White House, and on a cold Washington morning waited outside the East Wing for 45 minutes until the Secret Service let us in. I knew if I was to get a question in I would need to be near the front. For half an hour the president berated us. This video can not be played Trump's busy first month in 90 seconds Never had there been a more dishonest group of people. We were out of control. Wild. Feral. Not to be trusted. And then it was questions. He called various journalists he knew. Then I managed to catch his eye. And this is what followed: This video can not be played Trump to BBC correspondent Jon Sopel: Here's another beauty Me:Could I just ask you, thank you very much, Mr President. The trouble... President Trump:Where are you from? Me:BBC. President Trump:Here's another beauty. Me:That's a good line. Impartial, free and fair. President Trump:Yeah. Sure. Me:Mr President... President Trump:Just like CNN right? Me:On the travel ban - we could banter back and forth. On the travel ban would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government... President Trump:Yeah, I do. I do. Let me tell you about this government... Me:Were there any mistakes... President Trump:Wait. Wait. I know who you are. Just wait. Let me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban. But we had a bad court. Got a bad decision... It was quite the most extraordinary news conference I have attended. As I say, everything about reporting on this presidency is unexpected and unpredictable. This video can not be played Where do Donald Trump supporters get their news from? He is angry at times, proud of what he's achieving, furious that he's not getting the recognition he feels he deserves, obsessed by the polls, obsessed by the size of his crowd. And here's my one curious takeaway. The media that he professes to hate and despise he seems to spend an awful lot of time watching. You wonder, when does he find time to govern?

"Donald Trump reportedly started work in the Oval Office on Thursday morning and told his staff he wanted to hold a press conference that day. And so he did. Boy, did he. The event, ostensibly an announcement of the president's new pick for labour secretary, was anything but routine. New nominee Alexander Acosta wasn't even in attendance - and it probably wasn't a bad thing that he missed out, since he quickly became an afterthought to the 76-minute free-form scrum that ensued. So much for White House message discipline. Instead, it was Trump being Trump. The off-the-cuff style got him elected president, of course, so perhaps it's how he will reboot his four-week-old (!) presidency.  Donald Trump was off the leash - just the way he seems to like it. Here are some of the highlights. Thursday's press conference was Trump v the Media, round eleventy-billion. Mr Trump said mainstream journalists were the voice of a ""broken system"" of special interests that he is challenging - which can only be catnip for his base and a way of insulating himself against the recent barrage of negative stories. When pressed on the simmering scandal over former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's contacts with Russia and how the White House handled them, the president parried and then went after ""dishonest"" reporters who should be ""ashamed"" about inaccurate reporting based on illegal leaks (the president did not acknowledge the apparent contradiction in such a statement). He blamed reporters for the New York Times and Wall Street Journal for not directly contacting him before running unflattering stories, as though they had his personal mobile number. He even engaged in a bit of presidential concern-trolling, telling a CNN reporter his network would ""do much better by being different"". ""I started off today by saying that it's so important to the public to get an honest press,"" Mr Trump continued. ""The public doesn't believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don't know. But they don't believe you."" Mr Trump seemed to be at his happiest in this back-and-forth with hostile reporters over whether or not the media are honest - and with good reason. While journalists care deeply about the reputation of their profession, the general public probably views it as so much navel-gazing. Every minute debating the impartiality and truthfulness of the press is a battle fought on terrain friendly to the president. This video can not be played Trump was challenged by NBC on his false election boast Mr Trump has a habit of making statements that have, shall we say, a sometimes distant relationship with reality. He often couches the remarks in phrases like ""I've heard"", ""people are saying"", or ""I guess"". Such was the case when he turned once again - in the scripted portion of his press conference, no less - to the size of his Electoral College victory last November. In a bit of a twist, however, a reporter from NBC, Peter Alexander, called him on it minutes later. He said that Barack Obama and Bill Clinton posted bigger margins of victory. Mr Trump replied that he was referring to Republican presidents. Alexander countered that George HW Bush had a bigger win, too. ""Why should Americans trust you when you accuse the information they've received as being fake, when you provide information that's not accurate?"" he asked. Trump replied that it was information he ""was given"" and had ""seen around"", before saying that it was still a ""very substantial victory"" - a claim much more difficult to disprove. President Trump, like Candidate Trump, has seemed invulnerable to fact-checkers, perhaps in part because he's moved on to a hundred different topics before the media watchdogs can catch up. Thursday, for at least a brief moment, was different. The event on Thursday was billed as a press conference, but for the first half-hour it seemed more like an unpolished mid-day State of Union address. It was a chance for the president to talk over the gathered heads of the journalists in remarks broadcast on three of the four major US commercial networks and all the cable news outlets. He spoke about the jobs he's brought back to the US - anecdotal and small-bore though they may be. He spoke of ""productive talks"" he's had with world leaders and the request he's made for his military to come up with a plan to defeat the so-called Islamic state. He cited executive actions withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and cutting back on government regulations. He boasted of task forces created, councils formed and agency co-ordination instructed. And he touted his immigration efforts - a key piece of which is currently suspended pending court review. ""This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country,"" Mr Trump asserted again. ""And we have not even started the big work yet."" That last part is definitely true. While the Trump administration has seemed to be in a flurry of activity, legislatively there has been relatively little accomplished. Within the first four weeks of his presidency, Mr Obama had signed into law a measure increasing protection for women's wages in the workplace and a massive economic stimulus bill that included more than $800bn in new federal spending. After four weeks, Mr Trump still has 98% of his presidency ahead of him. The start has been rocky, and less accomplished than he says, but the jury is still out. One of the criticisms that seems to irk Mr Trump the most is that his presidency has been beset by ""chaos"" and mismanagement. Mr Trump lays part of the blame at the feet of Democrats, whom he says have been slow to approve his top-level cabinet appointments. While part of this assuredly true, as Democrats slow-walked several of his nominees, others have been tardy because there were delays in submitting vetting paperwork or in the announcement of the nominations. Perhaps of greater cause for concern is the lack of lower-level appointments announced. In key departments like state and treasury, the under-secretary slots remain largely unfilled. Then there's the ongoing palace intrigue within the White House, which Mr Trump glossed over. He said that his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, is ""working so hard just putting out fires"" - but some of those fires are coming from within his own administration. Inone,externalWashington Post story, an unnamed White House official said Priebus had to ""become more competent"". There's talk of rival factions within the Trump team, with pragmatists like Priebus squared off against longtime Trump true-believers like Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller. When asked by the BBC's Jon Sopel about one of the most-cited example of White House chaos - the confusion surrounding the administration's rollout of the Mr Trump's immigration order - the president was defiant. ""We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban,"" he said. ""But we had a bad court."" The court decisions Mr Trump was apparently referencing - either by the Seattle judge who suspended implementation of the ban or the appellate court that upheld the injunction - came well after the first few unruly days of implementation, however, when US immigration officials seemed uncertain of how to apply the broadly worded order. Perhaps ""chaos"" is too strong a word, but ""smooth"" is downplaying the confusion, particularly for permanent US residents from Iran, Iraq and other targeted nations who were left wondering whether they could safely enter the US. After berating a CNN reporter, calling Jon Sopel and BBC News ""another beauty"" and repeatedly telling a Jewish reporter asking about anti-Semitism to be quiet, Mr Trump finally found a question he liked - from an independent reporter named Kyle Mazza. ""Can you tell us all the things Melania does for the country?"" he asked, referring to the president's wife. ""That is what I call a nice question,"" Mr Trump responded, before extolling the virtues of the first lady. ""I've known her for a long time,"" he said. ""She was a very successful person. She was a very successful model. She did really well."" Mr Trump had been criticised for only calling on friendly reporters over the course of the last three press availabilities - all joint appearances with foreign leaders where a total of six questions from US journalists were permitted. Mr Trump chose conservative news outlets like Townhall, the Daily Caller and Newsmax over traditional mainstream media reporters. On Thursday, however, Mr Trump took the media's best shot - although he carped about how he'd be portrayed as ""ranting and raving"" in the subsequent coverage. He may not have ranted and raved, but it was a most unusual press conference nonetheless.

"Once doted on by his father, Kim Jong-nam had a long fall from grace as a man On Monday, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was killed in Malaysia. The BBC's Karishma Vaswani in Kuala Lumpur dissects a week of mystery and intrigue. It's been almost a week since the mysterious death of a Korean man at Kuala Lumpur airport and there are still no real answers. Initially, Malaysia refused to identify the dead man as Kim Jong-nam, saying just that the passport he had on him was under the name Kim Chol. This despite South Korea's insistence that it was indeed him, killed on the orders of North Korea's brutal regime. Malaysia finally confirmed for the first time on Wednesday that the dead man was indeed the half-brother of the North Korean leader. Zahid Hamidi, Malaysia's deputy prime minister, told reporters: ""I think he carries two different identities. Probably this [passport] is an undercover document."" Kim Jong-nam: North Korea's critic in exile Death in a dynasty: What led to the demise of Kim Jong-nam? North Korea's foreign assassinations Malaysia's cautious handling of this case has been evident from the start. The police have been sparing with their details, with official statements about arrests coming hours after they've already been widely reported. Kim Jong-nam had openly criticised North Korea and called for it to open up There have also been conflicting and often contradictory accounts from different divisions of the police - national and district - adding more confusion to the story. But here's what we do know:three people have been arrested so far.Two women are amongst them. Police say one is Indonesian while the other was carrying a Vietnamese passport. A third suspect - a Malaysian man police say is the boyfriend of the Indonesian - has also been detained. Police have detained the suspects for seven days for further questioning. One suspect wore a shirt with ""LOL"" - ""laugh out loud"" - written on it Still, nothing is known about how closely connected they are to the death of Kim Jong-nam, nor indeed why and exactly how he died. Malaysian police have told me that the two women were both identified from CCTV camera footage captured at the scene of the alleged crime. I went to the airport terminal where the attack happened to see for myself how it might be possible to get away with murder in broad daylight. The facts in this case are murky to say the least. But based on police reports, this is what appears to have happened. On Monday, Kim Jong-nam was about to board a flight. He is thought to have arrived in Kuala Lumpur on 6 February and was on his way back to Macau, where it is believed he lived. But while he was at the airport, some police reports say at least one woman is thought to have accosted him, and covered his face with a cloth doused in some sort of burning or poisonous chemical. He then went to the information counter and is thought to have asked for help. Subsequently it appears he was taken to the medical clinic in the airport from where he was sent to hospital, dying en route. All eyes are now on the forensic department of the hospital analysing Mr Kim's body But when I spoke to staff at the airport who may have witnessed what happened, no-one was willing to talk to me. At least two people said they had been told by police and their bosses not to speak to the media or divulge any details of what happened. So there's a lot we still don't know. What kind of chemical was used in the apparent poisoning? How exactly did he die? The post-mortem examination of his body has been completed, but details have yet to be released to the public. We also don't know what he was doing in Malaysia, although we understand that he did come here fairly frequently. I tried to track some of Kim Jong-nam's old haunts in Kuala Lumpur, which led me to a Korean restaurant in the centre of town. At the restaurant, the mainly Bangladeshi and Burmese staff had no idea who Kim Jong-nam was. But the owner of the restaurant is Korean, and he did speak to me. He refused to meet me in person though, choosing to speak to me on the phone. He also didn't want to be filmed or named because he was afraid of being linked to Mr Kim. But he said Mr Kim was a regular customer at his restaurant, and that he would bring bodyguards with him. In halting English, he told me Mr Kim often spoke to him and told him he feared for his life. ""Scared, yes,"" he told me. ""He was sure scared, because Kim Jong-un planned to kill him since so far five years."" The case has attracted intense interest in South Korea North Korea hasn't said anything about the death and it's highly unlikely it ever will. All we have heard about what Pyongyang wants is from Malaysian officials, who have said they will turn the body over if a formal written request is made. Instead, the focus in Pyongyang this week has been on the 75th anniversary celebrations of the current leader's father, Kim Jong-il. In North Korea's secretive regime, unanswered questions are a way of life. Kim Jong-nam: North Korea's critic in exile Death in a dynasty: What led to the demise of Kim Jong-nam?

"Schools have been warning the prime minister that the sums for school budgets do not add up After the NHS and social care, is the next funding crisis going to be in England's schools? Like a snowball getting bigger as it rolls downhill, momentum is gathering around the warnings of school leaders about impending cash problems. Head teachers have said alack of cash might force them to cut school hours. Ministers were forced by a Parliamentary question to reveal thatmore than half of academies lacked enough income to cover their expenditure. And school governors - the embodiment of local civic worthies - havethreatened to go on strike for the first time, rather than sign off such underfunded budgets. Petitions and protest letters have been sent to MPs about cuts to jobs and school services - and warning letters from head teachers will have been sent home to alert parents. Grammar school head teachers have gone a step further and warned thatparents might to have to payto make up the shortfall. School leaders see themselves rather like look-outs on the Titanic shouting out that there's a great big iceberg ahead - backed by the National Audit Office's finding that schools face 8% real-term spending cuts, worth Â£3bn, by 2020. The spending watchdog says costs for schools are outstripping the budgets allocated by the government. The spending watchdog says schools will have to find Â£3bn in budget cuts The missing piece in this debate has been any real sign of movement from the government - other than to keep repeating that school funding is at record levels. But plenty will be going on behind the scenes, and there is no shortage of ""insiders"" with views on what's happening. It's claimed that ministers can't sign a birthday card without getting clearance from 10 Downing Street. So education ministers are unable to give any indication of funding changes, in part because a consultation is still taking place and more particularly because it isn't in their gift to decide. But there are options thought to be under discussion. The government has announced a new formula for allocating funding to schools, responding to years of complaints about regional inequalities. But a number of Conservative MPs in rural and suburban areas have been energetically lobbying that this slicing up of the cake is still too much in favour of the inner cities. If the formula was shifted around a little, such as putting less emphasis on deprivation, it could shift funding from London and the big cities towards the shires. This would not have much electoral cost for the Conservatives as their support is not in these inner-city areas. But it would be a big call in terms of political purpose to cut funding from areas of deprivation. Another approach would be to start including pupil premium money - targeted at deprived children - into the general funding equation.

It was revealed that of the money earmarked for the ill-fated plan turn all schools into academies,Â£384m had been taken back by the Treasury. Heads have protested to MPs at the decisions they face in making cuts This Â£384m has been claimed as being enough to make sure that there are no losers in the funding formula shake-up. If this cash could be ""rediscovered"" in a virtual shoebox in the Treasury, it could come back into play, getting the government off a funding hook - without actually having to find new money. The apprenticeship levy, about to be introduced, has also been seen as a potential pot of money. TheInstitute for Fiscal Studies says by 2019-20 it will be raising Â£2.8bn from employers - but only Â£640m is set to be spent on apprenticeships. The Department for Education has so far not been able to explain where the rest of this money might be heading. Of course, another option is that the government refuses to move and schools have to operate within their budgets. What would this mean in practice? To take a real-life example shown to the BBC, what happens when a secondary school faces a shortfall of Â£350,000. The only way to make such savings is to cut staff - heads and governing bodies will be making such tough decisions. Which subject should they stop teaching? Which teachers should they make redundant? Should they get rid of counsellors for mental health problems? Should they merge classes? And who gets to lose out on the quality of their education? This has left head teachers furious. There has always been a well-developed moaning culture in education, but there is no escaping the outrage among school leaders about the lack of political response to funding worries. They were even more livid when they found that the government had found money to expand grammar schools - and have written angry letters asking which services they should cut in their own schools. They see ministers and MPs rather like untrustworthy children who won't take responsibility for their decisions. There is also brinkmanship on both sides. Will schools really send home children because of a lack of cash? And the government will worry that if they crack over schools, it would start a feeding frenzy of other demands on public spending. A Department for Education spokesman said that school funding is already at its highest level - more than Â£40bn for 2016-17. And the department says that it has grasped the nettle of introducing a long overdue national funding formula. ""Significant protections have also been built into the formula so that no school will face a reduction of more than more than 1.5% per pupil per year or 3% per pupil overall.

"The NHS was founded on the basis of free care for all at the point of delivery. It is a principle held dear by many in the UK. But with the health service under unprecedented pressure is it time to introduce charges? That was the most popular question readers of the BBC website wanted exploring when we canvassed them during NHS Health Check, our special week of coverage last week. Our health correspondent Nick Triggle has been looking into the issue. The first thing to point out is that there is already charging in the NHS. In the early 1950s, when money was tight, ministers introduced fees for prescriptions, dentistry and spectacles. But since then there has been little change - apart from the introduction of charges for eye tests in the 1980s. However, it is an issue that keeps cropping up as a possible solution to the ever-rising demand and squeeze on finances. In recent years, the Royal College of Nursing and British Medical Association have discussed it at their annual conferences. An option often put forward is a charge to see a GP. Hilary Hegarty asked whether a Â£10 charge for every visit to the GP would help. Wellresearch in 2013 by Reform,external, a centre-right think tank, found a Â£10 charge for consultations could raise Â£1.2bn a year even with exemptions for age and income. Charging also featured in the poll carried out by Ipsos MORI for the BBC during our NHS Health Check week. A majority were opposed to the idea of charging generally. But there did seem to be more appetite for charging people whose conditions were caused by their lifestyles, an idea suggested by David McLay from Falkirk, who wanted to know how much pressure was put on the NHS by those attending A&E and hospital with drink and drug-related illnesses. There was also appetite for increasing the charges applied to foreign nationals. The issue of foreign patients is a topic that has regularly been in the news and one that Elizabeth Morgan asked about. She questioned why ""health tourism"" has been ignored for so long while Dan wanted to know how much difference recouping money from non-UK residents would make to the NHS budget. Well thegovernment in England has already announced a crackdown, although it is mainly focused on ensuring the NHS does better at recouping costs for non-urgent care from foreign patients. The government in England has set a target of Â£500m by next year, but is recouping just over half of that at the moment. UK residents and asylum seekers are entitled to free treatment. But the governments of patients from within the European Economic Area should be charged for the treatment they receive, while visitors from outside that area should be charged personally. To incentivise the NHS to do better, hospitals are able to charge individuals 150% of the cost of care and last week they said fees should be recouped upfront. Health surcharges have also been introduced for visa applications. Where else could fees be applied? One suggestion - and it received the backing of seven in 10 who took part in the BBC poll - was to applycharges for missed appointments. Ministers estimated the problem costs the NHS about Â£1bn - nearly 1% of its annual budget. But Royal College of GPs president Dr Helen Stokes-Lampard believes it would be unworkable. ""The work involved in just setting up a system and administering it would render it not worthwhile. It would cost more than it raised."" 1948: Prescriptions, dental care and spectacles are all provided free on the NHS. 1952: Charging is introduced for all three. The prospect of this was a factor in the resignation of Nye Bevan from government a year earlier. 1965: Prescription charges are abolished by the Wilson government. 1968: Prescription charges are reintroduced. Treasury also supports GP consultation charges, but move blocked. 1988: Free NHS eye tests are abolished. 1999: Abolition of sight test charge for over-60s. 2004: Hospital charges introduced for telephones and television. 2006: Scotland introduces free eye tests. 2007-11: Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland abolish prescription charges. However, other countries manage to introduce charging. If you look at OECD countries - that is the most wealthy - two-thirds charge to see a GP and half charge for some element of hospital care. Often the charges are small, but they have the effect - advocates say - of encouraging the responsible use of health services. Exemptions are in place for children, older people and the least well-off. Indeed, you do not have to go far to find charging in action. Just a hundred miles off the south coast of England, residents in the channel island of Guernsey are expected to pay for some aspects of their care - or take out health insurance. The government covers about a quarter of the costs, leaving patients to pick up a bill of Â£50 to visit a GP and up to Â£350 for an A&E visit. But critics there say it can put people off seeking medical help - something which cannot be said for the NHS model. Hence whenever the issue of charging crops up, the government is adamant it is simply not an option. In fact, there is evidence in some areas to suggest scrapping existing charges could be beneficial. In 2006, Scotland re-introduced free eye tests. Research suggests they are worth Â£440m a year in terms of improving quality of life and early detection - more than the cost of paying for them.

"Once doted on by his father, Kim Jong-nam had a long fall from grace as a man On Monday, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was killed in Malaysia. The BBC's Karishma Vaswani in Kuala Lumpur dissects a week of mystery and intrigue. It's been almost a week since the mysterious death of a Korean man at Kuala Lumpur airport and there are still no real answers. Initially, Malaysia refused to identify the dead man as Kim Jong-nam, saying just that the passport he had on him was under the name Kim Chol. This despite South Korea's insistence that it was indeed him, killed on the orders of North Korea's brutal regime. Malaysia finally confirmed for the first time on Wednesday that the dead man was indeed the half-brother of the North Korean leader. Zahid Hamidi, Malaysia's deputy prime minister, told reporters: ""I think he carries two different identities. Probably this [passport] is an undercover document."" Kim Jong-nam: North Korea's critic in exile Death in a dynasty: What led to the demise of Kim Jong-nam? North Korea's foreign assassinations Malaysia's cautious handling of this case has been evident from the start. The police have been sparing with their details, with official statements about arrests coming hours after they've already been widely reported. Kim Jong-nam had openly criticised North Korea and called for it to open up There have also been conflicting and often contradictory accounts from different divisions of the police - national and district - adding more confusion to the story. But here's what we do know:three people have been arrested so far.Two women are amongst them. Police say one is Indonesian while the other was carrying a Vietnamese passport. A third suspect - a Malaysian man police say is the boyfriend of the Indonesian - has also been detained. Police have detained the suspects for seven days for further questioning. One suspect wore a shirt with ""LOL"" - ""laugh out loud"" - written on it Still, nothing is known about how closely connected they are to the death of Kim Jong-nam, nor indeed why and exactly how he died. Malaysian police have told me that the two women were both identified from CCTV camera footage captured at the scene of the alleged crime. I went to the airport terminal where the attack happened to see for myself how it might be possible to get away with murder in broad daylight. The facts in this case are murky to say the least. But based on police reports, this is what appears to have happened. On Monday, Kim Jong-nam was about to board a flight. He is thought to have arrived in Kuala Lumpur on 6 February and was on his way back to Macau, where it is believed he lived. But while he was at the airport, some police reports say at least one woman is thought to have accosted him, and covered his face with a cloth doused in some sort of burning or poisonous chemical. He then went to the information counter and is thought to have asked for help. Subsequently it appears he was taken to the medical clinic in the airport from where he was sent to hospital, dying en route. All eyes are now on the forensic department of the hospital analysing Mr Kim's body But when I spoke to staff at the airport who may have witnessed what happened, no-one was willing to talk to me. At least two people said they had been told by police and their bosses not to speak to the media or divulge any details of what happened. So there's a lot we still don't know. What kind of chemical was used in the apparent poisoning? How exactly did he die? The post-mortem examination of his body has been completed, but details have yet to be released to the public. We also don't know what he was doing in Malaysia, although we understand that he did come here fairly frequently. I tried to track some of Kim Jong-nam's old haunts in Kuala Lumpur, which led me to a Korean restaurant in the centre of town. At the restaurant, the mainly Bangladeshi and Burmese staff had no idea who Kim Jong-nam was. But the owner of the restaurant is Korean, and he did speak to me. He refused to meet me in person though, choosing to speak to me on the phone. He also didn't want to be filmed or named because he was afraid of being linked to Mr Kim. But he said Mr Kim was a regular customer at his restaurant, and that he would bring bodyguards with him. In halting English, he told me Mr Kim often spoke to him and told him he feared for his life. ""Scared, yes,"" he told me. ""He was sure scared, because Kim Jong-un planned to kill him since so far five years."" The case has attracted intense interest in South Korea North Korea hasn't said anything about the death and it's highly unlikely it ever will. All we have heard about what Pyongyang wants is from Malaysian officials, who have said they will turn the body over if a formal written request is made. Instead, the focus in Pyongyang this week has been on the 75th anniversary celebrations of the current leader's father, Kim Jong-il.

"Schools have been warning the prime minister that the sums for school budgets do not add up After the NHS and social care, is the next funding crisis going to be in England's schools? Like a snowball getting bigger as it rolls downhill, momentum is gathering around the warnings of school leaders about impending cash problems. Head teachers have said alack of cash might force them to cut school hours. Ministers were forced by a Parliamentary question to reveal thatmore than half of academies lacked enough income to cover their expenditure. And school governors - the embodiment of local civic worthies - havethreatened to go on strike for the first time, rather than sign off such underfunded budgets. Petitions and protest letters have been sent to MPs about cuts to jobs and school services - and warning letters from head teachers will have been sent home to alert parents. Grammar school head teachers have gone a step further and warned thatparents might to have to payto make up the shortfall. School leaders see themselves rather like look-outs on the Titanic shouting out that there's a great big iceberg ahead - backed by the National Audit Office's finding that schools face 8% real-term spending cuts, worth Â£3bn, by 2020. The spending watchdog says costs for schools are outstripping the budgets allocated by the government. The spending watchdog says schools will have to find Â£3bn in budget cuts The missing piece in this debate has been any real sign of movement from the government - other than to keep repeating that school funding is at record levels. But plenty will be going on behind the scenes, and there is no shortage of ""insiders"" with views on what's happening. It's claimed that ministers can't sign a birthday card without getting clearance from 10 Downing Street. So education ministers are unable to give any indication of funding changes, in part because a consultation is still taking place and more particularly because it isn't in their gift to decide. But there are options thought to be under discussion. The government has announced a new formula for allocating funding to schools, responding to years of complaints about regional inequalities. But a number of Conservative MPs in rural and suburban areas have been energetically lobbying that this slicing up of the cake is still too much in favour of the inner cities. If the formula was shifted around a little, such as putting less emphasis on deprivation, it could shift funding from London and the big cities towards the shires. This would not have much electoral cost for the Conservatives as their support is not in these inner-city areas. But it would be a big call in terms of political purpose to cut funding from areas of deprivation. Another approach would be to start including pupil premium money - targeted at deprived children - into the general funding equation. This really would mark the formal detonation of the last pillars of the Cameron and coalition era, for which the pupil premium was a moral touchstone. There are other more creative possibilities. It was revealed that of the money earmarked for the ill-fated plan turn all schools into academies,Â£384m had been taken back by the Treasury. Heads have protested to MPs at the decisions they face in making cuts This Â£384m has been claimed as being enough to make sure that there are no losers in the funding formula shake-up. If this cash could be ""rediscovered"" in a virtual shoebox in the Treasury, it could come back into play, getting the government off a funding hook - without actually having to find new money. The apprenticeship levy, about to be introduced, has also been seen as a potential pot of money. TheInstitute for Fiscal Studies says by 2019-20 it will be raising Â£2.8bn from employers - but only Â£640m is set to be spent on apprenticeships. The Department for Education has so far not been able to explain where the rest of this money might be heading. Of course, another option is that the government refuses to move and schools have to operate within their budgets. What would this mean in practice? To take a real-life example shown to the BBC, what happens when a secondary school faces a shortfall of Â£350,000. The only way to make such savings is to cut staff - heads and governing bodies will be making such tough decisions. Which subject should they stop teaching? Which teachers should they make redundant? Should they get rid of counsellors for mental health problems? Should they merge classes? And who gets to lose out on the quality of their education? This has left head teachers furious. There has always been a well-developed moaning culture in education, but there is no escaping the outrage among school leaders about the lack of political response to funding worries. They were even more livid when they found that the government had found money to expand grammar schools - and have written angry letters asking which services they should cut in their own schools.

Health surcharges have also been introduced for visa applications. Where else could fees be applied? One suggestion - and it received the backing of seven in 10 who took part in the BBC poll - was to applycharges for missed appointments. Ministers estimated the problem costs the NHS about Â£1bn - nearly 1% of its annual budget. But Royal College of GPs president Dr Helen Stokes-Lampard believes it would be unworkable. ""The work involved in just setting up a system and administering it would render it not worthwhile. It would cost more than it raised."" 1948: Prescriptions, dental care and spectacles are all provided free on the NHS. 1952: Charging is introduced for all three. The prospect of this was a factor in the resignation of Nye Bevan from government a year earlier. 1965: Prescription charges are abolished by the Wilson government. 1968: Prescription charges are reintroduced. Treasury also supports GP consultation charges, but move blocked. 1988: Free NHS eye tests are abolished. 1999: Abolition of sight test charge for over-60s. 2004: Hospital charges introduced for telephones and television. 2006: Scotland introduces free eye tests. 2007-11: Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland abolish prescription charges. However, other countries manage to introduce charging. If you look at OECD countries - that is the most wealthy - two-thirds charge to see a GP and half charge for some element of hospital care. Often the charges are small, but they have the effect - advocates say - of encouraging the responsible use of health services. Exemptions are in place for children, older people and the least well-off. Indeed, you do not have to go far to find charging in action. Just a hundred miles off the south coast of England, residents in the channel island of Guernsey are expected to pay for some aspects of their care - or take out health insurance. The government covers about a quarter of the costs, leaving patients to pick up a bill of Â£50 to visit a GP and up to Â£350 for an A&E visit. But critics there say it can put people off seeking medical help - something which cannot be said for the NHS model. Hence whenever the issue of charging crops up, the government is adamant it is simply not an option. In fact, there is evidence in some areas to suggest scrapping existing charges could be beneficial. In 2006, Scotland re-introduced free eye tests. Research suggests they are worth Â£440m a year in terms of improving quality of life and early detection - more than the cost of paying for them.

"This video can not be played Trump and Netanyahu - in 90 seconds A playful exchange between President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu actually said a great deal about the dim prospects of a successful negotiation with the Palestinians under current circumstances. ""I think we're going to make a deal,"" President Trump said on Tuesday as he rolled out the red carpet for Mr Netanyahu at the White House. The contrast in the tone of the US-Israeli relationship was tangible given the well-documented tension between Mr Netanyahu and Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama. ""It might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand. That's a possibility,"" Mr Trump added. ""So let's see what we do."" ""Let's try,"" responded Mr Netanyahu. When Mr Trump chided him for not sounding sufficiently optimistic, the prime minister quipped, ""That's the 'art of the deal'."" Actually, it's the reality of the Middle East peace process, a hall of mirrors with a grim regional reality, a host of historical grievances, and zero-sum politics that make the odds of a meaningful negotiation remote, much less an actual agreement. US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, here next to wives Melania and Sara Notwithstanding the obvious chemistry between Mr Trump and Mr Netanyahu - and a longstanding personal connection between Mr Netanyahu and Mr Trump's designated Middle East envoy and son-in-law, Jared Kushner - there is no chemistry between the Israeli leader and his Palestinian counterpart, President Mahmoud Abbas. ""As with any successful negotiation, both sides will have to make compromises,"" Mr Trump observed correctly. However, the parties themselves are farther apart on the substance of the process - the borders of a Palestinian state, Israeli security arrangements within a Palestinian state, the right of return for Palestinian refugees and the status of Jerusalem - than they were at the end of the Clinton administration. What will Trump mean for Israel? Is one homeland the solution? Blame and bitterness keeping peace at bay Both the Bush and Obama administrations expended considerable effort to close existing gaps and achieve at least a framework agreement that would set the stage for a final deal. Neither was successful. Obstacles were less about substance than politics. The centre of Israeli politics has moved markedly to the right; the left that embraced the essential bargain of the Oslo process, land for peace, has receded. The existing Israeli governing coalition is not wired to make concessions. In fact, it is pushing Mr Netanyahu to increase the settlement presence in the West Bank while accelerating construction in East Jerusalem. An Israeli soldier stands inside a guarding booth in the Gush Etzion Israeli settlement block in the occupied West Bank In 2009, the Obama administration demanded a freeze to all settlement activity. Israel reluctantly agreed, although some growth continued within settlements Israel would keep in any final deal. Rather than accelerate negotiations, settlements became a bone of contention within them. When the 10-month settlement moratorium ended, so did direct negotiations. Secretary of State John Kerry tried to achieve a framework agreement during Mr Obama's second term, but his one-year effort fell short. In a parting shot at Israel, when a resolution came before the UN Security Council declaring settlement activity to be an impediment to peace, the Obama administration abstained. President Trump criticised the ""unfair and one-sided"" treatment of Israel at the UN, a gesture Mr Netanyahu welcomed. Days before the meeting, the Trump White House cautioned the Israeli government that expansion of settlements beyond their existing borders was not helpful. Mr Netanyahu may moderate the current pace of settlement activity but he is not going to stop it. The Palestinians will continue to see settlement activity as a fundamental problem. A woman in the US during a ""Muslim and Jewish Solidarity"" protest. Mr Netanyahu is nicknamed ""Bibi"" The Palestinians are deeply divided. In 2006, Hamas won an unexpected majority of seats in the Palestinian legislature over Mr Abbas' Fatah Party. The Palestinians have lacked political unity ever since. Today, Hamas, not the Palestinian Authority, is the de facto government in Gaza. Full elections have not been held in more than a decade. The bottom line is that both sides prefer the status quo to making the politically painful concessions that a negotiation would require. Both Mr Trump and Mr Netanyahu hope to pursue an ""outside-in"" strategy, building on shared regional concern regarding Iran and radical extremists including the Islamic State group to create momentum to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While reasonable in theory - Mr Netanyahu spoke of partnership with Arab states in opposition to Iran - co-operation at the governmental level does not necessarily translate to popular support. For many in the region, the plight of the Palestinians continues to resonate. Given the limited prospects confronting a two-state solution - progress that likely requires different leaders and mandates on both sides - President Trump made a small, but significant adjustment in US policy, expressing a willingness to support a one-state solution if both parties agree. But the two sides have very different visions of what a one-state solution looks like. A Palestinian man watches a joint press conference in the West Bank city of Hebron A key Netanyahu prerequisite for any deal is preservation of Israel as a Jewish state. On the other hand, in any agreement, Palestinians would insist on citizenship, voting rights and a government of and for the people - all of them. This could redefine Israel's identity. President Trump may see his one-state acknowledgement as the opening gambit in a lengthy negotiation. But a one-state solution potentially presents Israel with an existential choice. It can be a Jewish state or a democracy, but not both. That is a choice the United States has never wanted Israel to confront since the answer could have grave implications for the US-Israeli relationship.

"Anna LeBaron's father, Ervil, was the leader of a polygamous cult responsible for more than 20 murders. The killings continued even after his death thanks to a hit list he had left behind. Here Anna speaks for the first time about how she escaped from the cult - and her hope to ""redeem"" the LeBaron name. ""We were taught to live in awe of him as God's prophet, as the one true prophet on Earth."" There is a note of incredulity in Anna LeBaron's voice as she describes her childhood. She speaks slowly and deliberately, as though she can hardly believe it herself. ""We were taught that we were celestial children, having been born from the prophet Ervil LeBaron. And we believed it. Even though we were treated so poorly we still believed we were celestial children."" Anna says she can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times she was in the same room as her father. Yet the power Ervil LeBaron had over his followers, which included his 13 wives and more than 50 children, was absolute. ""He used fear to manipulate and control people,"" she says. ""We were absolutely afraid of not doing what we were told. And we didn't have a voice."" Anna has found her voice now. At 48, she shows no outward sign of the traumatised childhood she vividly describes in her new memoir The Polygamist's Daughter. Anna LeBaron was born in Mexico in what she would later learn was a cult hideout. Separated at an early age from her mother, Ervil's fourth wife Anna-Mae Marston, she grew up on the run from the law. Shuttled from one overcrowded safe house to the next, she slept on filthy foam mattresses and scavenged for food in dustbins with the other cult children and Ervil's ""sister wives"". ""We were taught that we were being persecuted because we were God's chosen people and that the world outside didn't understand us,"" she says. ""That was how they used to explain all the moving in the middle of the night and staying ahead of the law."" Anna LeBaron in her early teens with brother Eddie - before she ran away The children were used as unpaid labour in the domestic appliance repair shops that were the cult's main source of income - forced to scrub grease and grime from rusty ovens and refrigerators for 12 hours a day during school holidays. ""I watched siblings of mine receive horrific beatings for any type of attitude,"" Anna recalls. ""And these are young kids. They're kids. How much work can you really get out of a 10-year-old, or an 11-year-old, really? You can get work out of them if you are beating them."" The children were not cut-off entirely from the outside world. They were allowed to go to school, though they were not allowed to talk about what happened at home, and were ""taught to lie"" Anna says. The girls were the lowest of the low in the cult's pecking order. ""It was a patriarchy, for sure. And the young girls were groomed to become wives of polygamist men that already had wives. We were groomed to accept that and to know that that's where we were headed, when we became of marriageable age."" Marriageable age, in the LeBaron family, was 15, she says. ""So when I escaped at age 13 I escaped by the skin of my teeth!"" Ervil Morrell LeBaron was the founder of the Church of the Lamb of God, an offshoot of the Mormon religion He had 13 wives and more than 50 children To his followers, he was the One Mighty and Strong Prophet, sent to Earth to purify the Mormon faith Dubbed the Mormon Manson by the media, he is thought to have ordered the murders of dozens of people The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints expelled him in the 1950s because he practised polygamy, which it had abandoned in 1890 Anna did not know it at the time but her father - a powerful, charismatic figure, who at 6ft 4in towered over most of his disciples - was wanted by the FBI and the Mexican police for a string of murders on both sides of the border. He rarely got involved in the violence himself but ordered his followers to kill anyone - including one of his own wives and two of his children - who challenged his position as God's representative on Earth or who threatened to leave the cult and complain to the authorities. His followers believed he was receiving his instructions directly from God, having inherited the mantle of prophet from his father Alma Dayer LeBaron. ""When you are so convinced that someone is right, that you are willing to do anything - and even if you disagree, if you are so afraid to voice that disagreement and you just go and do it - that's the ultimate control,"" Anna says. ""And he had that. People did what he said. To their own detriment."" Ervil LeBaron with fourth wife Anna Mae Marston But Ervil did not have a monopoly on divine revelations. Three of his brothers had, at one time or another, claimed to be God's sole representative on Earth. Ervil had initially been a follower of his older brother Joel but the pair clashed over Ervil's money-making schemes, including a plan to transform Los Molinos, the modest Mexican settlement where the sect's 200 or so followers had set up home, into a beach resort. Joel kicked Ervil out of his Church of the Firstborn of the Fullness of Time in 1970.  So Ervil started his own sect, the Church of the Lamb of God, and set about eliminating his rivals - starting, in 1972, with Joel. Using the long-abandoned Mormon doctrine of ""blood atonement"" which sanctions the killing of sinners to cleanse them of evil, Ervil could claim he was doing his ever-growing list of victims a favour by allowing them to enter Heaven. God would reveal to Ervil the next victim and he would hand-pick a team of disciples to carry out the hit. The murder plots grew increasingly sophisticated, involving wigs and theatrical make-up, and back-up squads in case the initial plan failed. Refusing to follow Ervil's command was not an option. ""People defied it and many of them paid for that with their lives. And it wasn't until after he died that it kind of started to break up and that power was lost,"" says Anna. ""However, even from the grave, he was able to control people and their actions and that is just mind-blowing - that from the grave he was able to do that."" Anna Mae Marston looking happy with some of her children Ervil had managed to evade justice in the Mexican courts over the murder of Joel and a deadly commando-style raid on Los Molinos, where the population were stubbornly refusing to accept him as their new prophet. He was eventually captured by Mexican police and handed over to the FBI in 1979, in circumstances that have never been fully explained. He was later jailed for life for orchestrating the murder of Rulon C Allred, the leader of a polygamous sect in Utah who had rejected Ervil's demands for money and recognition. Ervil died in Utah State Prison in 1981, after suffering a seizure. But his reign of terror was far from over. A bloody battle for the succession ensued, with Ervil's chief henchman, Dan Jordan, making an early play for the mantle of prophet - a terrifying prospect for Anna, who had suffered under the tyrannical regime in his Denver repair shop. Anna was now was living in Houston with her mother, half-sister Lillian and Lillian's husband, Mark Chynoweth, who also ran an appliance store. Lillian and Mark had been among the most fanatical of Ervil LeBaron's followers but after he was jailed they began to drift away from the cult, joining a Christian church and rejecting his polygamous creed. When Dan Jordan arrived in Houston to order Anna and her mother to return to Denver with him, the 13-year-old Anna rebelled. ""I could not believe that my mother had been talked back into going back to Denver when we were experiencing a life in Houston that was the most normal I had ever experienced.,"" she says. ""We had lived in the same house for about a year - the longest I had ever lived anywhere - and we were eating food that was purchased in grocery stores. And we were paid to work. We could save up money."" She realised that this might be the best chance she would get to take control of her life. ""It was now or never. And the feelings that I had inside, that bitterness and the injustices that we had experienced, left me with a very strong feeling about not wanting to go back."" Sisters - and sister-wives - Ramona and Faye LeBaron She could not have escaped without the help of Lillian, who hid her away in a motel room until her mother had returned to Denver with Jordan. Anna describes Lillian and Mark as the ""heroes"" of her story, for taking her in and giving her a chance to change the trajectory of her life. But their life together would not last. What they didn't know was that in prison Ervil had drawn up a hit list of 50 people he regarded as traitors, buried away in a final, rambling theological tract - The Book of the New Covenants - and that Mark's name was on it. After Dan Jordan was murdered in an apparent ""blood atonement"", Mark revealed that he and Jordan had been among a group of followers who had refused to carry out Ervil's orders to bust him out of prison ""guns blazing"" and so there was a good chance he would be targeted next. The 38-year-old refused to go into hiding. He opted instead to turn his suburban home into a fortress, but it wasn't enough. At 4pm on 27 June 1988, he was shot numerous times as he sat in his office chair at Reliance Appliances. At almost exactly the same time, Mark's brother Duane, owner of another Houston repair shop, was shot dead, along with his eight-year-old daughter Jennifer. And 200 miles away in Irving, Texas, another of Ervil's former disciples, Eddie Marston - Anna's half-brother - was gunned down next to his pick-up truck within five minutes of the first three killings. The Four O'Clock murders, as they became known, shocked America. Someone - most likely one of Ervil LeBaron's sons - was working their way through his hit list. The murders took place on the 144th anniversary of the death of Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormon church. Anna did her best to comfort Lillian and her six children, while dealing with her own fears. ""I don't think I was a personal target, however, I knew that if something happened, and I happened to be in the way, that I could also be killed. So it was a very frightening time. We were under police protection and it was just scary."" Mark Chynoweth had been the closest thing to a father figure in Anna's life, and she is close to tears as she talks about his death. As a teenager, she read about cult atrocities he had taken part in but  insists that was not the man she knew. ""Mark was a kind man. He was generous. And I don't believe for one minute that had he grown up in a normal family setting that he would have done any of the things that he was accused of, on his own. ""He was kind and loving. He was a good father to his children and losing him was very difficult, under the circumstances that we lost him."" In 1997, Anna's half-brother Aaron LeBaron, who had emerged from the succession battles as the One Mighty and Strong prophet, was sentenced to 45 years in prison for orchestrating the Four O'Clock murders. Four other cult members were also jailed for their part in the killings. By this point, Anna had made a decisive break from what remained of the cult, finding the strength to go away to college and attempt to build an independent life. She married David, her childhood sweetheart from Houston, who had joined the Marine Corps, and they started a family. She was determined to break free from polygamy, which she believes leads women to ""numb"" their emotions. ""I don't believe it's a natural relationship,"" she says. ""Most women will struggle, having to share their husband or their significant other."" It is not a view shared by her mother, with whom she remains in contact, and who stayed loyal to Ervil to the bitter end. ""My Mom still believes in the practice of polygamy as taught by [Mormon founder] Joseph Smith and still lives in a group that practises that, so that is a little bit difficult to process - how that can be something she sticks with even after all the devastation and the damage that it caused to her own children."" Jacqueline Tarsa LeBaron was the final cult member to be jailed over the Four O'Clock murders Anna battled depression after the death of Lillian Chynoweth, who committed suicide following her husband's murder in 1998. At first she coped with the trauma of losing so many loved ones by pretending it had happened to someone else. It would take years of painful therapy for her to finally ""acknowledge that these experiences are part of my past"". She now believes her father suffered from some form of mental illness for most of his adult life. ""It is sad to me that he was experiencing these things and not able to reach out and get the help he needed. But, of course, when you are the prophet, how much help do you actually think you'll need?"" Ervil's madness, if that's what it was, cast a long shadow over Anna and her siblings. The book was only closed on the Four O'Clock Murders in 2011, when after 20 years on the run Jacqueline Tarsa LeBaron became the sixth former cult member to be jailed for taking part in the plot. But Anna is convinced that the blood-letting is now, finally, at an end. ""I have five grown children and if me telling my story was to put me in any danger, or anybody that I loved and cared about, I would never have done this at all. I believe that is 100% in the past and there is no danger at all for me."" This video can not be played Anna LeBaron on how she escaped her father's polygamous cult She hopes that by telling her story, in The Polygamist's Daughter, she can ""help restore relationships in our family, instead of continuing to bring more separation and more fear"". In one passage, she describes a reunion with her half-brother Robert, who shot dead Duane Chynoweth and his eight-year-old daughter. Robert, who was just 17 at the time of the killings, received a reduced sentence for testifying against other family members. ""As I embraced my long-lost brother,"" she writes, ""the emotion I had held inside for years came out in floods of tears."" And despite everything, Anna says she is ""very proud"" of her family. ""Even people that were involved in some of the most horrific things that happened have gone on to become caring, kind, loving, productive members of society, that just want good in the world,"" she says. She hopes that the book's publication will help to ""redeem the LeBaron name,"" which remains one of the most infamous in American criminal history. But it is also an attempt to reassert her own identity, for so long suppressed by the cult and her father's malevolent legacy. ""Even though that life could have crushed who I am, in my spirit, in my soul, that has not been the last story,"" she says. ""So I kind of get to have the final word here, in saying, 'This is who I am.'""

"This video can not be played 'I was sweating and anxious' Secondary school teacher Daniel Gray has always kept his sexuality to himself at work. But to mark LGBT History Month, the 32-year-old from Brighton made the nerve-wracking decision to come out to more than 1,000 students. He tells his story to the BBC's Jennifer Scott. I didn't actually know I was gay when I was at secondary school. But it seemed everyone else in 1990s Basingstoke did. I was bullied every single day. I would get called homophobic names, be followed around by boys in gangs, pushed in corridors. There was an openly gay boy at school being bullied too. But when we went to a teacher, she said it was just the kind of thing you had to put up with. I wanted to be either a teacher or a pop star, there was never doubt in my mind. Teacher turned out to be the most realistic goal. It felt I could go back into a school and make up for the experience I had, right a few wrongs. It wasn't until I went to university that I realised. Going to a final year house party as a plus one led to me meeting a lot of gay people and I just felt more at home and comfortable then I ever had been. Daniel faced bullying throughout school, despite him not knowing he was gay until going to university in Brighton I took my first job in 2008. But as comfortable as I was with my sexuality, words from my teacher training stuck with me. The woman who ran the course said categorically not to reveal it to pupils as ""you don't want to give the students any more ammunition"". When I started working in a very strict Catholic school, I kept quiet. In my next school, I was ""out"" to colleagues but not to students - even though some of them probably knew. Two-and-a-half years ago, I started working at the Harris Academy in South Norwood, south London. I never felt like being gay was an issue, but those words from training stayed with me still. I had only ever heard of one other person who had come out at school,a teacher and campaigner called David Weston,external, but I didn't follow suit. Until David came in to our school that is. He was just doing some training, nothing to do with LGBT issues at all, but I remembered him and thought again. It felt like an instinct. It felt like something I had to do. LGBT History Month was coming up. We had a new man [principal] in charge and I thought, here is my chance. I thought I would have to go in and fight. But he said yes. He embraced it and told me he wanted to endorse it with all the staff. So it was on. I was going to tell over 1,000 teenagers in Croydon that I was gay. We teach across two sites so I couldn't be everywhere at once. As a media teacher, I decided to do a video. I spoke about LGBT History Month, all the things the school was doing to mark it for the first time. Then I looked directly into the camera and said: ""As a gay man, I know how important it is to have positive role models."" Sat in those assemblies, pressing play, waiting for the reaction, I cannot describe my nerves. But then I came on screen. There. I had done it. Daniel told over 1,000 pupils he was gay I didn't want it to be a big thing. I just wanted people to know I was there and to accept it as normal. Just having one teacher as a visible gay person in their lives could make a huge difference. One student came up to me after the assembly who I didn't know. I have never taught him before. He looked very nervous and a little shy. But he had something to say. ""Sir, your assembly has changed my life."" He walked away. But that moment, that single moment right there, reminded me why I am a teacher. Another student said ""Oh my God"" and gave me a high five. I just could not have imagined that. It hasn't all been rosy. We have had one complaint from a parent and we may get more. But, this is not the lasting thought I have about that day.  I want to focus on the positives. What I found particularly moving was the support from colleagues who even made classroom displays supporting LGBT rights following my assembly. A sign put up by one of Daniel's Christian colleagues in their classroom We are part of a federation of academies and, with the support of my head teacher, I am going to talk to others about going in and doing similar things. By coming out to my students, they can see that Mr Gray, the teacher they already know, is no different from anyone else. They also know that if they are struggling or need the support, there is someone there they can turn to. The only thing I would change? Not waiting nine years to do it. Nick Soar, executive principal of Harris Federation South and Upper Norwood When Daniel asked me if we could foreground LGBT month, I knew it was a moment early in my tenure to highlight to the staff and pupil body, and all parents, that I wanted to eliminate homophobia and, more widely, all forms of prejudice and hate. Ofsted, the schools' watchdog, is absolutely clear about language of prejudice and homophobia. Inspectors are explicitly told to examine if schools are aware of their statutory duties. The pastoral support for LGBT young people and staff has often been appalling in schools.
