"More than 500 people were injured when two trains collided head-on after a train driver missed a red signal on 5 October 1999 A Paddington rail disaster survivor has said he fears safety standards may be slipping 20 years after the crash. Thirty-one people died when two trains collided almost head-on after a driver missed a red signal on 5 October 1999. In 2018-19, 304 trains passed through red signals, a 10-year high, accordingto official data for England, Wales and Scotland.,external ""The risk now is that standards might drop,"" said Jonathan Duckworth, chair of the Paddington Survivors Group. He was one of 227 people hospitalised when his First Great Western train collided with another train at Ladbroke Grove, about two miles from its destination of Paddington, at a combined speed of about 130mph. In the 10 years following 1999 the number of Signals Passed at Danger (Spads) more than halved, from 593 to 273. But the number has begun to creep up again and July saw 41 Spads, more than one a day, the highest number in a single calendar month for 12 years. The UK has ""one of the safest railway networks in Europe"", rail minister Chris Heaton-Harris said. He added: ""We are continually learning how to make our railways safer, that is the legacy of a terrible disaster such as this. ""But disasters could happen any time. That is why one of my many jobs is to ensure we have safety hardwired into every decision that they make."" Emergency services freed 20 trapped survivors and took eight days to clear the scene of the crash. A 70-metre wall of fire engulfed the two trains as fuel caught alight following the collision at about 08:10 BST on a Tuesday morning 20 years ago. ""We went through a massive fireball. I could feel the heat coming through the windows,"" Mr Duckworth said. ""I had no idea what was going on. I thought perhaps it was a bomb. ""We basically derailed and overturned, so our coach ended up on its side. ""There was a bit of a battle to get out. It's not easy to get out of an overturned carriage."" When he got out Mr Duckworth saw ""smoke billowing out from charred carriages"" lying on their sides as police and rescuers swarmed over the wreckage to try to locate trapped survivors. It would take days to remove all the bodies from the wreckage. This video can not be played Jonathan Duckworth said the crash gave him PTSD and ruined his career The outcry that followed led to the biggest-ever safety reform of the country's rail network. A series of complex public inquires culminated in two reports by Lord Cullen. The inquiry found the crash was caused by the Thames Trains service travelling from Paddington passing through a red signal. But Lord Cullen concluded the crash was the culmination of ""a catalogue of failures to act"". He levelled severe criticism at Thames Trains for its ""slack and less than adequate"" safety culture. It was fined Â£2m in 2004. Railtrack, Network Rail's predecessor, was accused of a ""lamentable failure"" to introduce safe signalling systems in the entrance to Paddington station. Lord Cullen levelled severe criticism at the rail industry for ""a catalogue of failures to act"" on known rail safety problems Paddington was supposed to be a watershed but a series of fatal rail crashes followed at Hatfield in 2000, at Selby in 2001 and at Potters Bar in 2002. The Paddington Survivors Group, set up to help victims and bereaved families cope with trauma, campaigned to improve rail safety. Under pressure from the group, a train protection warning system that halted trains passing through red signals became industry standard. The group worked with the Office for Rail and Road and Network Rail to reorganise the industry in the wake of the crash. Network Rail, which superseded Railtrack in 2002, was fined Â£4m in 2007 for health and safety breaches in the run-up to the Paddington crash, after years of campaigning by the survivors group. In addition to July seeing the highest number of Spads for more than a decade, the past 12 months has seen 10 trains pass red signals and reach the ""conflict point"" - the position along the track at which a collision could theoretically take place. The average over the past five years has been between four and five. Carriages overturned as the two trains crashed A memorial garden has been created, partially overlooking the site of the rail crash Concern over the increase led the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB) to write to Network Rail and all train and freight operating companies. Mark Phillips, RSSB chief executive, said the 20th anniversary of the disaster was ""a timely reminder of what can go wrong if we don't keep our eyes on the ball"". ""We need to look at current train protection technology and industry initiatives, and ask whether enough is being done,"" he added. Mr Duckworth said: ""The risk is now that there hasn't been a serious rail crash for 20 years, standards might drop and focus might change. ""The industry needs to keep recognising that safety is of great importance, because though these incidents don't happen anymore, when they do occur they are devastating.""

"This video can not be played Tear gas fired as protests continue after face mask ban in Hong Kong Thousands have taken part in unplanned protests in Hong Kong after the territory's government announced a face mask ban, which came into effect at midnight (16:00 GMT). Chief executive Carrie Lam invoked a colonial-era emergency law in a bid to quell months of anti-government unrest. The ban comes after an escalation of violence during protests on 1 October, when an officer shot a demonstrator. Reports on Friday said a 14-year-old had been shot in the leg. He is reportedly being treated at Tuen Mun hospital and is in a serious condition. Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words The background you need on the Hong Kong protests In pictures: The face masks Hong Kong wants to ban A police statement published by the South China Morning Post,externalconfirmed an officer ""fired one shot as his life was under serious threat"" after being attacked by a large group of protesters, including with petrol bombs. The statement does not however say if anyone was hit. The demonstrations have now died down throughout most of the territory, although there are still pockets of unrest. Protests erupted immediately after the ban was announced. Many left work early to join the spontaneous demonstrations. Some furious protesters blocked roads, torched Chinese flags and vandalised stations and businesses, as police fired rounds of tear gas. On Friday, the territory's Mass Transit Railway (MTR) announced a full service suspension of all trains, which will continue throughout Saturday. A spokesman told the BBC this was due to vandalism and attacks on staff. Images showed fires lit at stations, and reports suggest a train was set ablaze. Many Hong Kongers were forced to walk home amid the unrest. Some pro-Beijing businesses were attacked after the face mask ban was announced The territory's transit system will remain closed until Saturday after protesters lit fires outside several stations Mask-wearing activists had also earlier called on others to wear masks in defiance of the government, which critics fear is becoming increasingly authoritarian. Ms Lam said she was forced to invoke the colonial-era law because violence at the now-weekly protests was ""destroying the city"", and she could not allow the situation ""to get worse and worse"". Danny Vincent, BBC News, Hong Kong Angry protesters chanted as they marched through the heart of this financial hub. They ripped down a banner marking 70 years of communist rule, setting it alight in front of a cheering crowd. Hundreds wore masks in defiance of the ban. This video can not be played Watch the moment protesters burn a banner after Hong Kong's face mask ban Today will be the last time demonstrators can hide their faces legally. Anonymity has become a key part of this movement but many fear that the introduction of this emergency law could lead to further restrictions. This protest movement began in opposition to an extradition bill now withdrawn from the legislature. The use of the emergency law did not need to go through the legislative body. Carrie Lam insists that the territory is not in a state of emergency, but the law allows her to take further emergency measures. Observers say the regulation will be hard to enforce and hugely controversial: critics have warned the mask ban could be the first in a series of ""draconian"" measures. ""This is a watershed. This is a Rubicon,"" pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo told news agency AFP.  ""And I'm worried this could be just a starter. More draconian bans in the name of law could be lurking around the corner."" The announcement has also prompted reaction from further afield, with Marta Hurtado, the United Nations human rights spokeswoman, noting at a news conference in Geneva that ""any restriction must have a basis in law and be proportionate and as least intrusive as possible"". UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, meanwhile, has said ""political dialogue is the only way to resolve the situation"". Beijing has backed Carrie lam's face mask ban But Beijing has backed Carrie Lam and her administration. In a BBC Newsnight interview, China's ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming called the face mask ban ""timely and necessary"", and said it was ""too early to tell"" whether it had caused more violence. ""I think the [Hong Kong government] decided to introduce the ban because the situation has escalated to a dangerous level,"" he said, while adding that China was committed to respecting the One Country, Two Systems policy - which grants Hong Kong greater freedoms than in mainland China - until 2047. The ambassador also reiterated that China would intervene if the local authorities lost control. ""If the situation in Hong Kong becomes uncontrollable, we certainly won't sit on our hands and watch,"" he said. The ban will apply for approved and unapproved public assemblies - rallies and marches - as well as in unlawful assemblies and riots. The ban covers all kinds of facial covering, including face paint. Protesters have increasingly worn masks for a number of reasons, including to conceal their identities - from employers, parents and, in some cases, police - and to protect themselves from tear gas. Some demonstrators blocked roads and set fires while police fired tear gas There are exemptions for people wearing masks for health reasons, or if required by their profession. Ms Lam said ""violence had been escalating to alarming levels"" leading to a situation of ""chaos and panic"" in the city. The legislation invoked by Ms Lam, called the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, dates to 1922 and has not been used in more than 50 years. It enables the chief executive to bypass the normal legislative process, where bills have to go through the city's parliament, the Legislative Council. Many donned face masks to protests the emergency measure, which came into effect at midnight The ERO was last used in 1967 to help stop riots in the territory's trading hub. Ms Lam stressed the new regulation did not mean that Hong Kong was in a state of emergency. But she said the city was ""in a state of serious public danger"". Hong Kong's protests started in June, sparked by proposals to extradite suspected criminals to mainland China. The extradition bill has since been cancelled but protests have widened into pro-democracy and anti-police demonstrations. This video can not be played How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence Over the months, clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent. On Tuesday, police shot a protester in the chest with a live bullet for the first time. Authorities say the 18-year-old - who was attacking police and was arrested after being shot - is in a stable condition in hospital. Hong Kong is a former British colony handed back to China in 1997. It has a ""one country, two systems"" agreement that guarantees it some autonomy, and its people certain freedoms, including freedom of assembly and freedom of speech. But those freedoms - the Basic Law - expire in 2047 and it is not clear what Hong Kong's status will then be.

"A card by the company involved in the trademark dispute with Banksy A greeting cards company has denied it attempted to ""take custody"" of the graffiti artist Banksy name to sell ""fake"" merchandise of his art. Full Colour Black, which is involved in a trademark legal row, said the artist's comment was ""entirely untrue"". The north Yorkshire company insisted it was a ""legitimate enterprise"" that did not ""infringe his rights in any way"". Banksy claimed he had been forced to open a shop in Croydon, south London, this week, as a result of the dispute. The store, Gross Domestic Product, is selling a range of ""impractical and offensive"" merchandise created by Banksy.

"Edward Putman was found guilty of fraud by false representation A conman who cashed in a fake National Lottery ticket to claim a Â£2.5m jackpot has been jailed for nine years. Edward Putman, 54, claimed he had found the winning ticket under a seat in his van in 2009 just before the deadline to claim the win passed. But St Albans Crown Court heard he was helped by Camelot insider Giles Knibbs who knew how to cheat the system. Putman, of Kings Langley in Hertfordshire, was found guilty of fraud by false representation. The court heard the fraud came to light after Mr Knibbs, who had a row with Putman over how the winnings were divided, took his own life in October 2015. Sentencing Putman, Judge Philip Grey called it a ""sophisticated, carefully planned, and diligently operated fraud"". ""You would have got away with this but quite plainly you were greedy"", he added. ""This crime struck at the integrity of the National Lottery. You have also undermined the public's trust in the lottery itself."" The fake ticket was used by Putman to claim the Lottery win Putman claimed the win on 28 August 2009 by using a badly-damaged ticket forged by Mr Knibbs, who worked for Camelot in the fraud detection department. Mr Knibbs had seen a document containing details of big wins which had not yet been claimed and prosecutor James Keeley said there was ""some trial and error"" in producing the successful forgery. The court heard each ticket had one of the 100 different possible unique codes at the bottom and Putman had gone to 29 different shops, providing a different ticket in each, before the right number was found at a shop in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. Fraud accused 'found Lottery ticket in his van' Lottery worker 'confessed scam' to former partner Worker 'helped with fake Lottery win scam' Mr Knibbs confessed to friends he had ""conned"" the Lottery after the row with Putman, a convicted rapist and benefits cheat, in June 2015. He also told them about technical inaccuracies in the creation of the ticket that Putman, of Station Road, had used. Evidence suggested Mr Knibbs was initially paid Â£280,000 by Putman for his part in the ruse, followed by much smaller increments totalling Â£50,000. Edward Putman was pictured outside court covering his face Putman was paid the jackpot by Camelot in September 2009 despite the bottom part of the mangled slip missing the barcode, the trial heard. Three years laterhe was sentenced to nine months in jail for benefit fraudafter claiming Â£13,000 in housing and income support following his win. In 2016, theGambling Commission fined Camelot Â£3mfor breaching its operating licence regarding controlling databases, investigating prize claims, and paying out prizes. A Camelot spokeswoman said there were ""some weaknesses in some of the specific controls relevant to this incident at the time and we're very sorry for that"". ""We've strengthened our processes significantly since then and are completely confident that an incident of this nature could not happen today,"" she added. The genuine winning ticket, which was bought in Worcester, has never been discovered. Tapashi Nadarajah, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said Putman's ""lies unravelled with the tragic death of his co-conspirator who he wasn't prepared to share the money with"".

"Microsoft said the hackers were ""highly motivated"" Hackers that appear to be linked to Iran's government have targeted the 2020 US presidential election, according to tech company Microsoft. The group attacked more than 200 email accounts, some of which belonged to people associated with ""a US presidential campaign"", it said. The target was President Donald Trump's re-election campaign, sources told Reuters news agency. Iran has not yet publicly commented on the allegations. A spokesman for the Trump campaign said it had no indication it had been targeted. ""Today we're sharing that we've recently seen significant cyber activity by a threat group we call Phosphorus, which we believe originates from Iran and is linked to the Iranian government,""a Microsoft statement reads,external. Phosphorus, it said, made more than 2,700 attempts to identify people's email accounts over a 30-day period in August and September. It then attacked 241 accounts. ""The targeted accounts are associated with a US presidential campaign, current and former US government officials, journalists covering global politics and prominent Iranians living outside Iran,"" Microsoft said. Who will take on Trump in 2020? If the US election were like Canada's... Currently, 19 Democrats are seeking to be nominated as their party's candidate to stand against Donald Trump in 2020, while three Republicans say they plan to challenge the president. The statement did not identify which specific campaign was targeted. However Reuters reported it was President Trump's re-election campaign, citing sources familiar with the operation. Reuters reports that the campaign targeted was US President Donald Trump's According to Microsoft, only four accounts were eventually compromised, and none of these were associated with a campaign, nor any former or current officials. The hackers tried to take over the accounts, in attacks Microsoft called ""not technically sophisticated"". The company has told account holders affected and helped to protect them. Russians charged with US election hack Russia cyber-plots: Three surprising things we learnt Nevertheless, the tech company called Phosphorus, also known as APT 35, ""highly motivated and willing to invest significant time and resources engaging in research and other means of information gathering"". Microsoft urged all its customers to set up two-step verification for their email accounts, and suggested people worried about security to check their login history. There has been increasing concern worldwide about foreign-sponsored election interference via hacking. In July,US Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded that Russia systematically interfered in the 2016 electionwith the intention of benefitting Mr Trump - although he did not establish collusion in a crime.

"This video can not be played Glasgow Airport alert sparked by package An emergency incident at Glasgow Airport was caused by a leak from a package containing glass tubes of vaccine in the cargo hold of a plane. An exclusion zone was placed around the aircraft after concerns were raised about the leaking package onboard KLM flight KL1473 from Amsterdam. The airline said the leak affected dry ice packed to cool the package and the tubes of vaccine remained intact. The incident was stood down and the area declared safe at 13:30 on Friday. Part of the international terminal had earlier been evacuated and closed off while a team examined the package, but all other areas of the airport remained fully operational. Pictures from the airport showed a large number of emergency vehicles, including several fire appliances, ambulances and an environmental protection unit, close to the runway. In a statement, KLM said: ""On KL1473 operated between Amsterdam to Glasgow, a package on board packed in dry ice started to leak this afternoon. ""The package contained glass tubes with vaccines.

"Police were mourning their colleagues in the French capital on Friday Anti-terror investigators have taken over the inquiry into the killing of four police employees by a colleague in Paris on Thursday. A 45-year-old IT specialist killed three police officers and an administrative worker in a knife rampage at Paris police headquarters. A motive is unclear, with a police union initially suggesting a workplace dispute was to blame. But investigators say new information justifies a terror probe. The attacker, MickaÃ«l Harpon, was shot dead by a junior police officer after he attacked colleagues in several offices at the central police building in Paris. He converted to Islam 18 months ago, according to reports, and had recently stopped talking to female colleagues in the office. But a government spokeswoman said on Friday morning that there was no indication he had been radicalised before the attack. Police investigators initially said there was no indication the attack was an act of terror but Paris police chief Didier Lallement later told reporters no theory was being ruled out. Until now, the case had been handled by the city's public prosecutor. This changed on Friday evening when an official from the prosecutor's office said that national anti-terror prosecutors had taken over the investigation ""in the light of the evidence gathered by criminal investigators"". Details of the new information uncovered have not been revealed. But according to Reuters, quoting judicial sources, the move came about after several people close to the attacker, including his wife, were interrogated and his mobile phone analysed. This video can not be played The scene of the attack was quickly cordoned off by police Police earlier seized computer equipment during a search of Harpon's home in the north of the city, according to media reports. The killer's wife on Friday reportedly told police that he had been incoherentand had heard voices the night before the attack. The woman, who is being detained but has not been charged, told police her husband had had a disagreement with his bosses. Police union officials also described tensions between Harpon and his supervisor. Harpon, who was born in the French overseas territory of Martinique in the Caribbean, worked in the force's intelligence unit. He also had a hearing and a speech disability. The employee entered the building around lunchtime on Thursday, and proceeded to attack his colleagues with a kitchen knife. He stabbed three people inside two offices and two women on a stairway, before he was shot dead by an officer inside the building's courtyard. Three men and one woman were killed. A fifth person was seriously injured. The police building is near major tourist sites including Notre-Dame cathedral. Earlier on Friday, a minute's silence was held outside the headquarters in memory of the four staff who died. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Diane saw her annual home insurance premium shoot up Diane's reward for staying with the same home insurance provider for 10 years was a rise in her annual premium from Â£1,500 to Â£3,500. The 76-year-old, from Kent, said: ""Being a pensioner, I don't like changing."" She ended up looking in the phone book, calling around for a deal. She is an example of the six million people who pay on average Â£200 too much on premiums. The City regulator has found consumers are overpaying by Â£1.2bn a year. Competition in the home and insurance market is not working and loyal customers are being penalised, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) says. It is considering bans on automatic price rises and making firms move consumers to cheaper deals, but said ""the ball is now in the industry's court"". ""This market is not working well for all consumers,"" said Christopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA. ""While a large number of people shop around, many loyal customers are not getting a good deal. We believe this affects around six million consumers. ""We have set out a package of potential remedies to ensure these markets are truly competitive and address the problems we have uncovered. We expect the industry to work with us as we do so."" Mr Woolard said the review did not reveal the insurance industry was breaching the rules on a wholesale basis. But he said it was clear that changes needed to be made, and some in the industry would accept this. He said in many cases - as was the case for Diane - it was much easier for consumers to renew a policy, sometimes just by ticking a box, than it was to switch away to a cheaper deal. The FCA said that more than one in 10 people were paying very high prices for their insurance. One in three of them were vulnerable in some way, perhaps elderly or lower paid. The regulator found,externalthat some insurers targeted price increases at those less likely to switch. Possible FCA remedies include: Banning or restricting practices such as raising prices for consumers who renew every year, or requiring firms to automatically move consumers to cheaper equivalent deals Stop practices that could discourage switching - including restricting the way that firms use automatic renewal Make firms be clear and transparent in their dealings with consumers - including improvements to the way they communicate with their customers The FCA intends to publish its final report on possible remedies in early 2020 after further consultation with the industry and consumer groups. By Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter You have never had a problem with your insurer or bank so you have stayed with them for years. What the FCA's, and other reviews, have shown is that this is an expensive option - for home and motor cover, overdrafts and more. Loyalty does not pay. Those unable or uncomfortable with searching for a better deal online, or haggling, pay more. There is also a nod in this FCA report to the poverty premium - you get a worse deal if your finances are less ""resilient"" or you struggle with handling money. Many of the same people will be among the eight million who an independent report estimated would be left behind if the UK became a cashless society. Undoubtedly, they will feel like the financial victims of the advances in technology which have changed the way we live our lives. Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, the industry's trade body, said his members accepted that the home and car insurance markets could work better for consumers who do not shop around at renewal. But he added: ""This is not an issue unique to insurance. It is important that any unintended consequences are carefully considered to ensure that a fair and balanced approach is achieved for all customers."" The consequences could be more expensive premiums for those shopping around, but the FCA said that, while it was keen to maintain a level of competition, the variation in prices to cover the same level of risk was too great. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said ""it's great to see the FCA acknowledging that the insurance market isn't working"". But she cautioned that the FCA's report set out proposals only. ""The FCA must now follow through on these bold ideas to stop loyal insurance customers being penalised,"" she said. Citizens Advice said it should not be left to the consumer to find the best deals. Rather, the market should be set up to ensure everyone is treated fairly. However, its advice to people searching for the lowest prices is: Shop around Ensure you opt out of auto-renewals Make a note of insurance expiry dates Use comparison websites Car and house insurance faces price probe Consumer loyalty 'rip off' faces probe Insurers 'burying price rises' Insurers accept that renewal premiums unfair Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while official hits out at looters Maps and pictures chart how fires have spread Biden praises Carter's character as former president's casket heads to Georgia The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"This video can not be played Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price says he wants ""economic justice"" from Westminster There will be a referendum on Welsh independence by 2030, Plaid Cymru's Adam Price has said. He told BBC Radio Wales' Breakfast programme that a referendum would take place ""definitely in the next decade"". The party leader claimed Wales could get Â£2bn extra as a European Union member in its own right. Speaking at the Plaid Cymru conference in Swansea, Mr Price said Wales deserved Â£20bn in reconstruction funds paid for by Westminster. He outlined policies aimed at lifting 100,000 children out of poverty, and said a Plaid government would build a rapid transit line for the south Wales valleys. Is Wales becoming an indy-curious nation? Compensate Wales for crippling poverty, says Price Labour AM says Welsh independence 'possible' Predicting a referendum on independence for Wales would be held in the next ten years, Mr Price told BBC Wales on Friday that ""things are accelerating"". ""The UK as we know it could cease to exist in a short few years"", he said. Addressing party members at Swansea's Grand Theatre, Mr Price argued an independent Wales would be able to issue its own long-term bonds, taking advantage of low interest rates. His party's mission is to convince Welsh voters ""that independence is imperative if we are to solve our problems as a nation"", he said. The plans include free childcare for one to three-year-olds Mr Price used his speech to unveil some of the policies his party would pitch at the next Welsh assembly elections, in 2021. He pledged Plaid would introduce a payment of Â£35 a week for every child in every low-income family in Wales, as well as 40 hours a week of free childcare for all children over a year old. The party leader recounted his experience of growing up in Ammanford. ""Aged 15 all my family had to sustain me was my child benefit"" and free school meals, he said. ""I was raised out of poverty and I can never rest until we've done the same for every child in Wales."" The leader, who took the helm of the party last year, promised he would make Wales ""not just a great country to grow up in, but a decent place to grow old in"". The party says it will provide detailed costings alongside its manifesto for the 2021 election. ""Our new cradle to the grave promise to the Welsh people will see us finally deliver a seamless National Health and Care Service,"" he said. Labour announced asimilar social care policy for Englandat its annual conference in Brighton last month. ""If Labour can promise to England what Scotland already has, then why don't they do it when they are actually in government in Wales?"" Mr Price added. Adam Price says ""people's natural allegiances are unravelling"" Analysis by Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editor It may have taken him a little while to get into his rhetorical stride, but Adam Price gave his party what they wanted: a vision of a Plaid Cymru government rooted in the love of the land. Like all conference speeches, this was pitched at many different audiences. For the converted he described Welsh independence, not Brexit, as the way to take back control. For those he wants to convert - especially voters in the Valleys seats which voted leave in 2016, and which Plaid must win to form a government in 2021 - there were big spending pledges on child care, jobs for young people, and a 50km rapid transit service ""allowing cross-valley travel for the first time in 50 years"". Plaid isn't the only party making big spending pledges for the years to come. The question of how they'd pay for any of it has been deferred to another day. The AM for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr said a Plaid government could ""transform Wales from bottom of the pile to leader of the pack"", boosting digital and physical infrastructure. He told conference the party would increase infrastructure investment by 2% of GDP by 2025. It was time, he said, for a ""Crossrail for the valleys"" - a 50km rapid transit service from Treherbert to Pontypool. ""We'll take people out of their cars by giving them a real alternative,"" he said. Mr Price said Wales needed a ""National Reconstruction programme"" - a ""Â£20 billion Fund for Wales"" - paid for by Westminster. He said Wales is owed reparations for ""a century of neglect that has left a country, rich in its resources, a bitter legacy of poverty, sickness, blighted lives and broken dreams"". ""Westminster owes us twenty times that for the wealth that they stole. Northern Ireland deserves a New Deal absolutely, but surely that's right for Wales too."" Turning his line of attack to the Welsh Government, the former MP accused Labour of being the ""handmaidens of continuing Tory austerity here at home"". ""The cold, hard, truth is that the Brexit vote in 2016 wasn't merely or even mainly a rejection of Europe. Rather, it was a rejection of politics as business as usual, of a complacency of twenty years of drift and decline - an indictment of the promise of a better life that devolution offered but, under Labour, failed to deliver,"" he said. Liz Saville Roberts is Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Plaid Cymru is hoping to build on its performance at May's European elections when the party came second in Wales behind the Brexit Party but ahead of Labour. It was the first time Plaid had beaten Labour in a Wales-wide election. Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts used her speech in Swansea to criticise Prime Minister Boris Johnson. ""This is the man who weaponises language, who brought the words of civil war to the chamber, only to be brought down by civil law and a girly swot in a spider brooch,"" she said, referring to the president of the Supreme Court, Lady Hale. Meanwhile South Wales West AM Dai Lloyd announced that he would not stand on the regional list in the next assembly election in 2021. He will stand in the Swansea West constituency only. Plaid Cymru has four MPs, 10 assembly members and one MEP. Compensate Wales for crippling poverty, says Price Plaid Cymru urged to back free social care for all Plaid's leader pledges to ditch Brexit in election 'Serious' talks on Lib Dem-Plaid election pact Impeach PM if Brexit law ignored, says Plaid Cymru Is Wales becoming an indy-curious nation?

"This video can not be played Trump calls for China and Ukraine to investigate the Bidens Kurt Volker brought receipts, as the saying goes - and it could spell real trouble for President Donald Trump. During the former US special envoy to Ukraine's private testimony to congressional committees on Thursday, he turned over a trove of text messages and other communications. They documented the Trump administration's efforts to get the Ukrainian government to investigate a Ukrainian company with ties to Joe Biden's son and conspiracy theories around Russian hacking during the 2016 US presidential election. On Thursday night, Democrats in the US House of Representatives - which is conducting an impeachment investigation of Donald Trump - made public a selection of these messages. While some Republicans are saying the release does not paint a complete picture of the Trump administration's diplomatic efforts and the motivations behind them, the messages themselves offer dramatic evidence of what Democrats view as an abuse of presidential authority. Donald Trump and his defenders have insisted there was no quid-pro-quo in his dealings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The text messages, however, tell a different story. It was very clear to members of the administration's Ukrainian diplomatic team what Mr Trump wanted - a publicly announced Ukrainian investigation of political rival Joe Biden and the 2016 election hacking, which the intelligence community has concluded was carried out by Russia (although Mr Trump still has his doubts). Kurt Volker, Mr Trump's Ukraine envoy who resigned a week ago Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, and a significant donor to Mr Trump Bill Taylor, a top US diplomat at the US embassy in Ukraine Messages appear to show the US diplomats coordinating Ukraine's investigation announcement, saying that a draft of Mr Zelensky's statement should include references to 2016 and Burisma, the company that Mr Biden's son worked for. It also was very clear what they had to offer the Ukrainians: not only US military aid, which had been put on hold by the White House, but also a meeting between the two presidents in Washington that would have been extremely valuable in bolstering the legitimacy of the newly elected Ukrainian leader. Drawing a straight line between the offer and the ask doesn't take much imagination - and at least one American diplomat, acting US Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, had serious concerns about the propriety of it all. He worried that delaying congressionally authorised US military aid to Ukraine, as the Trump administration had done in July, would be a boon to Russia - and would put Ukraine in a precarious spot. He wondered whether the aid, and a potential Zelensky visit to Washington, were being explicitly conditioned on Ukrainian ""investigations"". The Trump impeachment story explained Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? ""I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,"" Mr Taylor texted Gordon Sondland, the deep-pocketed Republican donor who Mr Trump nominated to be US ambassador to the European Union. After five hours, Mr Sondland - whose previous messages to Mr Taylor were conversational - replied with a denial of any ""quid pro quo"" that sounded like a statement crafted by lawyers, followed by a request that they stop texting about it. Other text messages - between Mr Taylor, Mr Sondland and Mr Volker are even more direct. The team seemed intent on getting the Ukrainians to release a statement announcing a new corruption investigation into Burisma and possible Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 hacking - a move that, even if it amounted to nothing, could have provided political ammunition for Republicans to undermine Mr Biden's presidential campaign. ""Heard from the White House - assuming President Z convinces Trump he will investigate / 'get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington,"" Mr Volker wrote, in which seems the clearest acknowledgement of a quid pro quo. It may not be long before the White House falls back to its final line of defence - that threatening and cajoling Ukraine to investigate Mr Biden and the 2016 hacking was a reasonable exercise of a president intent on cracking down on corruption involving a then high-ranking American official. ""We are looking at corruption, we are not looking at politics,"" Mr Trump said on Friday morning. ""I don't care if it's Biden or anybody else."" He may say he doesn't care if it involves Biden (and he dodged a question about whether he's ever asked foreign leaders for an investigation of someone who is not a political rival), but this strategy will necessitate all-out attacks on Mr Biden, his son Hunter and their reputation - despite no current evidence that the then-vice-president acted inappropriately in his interactions with Ukrainian officials. This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims In the past two days, Mr Trump has said the Bidens are ""crooked"", that they are ""pillaging the country"" and that the former vice-president arranged ""sweetheart deals"" with foreign governments in order to help his son. Complicating matters for the White House, however, was Mr Trump's decision on Thursday to suggest both Ukraine and China open investigations into the Bidens - essentially saying publicly what Democrats were accusing him of doing in his private phone call with Mr Zelensky. That he made the suggestion to China less than a minute after discussing the two nations' ongoing trade negotiations and saying that the US has ""tremendous power"" will leave Democrats howling - particularly aftera report later in the day,externalthat Mr Trump brought up Mr Biden in a 18 June call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Not to be outdone, Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor who has essentially served as the president's private detective investigating the Bidens,told the Wall Street Journal,externalthat Mr Trump ordered the dismissal of the previous US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, because she was insufficiently supportive of the Biden investigation. This video can not be played Mr Giuliani is alleged to have sought to dig up dirt on Democrat candidate Joe Biden All in all, the recent spate of revelations paints a picture of a White House wielding the tools of foreign policy to advance goals that could be seen as overtly political. Many Democrats have already said this is an abuse of power necessitating presidential impeachment and removal from office. A handful of Republicans have also been critical. In a series of tweets on Friday, Mitt Romney - the 2012 Republican presidential nominee -offered a stinging rebuke,externalof the president. ""When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China's investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,"" he wrote. ""By all appearances, the president's brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling."" Trump urges China to investigate Bidens The reality, however, is that for all the blows Mr Trump has received and may yet endure, none of them may prove fatal. He's faced seemingly mortal crises before, only to plough through and emerge intact on the other side. Impeachment, even if it now seems like a foregone conclusion, isn't the end of the Trump presidency. That would take two-thirds of the Republican-controlled Senate voting for removal. As Axios's Mike Allen points out, the chamber has more than enough Republican senators from states where the president remains popular - 36 - to form a ""red firewall"" to block removal. Unless Mr Trump's approval craters, any of these senators voting to convict the president would be tantamount to political suicide. The president knows how to endure the ""political storm"", as he called it earlier this week. ""I'm used to it,"" he said. ""For me, it's like putting on a suit in the morning."" With what's coming in the days ahead, he's going to need that to be a suit of armour. Follow Anthony on Twitter,external Five things to know about Canada's election Is Justin Trudeau in trouble?

"Edward Putman was found guilty of fraud by false representation A conman who cashed in a fake National Lottery ticket to claim a Â£2.5m jackpot has been jailed for nine years. Edward Putman, 54, claimed he had found the winning ticket under a seat in his van in 2009 just before the deadline to claim the win passed. But St Albans Crown Court heard he was helped by Camelot insider Giles Knibbs who knew how to cheat the system. Putman, of Kings Langley in Hertfordshire, was found guilty of fraud by false representation. The court heard the fraud came to light after Mr Knibbs, who had a row with Putman over how the winnings were divided, took his own life in October 2015. Sentencing Putman, Judge Philip Grey called it a ""sophisticated, carefully planned, and diligently operated fraud"". ""You would have got away with this but quite plainly you were greedy"", he added. ""This crime struck at the integrity of the National Lottery. You have also undermined the public's trust in the lottery itself."" The fake ticket was used by Putman to claim the Lottery win Putman claimed the win on 28 August 2009 by using a badly-damaged ticket forged by Mr Knibbs, who worked for Camelot in the fraud detection department. Mr Knibbs had seen a document containing details of big wins which had not yet been claimed and prosecutor James Keeley said there was ""some trial and error"" in producing the successful forgery. The court heard each ticket had one of the 100 different possible unique codes at the bottom and Putman had gone to 29 different shops, providing a different ticket in each, before the right number was found at a shop in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. Fraud accused 'found Lottery ticket in his van' Lottery worker 'confessed scam' to former partner Worker 'helped with fake Lottery win scam' Mr Knibbs confessed to friends he had ""conned"" the Lottery after the row with Putman, a convicted rapist and benefits cheat, in June 2015. He also told them about technical inaccuracies in the creation of the ticket that Putman, of Station Road, had used. Evidence suggested Mr Knibbs was initially paid Â£280,000 by Putman for his part in the ruse, followed by much smaller increments totalling Â£50,000. Edward Putman was pictured outside court covering his face Putman was paid the jackpot by Camelot in September 2009 despite the bottom part of the mangled slip missing the barcode, the trial heard. Three years laterhe was sentenced to nine months in jail for benefit fraudafter claiming Â£13,000 in housing and income support following his win. In 2016, theGambling Commission fined Camelot Â£3mfor breaching its operating licence regarding controlling databases, investigating prize claims, and paying out prizes. A Camelot spokeswoman said there were ""some weaknesses in some of the specific controls relevant to this incident at the time and we're very sorry for that"". ""We've strengthened our processes significantly since then and are completely confident that an incident of this nature could not happen today,"" she added. The genuine winning ticket, which was bought in Worcester, has never been discovered.

"A Palestinian flag was digitally edited into the sleeping man's mouth A student has been suspended following complaints about his dating app profile picture, posing next to a sleeping orthodox Jewish man on the London underground.

"Dozens of police and emergency services converged at the scene The wife of a police employee who killed four colleagues at the Paris force's HQ says he had a psychotic episode, was incoherent and heard voices the night before, reports say. MickaÃ«l Harpon, 45, was shot dead by police at the scene. His wife, who is in police custody but not charged, told police that he had a disagreement with his bosses, according to French media. French officials are trying to establish a motive for the killings. Police union officials have also suggested that Harpon may have been involved in a workplace dispute. Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Paris police chief Didier Lallement said officers had not ruled out any theory about the attack. He added that the young official who had shot Harpon had only been working at the HQ for six days. Paris knife attack: Pictures from the scene The killings came a day after police went on strike across France over increasing violence towards officers. A minute's silence was held by police HQ in Paris on Friday in memory of the four staff members who died. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Police shared a photo of the gathering on Twitter, calling it a ""moment of contemplation"" that was ""deeply moving"". At about 13:00 local time (11:00 GMT; 12:00 BST), the attacker is said to have gone into the building and straight to his office where he began attacking colleagues with a kitchen knife. He stabbed three people inside two offices and two women on a stairway, before he was shot dead by an officer inside the building's courtyard. This video can not be played The scene of the attack was quickly cordoned off by police Three men and one woman were killed, Paris prosecutor RÃ©my Heitz told reporters. A fifth person was critically injured in the attack, and was sent for surgery. The building is near major tourist sites including Notre-Dame cathedral. ""Police were running around in panic,"" a witness who was inside the courtyard at the time of the attack told Le Parisien newspaper. ""I was surprised to hear shooting because this is not a place where you hear that kind of thing. I first thought it was a suicide because there are a lot of those at the moment,"" he added. According to Interior Minister Christophe Castaner, Harpon was a 45-year-old IT specialist who had worked for the Paris police force for 16 years. Officials said he had been working in the force's intelligence division. Mr Castaner said there had been no warning signs about the attacker, adding: ""On the face of it, he looked a model employee."" Harpon also had a hearing and a speech disability. He converted to Islam 18 months ago, according to reports, and had recently stopped talking to female colleagues in the office. But a government spokeswoman has said there is no indication he had been radicalised before the attack. Police have searched his home in the north of the city and found no evidence that he was radicalised. Computer equipment seized from Harpon's home is now being examined, French media report. Paris police headquarters is located in the heart of Paris There were tensions between the knifeman and his supervisor, according to police union official Christophe CrÃ©pin. ""I do not think this is a terrorist act,"" Mr CrÃ©pin, who knew the attacker, told Franceinfo Radio. Police union leader Jean-Marc Bailleul described it as a criminal act, telling BFMTV: ""It was a moment of madness."" The attack follows a rare nationwide police strike on Wednesday, which saw thousands of officers demonstrating in Paris over working hours, shortages in resources and controversial pension reforms. This video can not be played French police get angry over working conditions and suicide rates Police unions say there have been more than 50 suicides by police officers since the start of the year. They blame the rising numbers on difficult working conditions and increasing violence towards police. Latest pictures from the scene Paris police cordon off knife attack scene.

"This video can not be played ""The oceans are rising but so are we"" The Green Party's co-leader is calling for the Home Office to be scrapped in a radical shake-up of immigration policy. Jonathan Bartley said the department was ""pernicious"" in its treatment of people and a new Ministry for Sanctuary should oversee a ""fairer"" system. In a speech to his party conference, he warned of a ""new authoritarianism"" in Britain and said he was ""ashamed of what our country has become"". Only the Greens could deal with the injustices that led to Brexit, he said. Addressing activists on the first day of the Green Party conference in Newport, Mr Bartley also called for free bus travel in England, and for all future laws passed by Parliament to be measured against their environmental impact on the next generation. Wales 'last frontier for the Green Party' The party, which opposes Brexit and supports another referendum, has only one MP in Westminster, Caroline Lucas, but performed strongly in council and European elections earlier this year. In his speech, Mr Bartley - who shares the leadership with Sian Berry - said a ""green wave was sweeping the continent and we are surfing it in England and Wales"". Paying tribute to climate protesters, including Extinction Rebellion, who he said had made the future of the planet a political imperative, he said the ""oceans are rising but so are we"". Outlining a ""radical plan"" to revamp government and the economy, he said the Home Office should be scrapped and its responsibilities shared between two new departments. All bus travel should be free in England and Wales, Mr Bartley said While the Ministry for Sanctuary would be in charge of immigration policy, the Ministry for the Interior would have responsibility for law and order. The changes, he said, were needed to address the ""austerity, inequality and political exclusion"" which he said had contributed to the Brexit vote. ""We would abolish the pernicious Home Office because transformation of our country demands a system that is truly representative of and fair to everyone,"" he said. While his party opposed Brexit, he said it would not be joining the Liberal Democrats in calling for Article 50 to be revoked, which would end the process entirely. Welcoming Labour's ""late"" conversion to the idea of another referendum on Brexit, he said only the people could settle the issue of the UK's future in Europe. ""If we want to stay in Europe, we must win the argument over Europe,"" he said. ""If they (the government) were on the side of the people they would trust the people, and give the people a people's vote"" He called for the a total overhaul of the economy to deal with the climate emergency, saying policy-makers ""must do what the science demands not what is deemed politically possible"". His key environmental proposals include: Introducing a carbon tax to fund investments in renewable energy. Scrapping the HS2 rail line and investing Â£70bn in local transport networks Phasing out petrol and diesel cars by 2030 Installing a ""Climate Chancellor"" so all decisions are judged on environmental impact Passing a Future Generations Act which would require the needs of young people to be taken into account before every government decision ""This can be a new start,"" he concluded. ""We need a decisive break from business as usual, and we are ready to make the leap. ""The Green Party has always been on the right side of history. The time is now to shape our future."" Ms Berry, who is running to be Mayor of London, will address the three-day event on Sunday.

"This video can not be played Tear gas fired as protests continue after face mask ban in Hong Kong Thousands have taken part in unplanned protests in Hong Kong after the territory's government announced a face mask ban, which came into effect at midnight (16:00 GMT). Chief executive Carrie Lam invoked a colonial-era emergency law in a bid to quell months of anti-government unrest. The ban comes after an escalation of violence during protests on 1 October, when an officer shot a demonstrator. Reports on Friday said a 14-year-old had been shot in the leg. He is reportedly being treated at Tuen Mun hospital and is in a serious condition. Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words The background you need on the Hong Kong protests In pictures: The face masks Hong Kong wants to ban A police statement published by the South China Morning Post,externalconfirmed an officer ""fired one shot as his life was under serious threat"" after being attacked by a large group of protesters, including with petrol bombs. The statement does not however say if anyone was hit. The demonstrations have now died down throughout most of the territory, although there are still pockets of unrest. Protests erupted immediately after the ban was announced. Many left work early to join the spontaneous demonstrations. Some furious protesters blocked roads, torched Chinese flags and vandalised stations and businesses, as police fired rounds of tear gas. On Friday, the territory's Mass Transit Railway (MTR) announced a full service suspension of all trains, which will continue throughout Saturday. A spokesman told the BBC this was due to vandalism and attacks on staff. Images showed fires lit at stations, and reports suggest a train was set ablaze. Many Hong Kongers were forced to walk home amid the unrest. Some pro-Beijing businesses were attacked after the face mask ban was announced The territory's transit system will remain closed until Saturday after protesters lit fires outside several stations Mask-wearing activists had also earlier called on others to wear masks in defiance of the government, which critics fear is becoming increasingly authoritarian. Ms Lam said she was forced to invoke the colonial-era law because violence at the now-weekly protests was ""destroying the city"", and she could not allow the situation ""to get worse and worse"". Danny Vincent, BBC News, Hong Kong Angry protesters chanted as they marched through the heart of this financial hub. They ripped down a banner marking 70 years of communist rule, setting it alight in front of a cheering crowd. Hundreds wore masks in defiance of the ban. This video can not be played Watch the moment protesters burn a banner after Hong Kong's face mask ban Today will be the last time demonstrators can hide their faces legally. Anonymity has become a key part of this movement but many fear that the introduction of this emergency law could lead to further restrictions. This protest movement began in opposition to an extradition bill now withdrawn from the legislature. The use of the emergency law did not need to go through the legislative body. Carrie Lam insists that the territory is not in a state of emergency, but the law allows her to take further emergency measures. Observers say the regulation will be hard to enforce and hugely controversial: critics have warned the mask ban could be the first in a series of ""draconian"" measures. ""This is a watershed. This is a Rubicon,"" pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo told news agency AFP.  ""And I'm worried this could be just a starter. More draconian bans in the name of law could be lurking around the corner."" The announcement has also prompted reaction from further afield, with Marta Hurtado, the United Nations human rights spokeswoman, noting at a news conference in Geneva that ""any restriction must have a basis in law and be proportionate and as least intrusive as possible"". UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, meanwhile, has said ""political dialogue is the only way to resolve the situation"". Beijing has backed Carrie lam's face mask ban But Beijing has backed Carrie Lam and her administration. In a BBC Newsnight interview, China's ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming called the face mask ban ""timely and necessary"", and said it was ""too early to tell"" whether it had caused more violence. ""I think the [Hong Kong government] decided to introduce the ban because the situation has escalated to a dangerous level,"" he said, while adding that China was committed to respecting the One Country, Two Systems policy - which grants Hong Kong greater freedoms than in mainland China - until 2047. The ambassador also reiterated that China would intervene if the local authorities lost control. ""If the situation in Hong Kong becomes uncontrollable, we certainly won't sit on our hands and watch,"" he said. The ban will apply for approved and unapproved public assemblies - rallies and marches - as well as in unlawful assemblies and riots. The ban covers all kinds of facial covering, including face paint. Protesters have increasingly worn masks for a number of reasons, including to conceal their identities - from employers, parents and, in some cases, police - and to protect themselves from tear gas. Some demonstrators blocked roads and set fires while police fired tear gas There are exemptions for people wearing masks for health reasons, or if required by their profession. Ms Lam said ""violence had been escalating to alarming levels"" leading to a situation of ""chaos and panic"" in the city. The legislation invoked by Ms Lam, called the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, dates to 1922 and has not been used in more than 50 years. It enables the chief executive to bypass the normal legislative process, where bills have to go through the city's parliament, the Legislative Council. Many donned face masks to protests the emergency measure, which came into effect at midnight The ERO was last used in 1967 to help stop riots in the territory's trading hub. Ms Lam stressed the new regulation did not mean that Hong Kong was in a state of emergency. But she said the city was ""in a state of serious public danger"". Hong Kong's protests started in June, sparked by proposals to extradite suspected criminals to mainland China. The extradition bill has since been cancelled but protests have widened into pro-democracy and anti-police demonstrations. This video can not be played How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence Over the months, clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent. On Tuesday, police shot a protester in the chest with a live bullet for the first time. Authorities say the 18-year-old - who was attacking police and was arrested after being shot - is in a stable condition in hospital. Hong Kong is a former British colony handed back to China in 1997. It has a ""one country, two systems"" agreement that guarantees it some autonomy, and its people certain freedoms, including freedom of assembly and freedom of speech. But those freedoms - the Basic Law - expire in 2047 and it is not clear what Hong Kong's status will then be.

"A new cricket tournament designed to appeal to children and families has been criticised by health campaigners for its snack food sponsorship. Each team in The Hundred, a new format from the England and Wales Cricket Board, features a KP Snacks logo. An anti-obesity group said brands such as KP wanted junk food to ""take centre stage in children's minds"". England cricketer Kate Cross said she hoped the competition would inspire children to be active. The tournament, which begins in July 2020, is intended to attract new audiences to cricket with a rapid-fire format where each team faces just 100 balls. Featuring men's and women's teams from Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds, Manchester, Nottingham, Southampton and two in London - based at Lord's and the Oval - it will be screened on Sky Sports and the BBC. The Hundred launch as it happened Efforts to cut sugar out of food way off target Ultra-processed foods 'make you eat more' A spokesperson for the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said: ""Our goal for cricket is to connect communities and improve lives by inspiring people to discover and share their passion for cricket. ""Across their portfolio of brands, KP has almost unprecedented reach into the lives of all of Britain's diverse consumers and is keen to work with us to help grow the game of cricket."" The spokesperson added that the partnership with KP will allow the ECB to engage with more people and educate them about health, activity and balance. But after the teams, players and kits were unveiled on Thursday, anti-obesity campaigners criticised the KP Snacks branding on the teams' shirts, promoting foods such as Hula Hoops, Skips, McCoy's crisps and Butterkist popcorn. Caroline Cerny at the Obesity Health Alliance, which represents dozens of health charities, said: ""Junk food brands sponsorship of popular sporting events is just another way they make sure their unhealthy products take centre stage in children's minds."" She said the ""relentless exposure"" to junk food marketing influences children's food choices and how much they eat. Joe Root will play for Trent Rockets, based in Nottingham, with Skips-branded kit Tam Fry, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said snack food companies argued their products could be eaten as part of a balanced diet ""but children don't know what a balanced diet is"". He said the high salt content of junk food was an increasing concern, with some children as young as 10 now at risk of heart problems due to their salt intake. The criticism comes after new rules were introduced to prevent companies advertising food and drinks which are high in fat, salt and sugar to under-16s. Several companies have seen their advertising banned, but the rules only apply to TV and online adverts. The ECB declined to comment, but when the sponsorship was first announced in July, commercial director Rob Calder said: ""We're thrilled to be partnering with KP Snacks to help grow the game of cricket and get families active."" Kate Cross, the England and Lancashire player who will play for Manchester Originals in The Hundred, told BBC Breakfast there had been ""negativity"" over the sponsorship on social media. But she said: ""For us it's about inspiring kids to pick up a bat and ball and get involved in exercise. As a professional sports person, you know you can have a balanced lifestyle, there can be a bit of both."" The sponsorship money was crucial to giving the women's sport a greater platform and allowing more women to go professional, she said. Sponsorship helps to support the women's game, says England international Kate Cross Asked about the gender pay gap, where men will earn up to Â£125,000 in the month-long tournament while women only earn up to Â£15,000, she said it was still ""very desirable"" compared to other women's teams worldwide. A spokesman for KP Snacks said: ""We believe that snacks can be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise. We have partnered with The Hundred to help encourage families to get active through cricket.""

"A new cricket tournament designed to appeal to children and families has been criticised by health campaigners for its snack food sponsorship. Each team in The Hundred, a new format from the England and Wales Cricket Board, features a KP Snacks logo. An anti-obesity group said brands such as KP wanted junk food to ""take centre stage in children's minds"". England cricketer Kate Cross said she hoped the competition would inspire children to be active. The tournament, which begins in July 2020, is intended to attract new audiences to cricket with a rapid-fire format where each team faces just 100 balls. Featuring men's and women's teams from Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds, Manchester, Nottingham, Southampton and two in London - based at Lord's and the Oval - it will be screened on Sky Sports and the BBC. The Hundred launch as it happened Efforts to cut sugar out of food way off target Ultra-processed foods 'make you eat more' A spokesperson for the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said: ""Our goal for cricket is to connect communities and improve lives by inspiring people to discover and share their passion for cricket. ""Across their portfolio of brands, KP has almost unprecedented reach into the lives of all of Britain's diverse consumers and is keen to work with us to help grow the game of cricket."" The spokesperson added that the partnership with KP will allow the ECB to engage with more people and educate them about health, activity and balance. But after the teams, players and kits were unveiled on Thursday, anti-obesity campaigners criticised the KP Snacks branding on the teams' shirts, promoting foods such as Hula Hoops, Skips, McCoy's crisps and Butterkist popcorn. Caroline Cerny at the Obesity Health Alliance, which represents dozens of health charities, said: ""Junk food brands sponsorship of popular sporting events is just another way they make sure their unhealthy products take centre stage in children's minds."" She said the ""relentless exposure"" to junk food marketing influences children's food choices and how much they eat. Joe Root will play for Trent Rockets, based in Nottingham, with Skips-branded kit Tam Fry, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said snack food companies argued their products could be eaten as part of a balanced diet ""but children don't know what a balanced diet is"". He said the high salt content of junk food was an increasing concern, with some children as young as 10 now at risk of heart problems due to their salt intake. The criticism comes after new rules were introduced to prevent companies advertising food and drinks which are high in fat, salt and sugar to under-16s. Several companies have seen their advertising banned, but the rules only apply to TV and online adverts. The ECB declined to comment, but when the sponsorship was first announced in July, commercial director Rob Calder said: ""We're thrilled to be partnering with KP Snacks to help grow the game of cricket and get families active."" Kate Cross, the England and Lancashire player who will play for Manchester Originals in The Hundred, told BBC Breakfast there had been ""negativity"" over the sponsorship on social media. But she said: ""For us it's about inspiring kids to pick up a bat and ball and get involved in exercise. As a professional sports person, you know you can have a balanced lifestyle, there can be a bit of both."" The sponsorship money was crucial to giving the women's sport a greater platform and allowing more women to go professional, she said. Sponsorship helps to support the women's game, says England international Kate Cross Asked about the gender pay gap, where men will earn up to Â£125,000 in the month-long tournament while women only earn up to Â£15,000, she said it was still ""very desirable"" compared to other women's teams worldwide. A spokesman for KP Snacks said: ""We believe that snacks can be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise. We have partnered with The Hundred to help encourage families to get active through cricket."" But he said the company recognised ""we have a responsibility to provide people with healthier snacking choices"". Since 2005, KP has cut salt in Hula Hoops by 42% and in some McCoy's flavours by 25%, while 29 products in its range have 100 calories or fewer per pack, the spokesman said.

"Hopes of a big rise in UK car sales in September have been dashed, spreading more gloom about the sector's health. Sales in what is the industry's second most important month rose 1.3% from a year earlier, well below the double-digit growth hoped for. In the first nine months of the year, car sales fell 2.5% to 1.86 million, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said September's rise was ""fairly paltry"". The small rise compared with what Mr Hawes described as a ""pretty awful"" September 2018, when sales slumped 20% due to the introduction of tougher emissions rules restricting the availability of certain vehicles. ""Any uplift from last year was welcome,"" Mr Hawes told the BBC. ""So we were hoping for something like a double-digit increase this September."" March, followed by September, are traditionally the industry's most important sales months due to licence plate changes typically prompting a spike in demand. Other major European markets had seen much stronger sales growth last month. Nissan to cut 12,500 jobs worldwide Brexit shutdown cuts car output by 45% Mr Hawes said: ""Consumer confidence is being undermined by political and economic uncertainty. We need to restore stability to the market which means avoiding a no-deal Brexit and, moreover, agreeing a future relationship with the EU that avoids tariffs and barriers that could increase prices and reduce buyer choice."" Sales of diesel models were down 20.6% during the first nine months of 2019, while demand for new petrol models was up 2.6%. Make no mistake, these figures are pretty dire. Registrations are up slightly compared to last year. But in September 2018 sales plummeted across Europe, due to supply problems resulting from the introduction of a new emissions testing regime. In other countries, they've recovered. In Germany last month they were up 22% for example. In Spain, they were up 18%. We ought to be seeing a double-digit improvement here, too. But we're not. The SMMT blames political and economic uncertainty linked to Brexit. Though the collapse in demand for diesel is still having an impact. Big picture, registrations have been falling pretty steadily for more than two years, and are at levels not seen since 2013. Even in an industry used to swinging fortunes, it's become a deeply worrying trend. But at least sales of electric cars have been accelerating. So there's a spark of optimism among the gloom. The market for battery electric cars is up by 122.1% but the plug-in hybrid sector is down by 29.2%. While growth in electric cars is good news, it still only represents a fraction of the market, Mr Hawes said. Government grants for new low-emission cars were slashed in October last year, meaning hybrid models are no longer eligible for the scheme. Motoring groups have warned that the decision will leave the UK struggling to meet targets to reduce vehicle emissions. Karen Johnson, head of retail and wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, said: ""The first increase in new car sales for some time will offer no relief, as the comparison with an extremely weak September 2018 was expected to be better than this. ""New fuel regulations lowered sales a year ago, and this time around it's hard to look beyond a lack of consumer confidence due to Brexit uncertainty as the primary reason for the pick-up not materialising as hoped. ""We're also seeing increasing evidence of purchasers who would previously have looked to buy a new vehicle instead switching to the used car market.""

"Ex-Premier League footballer Dean Saunders outside Chester Magistrates' Court Ex-Liverpool striker Dean Saunders has won his appeal against a jail sentence for failing to take a breath test. Saunders, 55, was jailed for 10 weeks by District Judge Nicholas Sanders when he appeared at Chester Magistrates' Court on 28 August. He admitting failing to comply with a roadside breath test and failing to provide a breath specimen. Judge Steven Everett has quashed the immediate jail term and instead suspended the sentence for 18 months. Saunders also played for Aston Villa, Derby County, and Nottingham Forest and won 75 caps for Wales. Judge Everett, the Honorary Recorder of Chester Crown Court, also ordered Saunders to do 200 hours of unpaid work in the community. His 30-month road ban remains. Saunders failed to comply with a roadside breath test when he was stopped in an Audi A8 by a police patrol in Chester city centre on May 10 after spending a day at the races. He spent just one day in custody and was given bail after his lawyers launched an appeal against his jail sentence. The court was shown footage from a police body-cam taken in the custody suite at Blacon police station. For several minutes Saunders is repeatedly offered the chance to provide a breath specimen but he tells police he wants to wait for the duty solicitor. After being told that is not an option he continues to question the instruction and is told that he will be prosecuted for failing to provide a specimen. This video can not be played Dean Saunders was filmed by an officer's body camera after his Audi was stopped Alistair Webster QC, defending, told the court the immediate prison sentence was ""disproportionate"". He said the footage which was issued to the media by the police and had left his client ""humiliated"". ""He rapidly went from an icon to a laughing stock,"" the barrister said. Mr Webster added: ""He's not been able to watch (the footage) before because he feels overwhelming humiliation by everything that happened."" Judge Everett said he believed Saunders ""had a lot to drink"" and ""prevaricated"" over taking a breath test so the reading would be lower. The judge said he took ""entirely wrong approach"" at the magistrates' court in telling probation officers he could not do work in the community because of his job as a TV pundit. Dean Saunders told police 'I only had one pint' Ex-footballer jailed for refusing breath test Breath test refusal ex-footballer leaves jail The court heard Saunders was now willing to carry out community service and the only other realistic option was serving a sentence in jail. Judge Everett said the district judge had been right to jail Saunders but, because of his previous good character and the prospect of rehabilitation, he could now suspend the sentence. ""The sheer shame is going to live with you for the rest of your life,"" he added. ""You should literally hang your head in shame by what you did. ""I suggest you take the opportunity to tell others that it really isn't worth it. Drink-driving is a terrible thing."" In a statement released by the League Managers Association, Saunders said: ""I want to apologise to the court, my family and all of the people I have let down as a result of my actions. ""I made a terrible error of judgment for which I have been rightly punished, and I wholeheartedly regret that it happened. ""I accept that I have been given an opportunity by the court and I hope that people can learn from my experience. The message is a simple one - don't ever drink and drive.""

"Edward Putman was found guilty of fraud by false representation A conman who cashed in a fake National Lottery ticket to claim a Â£2.5m jackpot has been jailed for nine years. Edward Putman, 54, claimed he had found the winning ticket under a seat in his van in 2009 just before the deadline to claim the win passed. But St Albans Crown Court heard he was helped by Camelot insider Giles Knibbs who knew how to cheat the system. Putman, of Kings Langley in Hertfordshire, was found guilty of fraud by false representation. The court heard the fraud came to light after Mr Knibbs, who had a row with Putman over how the winnings were divided, took his own life in October 2015. Sentencing Putman, Judge Philip Grey called it a ""sophisticated, carefully planned, and diligently operated fraud"". ""You would have got away with this but quite plainly you were greedy"", he added. ""This crime struck at the integrity of the National Lottery. You have also undermined the public's trust in the lottery itself."" The fake ticket was used by Putman to claim the Lottery win Putman claimed the win on 28 August 2009 by using a badly-damaged ticket forged by Mr Knibbs, who worked for Camelot in the fraud detection department. Mr Knibbs had seen a document containing details of big wins which had not yet been claimed and prosecutor James Keeley said there was ""some trial and error"" in producing the successful forgery. The court heard each ticket had one of the 100 different possible unique codes at the bottom and Putman had gone to 29 different shops, providing a different ticket in each, before the right number was found at a shop in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. Fraud accused 'found Lottery ticket in his van' Lottery worker 'confessed scam' to former partner Worker 'helped with fake Lottery win scam' Mr Knibbs confessed to friends he had ""conned"" the Lottery after the row with Putman, a convicted rapist and benefits cheat, in June 2015. He also told them about technical inaccuracies in the creation of the ticket that Putman, of Station Road, had used. Evidence suggested Mr Knibbs was initially paid Â£280,000 by Putman for his part in the ruse, followed by much smaller increments totalling Â£50,000. Edward Putman was pictured outside court covering his face Putman was paid the jackpot by Camelot in September 2009 despite the bottom part of the mangled slip missing the barcode, the trial heard. Three years laterhe was sentenced to nine months in jail for benefit fraudafter claiming Â£13,000 in housing and income support following his win. In 2016, theGambling Commission fined Camelot Â£3mfor breaching its operating licence regarding controlling databases, investigating prize claims, and paying out prizes. A Camelot spokeswoman said there were ""some weaknesses in some of the specific controls relevant to this incident at the time and we're very sorry for that"". ""We've strengthened our processes significantly since then and are completely confident that an incident of this nature could not happen today,"" she added. The genuine winning ticket, which was bought in Worcester, has never been discovered. Tapashi Nadarajah, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said Putman's ""lies unravelled with the tragic death of his co-conspirator who he wasn't prepared to share the money with"".

"This video can not be played ""The oceans are rising but so are we"" The Green Party's co-leader is calling for the Home Office to be scrapped in a radical shake-up of immigration policy. Jonathan Bartley said the department was ""pernicious"" in its treatment of people and a new Ministry for Sanctuary should oversee a ""fairer"" system. In a speech to his party conference, he warned of a ""new authoritarianism"" in Britain and said he was ""ashamed of what our country has become"". Only the Greens could deal with the injustices that led to Brexit, he said. Addressing activists on the first day of the Green Party conference in Newport, Mr Bartley also called for free bus travel in England, and for all future laws passed by Parliament to be measured against their environmental impact on the next generation. Wales 'last frontier for the Green Party' The party, which opposes Brexit and supports another referendum, has only one MP in Westminster, Caroline Lucas, but performed strongly in council and European elections earlier this year. In his speech, Mr Bartley - who shares the leadership with Sian Berry - said a ""green wave was sweeping the continent and we are surfing it in England and Wales"". Paying tribute to climate protesters, including Extinction Rebellion, who he said had made the future of the planet a political imperative, he said the ""oceans are rising but so are we"". Outlining a ""radical plan"" to revamp government and the economy, he said the Home Office should be scrapped and its responsibilities shared between two new departments. All bus travel should be free in England and Wales, Mr Bartley said While the Ministry for Sanctuary would be in charge of immigration policy, the Ministry for the Interior would have responsibility for law and order. The changes, he said, were needed to address the ""austerity, inequality and political exclusion"" which he said had contributed to the Brexit vote. ""We would abolish the pernicious Home Office because transformation of our country demands a system that is truly representative of and fair to everyone,"" he said. While his party opposed Brexit, he said it would not be joining the Liberal Democrats in calling for Article 50 to be revoked, which would end the process entirely. Welcoming Labour's ""late"" conversion to the idea of another referendum on Brexit, he said only the people could settle the issue of the UK's future in Europe. ""If we want to stay in Europe, we must win the argument over Europe,"" he said. ""If they (the government) were on the side of the people they would trust the people, and give the people a people's vote"" He called for the a total overhaul of the economy to deal with the climate emergency, saying policy-makers ""must do what the science demands not what is deemed politically possible"". His key environmental proposals include: Introducing a carbon tax to fund investments in renewable energy. Scrapping the HS2 rail line and investing Â£70bn in local transport networks Phasing out petrol and diesel cars by 2030 Installing a ""Climate Chancellor"" so all decisions are judged on environmental impact Passing a Future Generations Act which would require the needs of young people to be taken into account before every government decision ""This can be a new start,"" he concluded. ""We need a decisive break from business as usual, and we are ready to make the leap. ""The Green Party has always been on the right side of history. The time is now to shape our future."" Ms Berry, who is running to be Mayor of London, will address the three-day event on Sunday.

Paying tribute to climate protesters, including Extinction Rebellion, who he said had made the future of the planet a political imperative, he said the ""oceans are rising but so are we"". Outlining a ""radical plan"" to revamp government and the economy, he said the Home Office should be scrapped and its responsibilities shared between two new departments. All bus travel should be free in England and Wales, Mr Bartley said While the Ministry for Sanctuary would be in charge of immigration policy, the Ministry for the Interior would have responsibility for law and order. The changes, he said, were needed to address the ""austerity, inequality and political exclusion"" which he said had contributed to the Brexit vote. ""We would abolish the pernicious Home Office because transformation of our country demands a system that is truly representative of and fair to everyone,"" he said. While his party opposed Brexit, he said it would not be joining the Liberal Democrats in calling for Article 50 to be revoked, which would end the process entirely. Welcoming Labour's ""late"" conversion to the idea of another referendum on Brexit, he said only the people could settle the issue of the UK's future in Europe. ""If we want to stay in Europe, we must win the argument over Europe,"" he said. ""If they (the government) were on the side of the people they would trust the people, and give the people a people's vote"" He called for the a total overhaul of the economy to deal with the climate emergency, saying policy-makers ""must do what the science demands not what is deemed politically possible"". His key environmental proposals include: Introducing a carbon tax to fund investments in renewable energy. Scrapping the HS2 rail line and investing Â£70bn in local transport networks Phasing out petrol and diesel cars by 2030 Installing a ""Climate Chancellor"" so all decisions are judged on environmental impact Passing a Future Generations Act which would require the needs of young people to be taken into account before every government decision ""This can be a new start,"" he concluded. ""We need a decisive break from business as usual, and we are ready to make the leap. ""The Green Party has always been on the right side of history. The time is now to shape our future."" Ms Berry, who is running to be Mayor of London, will address the three-day event on Sunday.

"This video can not be played Watch the moment protesters burn a banner after Hong Kong's face mask ban Hong Kong's chief executive Carrie Lam has used a colonial-era emergency law to ban face masks to try to quell months of anti-government unrest. She said the ban would come into force on Saturday, after an escalation of violence during protests on 1 October. Ms Lam said the decision was taken because the situation could not be allowed ""to get worse and worse"". Protesters, who have promised to defy the new law, immediately took to the streets in response. By 22:00 local time (14:00 GMT), a number of banks, buildings and stations had been vandalised by the demonstrators. Police had fired off multiple rounds of tear gas. Mask-wearing activists had also earlier called on others to wear masks in defiance of the government, which critics fear is becoming increasingly authoritarian. Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words The background you need on the Hong Kong protests Ms Lam said she was forced to implement the colonial-era law because the violence at the now-weekly protests was ""destroying the city"". Observers say the regulation will be hard to enforce and hugely controversial: critics have warned the mask ban could be the first in a series of ""draconian"" measures. ""This is a watershed. This is a Rubicon,"" pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo told news agency AFP.  ""And I'm worried this could be just a starter. More draconian bans in the name of law could be lurking around the corner."" The announcement has also prompted reaction from further afield, with Marta Hurtado, the United Nations human rights spokeswoman, noting at a press conference in Geneva that ""any restriction must have a basis in law and be proportionate and as least intrusive as possible"". UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, meanwhile, has said ""political dialogue is the only way to resolve the situation"". But Beijing welcomed the move, saying the ban was ""extremely necessary"" to end the violent protests. Secretary for Security John Lee said the ban would apply for approved and unapproved public assemblies - rallies and marches - as well as in unlawful assemblies and riots. The ban covers all kinds of facial covering, including face paint. Protesters have increasingly worn masks for a number of reasons, including to conceal their identities - from employers, parents and, in some cases, police - and to protect themselves from tear gas. The ban targets all manner of facial coverings There are exemptions for people wearing masks for health reasons, or if required by their profession. Ms Lam said ""violence had been escalating to alarming levels"" leading to a situation of ""chaos and panic"" in the city. The legislation invoked by Ms Lam, called the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, dates to 1922 and has not been used in more than 50 years. It enables the chief executive to bypass the normal legislative process, where bills have to go through the city's parliament, the Legislative Council. Protesters have often worn face masks to hide their identity The ERO was last used in 1967 to help stop riots in the territory's trading hub. Ms Lam stressed the new regulation did not mean that Hong Kong was in a state of emergency. But she said the city was ""in a state of serious public danger"". The city's chief executive said what had been single rallies or marches, when the protests began, had spread to many areas across Hong Kong. She said petrol bombs were being used inside closed spaces like railway stations, and that violent protesters had targeted public buildings and private properties. She also accused protesters of not just criticising but ""lynching"" people with different views. It is unclear exactly what she was referring to. Ms Lam appealed that ""we all say no to violence"" According to the government, the percentage of demonstrators who are students has risen from 25% to 38%. Ms Lam said the mask ban would help prevent students breaking the law. She also pointed out that similar bans on facial coverings were in place in other places around the world. France to ban protest masks amid unrest Hong Kong's protests started in June, sparked by proposals to extradite suspected criminals to mainland China. The extradition bill has since been cancelled but protests have widened into pro-democracy and anti-police demonstrations. This video can not be played How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence Over the months, clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent. On Tuesday, police shot a protester in the chest with a live bullet for the first time. Authorities say the 18-year-old - who was attacking police and was arrested after being shot - is in a stable condition in hospital. Hong Kong is a former British colony handed back to China in 1997. It has a ""one country, two systems"" agreement that guarantees it some autonomy, and its people certain freedoms, including freedom of assembly and freedom of speech. But those freedoms - the Basic Law - expire in 2047 and it is not clear what Hong Kong's status will then be.

"Diane saw her annual home insurance premium shoot up Diane's reward for staying with the same home insurance provider for 10 years was a rise in her annual premium from Â£1,500 to Â£3,500. The 76-year-old, from Kent, said: ""Being a pensioner, I don't like changing."" She ended up looking in the phone book, calling around for a deal. She is an example of the six million people who pay on average Â£200 too much on premiums. The City regulator has found consumers are overpaying by Â£1.2bn a year. Competition in the home and insurance market is not working and loyal customers are being penalised, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) says. It is considering bans on automatic price rises and making firms move consumers to cheaper deals, but said ""the ball is now in the industry's court"". ""This market is not working well for all consumers,"" said Christopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA. ""While a large number of people shop around, many loyal customers are not getting a good deal. We believe this affects around six million consumers. ""We have set out a package of potential remedies to ensure these markets are truly competitive and address the problems we have uncovered. We expect the industry to work with us as we do so."" Mr Woolard said the review did not reveal the insurance industry was breaching the rules on a wholesale basis. But he said it was clear that changes needed to be made, and some in the industry would accept this. He said in many cases - as was the case for Diane - it was much easier for consumers to renew a policy, sometimes just by ticking a box, than it was to switch away to a cheaper deal. The FCA said that more than one in 10 people were paying very high prices for their insurance. One in three of them were vulnerable in some way, perhaps elderly or lower paid. The regulator found,externalthat some insurers targeted price increases at those less likely to switch. Possible FCA remedies include: Banning or restricting practices such as raising prices for consumers who renew every year, or requiring firms to automatically move consumers to cheaper equivalent deals Stop practices that could discourage switching - including restricting the way that firms use automatic renewal Make firms be clear and transparent in their dealings with consumers - including improvements to the way they communicate with their customers The FCA intends to publish its final report on possible remedies in early 2020 after further consultation with the industry and consumer groups. By Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter You have never had a problem with your insurer or bank so you have stayed with them for years. What the FCA's, and other reviews, have shown is that this is an expensive option - for home and motor cover, overdrafts and more. Loyalty does not pay. Those unable or uncomfortable with searching for a better deal online, or haggling, pay more. There is also a nod in this FCA report to the poverty premium - you get a worse deal if your finances are less ""resilient"" or you struggle with handling money. Many of the same people will be among the eight million who an independent report estimated would be left behind if the UK became a cashless society. Undoubtedly, they will feel like the financial victims of the advances in technology which have changed the way we live our lives. Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, the industry's trade body, said his members accepted that the home and car insurance markets could work better for consumers who do not shop around at renewal. But he added: ""This is not an issue unique to insurance. It is important that any unintended consequences are carefully considered to ensure that a fair and balanced approach is achieved for all customers."" The consequences could be more expensive premiums for those shopping around, but the FCA said that, while it was keen to maintain a level of competition, the variation in prices to cover the same level of risk was too great. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said ""it's great to see the FCA acknowledging that the insurance market isn't working"". But she cautioned that the FCA's report set out proposals only. ""The FCA must now follow through on these bold ideas to stop loyal insurance customers being penalised,"" she said. Citizens Advice said it should not be left to the consumer to find the best deals. Rather, the market should be set up to ensure everyone is treated fairly. However, its advice to people searching for the lowest prices is: Shop around Ensure you opt out of auto-renewals Make a note of insurance expiry dates Use comparison websites Car and house insurance faces price probe Consumer loyalty 'rip off' faces probe Insurers 'burying price rises' Insurers accept that renewal premiums unfair Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while official hits out at looters Maps and pictures chart how fires have spread Biden praises Carter's character as former president's casket heads to Georgia The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"King's Cross Estate's managers say the facial recognition scans ended in 2018 London's Metropolitan Police Service says it does not have any records of the outcomes of a facial recognition tie-up with a private firm in the city. Last month, it acknowledged it had shared people's pictures with the managers of the city's King's Cross Estate development. It had previously denied the alliance. In a new report, the Met added that it hadonly shared seven images,externaland did not believe there had been similar arrangements with other private bodies. It said the pictures were of ""persons who had been arrested and charged/cautioned/reprimanded or given a formal warning"" and had been provided by Camden Borough Police. The aim, it added, had been to ""prevent crime, to protect vulnerable members of the community or to support the safety strategy"". But it admitted that it had no record of whether the estate manager's surveillance camera system had ever made facial matches of those involved, nor whether any police action had been taken as a result. ""The findings of this report need to be caveated by noting the limitations of technology which was not designed to be audited in this way, and the limitations of corporate memory,"" it explained. It also confirmed that the facial recognition system in use at the estate was that of the Japanese firm NEC - something the management firm, Argent, had repeatedly declined to divulge itself. NEC's systems have also been deployed by the Met as well as South Wales Police in their own trials of live facial recognition. The Met also confirmed that the image-sharing arrangement had lasted between May 2016 and March 2018, and added that a new agreement had been put in place at the start of this year. However, it said no images had been shared under the new tie-up. Argent had previously said it intended to launch a more advanced facial recognition system at the property but had yet to do so. It has since ditched the proposal. The Met has again apologised for misinforming the mayor and members of London's Assembly about its involvement and blamed the mistake on the agreement having been struck at a ""borough level"". London's deputy mayor for policing and crime, Sophie Linden,added that she had been informed,externalthat the police service had written to all the city's basic command units to make it ""clear that there should be no local level agreements on the use of live facial recognition"". In a statement given to the BBC she added: ""The Mayor and I are committed to holding the Met to account on its use of facial recognition technology and that's why the [Met's] commissioner agrees with us that there will be no further deployment anywhere in London until all of the conditions set out in the London Policing Ethics Panel report have been addressed."" Use of the tech was frozen earlier in the year before details of the King's Cross partnership emerged. British Transport Police had previously confirmed it too had shared images with Argent for use in its facial recognition system. Privacy campaigners have raised concerns about the affair because it had not been apparent to the public that facial recognition scans were in use in what is a popular open-air site, home to shops, offices, education and leisure facilities. Moreover, any formal tie-up between the police and an independent organisation concerning the use of facial recognition is supposed to be flagged to a surveillance camera commissioner. The watchdog previously blocked another similar arrangement involving police in Manchester and a local shopping centre. Met Police gave images for King's Cross facial recognition scans King's Cross facial-recognition plans revealed by letter King's Cross investor seeks facial recognition answers In a related development, Argent has revealed further details of the scheme to Big Brother Watch after the privacy campaign group submitted a data subject access request. Argent said it had: retained data from its facial recognition checks for a maximum of 30 days if there was a match, and instantly discarded information in relation to other scans used at least two security officers, one of whom was often a police employee, to confirm the matches used the Ministry of Justice's Criminal Justice Secure email service to transfer data to the two police forces involved ""The fact that police initially denied involvement and have few records about it shows how out of control facial recognition use is in this country,"" said Big Brother Watch's director Silkie Carlo. Argent cancelled plans to turn on a new facial recognition system at King's Cross The surveillance camera commissioner for England and Wales, who has also been looking into the matter, said he believed the case highlighted the need for the government to refresh a code of practice intended togive the public confidence in the use of the technology,external. ""The concern I've got about private organisations working with the police, is the lack of oversight,"" commented Tony Porter. ""Who is providing oversight to the watch list? Who's on the watch list?

"Ex-Premier League footballer Dean Saunders outside Chester Magistrates' Court Ex-Liverpool striker Dean Saunders has won his appeal against a jail sentence for failing to take a breath test. Saunders, 55, was jailed for 10 weeks by District Judge Nicholas Sanders when he appeared at Chester Magistrates' Court on 28 August. He admitting failing to comply with a roadside breath test and failing to provide a breath specimen. Judge Steven Everett has quashed the immediate jail term and instead suspended the sentence for 18 months. Saunders also played for Aston Villa, Derby County, and Nottingham Forest and won 75 caps for Wales. Judge Everett, the Honorary Recorder of Chester Crown Court, also ordered Saunders to do 200 hours of unpaid work in the community. His 30-month road ban remains. Saunders failed to comply with a roadside breath test when he was stopped in an Audi A8 by a police patrol in Chester city centre on May 10 after spending a day at the races. He spent just one day in custody and was given bail after his lawyers launched an appeal against his jail sentence. The court was shown footage from a police body-cam taken in the custody suite at Blacon police station. For several minutes Saunders is repeatedly offered the chance to provide a breath specimen but he tells police he wants to wait for the duty solicitor. After being told that is not an option he continues to question the instruction and is told that he will be prosecuted for failing to provide a specimen. This video can not be played Dean Saunders was filmed by an officer's body camera after his Audi was stopped Alistair Webster QC, defending, told the court the immediate prison sentence was ""disproportionate"". He said the footage which was issued to the media by the police and had left his client ""humiliated"". ""He rapidly went from an icon to a laughing stock,"" the barrister said. Mr Webster added: ""He's not been able to watch (the footage) before because he feels overwhelming humiliation by everything that happened."" Judge Everett said he believed Saunders ""had a lot to drink"" and ""prevaricated"" over taking a breath test so the reading would be lower. The judge said he took ""entirely wrong approach"" at the magistrates' court in telling probation officers he could not do work in the community because of his job as a TV pundit. Dean Saunders told police 'I only had one pint' Ex-footballer jailed for refusing breath test Breath test refusal ex-footballer leaves jail The court heard Saunders was now willing to carry out community service and the only other realistic option was serving a sentence in jail. Judge Everett said the district judge had been right to jail Saunders but, because of his previous good character and the prospect of rehabilitation, he could now suspend the sentence. ""The sheer shame is going to live with you for the rest of your life,"" he added. ""You should literally hang your head in shame by what you did. ""I suggest you take the opportunity to tell others that it really isn't worth it. Drink-driving is a terrible thing."" In a statement released by the League Managers Association, Saunders said: ""I want to apologise to the court, my family and all of the people I have let down as a result of my actions. ""I made a terrible error of judgment for which I have been rightly punished, and I wholeheartedly regret that it happened. ""I accept that I have been given an opportunity by the court and I hope that people can learn from my experience. The message is a simple one - don't ever drink and drive.""

"This video can not be played Watch the moment protesters burn a banner after Hong Kong's face mask ban Hong Kong's chief executive Carrie Lam has used a colonial-era emergency law to ban face masks to try to quell months of anti-government unrest. She said the ban would come into force on Saturday, after an escalation of violence during protests on 1 October. Ms Lam said the decision was taken because the situation could not be allowed ""to get worse and worse"". Protesters, who have promised to defy the new law, immediately took to the streets in response. By 22:00 local time (14:00 GMT), a number of banks, buildings and stations had been vandalised by the demonstrators. Police had fired off multiple rounds of tear gas. Mask-wearing activists had also earlier called on others to wear masks in defiance of the government, which critics fear is becoming increasingly authoritarian. Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words The background you need on the Hong Kong protests Ms Lam said she was forced to implement the colonial-era law because the violence at the now-weekly protests was ""destroying the city"". Observers say the regulation will be hard to enforce and hugely controversial: critics have warned the mask ban could be the first in a series of ""draconian"" measures. ""This is a watershed. This is a Rubicon,"" pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo told news agency AFP.  ""And I'm worried this could be just a starter. More draconian bans in the name of law could be lurking around the corner."" The announcement has also prompted reaction from further afield, with Marta Hurtado, the United Nations human rights spokeswoman, noting at a press conference in Geneva that ""any restriction must have a basis in law and be proportionate and as least intrusive as possible"". UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, meanwhile, has said ""political dialogue is the only way to resolve the situation"". But Beijing welcomed the move, saying the ban was ""extremely necessary"" to end the violent protests. Secretary for Security John Lee said the ban would apply for approved and unapproved public assemblies - rallies and marches - as well as in unlawful assemblies and riots. The ban covers all kinds of facial covering, including face paint. Protesters have increasingly worn masks for a number of reasons, including to conceal their identities - from employers, parents and, in some cases, police - and to protect themselves from tear gas. The ban targets all manner of facial coverings There are exemptions for people wearing masks for health reasons, or if required by their profession. Ms Lam said ""violence had been escalating to alarming levels"" leading to a situation of ""chaos and panic"" in the city. The legislation invoked by Ms Lam, called the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, dates to 1922 and has not been used in more than 50 years. It enables the chief executive to bypass the normal legislative process, where bills have to go through the city's parliament, the Legislative Council. Protesters have often worn face masks to hide their identity The ERO was last used in 1967 to help stop riots in the territory's trading hub. Ms Lam stressed the new regulation did not mean that Hong Kong was in a state of emergency. But she said the city was ""in a state of serious public danger"". The city's chief executive said what had been single rallies or marches, when the protests began, had spread to many areas across Hong Kong. She said petrol bombs were being used inside closed spaces like railway stations, and that violent protesters had targeted public buildings and private properties. She also accused protesters of not just criticising but ""lynching"" people with different views. It is unclear exactly what she was referring to. Ms Lam appealed that ""we all say no to violence"" According to the government, the percentage of demonstrators who are students has risen from 25% to 38%. Ms Lam said the mask ban would help prevent students breaking the law. She also pointed out that similar bans on facial coverings were in place in other places around the world. France to ban protest masks amid unrest Hong Kong's protests started in June, sparked by proposals to extradite suspected criminals to mainland China. The extradition bill has since been cancelled but protests have widened into pro-democracy and anti-police demonstrations. This video can not be played How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence Over the months, clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent. On Tuesday, police shot a protester in the chest with a live bullet for the first time. Authorities say the 18-year-old - who was attacking police and was arrested after being shot - is in a stable condition in hospital. Hong Kong is a former British colony handed back to China in 1997. It has a ""one country, two systems"" agreement that guarantees it some autonomy, and its people certain freedoms, including freedom of assembly and freedom of speech. But those freedoms - the Basic Law - expire in 2047 and it is not clear what Hong Kong's status will then be.

"A new cricket tournament designed to appeal to children and families has been criticised by health campaigners for its snack food sponsorship. Each team in The Hundred, a new format from the England and Wales Cricket Board, features a KP Snacks logo. An anti-obesity group said brands such as KP wanted junk food to ""take centre stage in children's minds"". England cricketer Kate Cross said she hoped the competition would inspire children to be active. The tournament, which begins in July 2020, is intended to attract new audiences to cricket with a rapid-fire format where each team faces just 100 balls. Featuring men's and women's teams from Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds, Manchester, Nottingham, Southampton and two in London - based at Lord's and the Oval - it will be screened on Sky Sports and the BBC. The Hundred launch as it happened Efforts to cut sugar out of food way off target Ultra-processed foods 'make you eat more' A spokesperson for the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said: ""Our goal for cricket is to connect communities and improve lives by inspiring people to discover and share their passion for cricket. ""Across their portfolio of brands, KP has almost unprecedented reach into the lives of all of Britain's diverse consumers and is keen to work with us to help grow the game of cricket."" The spokesperson added that the partnership with KP will allow the ECB to engage with more people and educate them about health, activity and balance. But after the teams, players and kits were unveiled on Thursday, anti-obesity campaigners criticised the KP Snacks branding on the teams' shirts, promoting foods such as Hula Hoops, Skips, McCoy's crisps and Butterkist popcorn. Caroline Cerny at the Obesity Health Alliance, which represents dozens of health charities, said: ""Junk food brands sponsorship of popular sporting events is just another way they make sure their unhealthy products take centre stage in children's minds."" She said the ""relentless exposure"" to junk food marketing influences children's food choices and how much they eat. Joe Root will play for Trent Rockets, based in Nottingham, with Skips-branded kit Tam Fry, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said snack food companies argued their products could be eaten as part of a balanced diet ""but children don't know what a balanced diet is"". He said the high salt content of junk food was an increasing concern, with some children as young as 10 now at risk of heart problems due to their salt intake. The criticism comes after new rules were introduced to prevent companies advertising food and drinks which are high in fat, salt and sugar to under-16s. Several companies have seen their advertising banned, but the rules only apply to TV and online adverts. The ECB declined to comment, but when the sponsorship was first announced in July, commercial director Rob Calder said: ""We're thrilled to be partnering with KP Snacks to help grow the game of cricket and get families active."" Kate Cross, the England and Lancashire player who will play for Manchester Originals in The Hundred, told BBC Breakfast there had been ""negativity"" over the sponsorship on social media. But she said: ""For us it's about inspiring kids to pick up a bat and ball and get involved in exercise. As a professional sports person, you know you can have a balanced lifestyle, there can be a bit of both."" The sponsorship money was crucial to giving the women's sport a greater platform and allowing more women to go professional, she said. Sponsorship helps to support the women's game, says England international Kate Cross Asked about the gender pay gap, where men will earn up to Â£125,000 in the month-long tournament while women only earn up to Â£15,000, she said it was still ""very desirable"" compared to other women's teams worldwide. A spokesman for KP Snacks said: ""We believe that snacks can be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise. We have partnered with The Hundred to help encourage families to get active through cricket."" But he said the company recognised ""we have a responsibility to provide people with healthier snacking choices"". Since 2005, KP has cut salt in Hula Hoops by 42% and in some McCoy's flavours by 25%, while 29 products in its range have 100 calories or fewer per pack, the spokesman said.

"Destiny has been stuck in temporary accommodation after her student block was not completed on time Destiny is feeling cheated and angry. She is one of about 250 students at the University of Portsmouth left in the lurch when their accommodation was not finished in time for the new term. Instead of a glossy new room, she has been stuck temporarily in a hotel, away from other students - and with no cooking facilities she's had to live on take-away food for nearly three weeks. ""I've been feeling really anxious. I can't concentrate on my studies,"" says the politics student. There are 22 private student blocks across the UK that have been delayed this term - almost a third of those being built, according to student housing charity Unipol. Eva Crossan Jory, of the National Union of Students, says she is ""extremely concerned at the significant rise"" in students being disrupted. But the University of Portsmouth is also angry - because even though there might be an assumption that it has some link to the unfinished student flats, these are private developments over which the university has no control. Stanhope House for students in Portsmouth is still not ready for students to move in The university's vice-chancellor, Graham Galbraith, says there is a serious lack of scrutiny about how the private student accommodation system operates. ""At the end of the day, those housing providers know that the universities will step in. So where does the responsibility for this lie? Because they seem to be able to walk away,"" he says. Anyone going through university towns and cities will have seen new blocks of student flats mushrooming skywards. Bilgesu says she is having to stay in a hotel room away from students and without access to wi-fi These are often private investments, but the cash fuelling this building boom is public money - in the form of the maintenance loans to cover students' living costs. Prof Galbraith says it seems extraordinary that billions of pounds of taxpayers' money should go into these private rental projects with so little accountability. ""There is no real control,"" he says, and he warns that new blocks can open without even a ""conversation"" with the university. He also wants better consumer protection for students signing housing contracts, arguing that some ""arrangements are incredibly one-sided"". This autumn there have been reports of unfinished flats in locations from Portsmouth to Swansea, Lincoln to Liverpool. In Bristol, delays have meant students being put up temporarily in Wales. But it's not clear who might intervene. Students were expecting to move into this building in Portsmouth for the new term Universities UK says its code of conduct applies only to university-owned housing - which means any private student developments will not be covered. The higher-education regulator, the Office for Students, says it ""doesn't have powers to regulate private accommodation providers"". Portsmouth South MP Stephen Morgan asked a parliamentary question about ""safeguards for students affected by properties not being built in time"". But universities minister Chris Skidmore said universities were autonomous and that ""government plays no direct role in the provision of student residential accommodation"". In Portsmouth, Bilgesu is another student unable to move into the new Stanhope House student building. She is in a hotel with no free wi-fi, where she feels unable to get on with her degree course and isolated from student life. ""It's just so far away from the student environment,"" says the biomedical science student. Alex, an overseas student, found out that he had no accommodation when he was on his way to the UK Alex, an international student from the Netherlands, found out about the accommodation not being ready just as he was travelling to the UK. He was coming to a new country and a new city for the first time - and had nowhere to go, so booked himself into a hotel at his own expense. ""I didn't know anything about this city, I couldn't make any friends. It was hard for the first week,"" says Alex, who was then found a room by the university. He says he was even more taken aback when ""on the day they told people they can't move in, they were asking for money from them"". ""I feel like students are really easy to exploit. I just came here expecting the building to be ready, I'm trusting what I saw on the website."" Destiny says the disruption has meant she can't get the term started. ""I can't organise my books. It's affecting my studies,"" she says. The students are unimpressed by a compensation offer of Â£150 - less than they are still being charged for a week's rent. Student union president Helena Schofield says starting university is stressful enough without problems over housing The students' union and university officials have been trying to help students who have found themselves unable to move in. Union president Helena Schofield says the link between housing and students' mental health is underestimated. Starting at university can be an emotional time - and such uncertainty about accommodation, and being away from other students, can only add to the stress. The private housing company behind Stanhope House, Prime Student Living, says it has ""unreservedly apologised to students"". The University of Portsmouth has been trying to help students caught out by the non-completion of accommodation But it blames its building contractor for a lack of advance warning of the failure to open on time and says finding alternative accommodation was made an ""immediate priority"". The spokesman said the company was ""disappointed to hear that the university does not consider that we have communicated effectively to them"". ""We believe that we have done everything possible to mitigate the impact for those affected in the time available,"" said the Prime Student Living spokesman. ""We will continue to do all we can to get students into the building as an urgent priority.""

"John Lewis is seeking discounts from its landlords to cut costs, in a highly unusual move that highlights the huge pressures on retailers. The BBC has learned that the retail giant has been telling landlords in some locations that it will withhold 20% of this quarter's service charge. These are the fees retailers pay on top of rent for services such as heating and security. John Lewis said the charges had become too high and urged landlords to help. But the move could lead to legal action by property owners to recover any unpaid money. John Lewis Partnership announced a major restructuring of its management teams earlier this week in a bid to cut Â£100m a year from its costs. From next year its supermarkets and department store divisions will be run as one business. Four reasons John Lewis is under pressure John Lewis bonus cut as profits plunge But it's also clearly trying to make savings across its portfolio of stores as well. ""This was done without any consultation,"" one landlord told the BBC. ""Every landlord will be looking at their lease, talking to lawyers who will get revved up to recover this money as a debt,"" he added. A service charge is a sum due under the terms of a lease between a landlord and tenant, towards the costs incurred in providing a range of services for the operation of a building's common parts. That could include cleaning, security, maintenance, marketing, heating/cooling and staffing. Tenants are then charged on an apportioned basis relating to the size of the space occupied with larger stores getting a significant weighted discount. John Lewis has around 20 stores in covered shopping centres. It's understood that it wants mainly these landlords to shoulder some of the service charge during the so called ""golden quarter"" - the fourth quarter that includes Christmas. In September,the group posted its first ever loss for the first half of this year. In a statement John Lewis said: ""At a time when we are doing everything we can to reduce our cost base, we have unfortunately been faced with regular increases to the service charges we pay for some of our shops in shopping centres. ""Over the last three years we have seen an increase in service charges of 20% and these continued increases are simply not acceptable, particularly in the absence of strenuous efforts by landlords to work collaboratively with us to reduce these costs. ""We are investing more in our current shop estate than ever before to do everything we can to encourage customers to grow footfall to our shops and we hope that our landlords will support us in continuing to do this,"" it added. But John Lewis is under contract to meet its service charge obligations and withholding a big chunk of it could put it in direct conflict with some of its property owners. ""John Lewis is in a much better place than most of its rivals but its revenues are under enormous pressure right now,"" said another landlord. ""What they're up to, I think, is trying to open up a broader conversation about property costs more generally. The market is distorted right now. The stronger retailers are pretty concerned about this uneven playing field,"" he added. Debenhams has managed to slash its rent bill with reductions of up to 50% after securing a restructuring deal with its creditors. Struggling retailers have been turning to these so-called company voluntary arrangements as a way to cut costs. House of Fraser was bought out of administration by Mike Ashley's Sports Direct and many of these stores are currently paying little if any rent. John Lewis is one of Britain's stronger retail chains and has a reputation for plain dealing. This particular cost-cutting measure, if it succeeds, will be controversial for the already beleaguered retail property industry. The group's biggest landlords include Hammerson and Intu. ""I am astounded to hear this from a company which sets the gold standard in retail,"" one seasoned property expert told the BBC. ""There's nothing new in retailers trying to challenge the specifics of a service charge. But to seek to withhold money like this is in breach of a contract. This is going to go down like a lead balloon."" Landlords are already grappling with falling rents and property values. Now they may have something else to worry about if other retailers follow suit.

"The home secretary says that if Facebook has a credible plan to protect its users then it is time to disclose the details UK Home Secretary Priti Patel and counterparts in the US and Australia have sent an open letter to Facebook calling on it to rethink its plans to encrypt all messages on its platforms. The policy threatens ""lives and the safety of our children"", they said. They said it could hamper international efforts to grant law enforcers faster access to private messages on social media, as agreed between the UK and US. Facebook said ""people have the right to have a private conversation online."" The head of Facebook-owned WhatsAppWill Cathcart had previously posted on Hacker News,external: ""End-to-end encryption protects that right for over a billion people every day."" Facebook said it is ""consulting closely with child safety experts, governments and technology companies and devoting new teams and sophisticated technology"" to keep people safe. The letter was signed by Ms Patel, the US Attorney General William P Barr, Acting US Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan and the Australian minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton. It comes off the back of a data access agreement between the US and the UK  designed to remove the barriers to cross-border surveillance. It allows British law-enforcement agencies to demand from US tech firms data relating to terrorists, child-sexual abusers and other serious criminals. It is hoped it will dramatically speed up investigations - previously, the process of requesting data from US firms could take anything from six months to two years. This video can not be played What is encryption? Under the new agreement that could be cut to a matter of weeks or even days. But there is one major problem - messages sent over services using end-to-end encryption, such as WhatsApp, will remain unreadable. Following scandals over the misuse of personal data, the social network has focused on privacy and it now offers encryption as an option to users on its Messenger service. It also has plans to introduce it to Instagram. ""Tech companies like Facebook have a responsibility to balance privacy with the safety of the public,"" the letter read. It added: ""So far nothing we have seen from Facebook reassures me that their plans for end-to-end encryption will not act as barrier to the identification and pursuit of criminals operating on their platforms. ""Companies cannot operate with impunity where lives and the safety of our children is at stake, and if Mr Zuckerberg really has a credible plan to protect Facebook's more than two billion users, it's time he let us know what it is."" In 2018, Facebook made 16.8 million reports of child sexual exploitation and abuse content to the US National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, which the National Crime Agency estimates have led to more than 2,500 arrests and 3,000 children made safe. Head of online child safety at the NSPCC Tony Stower said: ""It's an absolute scandal that Facebook are actively choosing to provide offenders with a way to hide in the shadows on their platform, seamlessly able to target, groom and abuse children completely undetected. ""The landmark agreement between the US and UK on accessing data will radically reduce the time it takes for police to get hold of the data they need from tech giants to bring offenders to justice. ""It should be a hugely important step forward in tackling online child abuse - if tech giants play their part too."" There has been some confusion about whether the Cloud Act could force firms such as Facebook to offer so-called back doors to law enforcement. In a series of tweets on the issue,,externalFacebook's ex-technology officer Alex Stamos attempted to clarify. ""This agreement would allow UK courts to issue requests equivalent to US courts, but it does not grant them access to anything a US court can't get already,"" he wrote. ""Orders for wire taps of products like WhatsApp can get some data, like IP addresses, phone numbers, contact lists and avatar photos. It cannot get encrypted messages and attachments.""

"EU Council chief Donald Tusk is one of several leading EU figures to question Boris Johnson's plans The European Union is ""open but not convinced"" by the UK PM's new proposals for a Brexit deal with the EU, the president of the European Council says. Donald Tusk was among several leading EU voices to express doubt over Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement plan. The plan would keep Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods but see it leave the customs union. But what happens to the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland remains a central sticking point. Irish PM Leo Varadkar said the new plans for the withdrawal agreement were welcome, but ""fall short in a number of aspects"". It comes as UK PM Boris Johnson's Europe adviser, David Frost, is to hold another round of talks in Brussels in a bid to break the Brexit deadlock. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has told European diplomats he still has plenty of questions about the British proposal to replace the backstop - the measure designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit. Europe scorns Johnson's 'unrealistic' Brexit plans What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? He has said he will be in a better position to judge possible future negotiations with the UK once he has spoken to Mr Frost. On Thursday, Mr Johnson saidhe had made a ""genuine attempt to bridge the chasm"" with EU officialsbefore time runs out to reach a deal for the 31 October deadline for the UK to leave the EU. The UK government says it is aiming to reach a final agreement at an EU summit on 17 October. EU leaders face a delicate political dance, uncertain if Mr Johnson is open for deeper negotiations or is focusing his attention on a possible election campaign, the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says. Whatever happens, she adds, the EU will be reluctant to be seen slamming the door in the face of the UK. Meanwhile, Scotland's highest civil courtis to consider whether Mr Johnson could be jailed if he ignores legislation aimed at preventing no-deal. The so-called Benn Act requires the government to ask the EU for an extension to the Brexit deadline if it fails to either pass a deal in Parliament, or get MPs to approve no-deal, by 19 October. However, Mr Johnson has repeatedly insisted he would not ask for a delay as the law requires him to, describing the legislation as a ""surrender bill"". Downing Street hopes its new plan will replace the controversial Irish backstop provision that has proved the biggest obstacle to the existing withdrawal agreement. The backstop was meant to keep a free-flowing border on the island of Ireland but critics - including Mr Johnson - fear it could trap the UK in EU trading rules indefinitely. Mr Johnson's latest plan seeks to address this with the following: Northern Ireland to remain aligned with EU's single market rules for trade in animal, food and manufactured goods Northern Ireland's legislative assembly to have the right to decide every four years if it wants to continue to apply EU legislation to traded goods Northern Ireland to leave EU's customs union alongside rest of UK in 2021 Customs checks on goods traded between UK and EU to be ""decentralised"", with electronic paperwork and ""small number"" of physical checks away from border itself Read more:How does the border plan differ from the backstop? The new UK proposals envisage two borders - one between Northern Ireland and Ireland, and a second between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, says the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler. EU negotiators say they have already identified problems with the plans, including the continuing failure to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and the threat to the single market. Donald Tusk reacted in a tweet, after speaking to Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar, who is seen as key to agreeing to a withdrawal deal. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Watch the moment protesters burn a banner after Hong Kong's face mask ban Hong Kong's chief executive Carrie Lam has used a colonial-era emergency law to ban face masks to try to quell months of anti-government unrest. She said the ban would come into force on Saturday, after an escalation of violence during protests on 1 October. Ms Lam said the decision was taken because the situation could not be allowed ""to get worse and worse"". Protesters, who have promised to defy the new law, immediately took to the streets in response. By 22:00 local time (14:00 GMT), a number of banks, buildings and stations had been vandalised by the demonstrators. Police had fired off multiple rounds of tear gas. Mask-wearing activists had also earlier called on others to wear masks in defiance of the government, which critics fear is becoming increasingly authoritarian. Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words The background you need on the Hong Kong protests Ms Lam said she was forced to implement the colonial-era law because the violence at the now-weekly protests was ""destroying the city"". Observers say the regulation will be hard to enforce and hugely controversial: critics have warned the mask ban could be the first in a series of ""draconian"" measures. ""This is a watershed. This is a Rubicon,"" pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo told news agency AFP.  ""And I'm worried this could be just a starter. More draconian bans in the name of law could be lurking around the corner."" The announcement has also prompted reaction from further afield, with Marta Hurtado, the United Nations human rights spokeswoman, noting at a press conference in Geneva that ""any restriction must have a basis in law and be proportionate and as least intrusive as possible"". UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, meanwhile, has said ""political dialogue is the only way to resolve the situation"". But Beijing welcomed the move, saying the ban was ""extremely necessary"" to end the violent protests. Secretary for Security John Lee said the ban would apply for approved and unapproved public assemblies - rallies and marches - as well as in unlawful assemblies and riots. The ban covers all kinds of facial covering, including face paint. Protesters have increasingly worn masks for a number of reasons, including to conceal their identities - from employers, parents and, in some cases, police - and to protect themselves from tear gas. The ban targets all manner of facial coverings There are exemptions for people wearing masks for health reasons, or if required by their profession. Ms Lam said ""violence had been escalating to alarming levels"" leading to a situation of ""chaos and panic"" in the city. The legislation invoked by Ms Lam, called the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, dates to 1922 and has not been used in more than 50 years. It enables the chief executive to bypass the normal legislative process, where bills have to go through the city's parliament, the Legislative Council. Protesters have often worn face masks to hide their identity The ERO was last used in 1967 to help stop riots in the territory's trading hub. Ms Lam stressed the new regulation did not mean that Hong Kong was in a state of emergency. But she said the city was ""in a state of serious public danger"". The city's chief executive said what had been single rallies or marches, when the protests began, had spread to many areas across Hong Kong. She said petrol bombs were being used inside closed spaces like railway stations, and that violent protesters had targeted public buildings and private properties. She also accused protesters of not just criticising but ""lynching"" people with different views. It is unclear exactly what she was referring to. Ms Lam appealed that ""we all say no to violence"" According to the government, the percentage of demonstrators who are students has risen from 25% to 38%. Ms Lam said the mask ban would help prevent students breaking the law. She also pointed out that similar bans on facial coverings were in place in other places around the world. France to ban protest masks amid unrest Hong Kong's protests started in June, sparked by proposals to extradite suspected criminals to mainland China. The extradition bill has since been cancelled but protests have widened into pro-democracy and anti-police demonstrations. This video can not be played How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence Over the months, clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent. On Tuesday, police shot a protester in the chest with a live bullet for the first time. Authorities say the 18-year-old - who was attacking police and was arrested after being shot - is in a stable condition in hospital. Hong Kong is a former British colony handed back to China in 1997. It has a ""one country, two systems"" agreement that guarantees it some autonomy, and its people certain freedoms, including freedom of assembly and freedom of speech. But those freedoms - the Basic Law - expire in 2047 and it is not clear what Hong Kong's status will then be.

"At least 18 deaths and more than 1,000 cases of a mysterious lung illness have been linked with vaping by US health authorities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said cases were up a quarter from last week. Doctors have been unable to establish what is causing the illness, whose symptoms include chest pain, fatigue and shortness of breath. Dr Anne Schuchat from the CDC said the outbreak was expected to continue. ""I cannot stress enough the seriousness of these injuries. This is a critical issue. We need to take steps to prevent additional cases,"" Dr Schuchat said. Vaping-related injuries have been confirmed in 48 states, with deaths in 15 of those. The average age of those who died is nearly 50. The youngest victim was in their 20s and the oldest was in their 70s. What's behind a vaping illness outbreak in the US?

"Diane saw her annual home insurance premium shoot up Diane's reward for staying with the same home insurance provider for 10 years was a rise in her annual premium from Â£1,500 to Â£3,500. The 76-year-old, from Kent, said: ""Being a pensioner, I don't like changing."" She ended up looking in the phone book, calling around for a deal. She is an example of the six million people who pay on average Â£200 too much on premiums. The City regulator has found consumers are overpaying by Â£1.2bn a year. Competition in the home and insurance market is not working and loyal customers are being penalised, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) says. It is considering bans on automatic price rises and making firms move consumers to cheaper deals, but said ""the ball is now in the industry's court"". ""This market is not working well for all consumers,"" said Christopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA. ""While a large number of people shop around, many loyal customers are not getting a good deal. We believe this affects around six million consumers. ""We have set out a package of potential remedies to ensure these markets are truly competitive and address the problems we have uncovered. We expect the industry to work with us as we do so."" Mr Woolard said the review did not reveal the insurance industry was breaching the rules on a wholesale basis. But he said it was clear that changes needed to be made, and some in the industry would accept this. He said in many cases - as was the case for Diane - it was much easier for consumers to renew a policy, sometimes just by ticking a box, than it was to switch away to a cheaper deal. The FCA said that more than one in 10 people were paying very high prices for their insurance. One in three of them were vulnerable in some way, perhaps elderly or lower paid. The regulator found,externalthat some insurers targeted price increases at those less likely to switch. Possible FCA remedies include: Banning or restricting practices such as raising prices for consumers who renew every year, or requiring firms to automatically move consumers to cheaper equivalent deals Stop practices that could discourage switching - including restricting the way that firms use automatic renewal Make firms be clear and transparent in their dealings with consumers - including improvements to the way they communicate with their customers The FCA intends to publish its final report on possible remedies in early 2020 after further consultation with the industry and consumer groups. By Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter You have never had a problem with your insurer or bank so you have stayed with them for years. What the FCA's, and other reviews, have shown is that this is an expensive option - for home and motor cover, overdrafts and more. Loyalty does not pay. Those unable or uncomfortable with searching for a better deal online, or haggling, pay more. There is also a nod in this FCA report to the poverty premium - you get a worse deal if your finances are less ""resilient"" or you struggle with handling money. Many of the same people will be among the eight million who an independent report estimated would be left behind if the UK became a cashless society. Undoubtedly, they will feel like the financial victims of the advances in technology which have changed the way we live our lives. Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, the industry's trade body, said his members accepted that the home and car insurance markets could work better for consumers who do not shop around at renewal. But he added: ""This is not an issue unique to insurance. It is important that any unintended consequences are carefully considered to ensure that a fair and balanced approach is achieved for all customers."" The consequences could be more expensive premiums for those shopping around, but the FCA said that, while it was keen to maintain a level of competition, the variation in prices to cover the same level of risk was too great. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said ""it's great to see the FCA acknowledging that the insurance market isn't working"". But she cautioned that the FCA's report set out proposals only. ""The FCA must now follow through on these bold ideas to stop loyal insurance customers being penalised,"" she said. Citizens Advice said it should not be left to the consumer to find the best deals. Rather, the market should be set up to ensure everyone is treated fairly. However, its advice to people searching for the lowest prices is: Shop around Ensure you opt out of auto-renewals Make a note of insurance expiry dates Use comparison websites Car and house insurance faces price probe Consumer loyalty 'rip off' faces probe Insurers 'burying price rises' Insurers accept that renewal premiums unfair Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while official hits out at looters Maps and pictures chart how fires have spread Biden praises Carter's character as former president's casket heads to Georgia The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"The story is making the front pages of many newspapers in the region Irish newspapers are resoundingly unimpressed with Boris Johnson's proposed Brexit deal and many commentators in Europe are similarly dismissive of it. Several say the UK prime minister's description of the Irish border issue as a ""technical"" one shows a lack of sensitivity to its political meaning. Many believe his plans have less to do with formulating a realistic agreement and more to do with preparing for a general election. Some are frustrated at what they perceive to be the deliberate opacity of Mr Johnson's intentions. Broadly, the view is that the chances of a no-deal Brexit are increasing. Mr Johnson's proposals are ""unrealistic and unworkable"",external, says the Irish Times. ""A customs border would require checks, infrastructure and a much higher level of policing and monitoring than currently takes place... interventions of this kind would be toxic politically,"" the paper says. ""The prime minister and those around him have anticipated that this offer will be rejected and their primary objective in framing it in such a manner is their own domestic political advantage,"" it adds. The Irish Independent, meanwhile, saysMr Johnson's plan for Brexit ""asks too much and delivers far too little"",external. ""Surrendering something tried, trusted and secure, for something that could result in a permanent Border does not seem a reasonable demand. ""There will have to be more talking. But the art of conversation is the art of hearing as well as of being heard,"" it concludes. See also:What is Boris Johnson's plan to avoid a hard Irish border? The view from elsewhere in Europe is not dissimilar. ""Have you read it yourself?"" asks Brussels, in this cartoon from Latvia's Dienas Bizness ""Boris Johnson's new Brexit proposal is... equally bad for all,external,"" says a commentator in Germany's SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung. Another writer in Handelsblatt says the proposals showthe prime minister ""does not really want a deal"",external. ""By making impossible demands on the EU, he shatters any chance of reaching an agreement. The fact that Johnson now forces the EU to customs controls should be perceived as a provocation,"" the article says. Italy's La Repubblica also calls his proposal ""a provocation"", sayingit could be ""an attempt to exasperate the EU,externaland to have doors slammed in his face, just as he would prefer"". His deal ""gives a small region [Northern Ireland] a veto power,external. It is almost impossible to expect the EU - and Ireland in particular - to agree to this,"" says Lithuania's news website 15min. ""It is not an accident that Boris Johnson presented his alternative to the Irish backstop during today's [2 October] conference of the Conservative Party,"" says a commentary in Poland's Gazeta Wyborcza. ""He is gearing up not for a compromise but for elections,external."" The article believes Mr Johnson will try to avoid delaying Brexit. ""This would mean a war with Brussels, the British parliament and neighbours in order to finally become a political martyr in the struggle for Brexit."" There is some sympathy for Mr Johnson's plans in Hungary's right-wing 888 website, though, which reports it with the headline ""The Brits finally grew a gourd,externaland gave an ultimatum to Brussels"". ""Boris Johnson, the lover of contradictions"" - French daily Liberation One writer in France's Liberation newspaper notes that Mr Johnson describes the Irish border as a ""technical"" issue although ""the stakes are much deeper and more complicated"". ""It is a question of politics, of peace, of identity,,externalof preserving the integrity of the single market and... of the very survival of the EU,"" the writer says. European leaders ""are all carefully speaking about steps in the right direction...Europe wants to avoid at any cost Johnson being able to blame [it] for a hard Brexit,external"", notes Belgium's De Standaard. ""Nobody in Brussels believes that enough time remains to negotiate a serious alternative to the backstop,external. Almost everybody agrees that even if a compromise acceptable for the EU were reached, Johnson would be unable to push it through parliament,"" says Italy's Il Foglio. ""It is also not possible to know what Johnson is thinking,external, who is ideologically neutral and for whom Brexit is nothing more than a path of the least resistance discovered on the way to power,"" says Spain's La Vanguardia. ""Premier Johnson is going to war with the EU and the British parliament"" says this Polish daily ""Hard Brexit now looks unavoidable,external,"" says the Polish Rzeczpospolita. And nations do not have confidence that Mr Johnson will seek an extension if no deal can be agreed before his Brexit deadline of 31 October. ""Boris Johnson seems prepared to defy the law,externalto try to force a 'no-deal' Brexit,"" says Sweden's Dagens Nyheter. ""Whether the text is passed or not,"" says France's Le Parisien, ""he would finally be able to escape the impasse he is trapped in,external: betray his promise to leave the EU... or trample on the law obliging him to ask for a delay"".

"Boris Johnson hasoutlined his plan to the European Union (EU),externalto avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. Mr Johnson said the plan ""removes the so-called backstop"". The backstop is the insurance policy negotiated by Theresa May and the EU. It is designed to avoid any physical border infrastructure, which it is feared would bring back memories of the Troubles, after Brexit. It would keep the UK in the same customs territory as the EU, and Northern Ireland closely tied to EU regulations - until the UK and the EU reach a trade deal. But it would stop the UK striking its own trade deals, which is why so many Conservative MPs, including Mr Johnson, oppose the backstop. So, what is his alternative? The government wants the UK to leave the EU customs union. This would mean Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ending up in two different customs territories. This means lorries entering the Republic of Ireland from Northern Ireland will need to complete customs declarations. This is to ensure the correct tariffs (tax on imports) are paid when UK goods enter the EU customs union. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Reality Check's Chris Morris:From the beginning the EU has struggled to see how Ireland and Northern Ireland can exist in different customs territories while keeping the border as open as it is now under all circumstances. They will argue that - in the absence of a future free trade deal - this proposal means the UK is breaking commitments it has made about the border. The UK counters that the backstop has already been rejected in Parliament three times, and something needs to change. Instead of installing customs posts and other physical infrastructure at the Irish border, the UK says declarations should be done electronically. The government says physical checks would still be needed ""on a very small proportion of movements"". Currently, about one in 100 consignments entering the EU customs union are inspected to check that the goods match the information on the declaration. These inspections could be carried out at warehouses or ""designated locations, which could be located anywhere in Ireland or Northern Ireland."" The government's proposal does not spell out what these ""designated locations"" would look like, but it adds there should be ""a firm commitment (by both parties) never to conduct checks at the border in future"". Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? If adopted, a border solution relying on technology and remote checks would be a first. The EU does not currently share a single border with a non-EU country where checks have been completely eliminated. That includes Norway (not in the EU) and Sweden (an EU member) - which share one of the most technologically advanced borders in the world. Their main crossing point processes about 1,300 lorries a day, with each waiting 20 minutes on average. The EU has previously rejected a customs solution that relies on technology. Back in January, Sabine Weyand, the EU's director-general for trade, said: ""We looked at every border on this Earth, every border the EU has with a third country - there's simply no way you can do away with checks and controls."" The government says that some small traders should be exempt from paying duty. However, the document does not address smuggling head on. In other words, what will be done to detect and prevent traders, who should be paying duty, from crossing the border without completing custom declarations first? Reality Check's Chris Morris:The EU will see much of this as a rehash of previous ideas that it doesn't think will work. And many people will worry that unspecified ""designated locations"" could become targets for anyone seeking to undermine the Northern Ireland peace process. The EU will push back hard against suggestions that it needs to revise its own customs rules to suit the UK. When it comes to the regulation of goods, Northern Ireland would keep to the rules of the EU's single market, rather than UK rules. That removes the need for product standard and safety checks on goods at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, because both will be part of an ""all-island regulatory zone"". But it creates the need for checks between the rest of the UK - which will not be sticking to EU single market rules - and Northern Ireland.. All agricultural, food or animal products entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK will have to go through a Border Inspection Post. That's a bit of infrastructure where goods can be physically examined and paperwork checked. Manufactured goods in Northern Ireland would also have to keep to EU rules, and these goods would be checked ""at the boundary of the zone"" - presumably at crossings between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, on the Irish Sea. Reality Check's Chris Morris:This is quite a big concession from the UK side - basically accepting that there would have to be quite intrusive checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK for a number of years, on things like product standards and food safety. The EU has always said there have to be checks carried out somewhere, and both sides will try to deny any suggestion that this amounts to a new border in the Irish Sea. Having Northern Ireland following EU rules for the production of goods over which it has no say is, as the document says, ""a significant democratic problem"". As a result, it is proposed that the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive will have to sign off on the plan before it takes effect. The Northern Irish institutions will be asked to approve the plan again every four years, and if they do not then Northern Ireland would stop following EU rules one year later. The Northern Ireland Assembly has not met since early 2017. Reality Check's Chris Morris:The issue of democratic legitimacy is a crucial one, but it cannot be applied unevenly. The EU is likely to have a problem with anything which suggests that only Northern Ireland could have - in effect - a veto on this plan. The point of the backstop was to provide a legal guarantee to keep an open border under all circumstances. Being subject to approval every four years simply isn't the same thing. If Northern Ireland voted to leave this arrangement things like checks on food safety would have to take place at the Irish border. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"How does the prime minister's Irish border plan differ from the backstop? BBC News NI's economic and business editor John Campbell has a look. It was the plan for keeping the Irish border as open as it is today, if that can't be achieved through a trade deal or technological solutions. It was agreed by the former Prime Minister Theresa May in November 2018. It would mean the whole of the UK staying in a customs union with the EU. Northern Ireland alone would stay in EU's single market for goods. This arrangement would remain until both sides agreed there was something better to replace it. Prime Minister Boris Johnson opposes the backstop saying it is antidemocratic and could trap the UK in the EU's customs territory This video can not be played PM: Boris Johnson: ""It (no deal) is not an outcome we want... but is an outcome for which we are ready"" It says the whole of the UK should leave the EU's customs union. This inevitably means a new customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland with new requirements for cross-border traders. However the prime minister believes the impact of this can be minimised with any checks taking place away from the border. His plan involves trusted trader schemes and simplified customs procedures with the smallest traders being exempt from all customs procedures. He suggests that physical checks would only be required on a small proportion of trade and that most checks could take place at traders' premises. However the plan suggests that checks may also have to happen at ""other designated locations which could be located anywhere in Ireland or Northern Ireland."" Are those 'designated locations' customs posts by another name? The plan would also probably require the EU to make changes or derogations to its customs rules. Mr Johnson has written to the European Commission president about his proposals Mr Johnson's plan has big similarities to the backstop. Northern Ireland would continue to follow EU rules on agriculture, food safety and industrial goods -the rest of the UK would not. That would effectively mean a new border in the Irish Sea with checks on goods coming in here from other parts of the UK. These sorts of checks already happen on livestock. All animals coming here from the rest of UK enter through an inspection post at Larne Harbour. The new plan would mean an increase in the scope and scale of these checks. The DUP has welcomed the new border plan One big difference in the new plan is that the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly would have to approve that single market arrangement coming into force. Then every four years, Stormont would have to decide if it wants to continue to follow EU rules or align with the rest of the UK. The DUP, which has welcomed the plan, believes that would mean Northern Ireland would always default to UK regulations unless there is a cross-community vote at Stormont to continue to follow EU regulations. Nationalist parties fear this would amount to a unionist veto on whether to continue to follow EU rules. That is because of the existence of a veto mechanism at Stormont known as the Petition of Concern. The Irish government agreed on an interim Brexit deal with the UK in 2017 It seems unlikely at this stage. From the Irish government's point of view, they made an agreement with the UK in the 2017 Joint Report - a kind of interim deal - which said there would not be ""any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls"" as a result of Brexit. That was not just an agreement to prevent any new infrastructure at the Irish border, it was any new checks on the island of Ireland. So the Irish government's position has been that the UK agreed that the status quo would be maintained for cross-border trade. What Boris Johnson is proposing on customs would not meet those criteria.

"Destiny has been stuck in temporary accommodation after her student block was not completed on time Destiny is feeling cheated and angry. She is one of about 250 students at the University of Portsmouth left in the lurch when their accommodation was not finished in time for the new term. Instead of a glossy new room, she has been stuck temporarily in a hotel, away from other students - and with no cooking facilities she's had to live on take-away food for nearly three weeks. ""I've been feeling really anxious. I can't concentrate on my studies,"" says the politics student. There are 22 private student blocks across the UK that have been delayed this term - almost a third of those being built, according to student housing charity Unipol. Eva Crossan Jory, of the National Union of Students, says she is ""extremely concerned at the significant rise"" in students being disrupted. But the University of Portsmouth is also angry - because even though there might be an assumption that it has some link to the unfinished student flats, these are private developments over which the university has no control. Stanhope House for students in Portsmouth is still not ready for students to move in The university's vice-chancellor, Graham Galbraith, says there is a serious lack of scrutiny about how the private student accommodation system operates. ""At the end of the day, those housing providers know that the universities will step in. So where does the responsibility for this lie? Because they seem to be able to walk away,"" he says. Anyone going through university towns and cities will have seen new blocks of student flats mushrooming skywards. Bilgesu says she is having to stay in a hotel room away from students and without access to wi-fi These are often private investments, but the cash fuelling this building boom is public money - in the form of the maintenance loans to cover students' living costs. Prof Galbraith says it seems extraordinary that billions of pounds of taxpayers' money should go into these private rental projects with so little accountability. ""There is no real control,"" he says, and he warns that new blocks can open without even a ""conversation"" with the university. He also wants better consumer protection for students signing housing contracts, arguing that some ""arrangements are incredibly one-sided"". This autumn there have been reports of unfinished flats in locations from Portsmouth to Swansea, Lincoln to Liverpool. In Bristol, delays have meant students being put up temporarily in Wales. But it's not clear who might intervene. Students were expecting to move into this building in Portsmouth for the new term Universities UK says its code of conduct applies only to university-owned housing - which means any private student developments will not be covered. The higher-education regulator, the Office for Students, says it ""doesn't have powers to regulate private accommodation providers"". Portsmouth South MP Stephen Morgan asked a parliamentary question about ""safeguards for students affected by properties not being built in time"". But universities minister Chris Skidmore said universities were autonomous and that ""government plays no direct role in the provision of student residential accommodation"". In Portsmouth, Bilgesu is another student unable to move into the new Stanhope House student building. She is in a hotel with no free wi-fi, where she feels unable to get on with her degree course and isolated from student life. ""It's just so far away from the student environment,"" says the biomedical science student. Alex, an overseas student, found out that he had no accommodation when he was on his way to the UK Alex, an international student from the Netherlands, found out about the accommodation not being ready just as he was travelling to the UK. He was coming to a new country and a new city for the first time - and had nowhere to go, so booked himself into a hotel at his own expense. ""I didn't know anything about this city, I couldn't make any friends. It was hard for the first week,"" says Alex, who was then found a room by the university. He says he was even more taken aback when ""on the day they told people they can't move in, they were asking for money from them"". ""I feel like students are really easy to exploit. I just came here expecting the building to be ready, I'm trusting what I saw on the website."" Destiny says the disruption has meant she can't get the term started. ""I can't organise my books. It's affecting my studies,"" she says. The students are unimpressed by a compensation offer of Â£150 - less than they are still being charged for a week's rent. Student union president Helena Schofield says starting university is stressful enough without problems over housing The students' union and university officials have been trying to help students who have found themselves unable to move in. Union president Helena Schofield says the link between housing and students' mental health is underestimated. Starting at university can be an emotional time - and such uncertainty about accommodation, and being away from other students, can only add to the stress. The private housing company behind Stanhope House, Prime Student Living, says it has ""unreservedly apologised to students"". The University of Portsmouth has been trying to help students caught out by the non-completion of accommodation But it blames its building contractor for a lack of advance warning of the failure to open on time and says finding alternative accommodation was made an ""immediate priority"". The spokesman said the company was ""disappointed to hear that the university does not consider that we have communicated effectively to them"". ""We believe that we have done everything possible to mitigate the impact for those affected in the time available,"" said the Prime Student Living spokesman. ""We will continue to do all we can to get students into the building as an urgent priority.""

"John Lewis is seeking discounts from its landlords to cut costs, in a highly unusual move that highlights the huge pressures on retailers. The BBC has learned that the retail giant has been telling landlords in some locations that it will withhold 20% of this quarter's service charge. These are the fees retailers pay on top of rent for services such as heating and security. John Lewis said the charges had become too high and urged landlords to help. But the move could lead to legal action by property owners to recover any unpaid money. John Lewis Partnership announced a major restructuring of its management teams earlier this week in a bid to cut Â£100m a year from its costs. From next year its supermarkets and department store divisions will be run as one business. Four reasons John Lewis is under pressure John Lewis bonus cut as profits plunge But it's also clearly trying to make savings across its portfolio of stores as well. ""This was done without any consultation,"" one landlord told the BBC. ""Every landlord will be looking at their lease, talking to lawyers who will get revved up to recover this money as a debt,"" he added. A service charge is a sum due under the terms of a lease between a landlord and tenant, towards the costs incurred in providing a range of services for the operation of a building's common parts. That could include cleaning, security, maintenance, marketing, heating/cooling and staffing. Tenants are then charged on an apportioned basis relating to the size of the space occupied with larger stores getting a significant weighted discount. John Lewis has around 20 stores in covered shopping centres. It's understood that it wants mainly these landlords to shoulder some of the service charge during the so called ""golden quarter"" - the fourth quarter that includes Christmas. In September,the group posted its first ever loss for the first half of this year. In a statement John Lewis said: ""At a time when we are doing everything we can to reduce our cost base, we have unfortunately been faced with regular increases to the service charges we pay for some of our shops in shopping centres. ""Over the last three years we have seen an increase in service charges of 20% and these continued increases are simply not acceptable, particularly in the absence of strenuous efforts by landlords to work collaboratively with us to reduce these costs. ""We are investing more in our current shop estate than ever before to do everything we can to encourage customers to grow footfall to our shops and we hope that our landlords will support us in continuing to do this,"" it added. But John Lewis is under contract to meet its service charge obligations and withholding a big chunk of it could put it in direct conflict with some of its property owners. ""John Lewis is in a much better place than most of its rivals but its revenues are under enormous pressure right now,"" said another landlord. ""What they're up to, I think, is trying to open up a broader conversation about property costs more generally. The market is distorted right now. The stronger retailers are pretty concerned about this uneven playing field,"" he added. Debenhams has managed to slash its rent bill with reductions of up to 50% after securing a restructuring deal with its creditors. Struggling retailers have been turning to these so-called company voluntary arrangements as a way to cut costs. House of Fraser was bought out of administration by Mike Ashley's Sports Direct and many of these stores are currently paying little if any rent. John Lewis is one of Britain's stronger retail chains and has a reputation for plain dealing. This particular cost-cutting measure, if it succeeds, will be controversial for the already beleaguered retail property industry. The group's biggest landlords include Hammerson and Intu. ""I am astounded to hear this from a company which sets the gold standard in retail,"" one seasoned property expert told the BBC. ""There's nothing new in retailers trying to challenge the specifics of a service charge. But to seek to withhold money like this is in breach of a contract. This is going to go down like a lead balloon."" Landlords are already grappling with falling rents and property values. Now they may have something else to worry about if other retailers follow suit.
