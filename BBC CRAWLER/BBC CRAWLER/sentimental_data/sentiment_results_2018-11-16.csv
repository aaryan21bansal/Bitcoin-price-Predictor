"The future of newspapers previously owned by Johnston Press has been secured after they were acquired by JPIMedia, a spokesman said. The newly-formed company bought out Johnston Press, publisher of the i, The Scotsman and the Yorkshire Post, following the court appointment of administrators earlier on Saturday. Johnston Press said it meant employees would keep their jobs. The newspaper group put itself up for sale last month. Johnston Press was one of the largest local and regional newspaper organisations in the UK, but had debts of Â£220m which were due for repayment in June next year. Its chief executive, David King, previously said the debt had ""constrained us"" and that none of the offers they had received for the firm was enough to repay it. Mr King, who is now the new chief executive of JPIMedia, said the sale was ""an important one for the Johnston Press businesses as it ensures that operations can continue as normal, with employees' rights maintained, suppliers paid, and newspapers printed"". He said it would focus on ensuring the group's titles continued to publish ""the high-quality journalism we are known for and which has never been more important"". Daily Mail 'looking to buy i newspaper' Publisher of the i newspaper up for sale And John Ensall, director of JPIMedia, said: ""In the absence of another financial solution being available for the business, we are pleased to have reached this agreement to acquire Johnston Press, to protect the value of the business, preserve jobs and allow for the uninterrupted publication of its websites and newspapers."" He said that as part of the transaction, it had reduced debt levels significantly and would invest Â£35m into the business. Meanwhile, the National Union of Journalists has said it has ""significant concerns"" about the long-term intentions of the newspapers' new owners. The union is demanding ""a commitment that this is not a transition leading to a carve-up of the group motivated by asset-stripping rather than a commitment to journalism and publishing"". The NUJ is expected to meet Johnston Press management on Monday. Johnston Press had titles covering more than 200 locations from Scotland and Northern Ireland to the south of England. It was founded in Falkirk in 1767, and listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1988, growing through acquisitions. The i, which was first launched in 2012 and sells for 60p on weekdays and Â£1 on Saturdays, was seen as the jewel in the crown of its papers. In its latest results, Johnston Press reported a 10% fall in revenues during the first half of 2018. It swung back to a profit of Â£6.2m for the six-month period, but this was mainly due to a one-off accounting gain of Â£8.8m. In September, the i recorded a year-on-year circulation drop of 9% to 242,408 copies. By Douglas Fraser, Business/economy editor, Scotland Facing a debt repayment deadline next June, with no sign of a refinancing deal, and with the market valuation of the whole company below Â£3m, Johnston Press was cornered. The new owners are led by GoldenTree Asset Management. Fidelity is a better known investor as part of the consortium, along with Benefit Street and Carval. They have set up holding companies for ownership of the titles. Such companies do not have a track record of investing in titles for the good of the staff or the communities they serve. But the spin on day one is that that is precisely what the new owners are doing. Supporting the Johnston titles with a debt write-off and new investment is being aligned with the success of an underlying business that remains ""profitable and cash-generative"".

"Stephen Barclay has been picked as the new Brexit secretary, as Theresa May seeks to fill her cabinet after several of her top team quit. The MP for North East Cambridgeshire - who is a Leave supporter - had been a health minister since January. He replaces Dominic Raab, who resigned on Thursday over Mrs May's withdrawal agreement for Brexit. A No 10 spokesman indicated that Mr Barclay would focus on the domestic preparations rather than negotiations. How a day of resignations and appointments unfolded Danger has not passed for Theresa May Who is Stephen Barclay? How could May turmoil affect Brexit? A guide to where we arer Mr Barclay's promotion comes after a tumultuous few days for Mrs May, after two senior ministers and several other junior ministers and aides quit following the publication of the proposed Brexit agreement. And some Conservative Brexiteers who are unhappy with the deal have also been submitting letters of no-confidence in Mrs May. If 48 letters are sent, then a vote will be triggered and Mrs May could face a challenge to her leadership. But shortly before Mr Barclay's appointment, two leading Brexiteers in the cabinet, Environment Secretary Michael Gove and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox publicly threw their support behind her.

But Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Stephen Barclay's appointment changes absolutely nothing. ""After two years of negotiation, the prime minister has failed to deliver a Brexit deal that can command the support of Parliament. ""A new face in the Brexit department will do nothing to bring this divided government back together."" Environment Secretary Michael Gove - who the BBC understood had at one point been contemplating his position before rallying behind Mrs May - is understood to have turned down the role of Brexit secretary following Mr Raab's departure. Stephen Barclay - or Steve Barclay as he calls himself on Twitter - is a former banker and has also held the posts of City minister and a whip at the Treasury. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mr Barclay was not a household name and it was a big promotion for him. But he also described the 46-year-old as ultra-loyal, having never rebelled against the government. Vicky Ford, a fellow Tory MP and a friend of Mr Barclay, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme he is known for listening ""very, very hard and getting things done"". Mr Barclay, who is said to be a close friend of Theresa May's chief of staff Gavin Barwell, is married and has two children. Read more Meanwhile, Amber Rudd has been named the new work and pensions secretary - replacing Esther McVey, the second senior minister who resigned over the PM's Brexit plans on Thursday. Ms Rudd said she was ""delighted"" to be given the role, and saw it as her job to ""try to iron out"" the issues with Universal Credit. In her first interview in her new job, Ms Rudd called on any colleagues planning to submit letters of no-confidence in Mrs May to ""think again"". Amber Rudd visited her new workplace on Friday evening ""This is not a time for changing our leader,"" she said. ""This is a time for pulling together, for making sure we remember who we are here to serve, who we are here to help: that's the whole of the country."" Stephen Hammond will take over from Mr Barclay at the department for health and social care. The government also announced replacements for two junior ministers who resigned over Mrs May's deal. John Penrose will join the Northern Ireland office, replacing Shailesh Vara, and Kwasi Kwarteng will go to the Department for Exiting the EU, replacing Suella Braverman. Mrs May agreed a draft withdrawal agreement for Brexit with her cabinet on Wednesday, which had already been signed off by negotiators from both the UK and EU. This video can not be played BBC correspondents explain 585 pages faster than you could print them... on a BBC photocopier But the deal led to a backlash from some Brexit-supporting MPs, including Mr Raab and Ms McVey. Around 20 Tory MPs have publicly called for a vote of no confidence in the prime minister, with more thought to have written to the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee to call for a vote on her leadership. But Mrs May responded to critics saying she will stay in No 10 and see the deal through.

"This video can not be played I'm not a plotter, says Andrea Leadsom There is ""still the potential to improve"" the draft Brexit deal, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom has said. While she backed Prime Minister Theresa May's efforts to get the ""best possible deal"", she warned the UK could not be ""trapped"" in an EU customs union. The BBC understands that Brexiteer Mrs Leadsom is part of a group of five ministers hoping to amend the deal. Despite widespread criticism of the draft withdrawal agreement, Mrs May has vowed to ""see it through"". The585-page document,externalsets out the terms of the UK's departure, including details such as how much money will be paid to the EU, details of the transition period and citizens' rights. It is due to be finalised at an EU summit next Sunday, 25 November. The publication of the draft text prompted the start of a tumultuous few days for Mrs May, with two senior ministers and several other junior ministers and aides resigning. Some Conservative Brexiteers who are unhappy with the agreement have also been submitting letters of no-confidence in Mrs May. If 48 letters are sent, then a vote will be triggered and she could face a challenge to her leadership. Mark Francois, one of the 21 Conservative MPs who have publicly said they have sent a letter, said Mrs May's plan would leave the UK ""half in and half out"" of the EU and everyone knew she would never get it through Parliament. As it happened: May bids to shore up support Guide: Rules for any challenge to Theresa May Danger has not passed for Theresa May Brexit: Where we are in eight charts But Conservative MP Sir Alan Duncan urged his other fellow MPs to ""stop and reflect"", saying a leadership challenge was not going to get the country a better deal than Mrs May's. ""All it's likely to do is create chaos, break the government, break the party and leave the country in great disarray."" If there were to be a confidence vote in Mrs May's leadership, party veteran Ken Clarke said she would ""easily"" win it but Nadine Dorries was doubtful, saying ""when pen comes to paper"" most MPs would vote against her in a secret ballot. By Susana MendonÃ§a, BBC political correspondent When they didn't jump ship over Theresa May's Brexit deal you might have thought that meant these key Brexiteers in her cabinet were ready to toe the line in a show of what's supposed to be known as ""collective responsibility"". But the fact that they're still manoeuvring to change the details of the prime minister's deal (while declaring their support for her), is yet another sign of the extraordinary political times we are in. This apparent gang of five inside the cabinet differ in their priorities. Andrea Leadsom - who's understood to be leading them - doesn't want Britain to be trapped in an endless backstop, and wants technological solutions to get around it. Environment Secretary Michael Gove is worried about treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK. The group is at an ""embryonic"" stage but will they get their tweaks? Andrea Leadsom thinks there's ""still more to be done"" and that they ""do still have more time"" before the EU Council at the end of the month. But that leaves only just over a week - and the EU doesn't look to be in the market for renegotiation at the moment. On Friday evening, it emerged that Mrs Leadsom hopes to work with the four other cabinet ministers to change the draft withdrawal deal into something ""winnable and supportable"". The four ministers believed to working with Mrs Leadsom are Michael Gove and Liam Fox - who on Friday publicly threw their support behind the PM - plus Penny Mordaunt and Chris Grayling. Speaking to the BBC in her constituency, Mrs Leadsom said: ""What I'm doing is working very hard to support the prime minister in getting the Brexit deal that 17.4 million people voted for. ""I think there's still the potential to improve on the clarification and on some of the measures within it and that's what I'm hoping to be able to help with."" Among her concerns was that ""the UK cannot be trapped in a permanent customs arrangement"" with the EU, she said. She added: ""I wouldn't describe myself as a plotter. I'm really just trying to make sure that we get the best possible Brexit deal."" Reality Check: Making sense of the Brexit deal How a day of resignations and appointments unfolded The five Brexit questions everyone's asking Google The cabinet ""gang of five"" specifically want to change the part regarding the Irish backstop - which has been one of the main sticking points in talks with Brussels. Both the UK and the EU want to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border so they agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - or back-up plan - in case they cannot reach a long-term trade agreement which does this. The backstop would mean that Northern Ireland would stay more closely aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards than the rest of the UK, which critics say is unacceptable. The UK would not be able to leave the backstop without the EU's consent. This video can not be played BBC correspondents explain 585 pages faster than you could print them... on a BBC photocopier According to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the group of ministers want a change in the draft text to include the possibility of new technology or a free trade deal as alternative solutions to the Irish border issue. The group's plans were described as a ""work in progress"", and a ""last-ditch attempt to find something to put to the Commons"". The deal is expected to be approved at a special EU summit on 25 November, before being voted on by MPs in Parliament. Ahead of the vote, the EU is saying it intends to stick to the existing text, according to BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. If it is voted down, the EU would be open to ""tweaks"" but a source close to French President Emmanuel Macron has said ""nothing fundamental"" could change. Our correspondent adds that if it came to a general election or another referendum, the EU would likely be open to putting the leaving process on ice to avoid a no-deal Brexit and in the hope the UK might change its mind and stay in the EU. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the EU should not enter ""some kind of bargaining process"" over parts of the text, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted the EU and the UK had agreed the text so negotiations should not continue. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has suggested that Labour could renegotiate the deal before the UK is due to leave the EU in March next year. ""I think we can do it with good will, we can change the atmosphere of negotiations into one of mutual interest and mutual benefit,"" he told Sky News. Meanwhile, the prime ministertold the Daily Mail,externalthe withdrawal agreement was ""not everybody's ideal deal"" but said her job was to make ""tough decisions"" and ""find a way through"". She also warned her opponents their alternative Brexit plans would not resolve the Irish backstop issue. Commenting on the backlash to the deal, Mrs May acknowledged it had been ""a pretty heavy couple of days"". The PM says her husband is protective over her She revealed her husband Philip, who she described as her ""rock"", had helped her through it - at one point pouring her a whisky and making beans on toast. On Friday night, Mrs May called dozens of constituency chairmen to appeal to them to back her deal and her leadership - and this weekend she is expected to embark on a ""social media blitz"" to try to sell her plans to people not usually engaged in politics. Mrs May's comments come after Stephen Barclay was picked as the new Brexit secretary - replacing Dominic Raab who quit on Thursday. How could May turmoil affect Brexit? A guide to where we are with Brexit A No 10 spokesman indicated that Mr Barclay, who becomes the third Brexit secretary since the role was created, would focus on domestic preparations for Brexit, rather than the negotiations. Amber Rudd returns to the frontbench - she quit as home secretary in April over the Windrush controversy In other developments: Amber Rudd was named as the new work and pensions secretary - replacing Esther McVey who also quit over the deal Stephen Hammond takes over from Mr Barclay as a health minister in the mini-reshuffle And John Penrose will join the Northern Ireland office, replacing Shailesh Vara; while Kwasi Kwarteng will go to the Department for Exiting the EU, replacing Suella Braverman David Davis, Brexit secretary before Mr Raab, pressed Mrs May for a looser deal with the EU, saying the US would be ready to start negotiating a free trade deal straight after Brexit if she ditches her plan On Sunday, the pro-Brexit European Research Group plans to publish a seven-page summary of the 585-page draft agreement The Chief Constable of Northern Ireland warned that ""anything that re-emphasises"" the Irish border presented challenges for policing and thethreat of violence was not being exaggerated Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar told his party thathis government wants to build bridges rather than new borders.

"Jim Acosta was in court to hear the judge's temporary ruling Donald Trump has threatened to walk out of future press briefings if reporters do not act with ""decorum"". The US president was speaking after a Washington DC court ordered the White House to return CNN reporter Jim Acosta's press pass after it was revoked by the US Secret Service. Mr Acosta's press pass was taken after he clashed with the president during a news conference earlier this month. Mr Trump played down the ruling, saying it wasn't ""a big deal"". But, he said, ""people have to behave"", adding his staff were ""writing up rules and regulations"" for the press to abide by, including sticking to the agreed number of questions. ""If they don't listen to the rules and regulations we'll end up back in court and will win,"" Mr Trump said. ""But more importantly, we'll just leave, and then you won't be very happy."" ""You can't take three questions and four questions and just stand up and not sit down,"" he added. ""Decorum. You have to practice decorum."" Speaking outside the court earlier in the day, Mr Acosta praised the decision and told reporters ""let's go back to work"". The judge said the White House decision likely violated the journalist's right to due process and freedom of speech. This video can not be played Donald Trump and CNN's Acosta clash The ruling forces the White House press office to temporarily return Mr Acosta's ""hard pass"", the credential that allows reporters easy access to the White House and other presidential events. Mr Acosta's lawyer called the ruling ""a great day for the first amendment and journalism"". White House attacks CNN's Acosta lawsuit The Acosta affair: An unpopular opinion Mr Acosta was barred from entering the White House a day after he had a heated exchange with President Trump during a news conference on 8 November. A White House intern tried to take the microphone from Mr Acosta as he attempted to ask the president a second question. In a statement Mrs Sanders claimed that he had put ""his hands on a young woman"" during the exchange, during which Mr Trump called the reporter ""a rude, terrible person"". CNN sued to have Mr Acosta's pass restored, and their lawsuit was joined by other media groups, including conservative-leaning Fox News. Jim Acosta lost his White House access after a fiery exchange with President Trump Anthony Zurcher, BBCNews,Washington With Jim Acosta sitting in the front row of the courtroom, the media won the opening round of what could be an extended legal battle. Judge Kelly said he was not ruling on the merits of this case, but that the White House did not provide sufficient justification for revoking Acosta's credentials. That shouldn't come as much of a shock, given that the administration's explanation for the move has shifted multiple times, from a tenuous allegation that the CNN reporter ""placed his hands"" on a White House intern to a more general assertion that he violated press conference decorum. What's left to be decided after further hearings and court filings - assuming the case proceeds - is how much power a president has in determining which reporters get to have, and keep, access to the White House. An administration has discretion to limit the number of passes it gives out, but the balancing of executive power and press rights gets trickier when government officials try to take media credentials away. Judge Timothy Kelly, who was appointed to the bench by Mr Trump last year, said Mr Acosta's constitutional rights outweighed the White House's right to have an orderly news conference, the Washington Post reported. He also criticised the Trump administration's decision, saying that the process was ""so shrouded in mystery that the government could not tell me... who made the decision"". He also called Mrs Sanders' statement claiming that Mr Acosta had inappropriately touched an intern ""belated efforts [that] were hardly sufficient to satisfy due process"". But in court documents, the White House argued that the decision was made in order to preserve White House decorum and it did not claim impropriety towards the intern. Judge Kelly added that the White House was required to restore his White House access, but is under no obligation to call on him during questions. A hearing on the case is scheduled for next week, but it is unclear if the White House will once again seek to strip Mr Acosta's access, or allow him to resume his work as CNN's chief White House correspondent. In a statement, CNN said: ""We are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days. ""Our sincere thanks to all who have supported not just CNN, but a free, strong and independent American press."" Mrs Sanders said the judge ""made clear that there is no absolute first amendment right to access the White House"" and that her office planned to ""temporarily reinstate the reporter's hard pass"". Ben Wizner of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said that the White House's attempts to silence Mr Acosta had backfired. ""The White House surely hoped that expelling a reporter would deter forceful questioning, but the court's ruling will have the opposite effect. ""The freedom of the press is a bedrock principle, and our democracy is strengthened when journalists challenge our leaders rather than defer to them.""

Ms Ocasio-Cortez, elected to congress in November, has spoken of her financial struggles. Last week the 29-year-old saidshe will find it difficult to pay her rent until she picks up her first pay cheque in January. But conservative critics have attempted to portray the concerns of the self-described ""democratic socialist"" as disingenuous. ""Hill staffer sent me this pic of Ocasio-Cortez they took just now,"" Washington Examiner reporter Eddie Scarry wrote on Twitter, posting a picture of the incoming congresswoman from behind.

"Lauren Coyle and Reece Hitchcott were found guilty of child cruelty A woman and her ex-partner who strapped a toddler face down in a ""monstrous cage bed"" have each been sentenced to 10 years. Ellie-May Minshull-Coyle was 19 months old when she died after being restrained in Preston in March 2017. Her mother Lauren Coyle, 19, and stepfather Reece Hitchcott, 20, were both convicted of causing or allowing her death. At Liverpool Crown Court, the pair were sentenced to 10 years in youth custody. Ellie-May Minshull-Coyle experienced ""immense suffering"", the court heard Mr Justice Dove described the bed as ""quite literally a death trap"" The bed was turned into a ""cage"" by lashing the slatted sides of a cot to the bed frame before being covered in sheets and towels. Coyle said the bed had been converted by Hitchcott to help Ellie-May get into the routine of sleeping through the night. Sentencing the pair, Mr Justice Dove said: ""The bed you both created and used, night after night, was quite literally a death trap."" Coyle and Hitchcott were also previously found guilty of two counts of child cruelty, but cleared of manslaughter. The bed was described in court as a ""prison"" for Ellie-May The judge said the pair had ""extinguished"" all the ""positive energy and joy"" Ellie-May brought into the world. He said: ""On the night of 22 March and 23 March 2017, undoubtedly in escalating distress and agony, Ellie-May Minshull-Coyle succumbed to asphyxiation while she was forcibly restrained in the cage which her toddler bed had been transformed into."" In a statement read to the court, Ellie-May's father John Minshull said: ""Every day me and my mum think about Ellie and really miss her, we just wish we could give her a big hug and it breaks our hearts deeply."" 'Cage bed' couple guilty of child cruelty Stepdad denies tying toddler to 'cage bed' Mum's 'regret' over toddler 'cage' bed On the night of her death, Ellie-May became unsettled and Coyle sent a strongly-worded Snapchat message to a friend suggesting she was irritated. She then messaged her father at about 06:00 GMT to complain about the toddler crying, When her father, Sean Coyle arrived at the flat to check on his granddaughter about three hours later, he realised there was a ""terrible problem"". Ellie-May was not breathing and, despite attempts to resuscitate her, she died at Royal Preston Hospital. A post-mortem examination found her death was caused by ""forcible restraint by ligatures in a face-down position complicated by hyperthermia"". The judge said the couple had difficulties getting Ellie-May to sleep but had received good advice from grandparents and health visitors. Despite the advice, Hitchcott still converted the purple Frozen bed into a ""cage"", placing sheets and bedding over the sides to prevent the toddler seeing outside. The jury heard Ellie-May was also bound to the bed face down and there were marks on her wrists and ankles, suggesting she had been tied to it. Mr Justice Dove said the pair would have been aware of the ""obvious risks"" but took them for their own ""selfish reasons"". The couple's lodger Connor Kirby, 20, was cleared of all of the charges.

"Stephen Prosser is claiming for damages and loss of earnings A man is suing British Airways after being ""squashed"" next to an obese passenger during a 13-hour flight. Stephen Huw Prosser, who is 5ft 3in, said he suffered a pelvic injury and nerve damage in his neck on the journey from Bangkok to London in January 2016. The 51-year-old from Tonypandy in Rhondda Cynon Taff told Pontypridd County Court the passenger ""was built like the late rugby player Jonah Lomu"". He is claiming for damages and loss of earnings, which BA is resisting. The total amount is believed to be in the region of Â£7,500. Mr Prosser, a civil engineer company director, was returning home from a holiday in Thailand on 10 January 2016. He was sitting by the window when a ""huge man"" took the seat next to him before takeoff. Should obese passengers pay more? Where are you on the UK fat scale? ""In my opinion he was obese as well as tall. I would estimate he was 6ft 4in in height and in excess of 22 stones,"" said Mr Prosser. ""He had to physically squeeze himself between the armrests. His buttocks were bulging onto my side and the rest of his bulk spilling over. ""The weight of this man's bulk was pushing my spine in a painful, unnatural and crooked position as I tried to remain in an upright position."" Mr Prosser complained to the cabin crew but was told there was no alternative seat available as the flight was full. Mr Prosser said the passenger reminded him of Jonah Lomu (pictured) He remained in his seat for the rest of the journey but was in ""continual pain"". Asked if he complained to the passenger, Mr Prosser replied: ""I didn't want to get into a confrontation with him."" In the weeks that followed, he claimed he remained in constant pain, his stance was ""twisted"" and suffered back spasms. As a result of this, he said, he was also forced to restrict his working hours for three months and was unable to continue his hobbies of mountain-biking and motorcycling. The BA customer service manager on board the flight, Chris McLindon, said he had ""very rarely, if ever"" dealt with such a complaint. He added: ""The passenger was tall and broad but he was certainly not obese. He didn't overfill the armrest or the confines of the seat. Chris McLindon, seen arriving at court, said he did not agree the passenger was obese ""I regularly walked down the aisle and Mr Prosser was not sat in an unnatural position for an economy seat. ""When Mr Prosser left the aircraft, I watched him walk down the jetty in a perfectly normal manner and he showed no signs of injury."" He added British Airways does not have a policy where passengers must give their size or weight when booking tickets, however some 'pro-active' passengers, who know they will struggle to fit in one seat, instead purchase two. Timothy Salisbury, representing BA, said: ""Mr Prosser's colourful description that he was 'built like Jonah Lomu' was an exaggeration. ""The passenger did not need a seatbelt extender, the arm-rests were down and there was no complaint from the passenger on the other side. ""It's not unexpected to be sat next to a large passenger on a long-haul flight."" However Jack Harding, representing Mr Prosser, said it was ""not usual or expected"" to be pushed and held in an awkward position by a neighbouring passenger's body ""spilling over"". He added: ""Mr Prosser explored every other option, including sitting in the (cabin crew's) galley seat. ""But instead he was left in the position of either going back to his seat and suffer in silence with pain-killers or walking around the cabin for 13 hours. It was a Hobson's Choice. ""He suffered an injury, it was because he was sat at an awkward angle and that was caused by what he complained about on board time and again.""

"The community library has been in Barrow Island Primary School for a year Not a single book has been taken out of a pop-up library in the last year. Eighteen books were technically ""checked out"" at the library on Barrow Island, Cumbria, but they were by IT staff making sure the machine worked. Barrow Local Committee was told the library had sporadic opening hours. There is now a plan to get library staff out and about in the community more, providing story sessions for children, author visits and reading groups. Cumbria County Council installed the library at Barrow Island Primary School. Tracey Ingham, the council's area support manager for Barrow, told the committee a different approach was needed. She said: ""The proposal is to move away from the static library in the school and do more outreach."" Councillors agreed library staff should visit other community centres on Barrow Island each week, theLocal Democracy Reporting Serviceis reporting. The area's libraries as a whole were used by 844 adults and 538 young people in two months.

"People across northern California are snapping up masks to try to handle the smoke Northern California's air quality has become the worst in the world, according to monitoring groups, as the state battles devastating fires. Air quality network Purple Air said on Thursday the air is now worse than smoggy cities in India and China. Schools have cancelled classes, flights have been delayed, and internet searches for smoke masks are soaring. At least 63 people have died in the Camp Fire - the state's deadliest and most destructive blaze. The number of missing people has jumped to more than 600, local authorities said, doubling the size of the list in a day. Three more people have also died in the Woolsey Fire, further south. The day Paradise burned down Is Trump right about California wildfires? Before and after snapshots President Donald Trump will travel to California on Saturday to survey the damage and meet those affected. The Camp Fire - which broke out eight days ago - swept through a swathe of the north at high speed, leaving residents little time to escape. The AirNow website,externalranks the air around San Francisco and Oakland as ""very unhealthy"", meaning everyone in the area could experience more serious health effects. Around Elk Grove and Sacramento, it is classed as ""hazardous"" - the whole population is likely to be affected, their website states. Allow Twitter content?

Health officials warned people to stay indoors rather than risk the smoke. ""Wearing a mask may encourage outdoor activity when staying indoors is the best way to minimize exposure to smoke,"" the Sacramento County Public Health Office said Butte County released advice for residents about how to handle the poor air quality,external. The California Fire Department says it has now contained about 45% of the Camp Fire blaze. Officials say they do not expect to fully contain the blaze - which has razed 145,000 acres (56,600 ha) - until the end of the month. This video can not be played California wildfires survivor's tearful account of escape with son They are also battling several other fires, including the Morgan Fire in Contra Costa County, near San Francisco, the Woolsey Fire in Ventura County near Los Angeles and the smaller Hill Fire, also in Ventura County. The worst-hit area is the town of Paradise, with officials saying it will need a ""total rebuild"" job that will take several years. Before and after snapshots Wildfire survivors: 'We swam to safety' Is it advisable to escape a wildfire by car? Red carpets cancelled after wildfires Brock Long, administrator of Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), said the damage to Paradise was ""one of the worst disasters"" he had ever seen. Military troops are assisting forensics teams and cadaver dogs as they continue to search for human remains. Officials have warned the search operation could take weeks. Officials have not yet confirmed what started any of the blazes, as investigations are continuing. Several people have already filed a lawsuit against a local power company, alleging that the Camp Fire started when a high-voltage transmission line failed. Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn - but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. Low humidity, warm winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. Prof David Peterson of the University of Washington, a former senior researcher with the US Forest Service, told the BBC there is no hard evidence that climate change has affected US wildfires - yet. ""We expect that there will be significant effects in future decades as the climate continues to warm,"" he said. A warming climate, Prof Peterson explained, would increase the duration of the fire season, and more droughts would in turn create more wildfire fuel. Watch: Long battle against California wildfires Watch: Why California wildfires are so deadly Globally, the length of the wildfire season has already increased by nearly 19% between 1978 and 2013. ""By around 2050, fires may burn two to three times more area than they have historically."" As fire seasons worsen worldwide, all the carbon released as smoke into the atmosphere could have a serious impact on climate change, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

"A major UK home care provider, offering support to 13,000 older and disabled people, is seeking to transfer or sell all its contracts to other providers. Allied Healthcare was warned this month by the care regulatorabout its financial sustainability. Since then, some local authorities have already taken steps to find new providers. The company says it is working closely with councils to ensure there is no disruption to people's care. Allied Healthcare provides services such as preparing meals, washing and giving medication. Last week, the Care Quality Commission, which regulates such services in England, issued a notice - warning that it had serious doubts about the future of the company. It was the first time the regulator had issued such a notice about the financial sustainability of a social care provider. The CQC said it was concerned about the viability of services run by Allied Healthcare from the end of November and was warning councils to make contingency plans. It said the company had failed to provide adequate assurances regarding future funding and there was now a credible risk of disruption to services. Can the government deliver on radical care reform? Numbers of elderly in 24-hour care set to double by 2035 But a company spokesperson said on Friday that the CQC statement had ""negatively impacted"" the firm, led to some customers transferring care services to alternative providers, and disrupted staff retention and recruitment. ""These developments have intensified the impact of the challenging environment within which we operate and come immediately prior to the Christmas period, when pressures on care providers are at their highest."" The company said it had to re-evaluate its long-term business plan and was exploring the sale or transition of services to alternative providers, including the transfer of staff. The BBC understands it has now been able to extend its credit by three weeks from the end of November. Who's to blame? By Alison Holt, social affairs correspondent The watchword coming from all involved - in what appears to be the demise of one of the UK's largest providers of homecare - is reassurance. Allied Healthcare, councils, the regulator and the government are focused on making sure vital care will continue as normal for the more than 13,000 people, who get visits from the company's staff. No one can afford to get that wrong. But once handovers have happened, serious questions will remain about the pressure on the care market. Earlier this year, Allied blamed low fees from local authorities for some of their financial woes. Councils themselves warn of a Â£3.5 billion shortfall in funding for adult social care by 2025. And campaigners describe the care system as failing. The government has promised a green paper on the long term funding of social care by the end of the year. Previous deadlines have been and gone, and with so much political turmoil, the fear is it will slip again. But for many, the financial problems faced by Allied will have underlined just how much strain the care system is under right now. Andrea Sutcliffe, chief inspector of adult social care at the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said Allied Healthcare had had ""every opportunity"" to put together a plan for its future sustainability and ""failed to do so"". She said there had been a clear requirement for the CQC to issue the notice so local authorities could be informed about the ""credible risk of service disruption to people's care"" and could make contingency plans. Colin Angel, from the UK Home Care Association, said: ""Reasonable arrangements to contract with prospective providers must be put in place swiftly. ""Fees for these services need to be set at rates which are financially sustainable for both the short and longer term. "" The Local Government Association said it was working closely with the CQC, the Department of Health and social services to ensure continuity of care for people currently supported by Allied Healthcare. Ian Hudspeth, of the LGA, said councils had ""robust contingency plans in place"". And he added: ""Councils are confident of ensuring care for people affected and are also focused on retaining the highly valued staff that deliver these services to help keep the transition in business ownership as smooth as possible.""

"Amber Rudd has returned to the cabinet as work and pensions secretary. Ms Rudd, who replaces Esther McVey following her Brexit resignation, quit herself as home secretary in April amid controversy over her handling of the Windrush controversy. She admitted having ""inadvertently misled"" MPs over immigration targets but a subsequent probe found she had been let down by officials. But her appointment was met with outrage from Labour. The party's shadow cabinet office minister Jon Trickett said: ""After enforcing Theresa May's hostile environment in the Home Office, Amber Rudd will now be in charge of the DWP's hostile environment for disabled people and the poorest in society. ""With universal credit in absolute shambles, appointing a disgraced former minister who was only recently forced to resign for her role in another scandal is a desperate choice by a weak prime minister."" Live: Reaction to Rudd appointment Steve Barclay named new Brexit Secretary Amber Rudd resigns as home secretary Amber Rudd 'let down by officials' Ms Rudd said she had seen universal credit ""transform lives"" in her Hastings and Rye constituency but she ""recognised there had been some issues with it"". She said she would make it her role to to ""iron out those difficulties and make it a force wholly for good"". Labour MP David Lammy said her appointment so soon after the Windrush row was ""wrong"".

The BBC's Iain Watson said it was a huge job given the controversy surrounding universal credit, the government's flagship welfare reform. He also said it showed Theresa May's confidence that she could appoint one of her ""allies"" to such a key role given the turmoil over her leadership in the past 24 hours. Ms Rudd's return to government comes less than seven months after she faced intense criticism over the UK's treatment of the Windrush generation. She apologised after it emerged that some migrants from Commonwealth countries, who were encouraged to settle in the UK from the late 1940s to 1973, were being wrongly declared illegal immigrants.

However, she continued to defend the hostile environment immigration policy championed by Mrs May and quit after admitting to having inadvertently misled two parliamentary committees on what she knew about targets for immigration removals. A recent report found Home Office officials gave her the wrong information and then later failed to clear up the problem. Ms Rudd becomes the sixth work and pensions secretary since March 2016. A Remain supporter during the 2016 referendum, Ms Rudd has given her backing to Mrs May's draft Brexit agreement, saying it is ""not perfect but perfect was never on offer"". Her return to the ministerial ranks has been welcomed by colleagues, including Sajid Javid and Liz Truss. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Westminster seems more peaceful tonight. Maybe I should just stop there. It is Friday night after all, and after the Big Dipper ride of the last few days, maybe for Number 10, and maybe for you, that's enough to be going on with for now. But Number 10 knows they'd be kidding themselves to imagine that the danger has gone. We simply won't know, probably until Monday, whether there are enough Tory MPs willing to put their names to letters calling for her to go to trigger a vote on confidence in her that might - in theory - force her from office. It is possible that by the start of next week Theresa May finds herself with a vote that could unseat her. If she doesn't, or even if she does but then wins such a vote, here's the problem. More than 20 MPs have put their names out there publicly calling on her to go and screaming protests at her Brexit deal. They might not get their confidence vote. Even if they do, they might not get enough support to oust her. But it seems impossible for those who have put their names out there to vote for the Brexit deal in a few weeks time. With the DUP bristling with rage about the deal and how it was arrived at, and very little sign of a cavalry of Labour MPs riding to the rescue, the number of public protests from those Tory MPs makes it seem like Theresa May's agreement is doomed. In that regard, how on earth does the government plan to get it through? Can they? There are two factors that Number 10 hopes will come through for them. First off, they hope that once the deal is done officially with the EU, next Sunday (25 November), then the dynamic will change. Something along the lines ofthe leaked plan to sell the dealthat we saw last week can get going, and when it does, expect it to rev up fast and loud. As we've discussed before plenty of times, the government machine will crank up fast and furiously to get MPs to back the deal - or else. And they also hope that more Labour MPs than currently expected will back them in the end. That's not just because they could choose a deal rather than open Pandora's box. But it's also because there's a belief in Number 10 that Labour's fellow politicians on the left around Europe will make it clear that frankly, this deal is the best the UK will get, and that a hypothetical Labour government couldn't and wouldn't do any better. Is that realistic, when the opposition party have the temptation of doing maximum damage to the government of the day? Let's see. For some of the government's critics, it's simply deluded to imagine they will be able to turn this debate around. The draft deal, only 48 hours after it was published, has been roundly attacked. There are many more MPs on the record now than are needed to defeat the agreement in Parliament. But it is impossible to be in the minds of the MPs contemplating turning in a letter calling for May to quit over the weekend. And harder still to be in the minds of those who will have an agonising choice if the deal makes it to the Commons in a few weeks time. It is calmer in Westminster tonight, but it is messy, and the danger hasn't gone away.

"Stephen Barclay has become Theresa May's surprise choice to become the third Brexit Secretary in the past six months. But who is he? The 46-year old takes over from Dominic Raab, who quit on Thursday saying he could not support the prime minister's draft agreement with the EU. Mr Barclay has, for the past year, been a minister of state in the health and social care department, the rank below cabinet level. He voted Leave at the 2016 Brexit referendum, tweeting in February 2016 that David Cameron's attempt to renegotiate the UK's membership ""did not deliver the game changer we need to protect against further EU integration"". Despite being regarded for some time as a rising star, the MP for North East Cambridgeshire's appointment to such a high profile role counts as a major promotion. However, it appears that he may not have been the PM's first choice, amid reports that at least two cabinet ministers, Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, turned down the role. Steve Barclay named new Brexit Secretary Live: Reaction to Barclay appointment And the job has essentially been downgraded to focus on domestic preparations for the UK's departure, with Theresa May personally assuming responsibility for the remaining negotiations with the EU. A former banking executive who worked for Barclays - no relation - Mr Barclay is described by Parliament-watchers as a ""smart, numerate, technocrat"". He is also a loyalist, having not rebelled against the party whip during his eight years in Parliament. After taking the safe Cambridgeshire seat in 2010, he served on the influential Public Accounts Committee, which oversees government spending and is seen as a proving ground for political talent, for four years before a spell in the whip's office. In the summer of 2017, he moved to the Treasury, serving as economic secretary, or city minister, under chancellor Philip Hammond before taking on his current role in January. Fellow Tory MP Vicky Ford told the BBC's PM programme Mr Barclay was known for listening ""very, very hard and getting things done"". She said Mr Barclay's diverse constituency, consisting of rural areas around Wisbech that had seen high levels of EU migration but also the more prosperous commuter belt serving Cambridge, gave him an insight into both the economic benefits and costs of EU membership. The son of a trade union official and civil servant, Mr Barclay was educated at King Edward VII School in Lytham St. Annes and Peterhouse, Cambridge before qualifying as a solicitor in 1998. During his time in the City, he worked as an insurance company lawyer for Axa Insurance, as a regulator for the Financial Services Authority, and as Director of Regulatory Affairs and then Head of Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions at Barclays retail bank. Mr Barclay, who is said to be a close friend of Theresa May's chief of staff Gavin Barwell, is married and has two children.

"UK Prime Minister Theresa May has dismissed speculation she could be ousted as leader despite a series of ministers resigning over her long-awaited Brexit deal. Mrs May hasvowed to get her draft withdrawal agreement signed off in Brussels and put before MPsin defiance of a possible vote of no-confidence in her. Such a vote could lead to her removal as prime minister and a change of course on Brexit. Here are seven charts that will help explain what's going on. The draft EU withdrawal agreement negotiated by Mrs May is set to be signed off by European leaders at an emergency summit on 25 November. But if Mrs May survives as PM she faces a battle to get MPs to back it in a House of Commons vote. Mrs May does not have a Commons majority and many MPs on her own side - as well as Labour and the other opposition parties - are sceptical about her Brexit deal, or even openly hostile to it. Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which Mrs May relies on in key votes, has already said it is likely to vote against the deal, claiming it will lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom. A number of Conservative MPs on both the Remain and Leave wings of the party have also said they will vote against it. The vote is expected to take place around 7 December. What does the Brexit deal mean for you? Your Brexit questions answered Guide to where we are Transport Minister Jo Johnson, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey - along with more junior ministers - have all resigned over the Brexit deal in the last week. They followed a flurry of other resignations in July - among them ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and former Brexit Secretary David Davis. Looking back, Mrs May's tenure actually got off to a relatively strong and stable start. She had no resignations in her first 475 days as prime minister, before Michael Fallon was forced to resign as defence secretary in November 2017. Former prime minister David Cameron, by contrast, had David Laws leave his post as chief secretary to the Treasury over expenses claims after just 10 days. In just over a year, however, Mrs May has lost eight ministers, taking her level with Mr Cameron in just half the time. The only recent prime minister to come close to her rate of resignations is Gordon Brown, who lost five ministers in three days in June 2009 after a poor showing in local and European elections. Some departments appear more likely to experience resignations than others. Of the 32 cabinet ministers who have quit since 1997, six have been work and pensions: Andrew Smith and David Blunkett under Tony Blair, Peter Hain and James Purnell under Gordon Brown, Iain Duncan-Smith in David Cameron's cabinet, and Esther McVey under Mrs May. There have already been two Brexit secretaries, despite it only being a Cabinet position since July 2016. If you'd bought Â£10 worth of dollars at the beginning of the day on Thursday, you'd have got $12.99 in return. By the end of the day it would have bought you $12.77 - a difference of 1.7%. The resignations of Dominic Raab, Esther McVey and other more junior ministers appeared to have a bigger impact than those of Boris Johnson and David Davis over the summer. However, neither of the two rounds of resignations was as significant as Britain voting to leave back in June 2016, though - the pound dropped more than 10% between 21.40 BST and midnight. The draft agreement on Britain's withdrawal from the EU, due to be signed off by European leaders next month, is just the beginning of the process of leaving. The deal needs to be backed by UK Parliament, voted for by the European Parliament and approved by the EU Council before the UK can officially leave on 29 March 2019. However, the agreement is not a trade deal - details of that have yet to be hammered out. That is set to happen during the transition period, if all goes as planned. However, if Mrs May loses the vote in Parliament, the UK enters uncharted territory. The PM may seek to renegotiate with the EU, but most expect her time in Downing Street to end. There could be a general election and/or a new prime minister. This would trigger a vote of confidence in Mrs May among all Tory MPs. It would be a secret ballot, and if she won, she would be immune from challenge for a year. But if she lost, there would be a leadership contest, and she would not be able to stand. Unless there is a general election, the winner of any Tory leadership contest would also be expected to become prime minister.

"Theresa May has vowed to see her Brexit deal through, but as this week's events have shown, a lot can change in politics - and fast. Here are the possible scenarios of her next move and what it could mean for the future of Brexit. The prime minister managed to get her draft withdrawal agreement through cabinet on Wednesday, only to see two members resign in protest at it the following day. Some had expected further walkouts but Michael Gove and Liam Fox, both prominent Brexiteers, have rallied behind her. The threat of a no-confidence vote from Tory MPs remains, but if she does stay on office - and her defiant performance at a Downing Street press conference and on an LBC radio phone-in suggests she is not going anywhere - can she stay on course with her deal? Theresa May answered questions from journalists on Thursday night First up will be the emergency EU summit on 25 November where the UK and 27 EU member states will meet to sign off on the withdrawal agreement. The noises from the continent have been positive, with Germany's Angela Merkel saying she was pleased with the progress and France's Finance Minister saying the deal was ""good news for the French economy"". LIVE: No confidence speculation continues Leading Brexiteers back PM amid Tory revolt Brexit: Where we are in eight charts Who has written no confidence letters? EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier paid tribute to Theresa May at a meeting of member states' ambassadors in Brussels this morning but said that the EU had to protect its principles even if there were political problems in the UK. The consensus, according to our man in Brussels, Adam Fleming, was that the EU should keep calm and not provoke the situation in the UK. But officials point out that European Council President Donald Tusk has left the door open to the 25 November summit being cancelled if something ""extraordinary"" happens. Diplomats' lives in Brussels are now a combination of missed meals, late nights, meetings and speculation about the state of the British government, says Adam Fleming, who is on a similar schedule. Katya Adler: EU determined to keep calm and carry on with Brexit deal While the determination of Mrs May makes this scenario seem unlikely, it is possible that with continuing criticism from her own party, and perhaps more resignations in the offing, the PM could throw in the towel. If she leaves No 10 over the issue of her withdrawal agreement, the UK could then change direction entirely over its exit from the European Union. Brexiteers like David Davis and Jacob-Rees Mogg want to go back to Brussels and renegotiate - something EU leaders have made clear they are not open to. Others, like pro-Remain Tory Anna Soubry, have suggested a government of national unity, seeing a coalition of MPs from all sides come together to get us through - a concept normally associated with times of war. But again, Mrs May has made clear her intention is to stick it out. Jacob Rees-Mogg announced on Thursday he had submitted a letter to Sir Graham Brady This scenario would make the PM's fighting spirit null and void. If the Conservative Party wants to oust her, MPs have to write letters to the chair of the 1922 Committee - made up of backbenchers - saying they have no confidence in her. If the chair, Sir Graham Brady, gets 48 letters - the equivalent of 15% of Tory MPs - a vote of confidence is triggered and a secret ballot takes place. If Mrs May wins, she becomes immune from another challenge for a year. But if she loses, there would be a leadership contest, and she would not be able to stand. It is a risk for Brexiteers, who would face the prospect of trying to persuade Mrs May to change course on Brexit for another 12 months. But if the party votes against her, it becomes a battle between its two opposing wings, and the direction of Brexit could be determined by which side comes out on top. It is difficult to see how the 25 November EU summit to sign off on the deal could go ahead if Theresa May loses a confidence vote in the next few days. It is up to Sir Graham to decide when such a vote will be held, once he has received the required 48 letters from Tory MPs demanding one, but he has said the process will move quickly. The last time a Tory leader was ousted by their own MPs, in 2003, Iain Duncan Smith faced a confidence vote the next day. If Mrs May loses she will continue to be prime minister until the leadership contest is over but she won't be allowed to take part in it. She could opt to resign and hand over to a caretaker prime minister. In either circumstance, her version of Brexit, as set out in the withdrawal agreement and future relationship document, would be in doubt. European Council President Donald Tusk has said the summit will go ahead unless something ""extraordinary"" happens - he did not elaborate on what that might be. Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian chancellor who currently holds the revolving EU presidency, told Die Presse: ""The next week will be intense, because of course it will be crucial if there is a majority for a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister May. In any case, as the EU Presidency, we have made all the preparations to move forward swiftly."" So let's say she survives the attempts of her own colleagues to oust her and gets her deal signed off in Brussels - then there is the small matter of the ""meaningful vote"" promised to MPs. As things stand, with dissent from her own backbenchers, anger from her partners in the DUP, and Labour and the rest of the opposition lined up to vote against it, the numbers do not add up to getting her withdrawal agreement through. There is rumoured pressure for her to allow a free vote of all Conservative MPs - a highly unusual move which would involve suspending collective cabinet responsibility. Her predecessor David Cameron allowed his ministers to campaign for Leave or Remain as they saw fit during the referendum - but a vote in the Commons is a different matter. Downing Street has said there will be no free vote. And if the past three days are anything to go by, the PM will continue to hammer home her message that the public wants Parliament to ""get on with it"" and hope that is enough to win MPs over. She will try to present MPs with a take-it-or-leave-it choice between her deal or no deal in the hope enough waverers will be frightened into backing her. Labour will be using every weapon in their Parliamentary armoury to ensure other options are put to the vote. If MPs do reject the deal we are into full scale constitutional crisis territory. Britain would still be on course to leave the EU on 29 March - it's the law - but all sorts of possibilities come into play that could cause delays and renegotiations. It would be one way out of her bind if the deal is voted down, but the PM has repeatedly ruled out going back to the public to ask for their say on the deal, and her Leave-supporting critics feel the same way. Prominent pro-Remainers from both sides of the House - including Tory Dominic Grieve and Labour's Chuka Umunna - alongside the Lib Dems and Greens and a growing public campaign for a ""people's vote"" think differently. But unless Mrs May performs a shocking U-turn, or there is a new prime minister, it would be down to Parliamentary manouvering to get a vote on it, which might not pass, although Labour has not ruled out backing a referendum. Time is also running out to hold a campaign before Brexit day, so Article 50 might have to be extended, something Brussels might agree to, but a lot would depend on the proposed question on the ballot paper. Would Theresa May risk another general election? This is Labour's preferred outcome. It they win they would have to ask for an extension to Article 50 to give them a chance to go to Brussels and negotiate their version of Brexit. Mrs May is unlikely to be keen on trying to get backing for another election, given her experiences last year, but in the current climate it feels like almost anything is possible.

"The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement stands at 599 pages long. It sets out how the UK leaves the European Union. Chris Morris, from BBC Reality Check, has been going through it in detail and pulls outthe key points from the agreement,externaland what they mean. The transition period (which the UK government calls ""implementation period"")  is due to last for 21 months. The UK will need to abide by all EU rules, but will lose membership of its institutions. The draft withdrawal agreement says the transition can be extended, but only for a period of one or two years. Both the UK and EU must agree to any extension. Chris Morris's analysis: The details of transition aren't new but they are no less awkward for that. At a time when the government wants to trumpet that it is taking back control (its slogan, not mine), it will be ceding control for 21 months and very possibly longer. There will be no UK presence in the European Parliament, at the top table of the European Commission or in the European Court of Justice. The UK will have no formal say in making or amending EU rules and regulations, but it will have to follow them to the letter. The great advantage of transition, of course, is that it buys more time for businesses and governments to prepare for a new regime, and it smoothes the path out of the EU. Transition also gives the UK continued access to EU databases on crucial issues like security while a future relationship is negotiated. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The draft agreement sets out the calculations for the financial settlement (or ""divorce bill"") that the UK will need to pay to the EU to settle all of its obligations. While no figure appears in the document, it is expected to be at least Â£39bn and it will be paid over a number of years. Part of that money will be the financial contribution that the UK has to make during the transition period. In 2018/19 the UK's contribution to the EU budget is forecast to be a net Â£10.8bn. If the transition is extended, there will have to be additional UK payments to the EU budget, which will be agreed separately. Chris Morris's analysis:It seems a long time now since the size of the ""divorce bill"" was the big issue that was never going to be resolved, but the government knew that without a financial settlement, progress on other issues would be impossible. Money remains a cause of controversy, though, because many Brexit supporters hate the fact that large sums will be handed over without any cast-iron guarantee about the nature of the UK's future trade relationship with the EU. Any refusal to pay, on the other hand, would sour relations and could - in extremis - end up in court. All you need to know about Brexit Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Your guide to Brexit jargon What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? This is broadly unchanged from the initial draft of the withdrawal agreement which came out in March. UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit. Citizens who take up residency in another EU country during the transition period (including the UK of course) will be allowed to stay in that country after the transition. Anyone that stays in the same EU country for five years will be allowed to apply for permanent residence. Chris Morris's analysis:The European Parliament has promised to make citizens' rights its top priority. But while politicians on all sides are telling citizens that they want them to stay, the Brexit process has caused an enormous amount of anxiety and uncertainty. British citizens in other EU countries, for example, still don't know whether they will be able to work across borders after the transition period, because their right to reside only applies to the specific country where they live. Recognition of professional qualifications, and access to university education on the same terms they have now are also unresolved issues. If no long-term trade deal has been agreed by the end of 2020 that avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and if there is no extension to the transition period, then a backstop consisting of ""a single customs territory between the (European) Union and the United Kingdom"" will be triggered. Northern Ireland will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than the rest of the UK; it will also be more closely aligned with the rules and regulations of the EU single market. As long as the backstop is in operation, the UK will be subject to ""level playing field conditions"", to ensure it cannot gain a competitive advantage while remaining in the same customs territory. The UK cannot leave the backstop independently, it needs to be decided together with the EU. Chris Morris's analysis:The single customs territory is basically another name for a temporary customs union and, if it were needed, it would ensure that completely frictionless trade could continue across the Irish border. But it would also prevent the UK implementing any trade deals with other countries around the world that involve removing tariffs on goods. That upsets supporters of Brexit, especially as there is no guaranteed route out of this backstop unless the EU gives its consent. The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland was the toughest part of the draft agreement to negotiate and, now it has been published, it has triggered a series of government resignations. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The agreement says that a separate agreement will need to be reached on access to EU fishing in UK waters. The document says: ""The Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify 'an agreement' on access to waters and fishing opportunities."" Chris Morris's analysis:Fishing is always a hot button issue, even though in most countries the fishing sector forms a tiny part of the economy. Fishing has been left out of plans for a single customs territory because several countries objected to the idea that UK fish produce would be allowed unimpeded access to EU markets, without any corresponding guarantee that EU boats would be granted access to UK fishing waters. It's an example of how negotiations on a temporary customs union were bound to throw up a host of complications - and a reminder of how tough negotiations on a future trade agreement are likely to be. The UK will remain under European Court of Justice (ECJ) jurisdiction during the transition. A joint UK-EU committee will be set up to try to resolve any disputes on the interpretation of the withdrawal agreement. If the backstop is triggered and the UK forms a single customs territory with the EU, the ECJ will not be able to resolve disputes between the UK and EU directly. Instead, the whole dispute resolution procedure will be backed up by an arbitration panel. However, if any dispute rests on the interpretation of EU law, the arbitration panel refers the case to the ECJ for a binding decision. Chris Morris's analysis:Most of this draft agreement deals with matters of EU law, so the European Court of Justice casts a long shadow. The arbitration system for resolving disputes creates a semblance of independence and ECJ rulings will no longer have direct effect in the UK once transition is over. That is an important point of principle for the UK government, but the European Court will continue to have indirect influence over the UK for many years to come. Elsewhere in the agreement there are protocols on Gibraltar and the British military bases in Cyprus. There's a provision that the UK will withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), which relates to how nuclear material is handled. EU-approved geographical indications, protecting approved names like ""Welsh Lamb"" or ""Parma Ham"" remain. Alongside the withdrawal agreement, there's the outline of the political declaration, setting out what the future UK/EU relationship might look like. It's currently only seven pages long but it's being fleshed out in negotiations that are still continuing in the run-up to the EU's Brexit summit on 25 November.

"We all do it - we don't quite understand something, so we reach for our phones and Google it. And Brexit is no different. Here we answer the five most-googled questions to do with Brexit over the past 24 hours. Don't worry, we promise to keep it simple. Brexit - short for ""British exit"" - is the process of the UK leaving the EU (European Union). The EU is a group of 28 countries which trade with each other and allow anyone to easily move between the countries to live and work. The UK had a referendum in June 2016 where it voted to leave the EU, which it's been part of for more than 40 years. But the exit didn't happen straight away - it's happening on 29 March 2019. Click here for more on Brexit This video can not be played Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) After Brexit was voted for, negotiations started between the UK and the EU. The negotiations are over the ""divorce"" deal. This is a withdrawal agreement which sets out how exactly we leave the EU - not what will happen after we leave. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May presentedthat deal.Here are some key points: Payment: The UK will pay Â£39bn to the EU to cover what it owes Transition period: Between 29 March 2019 and 31 December 2020 nothing much changes to allow the UK and EU to strike a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust Immigration: EU citizens and their families can continue to move to the UK freely before 31 December 2020 Trade: There won't be any changes to trade in the transition period Northern Ireland: Neither the UK or the EU wants there to be a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (here's why). But in the deal, there's an agreement for a backstop. Click here for more on the draft withdrawal agreement This has been one of the biggest sticking points of the whole thing. Neither the UK or the EU want a visible or ""hard"" border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland with guard posts and checks. So they've agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - that's just another word for a deal to make sure a hard border never happens. It would mean that Northern Ireland - but not the rest of the UK - would still follow some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. The backstop would only be introduced if a trade deal between the EU and the UK isn't sorted out during the transitional period. But this bit is controversial. Some people say it means the UK would still be tied to EU rules while others don't like the idea of Northern Ireland having different regulations to the rest of the UK. Click here for more on the backstop On 25 November, the prime minister will try and get European leaders to officially back the deal. If approved, she then has to take it to MPs for a vote in Parliament. That's expected to happen in December. At the moment it looks like her deal would be defeated. She doesn't have enough Conservative MPs to force it through and there are MPs from all parties who aren't happy with what's being suggested. Click here for Brexit in eight charts Can May get Brexit deal through Commons? There was a big rally in October demanding a second referendum Well, it is written into UK law that Brexit is going to happen. But some people arecalling fora second referendum (they call it a ""People's Vote""), which would basically ask the question: ""Do you want the UK to leave the EU, now we know what the deal is?"" If that happened, then Brexit could potentially be reversed - but Theresa May has repeatedly said there won't be another referendum.

"A Russian IT specialist claims that he was asked by the Russian Security Service to provide back door access to the system issuing visas for Russians to travel to Britain. The individual is currently seeking asylum in the United States. He spoke initially to the Bellingcat investigative website,externalwho investigated his claim and published a report today. The BBC has also spoken directly to the individual who has asked not be named to protect his safety. While it is impossible to verify many of the details, experts say his story is consistent with activity by the Russian security services. It is unclear if it is linked directly to the travel of Russian intelligence operatives to Salisbury this March whenSergei Skripal was poisoned. The suspected Russian agents in the attack on Sergei Skripal travelled on valid visas The man - known as ""Vadim"", which is not his real name - worked for TLScontact, a company which provides IT services to consulates for visa applications. In the case of the British operation in Russia, it processes and transmits data to London where final decisions on visas are made. While working for the company in China, Vadim got married and when he was posted back to Moscow in late 2015 he encountered problems in getting his family back with him. He believes that along with the harassment of other members of his family in Russia, this was part of a ploy by the Russian Security Service - the FSB - to try to get him to collaborate with them. Bellingcat: The website behind the Skripal revelation Russia, Fancy Bears and hacking Olympic athletes The risks of cyber-conflict with Russia In April 2016 he said he was approached by someone who offered to make the problems go away. He was asked to co-operate with the FSB and signed a document indicating that. He says the individual said they wanted information on the operations and IT network of TLScontact including a ""network map"". Vadim claims he complied with requests and soon after noticed intrusions into the IT system. Further meetings and requests followed.  Vadim claims he then made a series of attempts to leave Russia but was stopped and warned. He was also asked to report on visa applications of certain people of interest. He believes the access would have allowed the FSB to monitor the flow of information and analyse the patterns of successful applications in order to understand better how to secure visas as well as gather personal information of those applying. He says he was eventually asked to create an electronic ""backdoor"" allowing access to the visa centre network of the British consulate. He believes the type of access that the FSB was trying to engineer might allow them to potentially monitor details provided in Russia and intercept the details being transferred between Russia and the UK. Vadim claims he got his family out of the country at this point and then left Moscow in September 2016 without carrying out the request. He travelled to the US and requested political asylum. He says he tried contacting a public hotline for MI6 when he arrived in the US but never heard back. He also says he contacted a person in the British embassy in Moscow but with no response as was the case when he tried to contact TLScontact. In March 2018, two operatives of Russian military intelligence (the GRU) are alleged by Britain to have come to the UK to poison Sergei Skripal with Novichok nerve agent. Have Russian spies lost their touch? They travelled on valid visas. There is no direct evidence linking their applications to any subversion of the visa system in Russia. Officials in the UK have suggested they received legitimate visas based on the false documentation including passports they provided and have played down any possibility that the system was subverted. Vadim's claims do suggest there is a long standing interest in attempting to monitor, track and potentially subvert the process of issuing visas for individuals from Russia trying to come to the UK. It is impossible to verify all of his claims but Western security sources say they are consistent with the behaviour and activity they would expect from the FSB. The Bellingcat organisation - which has conducted numerous investigations of Russian activities - say they have seen further documentation which they say supports the story.  The Home Office in London says that the ultimate decision for the issuing of a visa is in London and does not rest with the contractor.

"Clockwise from top left: Iqlak Yousaf, Nabeel Kurshid, Mohammed Imran Ali Akhtar, Tanweer Ali, Salah Ahmed El-Hakam and Asif Ali were found guilty after a trial Six men have been jailed for sexually exploiting young girls in Rotherham who were gang-raped and abused by them. The men subjected the five girls to ""degrading and violent"" acts using drink, drugs and the ""excitement of friendship"" to lure them in. A trial heard one girl had beensexually abused by ""at least 100 Asian men""by the time she was 16, while another described being passed around. They were sentenced to between 10 and 23 years at Sheffield Crown Court. The men, who are all of British Pakistani heritage, targeted and groomed the girls, who were aged between 13 and 16, over seven years between 1998 and 2005. In a victim impact statement, one of the girls said: ""I feel like I'm constantly fighting to get justice for what they did to me. I hope the court realises these men have destroyed me. ""Some parts of me can never be fixed."" More news from Yorkshire Sentencing them, Judge Sarah Wright told the men: ""Each in your own way perpetrated, facilitated or encouraged the sexual abuse of these young girls. ""Each of the complainants in this case were groomed, coerced and intimidated. Each of them was groomed. Each of you, groomed. ""You can have been in no doubt that the complainants were vulnerable in the extreme."" Victims were assaulted and abused in locations across Rotherham, including Clifton Park The victims described being taken to locations across Rotherham including a tip in Rawmarsh, a supermarket car park, Clifton Park and Ulley Country Park. One girl, who was 14 at the time, was given cannabis and driven to Sherwood Forest by Nabeel Kurshid, Iqlak Yousaf and a third man. The men then took turns raping her, warning her that if she did not do as she was told she would be left there. Another said Mohammed Imran Ali Akhtar regularly threatened to dump her in remote locations if she did not have sex with him and his friends, and on one occasion, he abandoned her by the side of a motorway. The same girl said Akhtar would take her to meet older Asian taxi drivers, who would then abuse her. Another recounted how as Tanweer Ali raped her in the back of a car he told her: ""It's better you just get it over and done with and then you can go back home"". Judge Wright added: ""You were clearly not immature evidenced by the fact you all indulged in cynical manipulation and exploitation of your victims, which showed a maturity well beyond your chronological age. ""They continue to suffer considerable trauma and will continue to suffer throughout their lives as a result of your actions."" The convictions are the latest to come out of Operation Stovewood, run by the National Crime Agency (NCA). It began in 2014after a report found,externalat least 1,400 children in Rotherham were the victims of abuse between 1997 and 2013.

"The data protection watchdog says the Metropolitan Police's database of gang members has been illegally sharing information on hundreds of victims who aren't involved in gang crimes. The workings of the database - called the gangs matrix - is also potentially racially discriminatory, the Information Commissioner's Office said. The database was created to gather intelligence on about 3,400 suspects. The Met says it has accepted the findings and is overhauling the matrix. The gangs matrix was created after the 2011 riots - but the the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it had been so poorly managed since its inception that it constantly failed to properly differentiate between dangerous offenders and their victims. As a result, police were sharing information with other agencies, without fully explaining who on the secret lists posed a serious risk of crime. The ICO has served Scotland Yard with its toughest sanction short of a criminal prosecution, ordering the force to overhaul how it manages and shares the data. It stopped short of ordering the force to close down the database because it said it recognised its value if managed properly. Met gang database 'not fit for purpose' How much violent crime is due to gangs? Police and officials in each of London's 32 boroughs collect and manage a local database that feeds into the London-wide Gangs Matrix system. The database includes personal details, criminal records, intelligence on links to gun or knife violence and a rating of how dangerous each individual is thought to be. In the last year it has played a key role in solving a wide range of serious crimes in London. Figures from the Mayor of London show that a fifth of murder victims in the first nine months of 2018 were already on the database. Almost half of suspects charged in relation to 100 killings in the capital were also in the system. But in ahighly critical enforcement notice,external, the watchdog disclosed that the matrix was holding information on ""a considerable number"" of people who had ""a risk score of zero"". ""Their personal data continues to be processed as though they remained connected with gangs,"" said the watchdog. ""Their personal data and supposed association is shared with third parties... to encourage enforcement against them."" This sharing with agencies such as social services, housing authorities and education was part of an ""Al Capone"" attempt to disrupt gang members by targeting them for lesser matters. But the agencies receiving the information did not know that some of the people were in fact merely repeat victims or associates of more serious gang members. That meant sharing the information would have a ""significant adverse impact"" on people who would be wrongly labelled as gang criminals by anyone receiving the information. James Dipple-Johnstone, the deputy information commissioner, said the way the Met handled highly sensitive data that needed protecting was quite confused. ""In some circumstances there was good practice, but in the poor, it wasn't always clear that people were on there by virtue of that victim status - or how they were linked in with the crime and the gangs,"" he told the BBC. ""Potentially, depending on who was receiving that information, it would have influenced their opportunity to access education opportunities, training opportunities, social services and housing opportunities."" Almost nine out of 10 individuals on the database are from a black or other ethnic minority background and the ICO warned this raised ""potential issues of discrimination"", given how the information was used and the fact that Scotland Yard had not considered this risk. Met 'use force more' against black people London gang crime down as violence rises Deputy Assistant Commissioner Duncan Ball of the Metropolitan Police said the force had accepted the watchdog's findings and was ""working hard"" to overhaul the database in line with the enforcement order. ""There is clear evidence that the gangs matrix can help to reduce offending and serious violence on the streets of London,"" he said. ""We have already started work to ensure that we improve our data handling and information sharing with partners, who are also involved in community safety work. ""As well as addressing the concerns within the ICO report, we are also taking forward additional work including the introduction of a public facing website to explain the legal framework for the gangs matrix and further information to improve public confidence and transparency.""

"Goldman died on Friday at his New York home William Goldman, screenwriter of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and All the President's Men, has died aged 87. Goldman, who received Oscars for both of those films, also wrote Marathon Man, Magic and The Princess Bride, which he adapted from his own novels. His memoir Adventures in the Screen Trade is famous for his memorable declaration that ""nobody knows anything"" about the movie business. He was also a noted ""script doctor"" who worked uncredited on many features. Born in Highland Park, Illinois in 1931, Goldman started out as a novelist before breaking into movies with 1965 spy caper Masquerade. He followed that with The Moving Target, also known as Harper, in which Paul Newman played a laconic private eye. Robert Redford and Paul Newman played the title characters in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid Newman would go on to star in Butch Cassidy with Robert Redford, who himself went on to star with Dustin Hoffman in All the President's Men. Goldman was much praised for his dramatisation of the Washington Post's investigations into the Watergate affair. Disagreements during its production, however, would later see him express a wish he had never taken on the project. ""If you were to ask me 'What would you change if you had your movie life to live over?' I'd tell you that I'd have written exactly the screenplays I've written,"" he wrote in Adventures in the Screen Trade. ""Only I wouldn't have come near All the President's Men."" Goldman's other films include World War II epic A Bridge Too Far, the Stephen King adaptation Misery and the Clint Eastwood thriller Absolute Power. For many, though, he will be best remembered for The Princess Bride, a part-parodic fairy tale set in a world of giants, pirates and ""rodents of unusual size"". Cary Elwes and Robin Wright played 'Westley' and 'Buttercup' in The Princess Bride Thirty years on, actor Mandy Patinkin is still regularly asked to recite the ""My name is Inigo Montoya"" speech Goldman wrote for him. Goldman, who died on Friday at his New York home, is understood to have been in poor health for some time. His daughter Jenny Goldman confirmed his death to the Washington Post, citing complications from colon cancer and pneumonia as the cause. Mia Farrow, Ben Stiller, Michael Sheen and director Ron Howard were among many to pay tribute. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Theresa May's draft Brexit agreement has left some of her fellow Conservative MPs seething. There's a broad range of objection, but these are some of their key complaints. For the Brexit faithful, it all comes down to control. Esther McVey, one of two senior members of the UK government to quit because of the proposed deal, did so because it fails to ""regain control"" from Brussels. ""Repeatedly you have said that we must regain control of our money, our borders and our laws and develop our own independent trade policy... This deal fails to do this,""she wrote,external. Her claim directly contrasts with what Theresa May said on Thursday: ""This deal... brings back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security and our Union."" So what exactly are the objections and how does the government defend them? This year the UK's contribution to the EU budget is forecast to be a net Â£10.8bn. It has agreed to continue paying similar amounts until the end of the ""transition period"" - the time after Brexit Day on 29 March 2019 that both sides have set aside to agree a trade deal. The payments will form part of the ""divorce settlement"" - expected to be at least Â£39bn - which the UK has agreed to pay the EU to cover its financial obligations for leaving. The transition period is due to end on the last day of December 2020, but it may not. The draft agreement leaves the option of it being extended - if a trade deal isn't sorted out. If the transition is extended, it can only happen once and for a limited period. This means a previous commitment by Theresa May that any extension would be for a""matter of months"", cannot be guaranteed, especially as the decision to extend the transition has to be taken jointly by the EU and the UK. So if the transition is extended, there will have to be additional UK payments to the EU which will be agreed separately. However, supporters of the draft deal say once the UK leaves the transition period, its big annual payments will end. This is why the prime minister and her supporters claim the agreement allows the UK to regain control of its money. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. During the transition period, freedom of movement rules apply, meaning EU citizens will be free to live and work in the UK and vice versa. Once the UK exits transition, it will be able to set its own rules on immigration. This is why the prime minster claims the UK will be ""taking back control"" of its borders and that the country will be ending free movement. But if the transition period continues, so EU citizens will be able to carry on moving to the UK. A guide to where we are with Brexit Why services matter in any deal? The European Court of Justice (ECJ) is the gremlin here for many Brexit believers. It has the final say on disputes between people and governments on matters of EU law. Its opponents say the last word should always be with a UK court. Mrs May agrees. Two years ago she declared: ""We are not leaving [the EU] only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. That is not going to happen."" But during the transition, the UK will have to follow all EU rules and abide by ECJ rulings. Opponents argue this leaves the UK as a rule taker and no longer a rule maker. And if the transition period is extended into a backstop, the ECJ's jurisdiction will also be extended. But Mrs May's backers say the UK will be free of the ECJ once the transition is over. Another objection, voiced by MP Mark Francois, is that under the agreement the UK has committed to keeping ""equivalent standards"" with the EU in employment, environmental and social policy. In effect, the UK ""would continue to take EU law"" says Mr Francois. Furthermore, if the backstop is triggered then disputes about putting the agreement into practice will be settled by an arbitration panel, consisting of people nominated by both sides. That panel must refer any matter which concerns the interpretation of EU law to the ECJ Once the UK exits transition, and assuming the backstop isn't triggered, it will be able to implement any agreed free trade deals it strikes with other countries. If the transition period is extended, that is the backstop is introduced, free trade deals will have to wait. And if the UK becomes a single customs territory, which is what would happen under the backstop, it won't be able to implement any deals on goods (but it will be able to do some deals it reaches on services). Deciding when the backstop comes to an end, will not only be up to the UK. It will also have to be agreed with the EU. Ms McVey and likeminded enemies of the deal fear the UK could become ""trapped"" in this arrangement, limiting its ability to strike trade deals.

"The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement stands at 599 pages long. It sets out how the UK leaves the European Union. Chris Morris, from BBC Reality Check, has been going through it in detail and pulls outthe key points from the agreement,externaland what they mean. The transition period (which the UK government calls ""implementation period"")  is due to last for 21 months. The UK will need to abide by all EU rules, but will lose membership of its institutions. The draft withdrawal agreement says the transition can be extended, but only for a period of one or two years. Both the UK and EU must agree to any extension. Chris Morris's analysis: The details of transition aren't new but they are no less awkward for that. At a time when the government wants to trumpet that it is taking back control (its slogan, not mine), it will be ceding control for 21 months and very possibly longer. There will be no UK presence in the European Parliament, at the top table of the European Commission or in the European Court of Justice. The UK will have no formal say in making or amending EU rules and regulations, but it will have to follow them to the letter. The great advantage of transition, of course, is that it buys more time for businesses and governments to prepare for a new regime, and it smoothes the path out of the EU. Transition also gives the UK continued access to EU databases on crucial issues like security while a future relationship is negotiated. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The draft agreement sets out the calculations for the financial settlement (or ""divorce bill"") that the UK will need to pay to the EU to settle all of its obligations. While no figure appears in the document, it is expected to be at least Â£39bn and it will be paid over a number of years. Part of that money will be the financial contribution that the UK has to make during the transition period. In 2018/19 the UK's contribution to the EU budget is forecast to be a net Â£10.8bn. If the transition is extended, there will have to be additional UK payments to the EU budget, which will be agreed separately. Chris Morris's analysis:It seems a long time now since the size of the ""divorce bill"" was the big issue that was never going to be resolved, but the government knew that without a financial settlement, progress on other issues would be impossible. Money remains a cause of controversy, though, because many Brexit supporters hate the fact that large sums will be handed over without any cast-iron guarantee about the nature of the UK's future trade relationship with the EU. Any refusal to pay, on the other hand, would sour relations and could - in extremis - end up in court. All you need to know about Brexit Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Your guide to Brexit jargon What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? This is broadly unchanged from the initial draft of the withdrawal agreement which came out in March. UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit. Citizens who take up residency in another EU country during the transition period (including the UK of course) will be allowed to stay in that country after the transition. Anyone that stays in the same EU country for five years will be allowed to apply for permanent residence. Chris Morris's analysis:The European Parliament has promised to make citizens' rights its top priority. But while politicians on all sides are telling citizens that they want them to stay, the Brexit process has caused an enormous amount of anxiety and uncertainty. British citizens in other EU countries, for example, still don't know whether they will be able to work across borders after the transition period, because their right to reside only applies to the specific country where they live. Recognition of professional qualifications, and access to university education on the same terms they have now are also unresolved issues. If no long-term trade deal has been agreed by the end of 2020 that avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and if there is no extension to the transition period, then a backstop consisting of ""a single customs territory between the (European) Union and the United Kingdom"" will be triggered. Northern Ireland will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than the rest of the UK; it will also be more closely aligned with the rules and regulations of the EU single market. As long as the backstop is in operation, the UK will be subject to ""level playing field conditions"", to ensure it cannot gain a competitive advantage while remaining in the same customs territory. The UK cannot leave the backstop independently, it needs to be decided together with the EU. Chris Morris's analysis:The single customs territory is basically another name for a temporary customs union and, if it were needed, it would ensure that completely frictionless trade could continue across the Irish border. But it would also prevent the UK implementing any trade deals with other countries around the world that involve removing tariffs on goods. That upsets supporters of Brexit, especially as there is no guaranteed route out of this backstop unless the EU gives its consent. The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland was the toughest part of the draft agreement to negotiate and, now it has been published, it has triggered a series of government resignations. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The agreement says that a separate agreement will need to be reached on access to EU fishing in UK waters. The document says: ""The Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify 'an agreement' on access to waters and fishing opportunities."" Chris Morris's analysis:Fishing is always a hot button issue, even though in most countries the fishing sector forms a tiny part of the economy. Fishing has been left out of plans for a single customs territory because several countries objected to the idea that UK fish produce would be allowed unimpeded access to EU markets, without any corresponding guarantee that EU boats would be granted access to UK fishing waters. It's an example of how negotiations on a temporary customs union were bound to throw up a host of complications - and a reminder of how tough negotiations on a future trade agreement are likely to be. The UK will remain under European Court of Justice (ECJ) jurisdiction during the transition. A joint UK-EU committee will be set up to try to resolve any disputes on the interpretation of the withdrawal agreement. If the backstop is triggered and the UK forms a single customs territory with the EU, the ECJ will not be able to resolve disputes between the UK and EU directly. Instead, the whole dispute resolution procedure will be backed up by an arbitration panel. However, if any dispute rests on the interpretation of EU law, the arbitration panel refers the case to the ECJ for a binding decision. Chris Morris's analysis:Most of this draft agreement deals with matters of EU law, so the European Court of Justice casts a long shadow. The arbitration system for resolving disputes creates a semblance of independence and ECJ rulings will no longer have direct effect in the UK once transition is over. That is an important point of principle for the UK government, but the European Court will continue to have indirect influence over the UK for many years to come. Elsewhere in the agreement there are protocols on Gibraltar and the British military bases in Cyprus. There's a provision that the UK will withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), which relates to how nuclear material is handled. EU-approved geographical indications, protecting approved names like ""Welsh Lamb"" or ""Parma Ham"" remain. Alongside the withdrawal agreement, there's the outline of the political declaration, setting out what the future UK/EU relationship might look like. It's currently only seven pages long but it's being fleshed out in negotiations that are still continuing in the run-up to the EU's Brexit summit on 25 November.

"Now the Brexit deal has been signed off in Brussels, attention turns to Westminster. MPs will get their say on whether they approve of the deal or not. Several days of debate will be followed by what's known as the ""meaningful vote"". This is expected to take place in the week beginning 10 December. Any attempt to work out the parliamentary arithmetic can only be an estimate so all numbers should be treated with caution. As things stand, though, there seems to be a majority against the proposed deal. What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Who has written no confidence letters? A guide to where we are with Brexit Theresa May relies on the 10 Democratic Unionist Party MPs for her majority in the House of Commons. Their opposition to the proposed deal alone could make winning the vote tricky but the prime minister's problems don't end there. Some 57 Conservative MPs have signed up to the StandUp4Brexit campaign which argues that the proposed deal leaves the UK too close to the EU. (That includes Charlie Elphicke who is currently suspended from the party but generally votes with the government.) Added to those are the seven pro-Brexit MPs who resigned from government or party jobs on 15 November. And several more who have publicly stated they are opposed to the deal. Then there are, perhaps, a further dozen or so Conservative MPs from the Remain wing of the party who support the People's Vote campaign for another referendum or would like a closer relationship with the EU. All in all, there are around 80-90 Tories currently set to defy the government. Some of them have only said they can't support the deal which, perhaps, suggests, they might abstain when it comes to the crucial vote. But others are more hardline. On the other side of the calculation, there are a handful of pro-Brexit Labour MPs who might back the deal. And a further group who could vote for it to stop the possible alternative of a ""no deal"" Brexit. There's also one Liberal Democrat MP, Stephen Lloyd, who says he'll vote in favour of the deal to fulfil a pledge he made to his constituents. As things stand, though, this group isn't big enough to outweigh the DUP and Conservative rebels. Things can change of course. Mrs May will hope to persuade some of the rebels and more opposition MPs. But she has a long way to go.

"Amber Rudd has returned to the cabinet as work and pensions secretary. Ms Rudd, who replaces Esther McVey following her Brexit resignation, quit herself as home secretary in April amid controversy over her handling of the Windrush controversy. She admitted having ""inadvertently misled"" MPs over immigration targets but a subsequent probe found she had been let down by officials. But her appointment was met with outrage from Labour. The party's shadow cabinet office minister Jon Trickett said: ""After enforcing Theresa May's hostile environment in the Home Office, Amber Rudd will now be in charge of the DWP's hostile environment for disabled people and the poorest in society. ""With universal credit in absolute shambles, appointing a disgraced former minister who was only recently forced to resign for her role in another scandal is a desperate choice by a weak prime minister."" Live: Reaction to Rudd appointment Steve Barclay named new Brexit Secretary Amber Rudd resigns as home secretary Amber Rudd 'let down by officials' Ms Rudd said she had seen universal credit ""transform lives"" in her Hastings and Rye constituency but she ""recognised there had been some issues with it"". She said she would make it her role to to ""iron out those difficulties and make it a force wholly for good"". Labour MP David Lammy said her appointment so soon after the Windrush row was ""wrong"".

The BBC's Iain Watson said it was a huge job given the controversy surrounding universal credit, the government's flagship welfare reform. He also said it showed Theresa May's confidence that she could appoint one of her ""allies"" to such a key role given the turmoil over her leadership in the past 24 hours. Ms Rudd's return to government comes less than seven months after she faced intense criticism over the UK's treatment of the Windrush generation. She apologised after it emerged that some migrants from Commonwealth countries, who were encouraged to settle in the UK from the late 1940s to 1973, were being wrongly declared illegal immigrants.

However, she continued to defend the hostile environment immigration policy championed by Mrs May and quit after admitting to having inadvertently misled two parliamentary committees on what she knew about targets for immigration removals. A recent report found Home Office officials gave her the wrong information and then later failed to clear up the problem. Ms Rudd becomes the sixth work and pensions secretary since March 2016. A Remain supporter during the 2016 referendum, Ms Rudd has given her backing to Mrs May's draft Brexit agreement, saying it is ""not perfect but perfect was never on offer"".

"Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have been on Sky News, with former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Mrs May warns party rivals that replacing her won't make Brexit negotiations easier or ""change the parliamentary arithmetic"" Labour leader Mr Corbyn says a further referendum is ""an option for the future but not an option for today"" Publication of the draft withdrawal agreement led to the resignations of two senior ministers and several junior ministers and aides Brian Wheeler and Tom Moseley From free trade agreement to no deal, find out what the key terms mean. What are the plans to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit? Theresa May has agreed a draft Brexit deal with Brussels. What happens now? Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have been out and about, setting out their stall on Brexit. We've also heard from the former Brexit secretary who resigned last week and Sir Graham Brady, the Tory MP who knows more than anyone how close the prime minister is to facing a no confidence vote. Here are some key lines:  Adam FlemingBrussels reporter The European Commission has
proposed 31 December, 2022 as the ultimate end date for a possible
extension to the post-Brexit transition or implementation period, according to
a diplomatic note of a meeting between Michel Barnier and EU27 ambassadors in
Brussels this afternoon. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also said that the
UK is still pushing for a Chequers-style free trade area in goods with a common
rule-book to be included in the political declaration on the future
relationship. There was a divide between member
states that want an ambitious trading relationship with the UK and those who
want Britainâs access to the single market to be more constrained. The UK wants to maintain the
status quo on internal security, which is also âa problem,â ambassadors were
told. The final political declaration
could be between 14 and 20 pages long. Spain raised serious concerns
about Gibraltar, which officials fear could grow in the coming days. Michel Barnier said the political
situation in the UK was âvolatile.â A diplomat said the message from
the EUâs Brexit negotiators to the member states was âkeep a lid on your
concerns for now and weâll deal with them in the negotiations on the future
relationship."". The European Council is also
planning to issue conclusions which will go alongside the withdrawal agreement
and the political declaration when they are endorsed at the special summit next
week. New York Times The New York Times hastaken a quizzical look,externalat how Theresa May could be ousted as prime minister.  In a secret location, the chairman of a panel called the 1922 Committee was collecting poison-pen letters from rebels within Mrs Mayâs Conservative Party, calling for her to be removed as leader.  The number of letters is secret except to the chairman, Graham Brady, but once their number reaches 48, the committee â also known as âthe men in gray suitsâ â can demand a vote of all 315 Conservative members of Parliament. If she doesnât win half the votes, she will be forced to resign.  This is the way political death comes in Britain, speedily and stealthily.""  The Andrew Marr Show Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed her SNP MPs will vote against Theresa May's Brexit deal. The First Minister rejected claims her Westminster MPs could abstain on the vote in the House of Commons. The SNP leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show it would be ""deeply irresponsible"" for any MPs to endorse the prime minister's agreement, published last week. And she revealed she will be heading to London to talk to opposition parties about alternatives in the coming days. The SNP has 35 MPs at Westminster. Labour has said it will oppose the draft agreement in the crunch Commons vote, and the DUP - which props up the Tory government in key votes - has also criticised the proposals. Read more More from the DUP's Nigel Dodds, who has described the draft withdrawal deal as ""dangerous"". ""This deal would place a trade border in the Irish Sea, subject us to EU rules without any power to influence or change them and binds us to the EU with no unilateral ability to leave. Indeed, Northern Ireland is part of the EU customs union not the UK's."" Former first secretary of state Damian Green is an ally of Theresa May, so it's no surprise that he is strongly against any challenge to her leadership. If you step back, we are at the absolute crunch point of the most important negotiations this country has had for decades. I think saying that what the country now needs - let alone the Conservative Party, look at it on a national basis - to say that what the country now needs is a leadership election and a change of leadership, is absurd. From the country's point of view, I think that's exactly the wrong way to go.""  The Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs give Theresa May vital support in key votes, is not happy about the draft agreement, saying it could create a new border down the Irish Sea by making Northern Ireland follow different trade rules to the rest of the UK. Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: ""I understand why some people fear a 'no deal' scenario. ""But the choice is between this very bad deal and the right
deal. ""With MPs on all sides of the House
pointing to the dangers for the Union of the Withdrawal
Agreement, it is clear that it is time to work for a better deal
which does not undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom.""  Catherine Haddon, of the Institute for Government think
tank, said the 25 November EU summit would probably have to be postponed if May loses a
vote of confidence. She would still be prime minister until a new Tory leader was elected, unless she resigned and handed over to a caretaker PM. âIt would have implications for the negotiations because we
donât know what the position of the new prime minister would be,â Ms Haddon told BBC
News. Appointing a caretaker PM would be âquite problematicâ because
the party is divided and would be unlikely to agree on a suitable candidate. The whole Tory leadership process takes about two months,
although they could shorten it, but they would âhave to say to the EU, and the
public, we will come back in January and try to get through the leadership
contest between now and thenâ. That would take us even closer to the 29 March, the
scheduled departure date, and make it even tighter to get the required Brexit
legislation through Parliament in time. Tory MPs will be conscious of the time pressure and if she
survives this week then the chances of her being ousted are reduced, argued Ms
Haddon. She could face another âpressure pointâ when MPs vote on the
deal, which might lead to another attempt to get her out. If she won a  vote of confidence it would âstrengthen
her hand quite considerably,â she adds. The BBC's Europe editor tweets...  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The case would be made on facts rather than promises, as it was a few years ago, he said. Asked if he thought Mrs May would keep her job, Sir Vince said: ""I think so.""

Rob WatsonBBC political correspondent This time next week Theresa May hopes to be in Brussels finalising her Brexit plan with EU leaders. In the meantime she's fighting off challenges at home not just to that plan but her very leadership. Her message to hardline Brexiteers within the Conservative Party - getting rid of me won't make Brexit any easier. So far those Brexiteers have yet to muster the numbers against her for a vote of no confidence, though that could come any minute or any day. Whatever happens, whether she survives any leadership challenge or not,  the Conservative party now seems in a state of open civil war over Brexit with unforeseeable consequences for Britain's departure from the EU. The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme John Whittingdale, a former culture secretary, is one of the Conservative MPs who have submitted a letter calling for the prime minister to stand down. ""When you have a succession of resignations of the numbers that we have seen, not just this week, but when the Chequers Agreement was published, it does look like a government in disarray and it's very hard to reach any other conclusion. ""But that is because we are pushing ahead with a deal that commands very little support in the Conservative Party, is opposed in Parliament and certainly on the basis of my discussions with my own constituents, commands virtually no support in the country."" The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme Another Conservative association chair, councillor Tom Ashton of the Boston and Skegness association where people voted overwhelmingly for Brexit, says Mrs May should stay - for now. ""I wouldn't support a leadership challenge at this stage,"" he said. ""I feel she deserves the chance now to bring the deal that she's speaking of before Parliament. ""But if you cannot get a deal through, then I think it'll be up to party colleagues in Parliament 
to consider their options,"" he added. The BBC's Andrew Marr clashes with Baroness Chakrabarti, Labour's shadow attorney general, during a discussion about Brexit. Â© 2025 BBC.

Levels of child poverty are ""staggering"" and 1.5 million people were destitute at some point in 2017, the Australian said. The government rejected his analysis, pointing to rising household incomes. Prof Alston, an expert in human rights law based at New York University, visited locations including Belfast, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Essex, Glasgow, London and Newcastle on a fact-finding mission. He met people affected by poverty as well as government officials, discussing the impact of austerity, changes to benefits and local government funding. At a news conference in London, he said he witnessed ""a lot of misery, a lot of people who feel the system is failing them, a lot of people who feel the system is really just there to punish them"". Quoting figures from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, he said that more than 1.5 million people were destitute at some point in 2017, meaning they lived on less than Â£70 a week or went without essentials such as housing, food, clothing or heating. A fifth of the population, amounting to 14 million people, are living in poverty, Prof Alston said. Prof Alston useda new measure by the Social Metrics Commission,externalto come up with the figure of 14m people in the UK in poverty. It is a measure of ""relative poverty"", meaning it looks at the percentage of people living with less than 55% of the median income, taking into account costs such as childcare, housing, debt and disability. But the government has preferred to use the measure of ""absolute poverty"". This counts the number of people in households with less than 60% of the median income as it was in 2010/11, so it shows how living standards of low-income households have changed over time. By that measure, the government says there are a million fewer people in absolute poverty than there were in 2010. Among experts in the media, think tanks, Parliament and organisations such as the National Audit Office, Prof Alston said there was ""close to unanimity"" that Britain was not doing enough to combat poverty. But he said the view from ministers was the opposite. Foodbanks 'should not be safety net' UN poverty expert visits deprived village Osborne 'ignored child poverty warning' ""Ministers with whom I met told me that things are going well that they don't see any big problems and they are happy with the way their policies are playing out,"" Prof Alston said. Prof Alston met human rights workers and residents in deprived parts of Belfast He said the government was preoccupied with reducing welfare dependency but said he could not believe ministers were as happy with the results as they claimed to be. Prof Alston said: ""The era of connectivity and the era of social media makes it much less sustainable to have this dramatic difference between people living the high life, a higher life than has ever been lived before, and at the other end, people who can't afford a tin of beans, can't afford the seventh meal of the week."" by Michael Buchanan, BBC social affairs correspondent Britain's poorest communities often feel ignored, that politicians aren't interested in their experiences. For a UN representative to hold public meetings, to seek out their concerns, mattered. Some of the gatherings were packed - hundreds of people took the opportunity to be heard. What emerged for Philip Alston was an astounding disconnect between what he heard at those meetings, backed by other research he'd done, and the discussions he held with the ministers who oversee the very system causing such hardship for many people. Some will ask why the UN is looking at poverty in the UK - one of the world's richest nations. The answer, said Prof Alston, is that the government has supported these UN investigations in other countries, and couldn't therefore oppose the legitimacy of his visit here. These harsh criticisms of the government's approach to the poor may not make their lives better immediately. But their daily struggles have appalled the UN, and in time, that might matter. The approach to benefits was ""punitive, mean-spirited, and often callous"", Prof Alston said. He gave the example of ""draconian sanctions"" which shut people out from the benefits system for weeks or months at a time, sometimes for minor infringements such as missing an appointment. Many of the ""harsh"" policies could be ended ""overnight"" at little cost, he claimed. Thousands of children in 'bed poverty' Two-child benefit cap lawful, court rules Education spending now 'skewed' to poor These included the delay of five to 12 weeks before Universal Credit was paid, the single household payments which give more leverage to controlling or violent partners, and the two-child limit for benefit claimants. Prof Alston compared this limit to China's notorious one-child policy and said it was ""a perfect way to punish families"". Welfare changes have disproportionately affected women, especially single parents, he said. ""If you got a group of misogynists in a room, and said guys, how can we make this system work for men and not for women, they wouldn't have come up with too many other ideas than what's already in place."" He also warned that the poor would ""bear the brunt"" of the expected impact of Brexit on the UK economy, and said the fall in the value of the pound had already cost low-income families Â£400 a year. ""In my meetings with the government, it was clear to me that the impact of Brexit on people in poverty is an afterthought,"" he said. Jaywick, Essex, pictured in 2015, was one of the towns visited for the UN report Prof Alston's report will be presented to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva next year. A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""We completely disagree with this analysis."" She said that household incomes have ""never been higher"", income inequality has fallen and there are one million fewer people living in absolute poverty compared with 2010. It is not the first time the UK has been criticised by UN special rapporteurs, who are independent human rights experts appointed for fact-finding and monitoring missions around the world. In 2014, urban planning expert Raquel Rolnik said the ""bedroom tax"", which meant social housing tenants with spare rooms had to pay more rent or move somewhere smaller,undermined the right to adequate housing. On that occasion, ministers said her report was a ""misleading Marxist diatribe"" and made an official complaint to the UN.

"Goldman died on Friday at his New York home William Goldman, screenwriter of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and All the President's Men, has died aged 87. Goldman, who received Oscars for both of those films, also wrote Marathon Man, Magic and The Princess Bride, which he adapted from his own novels. His memoir Adventures in the Screen Trade is famous for his memorable declaration that ""nobody knows anything"" about the movie business. He was also a noted ""script doctor"" who worked uncredited on many features. Born in Highland Park, Illinois in 1931, Goldman started out as a novelist before breaking into movies with 1965 spy caper Masquerade. He followed that with The Moving Target, also known as Harper, in which Paul Newman played a laconic private eye. Robert Redford and Paul Newman played the title characters in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid Newman would go on to star in Butch Cassidy with Robert Redford, who himself went on to star with Dustin Hoffman in All the President's Men. Goldman was much praised for his dramatisation of the Washington Post's investigations into the Watergate affair. Disagreements during its production, however, would later see him express a wish he had never taken on the project. ""If you were to ask me 'What would you change if you had your movie life to live over?' I'd tell you that I'd have written exactly the screenplays I've written,"" he wrote in Adventures in the Screen Trade. ""Only I wouldn't have come near All the President's Men."" Goldman's other films include World War II epic A Bridge Too Far, the Stephen King adaptation Misery and the Clint Eastwood thriller Absolute Power. For many, though, he will be best remembered for The Princess Bride, a part-parodic fairy tale set in a world of giants, pirates and ""rodents of unusual size"". Cary Elwes and Robin Wright played 'Westley' and 'Buttercup' in The Princess Bride Thirty years on, actor Mandy Patinkin is still regularly asked to recite the ""My name is Inigo Montoya"" speech Goldman wrote for him. Goldman, who died on Friday at his New York home, is understood to have been in poor health for some time. His daughter Jenny Goldman confirmed his death to the Washington Post, citing complications from colon cancer and pneumonia as the cause. Mia Farrow, Ben Stiller, Michael Sheen and director Ron Howard were among many to pay tribute. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"It is not clear what charges Mr Assange would face The US Justice Department is preparing charges against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, reports in the US say. The reports came as a filing in a separate court case hinted that charges were being prepared. Justice officials said the filing was made in error. Mr Assange fled to Ecuador's London embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over sex assault allegations - a case since dropped. He has also stayed in the embassy over fears of extradition to the US. It is not clear what charges Mr Assange would face there. However, the US Mueller inquiry into alleged Russian election interference has suggested that WikiLeaks was used by Russian intelligence to distribute hacked material. US spy agencies say Russia aimed to help Donald Trump win the 2016 election. Russia denies the allegations. Wikileaks published thousands of emails hacked from Democrats during the presidential race between Mr Trump and Hillary Clinton. Four intriguing lines in Mueller charges Julian Assange: Campaigner or attention-seeker? Timeline: Julian Assange case The separate court case involves defendant, Seitu Sulayman Kokayi, who is charged with coercion and enticement of a minor. The filing about the case was from a prosecutor in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Assistant US Attorney Kellen Dwyer. In the filing, Mr Dwyer says documents should remain sealed because ""due to the sophistication of the defendant and the publicity surrounding the case, no other procedure is likely to keep confidential the fact that Assange has been charged"". The documents ""would need to remain sealed until Assange is arrested in connection with the charges in the criminal complaint and can therefore no longer evade or avoid arrest and extradition in this matter"", Mr Dwyer goes on to say. It was not clear if any charges against Mr Assange had been filed. The Justice Department said the filing was a mistake, without specifying why, while WikiLeaks believed it was a ""cut and paste"" error. Allow Twitter content?

One of Mr Assange's lawyers told the Guardian newspaper thatcharging someone for publishing accurate information was a ""dangerous path for a democracy to take"",external. ""The news that criminal charges have apparently been filed against Mr Assange is even more troubling than the haphazard manner in which that information has been revealed,"" Barry Pollack told the newspaper. The US media reports say US officials are increasingly confident that Mr Assange will be detained and face charges in the US. Earlier this yearthe British government said it was holding talks with Ecuadorover Mr Assange's fate. Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno has said he was never ""in favour"" of Mr Assange's activities and has described him as a ""stone in our shoe"". The US also wants Mr Assange in connection withWikileaks publishing hundreds of thousands of confidential US diplomatic cables in 2010as well as other files including video footage of an US Apache helicopter killing 12 civilians in Baghdad in 2007 during the Iraq War.

"EE and Virgin Media have been fined Â£13.3m by Ofcom for leaving customers who quit broadband and phone contracts early ""out of pocket"". The regulator said about 400,000 EE customers who ended their contracts early were over-billed and paid up to Â£4.3m too much as a result. Ofcom said about 82,000 Virgin customers were overcharged by almost Â£2.8m. Virgin said it would appeal. Margot James, Digital Minister, said companies need ""to play by the rules"". Gaucho Rasmussen, director of investigations and enforcement at Ofcom, said: ""EE and Virgin Media broke our rules by overcharging people who ended their contracts early. Those people were left out pocket and the charges amounted to millions of pounds."" The fine for Virgin Media was Â£7m, Ofcom said, with an additional Â£25,000 for providing incomplete information to the regulator. Ofcom found that Virgin Media had levied early-exit charges that were higher than customers had agreed to when signing up to their residential contracts. The regulator said this went on for almost a year. However, Virgin Media said it ""strongly disagrees"" with Ofcom's decision and would appeal to the Competition Appeal Tribunal. ""This decision and fine is not justified, proportionate or reasonable. A small percentage of customers were charged an incorrect amount when they ended one or more of their services early and for that we are very sorry,"" said Tom Mockridge, chief executive of Virgin Media. Virgin Media said it had mistakenly overcharged 1.5% of its 5.5 million cable customers between September 2016 and August 2017. The company has reimbursed or made charity donations covering 99.8% of its overcharging. This video can not be played Virgin Media customer John Jones John Jones, from Hatfield in Hertfordshire, a Virgin Media customer for seven years, arranged to terminate his account when he moved house and the firm said it did not service his new address. Virgin told him he would have to pay a ""breaking contract charge"" of Â£240. ""That was in spite of the fact that I had been a customer of theirs for seven years, wanted to continue using their services, but could not do only because they did not service my new address,"" he says. His attempts to get Virgin to remove the charge were unsuccessful and he agreed to pay as he did not want his credit rating to be affected. The charge was due to be taken in January last year by direct debit, but Virgin did not take it until the 16 February. But on 9 February, Virgin Media made a so called ""derogatory report"" to credit  reference agencies saying John had let his account fall into arrears. John says this had ""a devastating effect"" on his credit rating. His rating with Equifax fell from excellent to fair, whilst his rating with Experian dropped from excellent to poor. ""It took me 10 phone calls and emails over a period of 29 days to get Virgin Media's credit control section to agree to correct their error with the Credit Reference Agencies. ""Although they have recovered since, my credit ratings have yet to get back to the levels they were before this event happened,"" he says. EE apologised to customers after it was fined Â£6.3m following Ofcom's discovery that over a six-year period the firm did not set out the charges its mobile customers would have to pay if they left their contracts early. Ofcom said that up to 15 million EE customers faced being over-billed by up to Â£13.5m as the company had miscalculated early-exit charges. However, not all affected customers had paid these excessive charges as EE had subsequently waived some of them, leaving Â£4.3m in excessive charges. A spokesperson for EE said: ""We've already refunded customers and changed the way we calculate early termination charges, and we will continue to focus on ensuring our policies are clear and fair for all customers."" However, Ofcom said that Â£1.6m of the Â£4.3m of the overcharged fees had not been repaid as EE did not have records covering the whole period. Customers who feel they may have been overcharged should contact EE. Digital Minister Margot James said: ""We've strengthened Ofcom's powers to better protect consumers and these fines show the issue is being taken very seriously and strong action will be taken. ""Companies need to play by the rules and treat their customers fairly and honestly,"" the minister said. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ""Anyone who has been affected by this deserves a refund. ""This is another in a long line of failings in the mobile and broadband industry - we need an independent consumer champion to stick up for customers and stop this from happening."" Ofcom said the behaviour of both companies made customers less likely to switch provider, which was against its rules.

"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) broke the record held by Jeff Koons A celebrated painting by British artist David Hockney has been sold at Christie's in New York for just over $90m (Â£70m) - an auction record for a work by a living artist. Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) had been forecast to fetch $80m (Â£62m). It sold following a 10-minute battle between two bidders via telephone, after the price passed $70m (Â£54m). The sale eclipsed the previous record held by US artist Jeff Koons. His stainless steel Balloon Dog (Orange) sold for $58m (Â£45m) in 2013. The packed sales room in New York broke into applause when the hammer fell, with the buyer's premium and commission taking the final price to $90.3m. Hockney painting smashes his auction record David Hockney on Tate Britain retrospective Christie's did not name the successful bidder. The Hockney work was painted in 1972 and is one of the Yorkshire artist's most recognisable works. The auction house in New York was packed for the sale The composition of the two figures began as two separate photographs on the artist's studio floor and was completed in time for an exhibition at New York's AndrÃ© Emmerich Gallery in 1972. Christie's described it as ""one of the great masterpieces of the modern era"". Earlier this year, another of the 81-year-old's paintings sold for $28.5m (Â£22.2m) - a personal auction record for the artist. Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) was previously owned by record executive David Geffen, who sold it to British billionaire Joe Lewis in 1995 for an undisclosed sum. By arts editor Will Gompertz There is good reason for all the fuss over Hockney's huge canvas Portrait of an Artist. Painted in 1972, it unites the themes and ideas he was exploring in the late 60s and 70s with his famous ""swimming pool"" pictures and ""double portraits"". The two individual series are widely considered to be his best work. So the opportunity to buy a picture that combines both in a single wholly coherent and powerful image - by one of the world's most respected contemporary painters - is an opportunity that doesn't come along very often. That means the market-driven rules of supply and demand come into play, pushing the price up to the giddy heights of $90 million. Art dealer Stephen Howes said Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) was ""truly one of the most iconic paintings of the 20th Century"". The sale, he continued, ""galvanizes the piece's rightful place as a true masterpiece and further cements Hockney's place in the highest echelons of art history."" David Hockney celebrated his 81st birthday earlier this year The painting is so well known it was even parodied in the cartoon series Bojack Horseman,as one eagle-eyed Twitter user noticed,external.

"Germany's Angela Merkel and Irish leader Leo Varadkar have both stressed they have no appetite to amend the Brexit deal Again and again throughout this Brexit process I've been struck by the chasm in thinking between leading UK politicians and the viewpoint of EU leaders.

As the UK's political class twists and turns itself into a spitting Brexit frenzy and the pound fluctuates hysterically on the currency markets, the EU has popped on its blinkers, clapped its hands firmly over its metaphorical ears and is resolutely continuing preparations for a special summit of EU leaders to sign a Brexit deal that many in the UK believe/hope could yet end up in the bin. So far, nothing - none of the screaming headlines back in the UK - is managing to distract the EU from its focus. This video can not be played May responds to call to stand aside This, first and foremost, is because Theresa May stands firmly behind the Brexit deal. And Europeans view her as the UK's chief Brexit negotiator. UK cabinet ministers - even Brexit secretaries - can come and go, but as long as the prime minister remains on board, EU leaders believe the seal-the-deal Brexit summit will go ahead. There is also zero - really, truly, honestly, not just saying it - zero-intention or appetite in Europe to start renegotiating the withdrawal deal with the UK. For Europe's leaders, the document is the result of 19 months of intense and tense negotiations working towards something (Brexit) that none of them wants and which has already sucked up an enormous amount of time, energy and money across the European capitals in preparation. Of course, the EU would rather the UK changed its mind and stayed in the club. But if it is leaving then this, they say, is the deal on the table. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, told EU ambassadors on Friday that the European Union should not start a last minute bargaining process. Live: Theresa May vows to sell Brexit deal No Brexit renegotiation, EU leaders warn Brexiteers Gove and Fox back PM amid Tory revolt The EU should protect its principles, he said: meaning standing by the backstop guarantee on the Irish border. Brussels wants to close this chapter and move on. But remember: we're talking about the divorce deal here. Not the future EU-UK trade deal. Sure, EU and UK negotiators are hammering out a document this weekend to outline the kind of relationship they intend to have with one another after Brexit but - spoiler alert - when it comes to the chapter on future economic relations, expect their text to be suitably vague. This video can not be played Brexit: What just happened? And, anyway, this document unlike the Brexit withdrawal agreement is not legally binding. Detailed negotiations on the new EU-UK trade deal will only begin after Brexit day and the UK is legally, if not politically, free to choose - and change - the kind of economic relationship it wants with the bloc: very closeÃ  laEEA (European Economic Area),or a more arm's-length deal like Canada has. But, since it takes two to tango in negotiations, each choice has consequences under EU law. More from Katya:Volatile UK politics could bin Brexit deal, worries EU A Canada-like free-trade agreement can never - whatever David Davis and others promised - offer frictionless trade. And it would lead to a customs border on the island of Ireland unless a separate arrangement is agreed for Northern Ireland. Whereas being a member of the EEA would mean the UK accepting freedom of movement and paying into the EU budget. But the by-now hugely controversial EU-UK customs relationship outlined in the Brexit withdrawal treaty need never come about. It is an on-paper insurance policy to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland since, as already discussed, no-one knows right now what the future economic relationship will look like between the EU and the UK. Explained: The Irish border Brexit backstop Your questions answered Brexit: Where we are in eight charts How could May turmoil affect Brexit? The reason it is a UK-wide customs arrangement is because Theresa May, not the EU, wanted it to be. And, if a new trade deal is ready between the two sides before the end of the transition period - the end of 2020 - then the ""backstop"" customs partnership would be superseded. If it isn't ready, the UK government could ask the EU to extend the transition period instead, though that of course has consequences too: ongoing freedom of movement, payments into the EU budget etc. Please upgrade your browser The options don't look appetising perhaps but, as I have said, if the UK parliament now rejects the Brexit withdrawal deal, hoping to renegotiate a ""better"" (i.e more successfully cake-and-eat-it) deal, then the EU doesn't want to know. But they would likely ""freeze"" the Article 50 process if the UK were to hold a general election or a second referendum. Out of self-interest, of course. Firstly, because the EU wants to avoid a costly, chaotic no-deal scenario and, secondly, because as France's Emmanuel Macron has said so often, they will keep the door open until the last moment in case the UK should change its mind about leaving. But, deep down, Europeans think a nationwide change of heart is unlikely and that the Brexit deal will in the end be signed. Which is why, in stark contrast to the UK media obsession with the current political turmoil, Brexit is far, far down the running order of evening news programmes across Europe.

"What does the585-page Brexit withdrawal agreement,externalmean for you? BBC experts answer some of the most common questions you have sent us. Is there time for a renegotiation?@LonsYons Chris Morris, Reality Check correspondent replies: It would be difficult but not impossible: the rest of the EU would have to agree an extension of Article 50 - which they are not keen on. What is the chance of an European Economic Area (EEA)-European Free Trade Association (EFTA) deal?George Cazenove Chris Morris, Reality Check correspondent replies: Trouble with this is that no-one has really asked Norway and co if they really want the UK to crash their party. It sounds like a simple solution, but would actually be very complex. Then again, which proposal isn't? This video can not be played Brexit agreement: What does the 585-page document say? What is the likelihood of this deal being approved by all 27 other EU members?James Blackford Chris Morris, Reality Check correspondent replies: I think the other 27 would say yes if they thought the UK was committed to it. They've got plenty of other things to worry about other than Brexit. They want it sorted one way or another Live coverage: Theresa May and Brexit latest What does the draft withdrawal agreement reveal? Brexit: A guide to where we are What will it mean for British citizens' freedom of travel and rights to live & work on the continent?Henry Covey Daniel Sandford, Home affairs correspondent replies: The headline is freedom of movement ends after the transition period finishes in December 2020, but until then British citizens and their families will continue to have the right to move to live and work in the EU, and vice versa. Those who take up residence before the end of the transition period will be allowed to remain beyond transition and, if they stay for five years, will be allowed to remain permanently. However, once the transition period is over, the draft agreement does allow the EU to require UK citizens who stay on to apply for a new residence document. Will the UK be free to make trade deals with other countries?Peter Hodge Andrew Walker, Economics correspondent replies: The full answer is complicated. The short answer is: it looks like it would be difficult. First let's suppose we do end up activating the Northern Ireland backstop. That involves what the draft agreement calls a Single Customs Territory for the UK and the EU, which appears to be a customs union in all but name. In particular it says: ""Under no circumstances may the United Kingdom apply to its customs territory a customs tariff which is lower than the Common Customs Tariff (applied by the EU) for any good or import from any third country."" That rules out the bread and butter of trade agreements, negotiating the reduction or elimination of tariffs. It might still be possible to do deals on services and also investment, which is an area that has often been added on to trade agreements. If the backstop is not activated, then it depends on the shape of the agreement on the long-term relationship, which would be negotiated during the transition period. We have an outline of the political declaration intended to guide those negotiations, which says the ultimate deal should ""build on the single customs territory provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement"". On the face of it, that could run into the same difficulties as the backstop in terms of trade deals with other countries. If, however, it drops the prohibition on applying tariffs lower than the EU's, we would be in a position to negotiate conventional trade agreements with other countries. Please upgrade your browser What does the deal say about services, specifically regulations on UK financial services? Is there equivalence?Schwitt, London Andrew Walker, Economics correspondent replies: This is a question for the long term rather than the Withdrawal Agreement.  The outline political declaration doesn't make a general commitment that there will be equivalence granted but it does refer to it. The EU and UK can take ""equivalence decisions in their own interest"". The document calls for assessments of equivalence to start as soon as possible after Brexit and be completed by the end of the transition period. But I would emphasise this. It is just an outline to guide negotiations, not a definitive statement of where they will end. I am a UK national, living and studying within the EU, what impact would this have on me?Paul Blow, studying in Venlo in the Netherlands Sean Coughlan, Education correspondent replies: The future status of UK students in the EU and EU students in the UK still remains uncertain. Up to 2020, and during the transition period, not much would be expected to change. But the longer-term arrangements, about levels of tuition fees and access to student loans, have still to be decided. At present, EU and UK students are treated the same for fees in each other's countries - which has seen some UK students going to university in low-fee countries such as the Netherlands. But it will have to be negotiated whether there will be any reciprocal deals to replace this. What does the draft withdrawal agreement reveal? Will the EU still have access to UK waters and fish stocks?Stephen Knox Chris Morris, Reality Check correspondent replies: One policy area is excluded from these potential customs arrangements: fishing. That's because the trade-off between access for UK fish produce to EU markets, and access for EU boats to UK waters, is too controversial. The draft agreement simply states that ""the Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify"" an agreement ""on access to waters and fishing opportunities"". This video can not be played When will Brexit happen? Will the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) continue to have the same validity for UK citizens visiting the EU as is currently does?John Jarvis Hugh Pym, Health Editor replies: UK citizens' rights to get healthcare in the EU and vice versa will be thrashed out during the transition period from March 2019 to December 2020. The Government has drawn up a Bill to spell this out but it wont have any force till the transition talks work out how it will all work.  If there is no deal things get a lot more complicated! The Reality Check team adds: During the transition period all EU law will continue to apply in the UK. That would mean that citizens would have exactly the same rights and guarantees as before - so, you'll still be able to use your card at least until the period ends.

"UK Prime Minister Theresa May has dismissed speculation she could be ousted as leader despite a series of ministers resigning over her long-awaited Brexit deal. Mrs May hasvowed to get her draft withdrawal agreement signed off in Brussels and put before MPsin defiance of a possible vote of no-confidence in her. Such a vote could lead to her removal as prime minister and a change of course on Brexit. Here are seven charts that will help explain what's going on. The draft EU withdrawal agreement negotiated by Mrs May is set to be signed off by European leaders at an emergency summit on 25 November. But if Mrs May survives as PM she faces a battle to get MPs to back it in a House of Commons vote. Mrs May does not have a Commons majority and many MPs on her own side - as well as Labour and the other opposition parties - are sceptical about her Brexit deal, or even openly hostile to it. Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which Mrs May relies on in key votes, has already said it is likely to vote against the deal, claiming it will lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom. A number of Conservative MPs on both the Remain and Leave wings of the party have also said they will vote against it. The vote is expected to take place around 7 December. What does the Brexit deal mean for you? Your Brexit questions answered Guide to where we are Transport Minister Jo Johnson, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey - along with more junior ministers - have all resigned over the Brexit deal in the last week. They followed a flurry of other resignations in July - among them ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and former Brexit Secretary David Davis. Looking back, Mrs May's tenure actually got off to a relatively strong and stable start. She had no resignations in her first 475 days as prime minister, before Michael Fallon was forced to resign as defence secretary in November 2017. Former prime minister David Cameron, by contrast, had David Laws leave his post as chief secretary to the Treasury over expenses claims after just 10 days. In just over a year, however, Mrs May has lost eight ministers, taking her level with Mr Cameron in just half the time. The only recent prime minister to come close to her rate of resignations is Gordon Brown, who lost five ministers in three days in June 2009 after a poor showing in local and European elections. Some departments appear more likely to experience resignations than others. Of the 32 cabinet ministers who have quit since 1997, six have been work and pensions: Andrew Smith and David Blunkett under Tony Blair, Peter Hain and James Purnell under Gordon Brown, Iain Duncan-Smith in David Cameron's cabinet, and Esther McVey under Mrs May. There have already been two Brexit secretaries, despite it only being a Cabinet position since July 2016. If you'd bought Â£10 worth of dollars at the beginning of the day on Thursday, you'd have got $12.99 in return. By the end of the day it would have bought you $12.77 - a difference of 1.7%. The resignations of Dominic Raab, Esther McVey and other more junior ministers appeared to have a bigger impact than those of Boris Johnson and David Davis over the summer. However, neither of the two rounds of resignations was as significant as Britain voting to leave back in June 2016, though - the pound dropped more than 10% between 21.40 BST and midnight. The draft agreement on Britain's withdrawal from the EU, due to be signed off by European leaders next month, is just the beginning of the process of leaving. The deal needs to be backed by UK Parliament, voted for by the European Parliament and approved by the EU Council before the UK can officially leave on 29 March 2019. However, the agreement is not a trade deal - details of that have yet to be hammered out. That is set to happen during the transition period, if all goes as planned. However, if Mrs May loses the vote in Parliament, the UK enters uncharted territory. The PM may seek to renegotiate with the EU, but most expect her time in Downing Street to end. There could be a general election and/or a new prime minister. This would trigger a vote of confidence in Mrs May among all Tory MPs. It would be a secret ballot, and if she won, she would be immune from challenge for a year. But if she lost, there would be a leadership contest, and she would not be able to stand. Unless there is a general election, the winner of any Tory leadership contest would also be expected to become prime minister.

"A Russian IT specialist claims that he was asked by the Russian Security Service to provide back door access to the system issuing visas for Russians to travel to Britain. The individual is currently seeking asylum in the United States. He spoke initially to the Bellingcat investigative website,externalwho investigated his claim and published a report today. The BBC has also spoken directly to the individual who has asked not be named to protect his safety. While it is impossible to verify many of the details, experts say his story is consistent with activity by the Russian security services. It is unclear if it is linked directly to the travel of Russian intelligence operatives to Salisbury this March whenSergei Skripal was poisoned. The suspected Russian agents in the attack on Sergei Skripal travelled on valid visas The man - known as ""Vadim"", which is not his real name - worked for TLScontact, a company which provides IT services to consulates for visa applications. In the case of the British operation in Russia, it processes and transmits data to London where final decisions on visas are made. While working for the company in China, Vadim got married and when he was posted back to Moscow in late 2015 he encountered problems in getting his family back with him. He believes that along with the harassment of other members of his family in Russia, this was part of a ploy by the Russian Security Service - the FSB - to try to get him to collaborate with them. Bellingcat: The website behind the Skripal revelation Russia, Fancy Bears and hacking Olympic athletes The risks of cyber-conflict with Russia In April 2016 he said he was approached by someone who offered to make the problems go away. He was asked to co-operate with the FSB and signed a document indicating that. He says the individual said they wanted information on the operations and IT network of TLScontact including a ""network map"". Vadim claims he complied with requests and soon after noticed intrusions into the IT system. Further meetings and requests followed.  Vadim claims he then made a series of attempts to leave Russia but was stopped and warned. He was also asked to report on visa applications of certain people of interest. He believes the access would have allowed the FSB to monitor the flow of information and analyse the patterns of successful applications in order to understand better how to secure visas as well as gather personal information of those applying. He says he was eventually asked to create an electronic ""backdoor"" allowing access to the visa centre network of the British consulate. He believes the type of access that the FSB was trying to engineer might allow them to potentially monitor details provided in Russia and intercept the details being transferred between Russia and the UK. Vadim claims he got his family out of the country at this point and then left Moscow in September 2016 without carrying out the request. He travelled to the US and requested political asylum. He says he tried contacting a public hotline for MI6 when he arrived in the US but never heard back. He also says he contacted a person in the British embassy in Moscow but with no response as was the case when he tried to contact TLScontact. In March 2018, two operatives of Russian military intelligence (the GRU) are alleged by Britain to have come to the UK to poison Sergei Skripal with Novichok nerve agent. Have Russian spies lost their touch? They travelled on valid visas. There is no direct evidence linking their applications to any subversion of the visa system in Russia. Officials in the UK have suggested they received legitimate visas based on the false documentation including passports they provided and have played down any possibility that the system was subverted. Vadim's claims do suggest there is a long standing interest in attempting to monitor, track and potentially subvert the process of issuing visas for individuals from Russia trying to come to the UK. It is impossible to verify all of his claims but Western security sources say they are consistent with the behaviour and activity they would expect from the FSB. The Bellingcat organisation - which has conducted numerous investigations of Russian activities - say they have seen further documentation which they say supports the story.  The Home Office in London says that the ultimate decision for the issuing of a visa is in London and does not rest with the contractor.

"Japan Airlines will introduce a new breathalyser system at airports abroad after one of its pilots was arrested at Heathrow Airport for being drunk. Katsutoshi Jitsukawa was arrested last month after a test showed he was nine times over the legal alcohol limit. Reports in Japan say Mr Jitsukawa also cheated on an airline breathalyser test before his arrest. The new measures also come after a series of Japan Airlines flights were delayed due to intoxicated pilots. Japanese law does not set limits for alcohol consumption by pilots. Instead, it is up to airlines to determine alcohol limits for pilots on duty. Mr Jitsukawa was arrested after he was found to have 189mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in his system - the legal limit for a pilot in the UK is 20mg. He had earlier cheated on an in-house breathalyser test,external, taking it at a distance from the chief pilots who were supposed to oversee it, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper said. The co-pilot did not blow the necessary amount of air into the device and ""deliberately got around the test"", the newspaper quoted the Japan Airlines report as saying. The chief pilots had also admitted failing to oversee the test properly, the report added. Drunk Japanese pilot arrested at Heathrow Pre-flight double vodkas pilot jailed Pilot suspended for failing alcohol test ""The company takes this violation seriously, as safety remains our utmost priority, and sincerely apologizes to all affected by the employee's actions,"" Japan Airlines said in a statement. Since August 2017, there have been 19 cases where Japan Airlines pilots have failed the company's alcohol tests, a spokesperson for the firm said. Twelve flights were delayed as a result, with the remaining seven operating on time because alternative crew members were found. Japan Airlines will implement a series of measures as a result of the recent breaches. These include new breathalyser systems at overseas airports and introducing penalties ""for flight crew violating the regulated alcohol concentration level"". The new systems are already in place at Heathrow and domestic airports in Japan, the spokesperson said. They will be introduced at other airports on 19 November. Pilots will also be prohibited from consuming alcohol in the 24 hours prior to reporting for a flight from Japan, the firm said. Other airlines have also had recent trouble with intoxicated pilots. A British Airwayspilot who turned up for work after drinking three double vodkaswas jailed earlier this year. In India,a pilot was also recently barred from flying for three yearsafter he failed an alcohol test.

"EE and Virgin Media have been fined Â£13.3m by Ofcom for leaving customers who quit broadband and phone contracts early ""out of pocket"". The regulator said about 400,000 EE customers who ended their contracts early were over-billed and paid up to Â£4.3m too much as a result. Ofcom said about 82,000 Virgin customers were overcharged by almost Â£2.8m. Virgin said it would appeal. Margot James, Digital Minister, said companies need ""to play by the rules"". Gaucho Rasmussen, director of investigations and enforcement at Ofcom, said: ""EE and Virgin Media broke our rules by overcharging people who ended their contracts early. Those people were left out pocket and the charges amounted to millions of pounds."" The fine for Virgin Media was Â£7m, Ofcom said, with an additional Â£25,000 for providing incomplete information to the regulator. Ofcom found that Virgin Media had levied early-exit charges that were higher than customers had agreed to when signing up to their residential contracts. The regulator said this went on for almost a year. However, Virgin Media said it ""strongly disagrees"" with Ofcom's decision and would appeal to the Competition Appeal Tribunal. ""This decision and fine is not justified, proportionate or reasonable. A small percentage of customers were charged an incorrect amount when they ended one or more of their services early and for that we are very sorry,"" said Tom Mockridge, chief executive of Virgin Media. Virgin Media said it had mistakenly overcharged 1.5% of its 5.5 million cable customers between September 2016 and August 2017. The company has reimbursed or made charity donations covering 99.8% of its overcharging. This video can not be played Virgin Media customer John Jones John Jones, from Hatfield in Hertfordshire, a Virgin Media customer for seven years, arranged to terminate his account when he moved house and the firm said it did not service his new address. Virgin told him he would have to pay a ""breaking contract charge"" of Â£240. ""That was in spite of the fact that I had been a customer of theirs for seven years, wanted to continue using their services, but could not do only because they did not service my new address,"" he says. His attempts to get Virgin to remove the charge were unsuccessful and he agreed to pay as he did not want his credit rating to be affected. The charge was due to be taken in January last year by direct debit, but Virgin did not take it until the 16 February. But on 9 February, Virgin Media made a so called ""derogatory report"" to credit  reference agencies saying John had let his account fall into arrears. John says this had ""a devastating effect"" on his credit rating. His rating with Equifax fell from excellent to fair, whilst his rating with Experian dropped from excellent to poor. ""It took me 10 phone calls and emails over a period of 29 days to get Virgin Media's credit control section to agree to correct their error with the Credit Reference Agencies. ""Although they have recovered since, my credit ratings have yet to get back to the levels they were before this event happened,"" he says. EE apologised to customers after it was fined Â£6.3m following Ofcom's discovery that over a six-year period the firm did not set out the charges its mobile customers would have to pay if they left their contracts early. Ofcom said that up to 15 million EE customers faced being over-billed by up to Â£13.5m as the company had miscalculated early-exit charges. However, not all affected customers had paid these excessive charges as EE had subsequently waived some of them, leaving Â£4.3m in excessive charges. A spokesperson for EE said: ""We've already refunded customers and changed the way we calculate early termination charges, and we will continue to focus on ensuring our policies are clear and fair for all customers."" However, Ofcom said that Â£1.6m of the Â£4.3m of the overcharged fees had not been repaid as EE did not have records covering the whole period. Customers who feel they may have been overcharged should contact EE. Digital Minister Margot James said: ""We've strengthened Ofcom's powers to better protect consumers and these fines show the issue is being taken very seriously and strong action will be taken.

"The pair are already serving life sentences For the first time, two leaders of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia have been convicted of genocide. His deputy Nuon Chea, 92, and head of state Khieu Samphan, 87, faced trial on charges of exterminating Cham Muslim and ethnic Vietnamese communities. This was the first genocide verdict given by the UN-backed tribunal on Pol Pot's brutal 1975-1979 regime. Up to two million people, mostly from the Khmer majority, are believed to have died during those four years. 'I live next to my torturer' But the larger-scale killings of the Cambodian population do not fit the narrow definition of genocide under international law, says BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, and have instead been prosecuted as crimes against humanity. Friday's verdicts will almost certainly be the last from an unusual attempt at transnational justice that has lasted more than a decade, our correspondent adds. The pair were also found guilty of a litany of other crimes, including the crimes against humanity of murder, extermination, enslavement and torture. Khieu Samphan was in court to hear the verdict The two men - already serving life sentences for crimes against humanity from a separate trial - have again been sentenced to life. They are two of only three people ever convicted by the tribunal, which has faced criticism for its slow pace and for being subject to alleged political interference. What is genocide? Judge Nil Nonn read out the lengthy and much-anticipated ruling to a courtroom in Phnom Penh full of people who suffered under the Khmer Rouge. He described the terror of the regime, and spoke of forced marriages where couples were ordered to have children. Victims and their relatives were in the courtroom to see the ruling read out But the landmark moment came when Nuon Chea was found guilty of genocide for the attempt to wipe out Cham Muslims and ethnic Vietnamese Cambodians, and Khieu Samphan was found guilty of genocide against the ethnic Vietnamese. Researchers estimate that 36% of the Cham population of 300,000 died under the Khmer Rouge. Most of the Vietnamese community were deported, and the 20,000 who remained were all killed. More on Cambodia's brutal Khmer Rouge regime When the UN ran a country The Khmer Rouge's crimes have long been referred to as the ""Cambodian genocide"", but academics and journalists have debated for years as to whether what they did amounts to that crime. Cambodia has become known for ""the killing fields"", a reference to the scale of slaughter that took place there The UN Convention on Genocide speaks of ""intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group"". So prosecutors at the tribunal tried to prove that the Khmer Rouge specifically tried to do that to these groups - something some experts, including Pol Pot biographer Philip Short, say they did not. During the trial, a 1978 speech from Pol Pot was cited in which he said that there was ""not one seed"" of Vietnamese to be found in Cambodia. And historians say that indeed a community of a few hundred thousand was reduced to zero by deportations or killings. Apart from being targeted in mass executions, Cham victims have said they were banned from following their religion and forced to eat pork under the regime. The verdict today may not end the debate completely, but victims groups have long waited for this symbol of justice. ""They brought suffering to my relatives"" 72-year-old Cham Muslim Los Sat, who lost many family members, told the AFP news agency at the court. "" I am really satisfied with the sentences."" Led by Saloth Sar, better known as Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge was a radical Maoist movement founded by French-educated intellectuals. Pol Pot (left) had a vision of Cambodia as a classless agrarian utopia They sought to create a self-reliant, agrarian society: cities were emptied and residents forced to work on rural co-operatives. Many were worked to death while others starved as the economy imploded. During the four violent years they were in power from 1975 to 1979, the Khmer Rouge tortured and killed all those perceived to be enemies - intellectuals, minorities, former government officials - and their families. The scale and brutality of the killings - many of them meticulously documented by officials - means the regime remains one of the bloodiest of the 20th Century. The regime was defeated in a Vietnamese invasion in 1979. Pol Pot fled and remained free until 1997 - he died under house arrest a year later. This could be the final decision of the tribunal, officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC). Established in 2006 with both Cambodian and international judges, it has so far only convicted three people for the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge regime at a cost of $300m (Â£232m). This video can not be played I survived Khmer Rouge torture prison In 2010 it convicted Kaing Guek Eav, also known as Duch, who was in charge of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture centre and prison in Phnom Penh. He is serving a life sentence. Former Khmer Rouge foreign minister Ieng Sary was a co-defendant with Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea but died before judges delivered a verdict in the first of the two sub-trials in 2014. His wife Ieng Thirith, the regime's social affairs minister and the fourth co-defendant, was ruled mentally unfit to stand trial and died in 2015. Hun Sen: Cambodia's strongman prime minister How two men survived a prison where 12,000 died Although there are cases against four other Khmer Rouge members, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has been vocal about his opposition to the tribunal starting any new trials and there is little chance this will happen. A former mid-level member of the Khmer Rouge regime himself, he says his people want to move on and that further prosecutions could lead to violence. The Khmer Rouge waged an insurgency after they were toppled from power, although thousands defected to the government in the 1990s before the group disbanded completely in 1999. There are parts of the country where victims and perpetrators live side by side in villages. But many Cambodians pay little attention to the tribunal, and young people in particular are keen for their country to be known for something other than the ""Killing Fields"".

"This video can not be played Drone footage shows complete devastation in the Californian town of Paradise The number of people missing in northern California's devastating wildfire has leapt to more than 600, and seven more bodies have been found, according to local authorities. The missing persons' list has doubled since earlier on Thursday. The Camp Fire, the state's deadliest and most destructive blaze, has killed at least 63 people. Nearly 12,000 buildings have been destroyed. Three more people have also died in the Woolsey Fire, further south. Wildfire survivors: 'We swam to safety' Is Trump right about California wildfires? Before and after snapshots President Donald Trump will travel to California on Saturday to survey the damage and meet those affected. About 9,400 firefighters are currently battling wildfires across the state. The Camp Fire - which broke out eight days ago - swept through a swathe of the north at high speed, leaving residents little time to escape. The official list more than doubled from 300 to 631 on Thursday. At a news briefing, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said this was because investigators had thoroughly cross-checked their information, including emergency calls made since the Camp Fire started on 8 November. ""I want you to understand that the chaos we were dealing with was extraordinary,"" Mr Honea said. He stressed that the number of the missing would most likely fluctuate. ""If you look at that list and see your name, or the name of a friend or loved one, please call to let us know,"" Mr Honea appealed to the public. The California Fire Department says it has now contained about 40% of the Camp Fire blaze. ""We continue to engage in the fire fight. We continue to keep our eye on the ball,"" chief fire department official Ken Pimlott said. Officials say they do not expect to fully contain the blaze - which has razed 145,000 acres (56,600 ha) - until the end of the month. They are also battling several other fires. The Woolsey Fire in Ventura County near Los Angeles covers nearly 100,000 acres and is 62% contained. The smaller Hill Fire, also in Ventura County, covers 4,530 acres and is 99% contained. The Morgan Fire in Contra Costa County, near San Francisco, covers 20 acres and is 60% contained. Before and after snapshots Is it advisable to escape a wildfire by car? Red carpets cancelled after wildfires The worst-hit area is the town of Paradise, with officials saying it will need a ""total rebuild"" job that will take several years. The town of Paradise was gutted by the blaze Brock Long, administrator of Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), said the damage to Paradise was ""one of the worst disasters"" he had ever seen.

Watch: Long battle against California wildfires Watch: Why California wildfires are so deadly Officials have warned the search operation could take weeks. Officials have not yet confirmed what started any of the blazes, as investigations are continuing. Several people have already filed a lawsuit against a local power company, alleging that the Camp Fire started when a high-voltage transmission line failed. Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn - but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round.

"Japan Airlines will introduce a new breathalyser system at airports abroad after one of its pilots was arrested at Heathrow Airport for being drunk. Katsutoshi Jitsukawa was arrested last month after a test showed he was nine times over the legal alcohol limit. Reports in Japan say Mr Jitsukawa also cheated on an airline breathalyser test before his arrest. The new measures also come after a series of Japan Airlines flights were delayed due to intoxicated pilots. Japanese law does not set limits for alcohol consumption by pilots. Instead, it is up to airlines to determine alcohol limits for pilots on duty. Mr Jitsukawa was arrested after he was found to have 189mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in his system - the legal limit for a pilot in the UK is 20mg. He had earlier cheated on an in-house breathalyser test,external, taking it at a distance from the chief pilots who were supposed to oversee it, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper said. The co-pilot did not blow the necessary amount of air into the device and ""deliberately got around the test"", the newspaper quoted the Japan Airlines report as saying. The chief pilots had also admitted failing to oversee the test properly, the report added. Drunk Japanese pilot arrested at Heathrow Pre-flight double vodkas pilot jailed Pilot suspended for failing alcohol test ""The company takes this violation seriously, as safety remains our utmost priority, and sincerely apologizes to all affected by the employee's actions,"" Japan Airlines said in a statement. Since August 2017, there have been 19 cases where Japan Airlines pilots have failed the company's alcohol tests, a spokesperson for the firm said. Twelve flights were delayed as a result, with the remaining seven operating on time because alternative crew members were found. Japan Airlines will implement a series of measures as a result of the recent breaches. These include new breathalyser systems at overseas airports and introducing penalties ""for flight crew violating the regulated alcohol concentration level"". The new systems are already in place at Heathrow and domestic airports in Japan, the spokesperson said. They will be introduced at other airports on 19 November. Pilots will also be prohibited from consuming alcohol in the 24 hours prior to reporting for a flight from Japan, the firm said. Other airlines have also had recent trouble with intoxicated pilots. A British Airwayspilot who turned up for work after drinking three double vodkaswas jailed earlier this year. In India,a pilot was also recently barred from flying for three yearsafter he failed an alcohol test.

"ShortList, which claims to be UK's biggest men's magazine, is being axed by its publisher as advertising continues to move online.

The closure, which wasfirst reported by trade title Campaign,external, will result in some job losses. Staff were told about the decision to close the print edition on Friday.

"This video can not be played Brexit: May under pressure over deal Theresa May has secured a deal with the European Union on the terms of Britain's exit on 29 March - and a joint statement on how future relations between the two might work. What happens now? The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, 2019, after people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum. The UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice. This has now been agreed with the EU and backed by the cabinet, althoughtwo ministers resigned in protest at it.They have also agreed a rough outline of how future relations might work, known as the political declaration. Theresa May now has to get MPs to vote for the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. A vote scheduled for Tuesday, 11 December was delayed by the prime minister until 21 January at the latest. If she eventually clears that hurdle, it will go to a vote in the European Parliament. There are two documents. Adraft 585-page agreement on Britain's withdrawal,externalfrom the European Union is a legally-binding text that sets out the terms of the UK's departure. It includes: Commitments over citizens' rights after Brexit - people will be able to work and study where they currently live, and to be joined by family members A 21-month transition period after the UK's departure, to allow time for trade talks The UK would continue to follow all EU rules during this period in order to give governments and businesses more time to prepare for long term changes A ""fair financial settlement"" from the UK - also known as the Â£39bn ""divorce bill"" A ""backstop"" arrangement to keep the Irish border unmanned if trade talks don't come up with a way of avoiding that happening More on how what the draft agreement reveals The other document isa 26-page statement on the UK's future relationship with the EU,external, when the transition period comes to an end. This is not legally-binding and contains wriggle room for both sides, based around the central ideal of continued close co-operation. The government has described it as ""a set of instructions to negotiators"" working on a legally-binding treaty. Formal negotiations on everything it contains can only begin after Brexit has actually happened on 29 March 2019. The declaration includes: Plans for a ""free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas"" ""Ambitious customs arrangements"" that ""build on"" the arrangements in the withdrawal agreement Commitment to respect the EU's four freedoms - the free movement of people, goods, services and money around the EU A specific reference to the end of free movement in the UK A reference to allowing the UK to strike its own trade deals after Brexit An exit from the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy Determination to use technology to replace the Northern Irish ""backstop"" - but no guarantee A clear continuing role for the European Court of Justice in the interpretation of EU law Continued participation in EU programmes in areas like science, culture, education, overseas development and space, including ""a fair and appropriate financial contribution"" Continued co-operation on defence and security More on what's in the political declaration This was the major sticking point in talks with Brussels. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with guard posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk. So they agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU. The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. But Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules and they say there's no process for the UK to unilaterally decide to exit the backstop - and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea. Mrs May insists she does not want to use the backstop and says it is highly unlikely that it will ever be triggered (her critics think otherwise). But if no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead. This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now. They could do this only once. The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely. But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be. Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022. Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March's official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about. This video can not be played When will Brexit happen? As things stand, it looks unlikely. MPs were scheduled to vote on Tuesday, 11 December. However, the prime minister delayed the vote, admitting that ""widespread and deep concern"" over the Northern Ireland backstop meant the deal would have been rejected ""by a significant margin"". Mrs May said she would raise those concerns with EU leaders, and also look at ways to give MPs the power to force the government to ""ensure that the backstop cannot be in place indefinitely"" and has ""democratic legitimacy"". Downing Street has said it will be rescheduled for 21 January at the latest, although Brexit Minister Robin Walker told MPs he hoped it would be sooner. Before the vote was postponed, Labour and all the other opposition parties in the House of Commons had said they would vote against the deal. About 100 Conservative MPs have said will not support it, although some might abstain rather than actually voting against. And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, who Mrs May relies on to keep her in power, have also said they will vote against it. Theresa May is hoping to persuade MPs that the deal not only delivers on the result of the EU referendum by allowing the UK to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"" it is also the best the UK can get from the EU and there is no alternative on offer. She will also argue that if her deal is voted down, Britain risks leaving without a deal - a prospect feared by many MPs, who think it will cause chaos at the ports and damage industry - or, she says, there will be ""no Brexit at all"". Brexiteers say it is not what people voted for - and it could keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, without any say over its rules. Some have even argued that it would be worse than staying in the EU. Remainers also argue that it is a worse deal for the UK than staying in the EU. This video can not be played Radio 4 The World at One asks: What will happen if Parliament rejects the Brexit plan? It is hard to say for certain. There are number of possible scenarios, including: Leaving the EU without a deal Having another vote in Parliament - Mrs May will get three weeks to make a second attempt Another EU referendum (this can only happen if the government brings forward legislation to hold one and a majority in the Commons supports it) A general election - Labour's preferred option but it would need a no-confidence vote in the PM Theresa May is removed by her own MPs and a new leader tries to renegotiate a deal with the EU - Tory MPs say they are close to having enough signatures to trigger a confidence vote in her Some of these options would involve delaying the official Brexit date of 29 March by a few months to allow time to renegotiate a deal, if the EU agrees to that Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has alsofloated the idea of Labour forming a minority governmentwithout a general election to have a go at getting its own version of Brexit - centred around a permanent customs union with the EU - through Parliament, although the party would then have to get the EU to agree to that.

"The UK stock market has slipped lower amid the political fall-out from Theresa May's Brexit plan. The FTSE 100 share index ended 0.3% lower at 7,013.88, with shares in UK-focused stocks such as banks and housebuilders continuing to slide. However, the pound - which suffered its biggest fall for two years on Thursday - has stabilised. Sterling was up 0.6% against the dollar at $1.2846, although it slipped 0.2% against the euro to â¬1.1258. Despite the Prime Minister announcing on Wednesday that she had secured cabinet backing for the draft Brexit agreement with Brussels, the resignations of Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey on Thursday rattled markets. On Thursday, the pound registered its highest volatility since the referendum in June 2016 as it fell 1.7% against the dollar and dropped 1.9% against the euro. In the absence of any further resignations, the pound stabilised on Friday. But the stability may not last, analysts said. ""As long as 'no deal' remains as likely as it is, there is a risk of a sterling depreciation spiral that is self-intensifying,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmannan, a foreign exchange strategist at Commerzbank. ""Sterling volatility has woken up from its 100-year slumber and is likely to remain reactive."" May's deal 'better than no deal': Rolls boss Brexit: Where we are in eight charts Leading Brexiteers back PM amid Tory revolt Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the pound was a barometer for the prospects of the UK economy. ""Every time we see a likelihood of a bad Brexit risk... the currency sells off,"" Mr Khalaf said. The fall in the pound on Thursday which was the largest percentage fall in the currency since the vote to leave the EU in June 2016, when the pound slumped by 9.1% against the dollar. That move was even greater than the slump on 21 October 2008, when the then governor of the Bank of England. Mervyn King, said the financial crisis meant the UK economy was heading into a recession. James Bevan, chief investment officer at CCLA Investment Management, told the BBC's Today programme that there were some ""interesting fundamentals"" affecting the pound at present. Among them are the slower economic growth in the UK than the EU and the US, which means that interest rates in the UK may not rise as quickly as those in other parts of the world. This makes the pound less attractive to investors. The FTSE 100 share index lost ground on Friday, ending 0.3% lower at 7,013.88, while the FTSE 250 - which is generally regarded as a closer barometer of the UK economy - also fell 0.4% to 18,589.09. Mr Khalaf said the index of the biggest 100 companies on the stock market was protected from bigger falls by companies with large international operations. ""If you look at the headline performance of the market, the benchmark index, it hasn't really moved,"" said Mr Khalaf. For instance, the biggest companies in the index, Shell and HSBC, both have large overseas operations that generate revenues in currencies such as dollars and euros which are worth more as the pound falls. During Thursday, shares in companies that are heavily exposed to the UK economy saw the biggest falls, with housebuilders and banks being particularly hard hit. Royal Bank of Scotland fell over 3%, housing firms Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey fell over 2% and 1% respectively while Barratt Developments lost 0.5%. Mr Khalaf calls such companies the ""Brexit beasts"" - ones which are more closely linked to the UK economy. He gave the example of Lloyds Banking Group which was making a loss in 2011 and now makes billions of pounds of profits but is trading at a lower share price. RBS is also being knocked by the possibility that if there was a general election and the Labour party took power, the bank could be fully nationalised. Big businesses have been generally supportive of the draft Brexit agreement published on Wednesday. The CBI's Chairs' Committee - the body's most senior policy-making committee - said it represented ""hard-won progress"". It said the agreement had two essential economic benefits which must be achieved: avoiding a no deal cliff edge by delivering transition, and opening a route to a good long-term trade deal. ""The real life implications for people and regions across the UK are what really matter. Business urges all involved to assess the way forward on this basis,"" it added in a statement. Earlier, Warren East, chief executive of engineering company Rolls-Royce, told the Today programme that time was running out and that any deal was better than leaving the EU without an agreement. ""I would, as a business leader, like to see politicians on both sides of the fence get on and negotiate a practical deal that works for business,"" he said. Eyes are on businesses such as Rolls-Royce, which operate a ""just-in time"" model where parts arrive in the UK from across the EU as they are needed. The head of the Co-operative Group has warned that availability of fresh food from both the UK and abroad could be hit by a no-deal Brexit. Steve Murrells told BBC Radio 5 live that stockpiling was not an option as ""there is not enough chilled capacity to do it"".

"There are now discrepancies between copies of the kilogram and the master version held in a French vault Scientists have changed the way the kilogram is defined. Currently, it is defined by the weight of a platinum-based ingot called ""Le Grand K"" which is locked away in a safe in Paris. On Friday, researchers meeting in Versailles voted to get rid of it in favour of defining a kilogram in terms of an electric current. The decision was made at theGeneral Conference on Weights and Measures,external. But some scientists, such as Perdi Williams at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK, have expressed mixed feelings about the change. ""I haven't been on this project for too long but I feel a weird attachment to the kilogram,"" she said. ""I think it is such an exciting thing and this is a really big moment. So I'm a little bit sad about [the change]. But it is an important step forward and so the new system is going to work a lot better. It is also a really exciting time, and I can't wait for it to happen."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Le Grand K has been at the forefront of the international system of measuring weights since 1889. Several close replicas were made and distributed around the globe. But the master kilogram and its copies were seen to change - ever so slightly - as they deteriorated. In a world where accurate measurement is now critical in many areas, such as in drug development, nanotechnology and precision engineering - those responsible for maintaining the international system had no option but to move beyond Le Grand K to a more robust definition. The change was approved at the General Conference on Weights and Measures The fluctuation is about 50 parts in a billion, less than the weight of a single eyelash. But although it is tiny, the change can have important consequences. Coming in is an electrical measurement which Dr Stuart Davidson, head of mass metrology at NPL, says is more stable, more accurate and more egalitarian. ""We know from comparing the kilogram in Paris with all the copies of the kilogram that are all around the world that there are discrepancies between them and Le Grand K itself,"" he said. ""This is not acceptable from a scientific point of view. So even though Le Grand K is fit for purpose at the moment, it won't be in 100 years' time."" Electromagnets generate a force. Scrap-yards use them on cranes to lift and move large metal objects, such as old cars. The pull of the electromagnet, the force it exerts, is directly related to the amount of electrical current going through its coils. There is, therefore, a direct relationship between electricity and weight. So, in principle, scientists can define a kilogram, or any other weight, in terms of the amount of electricity needed to counteract the weight (gravitational force acting on a mass). 'Anti-vaxxers' in US chickenpox outbreak Mystery of wombats' cubed poop revealed The remote UK community living off-grid There is a quantity that relates weight to electrical current, called Planck's constant - named after the German physicist Max Planck and denoted by the symbolh. Buthis an incredibly small number and to measure it, the research scientist Dr Bryan Kibble built a super-accurate set of scales. The Kibble balance, as it has become known, has an electromagnet that pulls down on one side of the scales and a weight - say, a kilogram - on the other. The electrical current going through the electromagnet is increased until the two sides are perfectly balanced. By measuring the current running through the electromagnet to incredible precision, the researchers are able to calculatehto an accuracy of 0.000001%. This breakthrough has paved the way for Le Grand K to be deposed by ""die kleineh"". Scientists celebrated the outcome of the vote Every few decades, all the replica kilograms in the world had to be checked against Le Grand K. The new system, now that it's been adopted, will allow anyone with a Kibble balance to check their weights anytime and anywhere, according to NPL's Dr Ian Robinson. ""It feels really good to be at this point. I feel it is the right decision. Once we've done this it will be stable for the foreseeable future,"" he said.

"The body of 85-year-old Rosina Coleman was found at her home in Romford A handyman has been jailed for life after he admitted bludgeoning an 85-year-old woman to death with a hammer. Rosina Coleman was killed at her home in Ashmour Gardens, Romford, east London, on 15 May. Convicted burglar Paul Prause, who had racked up huge debts through gambling, stole a Â£7,000 ring from his victim. The 65-year-old, of Romford, pleaded guilty to Ms Coleman's murder and was jailed at the Old Bailey for a minimum of 22 years. Prause initially told detectives he had found Mrs Coleman's body when he arrived at her house, but was challenged over his account in police interviews. He had attempted to stage the scene of a burglary by carrying out an ""untidy search"" of her bedroom. Paul Prause, 65, was jailed for a minimum of 22 years He then told officers he went round for a cup of tea but was sworn at by the pensioner as he left, so he hit her round the head with a hammer. He had felt rage and could not stop himself, and continued hitting her until she was dead, he told police. Can Chicago cure London's violence? London homicides: The victims of 2018 Murder victim's family leave UK and say London 'too dangerous' After giving at least two false accounts to police, the defendant accepted responsibility for inflicting the fatal injuries. Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC said: ""He said that he had been under pressure for some time and if it had not been Rosie that day someone else 'would have got it'."" When Prause's home in Romford was searched, a white gold diamond ring solitaire twist was found on top of a brick inside the garage. The ring, belonging to Mrs Coleman, had a retail value of up to Â£7,000. Paul Prause bought latex gloves at a DIY store in east London as he sought to cover up the murder Mrs Coleman had lived on the street for decades with her husband Bill, who died about 11 years ago. In a victim impact statement, Mrs Coleman's daughter, Sharon Thomas, said her life had been ""devastated"" by her mum's ""violent death"". She said: ""This would not have been the same if mum had died from natural causes, a heart attack. I know that because my dad died instantly."" Outside court, Ms Thomas said her mother had lived her life ""to the full"". She said: ""We as a family have been robbed of our queen. We feel robbed through mindless greed."" The hammer which inflicted the injuries was recovered from the River Rom Prause had previous convictions between 1966 and 1994 for theft, burglary and taking a vehicle without consent, the court heard. Det Ch Insp Paul Considine said: ""Prause pretended he had just come across this terrible crime when in reality he was Rose's attacker. ""He lied to officers until the evidence caught him out and he was forced to admit he had hit her repeatedly with a hammer."" Rosina Coleman's Â£7,000 wedding ring was found in Paul Prause's shed CCTV revealed Prause's car had been in Ashmour Gardens three times during the morning of Mrs Coleman's death. Detectives discovered he had been in nearby Chadwell Heath fixing a washing machine between 08:30 and 09:00 BST. After completing the job, Prause had visited a DIY store in Romford at 09:05 to buy a packet of latex gloves. A finger from a latex glove was later found caught in the door handle of a wardrobe in Mrs Coleman's bedroom A blood-stained piece of glove was later submitted for DNA testing and produced two profiles - one belonged to Mrs Coleman and the second was found to be a match for Prause. A search of Prause's car found the opened packet of latex gloves, with two missing. When sentencing Prause, Judge Philip Katz QC described the wounds inflicted on Mrs Coleman as ""sickening"". He told Prause: ""Your attack with a hammer was brutal and sustained long enough for her to have defensive wounds. ""Her terror can only be imagined. There were at least 11 blows with severe force.""

"A UK university had to be given an emergency loan of almost Â£1m by the higher education watchdog to stay afloat this autumn. It's been discovered that the Office for Students provided the bailout when the university faced the prospect of running out of cash and being unable to pay its bills. The money has been repaid - and the regulator says the university, a small, modern institution, is now financially stable. But it highlights the fragility of university finances, which are now in a ""marketplace"" and vulnerable to fluctuations in recruitment and tuition fee income. The discovery of this payment is also embarrassing for the Office for Students (OFS), which recently sent out a tough message that there would be no bailouts for universities in financial difficulty. Sir Michael Barber, who chairs the regulator, told a conference a couple of weeks ago that it was wrong for university leaders to think the OFS would would help them if they were in ""financial trouble"" because of a lack of student numbers or overspending on buildings. ""This is wrong. The OFS will not bail out providers in financial difficulty,"" Sir Michael said. The watchdog says the bailout it did provide, made to the university in September and understood to be about Â£900,000, was under the rules of its predecessor organisation, the Higher Education Funding Council for England, under transition arrangements. It followed a cash problem faced by the university over the summer. But a spokesman for the OFS said that under its own new rules, now in place, such financial support would no longer be permissible. Would a university really be allowed to go bust? Review is considering cutting fees to Â£6,500 Is the tuition fees 'illusion' about to unravel? The debate about bailouts followed reports from Richard Vaughan in the I newspaper thatthree universities were on the ""brink of bankruptcy"",external. It raised the question of whether universities, in what has been designed as a competitive marketplace, should be allowed to go bust and close down. That the watchdog was ready to act behind the scenes shows how difficult it would be to really allow a university to go under. It would mean huge disruption for students and would mean the loss of what are often among the biggest local employers and drivers of local economies. It could also put the watchdog and universities minister into a very compromised position if they let a university collapse. They would be asked how they allowed people to apply to a university they knew to be at financial risk. If students are getting into Â£50,000 of debt from a degree course, the Office for Students, acting in the consumer interest, would be expected to warn students not to step aboard a university that was not financially watertight. But if they, or university ministers, did warn that a university was in financial trouble, it would be likely to destroy the student numbers on which universities rely for their income - making it even harder for a university to dig itself out of danger. The OFS says that its new provisions will make the university sector more financially robust. As a condition of registering with the OFS, the regulator will have to be confident that universities are financially secure for at least the next three years. A spokesman for the OFS said the institution to which it lent money could now pass this financial test and show it was ""not at material risk of insolvency for the next three years"". ""Over the summer, we provided a short-term liquidity loan to the university, which was quickly repaid in full and repaid before registration,"" the OFS spokesman said. He said it was paid under ""inherited legal responsibilities which will cease to apply at the end of this transition year in July 2019"". ""We have been very clear that we would not bail out any university. But we have also said that where a university is in trouble, we would first ensure that they have a strong student protection plan and secondly we would act according to the circumstances. ""This could for example involve requiring them to carry out a strategic options review to identify future options including restructuring their business model, sale of property or mergers."" It will also raise questions for the current review of university funding in England. There have been suggestions that the headline figure for tuition fees could be reduced to Â£6,500 from Â£9,250. Although this would mean less cash going directly to universities, it would mean that more of university budgets could be distributed centrally, making them less vulnerable to annual changes in student numbers.

"This picture released by state media showed Mr Kim surrounded by officials, but no weapons were visible North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has supervised the successful test of a new ""high-tech"" tactical weapon, state-run media say. The KCNA news agency gave no details on the type of the weapon, saying only it had been developed over a long period. This is North Korea's first official report of a weapons test in a year. In a summit in June Mr Kim and US President Donald Trumpagreed the Korean peninsula should denuclearise, but a detailed plan was never set out. North Korean state media have provided no details as to what kind of weapon this was, but it comes shortly aftera report based on satellite imagery identified the extent of North's complex network of missile bases around the country.,external South Korea says it is in the process of analysing what the weapon is, but many have pointed out that the North made no commitment to halt any weapons development or shut down its missile bases. Responding to the inspection, a US State Department spokesman said the US ""remained confident that the promises made by President Trump and Chairman Kim will be fulfilled"". US and North Korea suffer communication breakdown The king of Pyongyang ""Kim Jong-un inspected the testing of a newly developed high-tech tactical weapon at the Academy of National Defence Science,"" the KCNA reported. ""The testing of the high-tech tactical weapon has been carried out successfully."" Kim Jong-un expressed ""great satisfaction"" over ""state-of-the-art"" weapon, North Korea's media say The news agency added that Mr Kim expressed ""great satisfaction"" over the ""state-of-the-art"" weapon that ""builds impregnable defences of our country and strengthens the fighting power of our people's army"". Meanwhile, South Korea's unification ministry said it was Mr Kim's first known inspection of a testing site since he was present at the launch of the Hwasong-15 intercontinental missile in November 2017. The ministry said it believed this time Mr Kim was supervising the test of a traditional weapon because the term ""strategic weapon"" was not used by the KCNA. Yes and no. At the Singapore summit in June, both Mr Trump and Mr Kim agreed to work towards denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula. But the agreement did not include any timeline, details or mechanisms to verify the process. Both countries have also never agreed on the goalposts of ""denuclearisation"". Denuclearisation: The word Trump and Kim can't agree on North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Pyongyang has been clear from the start that it would not unilaterally disarm. But the US has also made it clear that there will be no sanctions relief until ""complete denuclearisation"". Talks appear to have stalled since then, and discussions aimed at setting up a second summit between both leaders failed to materialise. Last week Mr Kim's aide, Kim Yong-chol, was supposed to travel to New York and meet US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. But the BBC understands that the meeting was cancelled after the State Department discovered that the North Koreans did not get on the plane as planned. However, the US still maintains that another summit between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump will take place early next year.

""Every time we see a likelihood of a bad Brexit risk... the currency sells off,"" Mr Khalaf said. The fall in the pound on Thursday which was the largest percentage fall in the currency since the vote to leave the EU in June 2016, when the pound slumped by 9.1% against the dollar. That move was even greater than the slump on 21 October 2008, when the then governor of the Bank of England. Mervyn King, said the financial crisis meant the UK economy was heading into a recession. James Bevan, chief investment officer at CCLA Investment Management, told the BBC's Today programme that there were some ""interesting fundamentals"" affecting the pound at present. Among them are the slower economic growth in the UK than the EU and the US, which means that interest rates in the UK may not rise as quickly as those in other parts of the world. This makes the pound less attractive to investors. The FTSE 100 share index lost ground on Friday, ending 0.3% lower at 7,013.88, while the FTSE 250 - which is generally regarded as a closer barometer of the UK economy - also fell 0.4% to 18,589.09. Mr Khalaf said the index of the biggest 100 companies on the stock market was protected from bigger falls by companies with large international operations. ""If you look at the headline performance of the market, the benchmark index, it hasn't really moved,"" said Mr Khalaf. For instance, the biggest companies in the index, Shell and HSBC, both have large overseas operations that generate revenues in currencies such as dollars and euros which are worth more as the pound falls. During Thursday, shares in companies that are heavily exposed to the UK economy saw the biggest falls, with housebuilders and banks being particularly hard hit. Royal Bank of Scotland fell over 3%, housing firms Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey fell over 2% and 1% respectively while Barratt Developments lost 0.5%. Mr Khalaf calls such companies the ""Brexit beasts"" - ones which are more closely linked to the UK economy. He gave the example of Lloyds Banking Group which was making a loss in 2011 and now makes billions of pounds of profits but is trading at a lower share price. RBS is also being knocked by the possibility that if there was a general election and the Labour party took power, the bank could be fully nationalised. Big businesses have been generally supportive of the draft Brexit agreement published on Wednesday. The CBI's Chairs' Committee - the body's most senior policy-making committee - said it represented ""hard-won progress"". It said the agreement had two essential economic benefits which must be achieved: avoiding a no deal cliff edge by delivering transition, and opening a route to a good long-term trade deal. ""The real life implications for people and regions across the UK are what really matter. Business urges all involved to assess the way forward on this basis,"" it added in a statement. Earlier, Warren East, chief executive of engineering company Rolls-Royce, told the Today programme that time was running out and that any deal was better than leaving the EU without an agreement. ""I would, as a business leader, like to see politicians on both sides of the fence get on and negotiate a practical deal that works for business,"" he said. Eyes are on businesses such as Rolls-Royce, which operate a ""just-in time"" model where parts arrive in the UK from across the EU as they are needed. The head of the Co-operative Group has warned that availability of fresh food from both the UK and abroad could be hit by a no-deal Brexit. Steve Murrells told BBC Radio 5 live that stockpiling was not an option as ""there is not enough chilled capacity to do it"".

"Rolls-Royce is one of the biggest suppliers of aero engines Politicians must get behind a ""practical plan"" for Brexit, the boss of engineering giant Rolls-Royce has said. Warren East said time was running out and that any deal was better than leaving the EU without an agreement. Rolls-Royce employs 22,300 people in the UK making aerospace, marine and submarine engines. Mr East joined other business leaders in backing the draft plan put forward by Theresa May on Wednesday. ""The time since the referendum seems to have gone remarkably quickly and we're essentially [still] having a discussion we could have had the morning after the referendum,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""We are slightly running out of time and I would, as a business leader, like to see politicians on both sides of the fence get on and negotiate a practical deal that works for business."" May vows to see Brexit through Pound and UK shares hit by Brexit turmoil BBC correspondents on the draft deal Like many other engineering firms, Rolls-Royce has supply chains that rely on smooth ""just-in-time"" delivery of thousands of parts from across the Channel. Earlier this yearMr East called for ""as little change as possible"" from Brexit to minimise the impact on business. He said the firm would stockpile parts to protect against the risk of a no-deal Brexit that might interrupt the movement of supplies across borders. He said Rolls-Royce would continue to pursue those contingency plans to ensure it could keep operating after 29 March. Rolls-Royce chief executive Warren East says any deal is better than a no-deal Brexit Other business leaders have stepped forward to back Mrs May's draft Brexit plan following a conference call between executives and the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, on Wednesday aimed at rallying support within the business community. But the pound came under pressure on Thursday as investors worried that Mrs May would not get the backing of parliament and that the stability of her government was at stake after a string of ministerial resignations. In Friday trading in Asia the pound was slightly higher against the dollar at about $1.28. Uncertainty around whether the draft deal will pass through parliament, whether the UK will fail to reach a deal at all, or whether further political upheaval will result in a general election, has left executives with no choice but to prepare for a range of scenarios. BMW welcomed the draft document as a ""positive step in the right direction"" but also confirmed the carmaker would continue to prepare for ""the worst-case scenario, which is what a no-deal Brexit would represent"". Mrs May's proposed deal would mean the UK would maintain roughly the same trading relationship with the EU until at least the end of 2020, while a more permanent arrangement is negotiated. That prospect is attractive to businesses eager to maintain trade without increased friction from border checks or tariffs. ""Most business people ultimately are pragmatists and this is about playing the cards we have been dealt rather than wishing for a better hand,"" Sir Roger Carr, chairman of BAE Systems, told the BBC. However, Justin King, the former Sainsbury's chief executive who is now vice-chairman of private equity firm Terra Firma, argued it was not necessarily a binary decision. ""We've been presented with an entirely false choice: it's not a choice between this deal or no deal and crashing out of Europe. There's plenty of choice,"" he told Today. ""Business people are pragmatists, but they're also not fatalists. I think when you see that something is not going to be a good outcome, then you have to keep fighting for an alternative."" Mr King was one of some 70 business leaders who have called for apublic vote on the UK's Brexit deal. Meanwhile, the head of the Co-Operative Group has warned that availability of fresh food from both the UK and abroad could be hit by a no-deal Brexit. Steve Murrells told BBC Radio 5 live that stockpiling was not an option as ""there is not enough chilled capacity to do it"". The group, which also supplies chains such as Costcutter, would consider air freight or changing ports to to ""keep the supply chain going as best as we can"". Mr Murrells also feared a lack of workers could affect supplies: ""Farming relies on migrant labour and if the wrong outcome prevails there is going to be a real shortage of people to pick the crops.""

"Kate McClure (left) and partner Mark D'Amico (not pictured) are accused of conspiring with homeless man Johnny Bobbitt to take advantage of donors' good will The US protagonists in a viral fundraising campaign for a homeless man have been charged with theft by deception and conspiracy. Kate McClure and Mark D'Amico raised more than $400,000 (Â£313,000) for homeless ex-marine Johnny Bobbitt. But in August, Mr Bobbitt launched legal action against the couple, claiming he did not get his fair share. Now, prosecutors in New Jersey say Mr Bobbitt was complicit in the alleged plot. All three face the same charges. A lawyer for Mr D'Amico, 39 and Ms McClure, 28, declined to comment, according to US media. At Thursday's press conference, Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina said the story ""that drove this fundraiser might seem too good to be true. Unfortunately, it was"". ""The entire campaign was predicated on a lie,"" he added. The prosecutors believe the campaign was concocted a month before it was launched. The campaign text had said that Mr Bobbitt had used ""his last $20"" to help Ms McClure when her car broke down in 2017. Mr Bobbitt remains in custody, and the couple were released pending a court date on 24 December. The three face potential sentences of five to 10 years for the second-degree crimes.

Mr Bobbitt and the couple first came to prominence in November 2017 when Ms McClure launched a crowdfunding GoFundMe campaign, which, they said, was to re-pay the debt of a homeless man who came to her aid at the side of a road. A photograph of Ms McClure and Mr Bobbitt, a veteran and drug addict who had lived on the streets for several years, standing on the side of the road, fronted the fundraising campaign. More than 14,000 people donated, many inspired by the story's details, such as Mr Bobbitt instructing Ms McClure to lock her car doors before he returned with a can of petrol. Officials said on Thursday they believe the photo was staged after the three met previously when Ms McClure and Mr D'Amico visited a casino near an underpass where Mr Bobbitt spent time. Kate McClure, Mark D'Amico, Johnny Bobbitt The relationship between the three soured in August when Mr Bobbitt brought legal action against the couple, alleging they were using the funds as their personal ""piggy bank"" to fund an extravagant lifestyle. US homeless man sues couple over $400,000 fundraiser money After exceeding their original fundraising goal of $10,000, they bought clothing and a new camper van for Mr Bobbitt, but later reportedly asked him to remove it from outside their property. Ms McClure and Mr D'Amico told their online supporters the money would go to two financial trusts for Mr Bobbitt, as well as a lawyer and a financial adviser to help him manage all the money. ""Every dollar he ever touched was used for drugs,"" Mr D'Amico told NBC in a nationally televised interview in August. Life at an open-air drug camp in Philadelphia Investigators claimed the three originally made up the story to make people feel bad and compel donors to contribute to a cause. Net proceeds for Ms McClure and Mr D'Amico amounted to more than $367,000 (Â£287,000) and were spent on a car, holidays, high-end handbags and casino gambling, Mr Coffina said. The prosecutor said that Mr Bobbitt received about $75,000 (Â£58,000). In thousands of text messages read by police, the couple had discussed financial woes, inability to pay bills and debts, and Mr D'Amico said he hoped to raise more money by pursuing a book deal about the story. Expressing sympathy for Mr Bobbitt's homelessness, the prosecutor nonetheless accused the veteran of being ""fully complicit"" in the campaign, promoting it in several media appearances and appearing in the original photograph. Mr Bobbitt posted a similar story on Facebook in 2012 about helping a woman who had run out of petrol, officials say, but that ""full responsibility"" should be ascribed to all three. In a statement to CNN, a spokesman for the crowdfunding site Go Fund Me confirmed donors who contributed to the campaign would receive a refund.

"GPs and patients frustrated by a shortage of the new flu vaccine for over-65s are being told the final delivery batch will arrive by Saturday. NHS England said there would be enough vaccines for everyone to be protected ahead of winter. But doctors' leaders said more guidance should have been given to GPs and patients to avoid disruption over the phased delivery of supplies. Older adults are advised to get the flu jab by early December. This gives time for protection before flu starts to circulate, normally later in the month. However, the staggered delivery of supplies of the over-65s vaccine from the manufacturer Seqirus to GPs and pharmacies means some older patients have not been able to be vaccinated. In a survey of 650 GPs in Pulse,,externalnearly 70% said there had been a shortage of this flu vaccine at their practice. That meant they could not vaccinate as many elderly patients as they would have liked. Some GPs said they had to cancel appointments while others said it had created staffing problems. But a spokesperson for NHS England said that this week, ""100% of vaccines will have been delivered by the manufacturer to those surgeries and pharmacists who placed an order on time"". ""So the public can be assured that there is sufficient supply of the vaccine in stock for everyone to get protected ahead of winter."" The new vaccine is the best way of protecting older adults against flu strains Dr Richard Vautrey, chairman of the GP committee at the British Medical Association (BMA), said it had not been an easy time for GPs. ""As practices begin planning for next year, NHS England must learn lessons from the disruption seen in the past weeks. ""Adequate notice and guidance to all practices must be given well in advance of the ordering period, to allow both practices and manufacturers to ensure there are no further supply problems for next year. ""Improving information for the public would also be beneficial,"" he said. Public Health England said theadjuvanted flu vaccine,which is designed to help the immune systems of older people fight off flu, was worth having. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at PHE, said: ""We encourage all older adults to get an appointment with their GP or pharmacist by early December before flu typically starts to circulate later in the month. ""However, it's always worth getting vaccinated even if it's later in winter - it's the best defence we have against an unpredictable virus."" The new flu vaccine is also available to over-65s in Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, it is only available to the over-75s.

"A UK university had to be given an emergency loan of almost Â£1m by the higher education watchdog to stay afloat this autumn. It's been discovered that the Office for Students provided the bailout when the university faced the prospect of running out of cash and being unable to pay its bills. The money has been repaid - and the regulator says the university, a small, modern institution, is now financially stable. But it highlights the fragility of university finances, which are now in a ""marketplace"" and vulnerable to fluctuations in recruitment and tuition fee income. The discovery of this payment is also embarrassing for the Office for Students (OFS), which recently sent out a tough message that there would be no bailouts for universities in financial difficulty. Sir Michael Barber, who chairs the regulator, told a conference a couple of weeks ago that it was wrong for university leaders to think the OFS would would help them if they were in ""financial trouble"" because of a lack of student numbers or overspending on buildings. ""This is wrong. The OFS will not bail out providers in financial difficulty,"" Sir Michael said. The watchdog says the bailout it did provide, made to the university in September and understood to be about Â£900,000, was under the rules of its predecessor organisation, the Higher Education Funding Council for England, under transition arrangements. It followed a cash problem faced by the university over the summer. But a spokesman for the OFS said that under its own new rules, now in place, such financial support would no longer be permissible. Would a university really be allowed to go bust? Review is considering cutting fees to Â£6,500 Is the tuition fees 'illusion' about to unravel? The debate about bailouts followed reports from Richard Vaughan in the I newspaper thatthree universities were on the ""brink of bankruptcy"",external. It raised the question of whether universities, in what has been designed as a competitive marketplace, should be allowed to go bust and close down. That the watchdog was ready to act behind the scenes shows how difficult it would be to really allow a university to go under. It would mean huge disruption for students and would mean the loss of what are often among the biggest local employers and drivers of local economies. It could also put the watchdog and universities minister into a very compromised position if they let a university collapse. They would be asked how they allowed people to apply to a university they knew to be at financial risk. If students are getting into Â£50,000 of debt from a degree course, the Office for Students, acting in the consumer interest, would be expected to warn students not to step aboard a university that was not financially watertight. But if they, or university ministers, did warn that a university was in financial trouble, it would be likely to destroy the student numbers on which universities rely for their income - making it even harder for a university to dig itself out of danger. The OFS says that its new provisions will make the university sector more financially robust. As a condition of registering with the OFS, the regulator will have to be confident that universities are financially secure for at least the next three years. A spokesman for the OFS said the institution to which it lent money could now pass this financial test and show it was ""not at material risk of insolvency for the next three years"". ""Over the summer, we provided a short-term liquidity loan to the university, which was quickly repaid in full and repaid before registration,"" the OFS spokesman said. He said it was paid under ""inherited legal responsibilities which will cease to apply at the end of this transition year in July 2019"". ""We have been very clear that we would not bail out any university. But we have also said that where a university is in trouble, we would first ensure that they have a strong student protection plan and secondly we would act according to the circumstances. ""This could for example involve requiring them to carry out a strategic options review to identify future options including restructuring their business model, sale of property or mergers."" It will also raise questions for the current review of university funding in England. There have been suggestions that the headline figure for tuition fees could be reduced to Â£6,500 from Â£9,250. Although this would mean less cash going directly to universities, it would mean that more of university budgets could be distributed centrally, making them less vulnerable to annual changes in student numbers. Would a university really be allowed to go bust? Tuition fees cut to Â£6,500? Are students overpaying for tuition fees? Is the tuition fees 'illusion' about to unravel?

More than two years since the vote to leave the European Union we do know the kind of relationship that the country could build with the rest of the continent after Brexit. We do know the prime minister has every intention of staying on to push it through. But we don't know whether it's politically possible, whether it could get through Parliament. Live: May defends Bexit deal May: I am going to see this through We don't know who the person in charge of the process will be - the Brexit secretary. And, most glaringly, we actually don't know if the prime minister will still be in place to try to push her deal through. The government, for today at least, is at the mercy of events not in control. Her vow to stay on tonight does not make her deep, deep problems disappear. With her party in revolt, her colleagues departing - some determined to usher her out of office - we can't, and don't know yet, if Brexit can happen as planned, perhaps, if at all. This could be a gale that's weathered in a few days, or a serious storm that sweeps the government away. But while the prime minister's future is so uncertain, so is all of ours.

"Properties are taking longer to sell than a year ago, analysis suggests, at an average of more than three months in urban areas of the UK. Homes in cities and major towns were on the market for 102 days on average before being sold or put under offer. This was six days longer than in 2017, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR). Selling periods ranged from an average of 39 days in Edinburgh to 131 days in Blackpool. Completion of the deal may take a lot longer than this, owing to legal requirements and the practicalities of moving dates. Where does rent hit young people the hardest in Britain? The people with more stuff than they have room for The research for Post Office Money found that properties in Glasgow also sold quickly, at an average 48 days. Belfast and Swansea recorded the biggest fall in the time properties spent on the market - at 17 and 14 days less respectively than last year. In contrast, properties in Bristol and Luton were taking 10 and 14 days longer respectively to sell than last year. Homes in London, where the market has slowed considerably recently, took an average of 126 days to sell. The report suggested affordability constraints had hit demand in these areas, leading to longer selling times. This interactive content requires an internet connection and a modern browser.

"EE and Virgin Media have been fined Â£13.3m by Ofcom for leaving customers who quit broadband and phone contracts early ""out of pocket"". The regulator said about 400,000 EE customers who ended their contracts early were over-billed and paid up to Â£4.3m too much as a result. Ofcom said about 82,000 Virgin customers were overcharged by almost Â£2.8m. Virgin said it would appeal. Margot James, Digital Minister, said companies need ""to play by the rules"". Gaucho Rasmussen, director of investigations and enforcement at Ofcom, said: ""EE and Virgin Media broke our rules by overcharging people who ended their contracts early. Those people were left out pocket and the charges amounted to millions of pounds."" The fine for Virgin Media was Â£7m, Ofcom said, with an additional Â£25,000 for providing incomplete information to the regulator. Ofcom found that Virgin Media had levied early-exit charges that were higher than customers had agreed to when signing up to their residential contracts. The regulator said this went on for almost a year. However, Virgin Media said it ""strongly disagrees"" with Ofcom's decision and would appeal to the Competition Appeal Tribunal. ""This decision and fine is not justified, proportionate or reasonable. A small percentage of customers were charged an incorrect amount when they ended one or more of their services early and for that we are very sorry,"" said Tom Mockridge, chief executive of Virgin Media. Virgin Media said it had mistakenly overcharged 1.5% of its 5.5 million cable customers between September 2016 and August 2017. The company has reimbursed or made charity donations covering 99.8% of its overcharging. This video can not be played Virgin Media customer John Jones John Jones, from Hatfield in Hertfordshire, a Virgin Media customer for seven years, arranged to terminate his account when he moved house and the firm said it did not service his new address. Virgin told him he would have to pay a ""breaking contract charge"" of Â£240. ""That was in spite of the fact that I had been a customer of theirs for seven years, wanted to continue using their services, but could not do only because they did not service my new address,"" he says. His attempts to get Virgin to remove the charge were unsuccessful and he agreed to pay as he did not want his credit rating to be affected. The charge was due to be taken in January last year by direct debit, but Virgin did not take it until the 16 February. But on 9 February, Virgin Media made a so called ""derogatory report"" to credit  reference agencies saying John had let his account fall into arrears. John says this had ""a devastating effect"" on his credit rating. His rating with Equifax fell from excellent to fair, whilst his rating with Experian dropped from excellent to poor. ""It took me 10 phone calls and emails over a period of 29 days to get Virgin Media's credit control section to agree to correct their error with the Credit Reference Agencies. ""Although they have recovered since, my credit ratings have yet to get back to the levels they were before this event happened,"" he says. EE apologised to customers after it was fined Â£6.3m following Ofcom's discovery that over a six-year period the firm did not set out the charges its mobile customers would have to pay if they left their contracts early. Ofcom said that up to 15 million EE customers faced being over-billed by up to Â£13.5m as the company had miscalculated early-exit charges. However, not all affected customers had paid these excessive charges as EE had subsequently waived some of them, leaving Â£4.3m in excessive charges. A spokesperson for EE said: ""We've already refunded customers and changed the way we calculate early termination charges, and we will continue to focus on ensuring our policies are clear and fair for all customers."" However, Ofcom said that Â£1.6m of the Â£4.3m of the overcharged fees had not been repaid as EE did not have records covering the whole period. Customers who feel they may have been overcharged should contact EE. Digital Minister Margot James said: ""We've strengthened Ofcom's powers to better protect consumers and these fines show the issue is being taken very seriously and strong action will be taken. ""Companies need to play by the rules and treat their customers fairly and honestly,"" the minister said. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ""Anyone who has been affected by this deserves a refund. ""This is another in a long line of failings in the mobile and broadband industry - we need an independent consumer champion to stick up for customers and stop this from happening."" Ofcom said the behaviour of both companies made customers less likely to switch provider, which was against its rules.

"Dean and Amy Coombes have been in temporary accommodation since June A family of six has been moved by their local authority 13 times since becoming homeless four months ago. Dean and Amy Coombes were evicted from their house in St Austell, Cornwall, on 29 June, along with their four children aged under eight. Since then they have been placed in caravans on campsites, holiday cottages, a hotel and a room above a pub, in different parts of the county. Mr Coombes said the experience felt like being ""strangled"". Cornwall Council said it was supporting the family but ""unfortunately there is a high demand for temporary accommodation, which includes our own housing stock, properties that we rent, or other accommodation"". The latest figures reveal61,190 households with children,externalin England are in temporary accommodation, with110 in Cornwall,external. Mr Coombes said they had been told three times a property had been found for them, only to have the offer withdrawn soon afterwards. Mr and Mrs Coombes were evicted after being given eight weeks' notice by their landlord, who wanted his property back. They are now waiting for a house they have been told will become available in Truro, but fear they will be let down, having had the moving date pushed back three times. ""They say 'we'll give you a house' and then the next day they say 'no we won't',"" Mr Coombes said. ""It feels like we are being strangled. Your hopes are up, and then you are shot down again."" ""We have run out of enthusiasm"", added Mrs Coombes. ""We feel deflated - you want to throw the towel in. You want to give up but know you can't. ""The kids are the reason we haven't given up."" The children have been moved to a new school The family has belongings in storage, a dog in kennels and a cat in a cattery. On occasions they have been told to move out of their property without knowing where they are going to spend that night. ""We left one place in the morning, packed the car with all our bags, drove to St Austell and just waited in the car with the children. Then they rung us up and said we were booked back into the same campsite we had just left,"" Mr Coombes said. Three of the children have moved to a new school 10 miles from their current residence, a holiday cottage in a rural location near Falmouth. Because of a poor internet connection they have been unable to easily check the school website, meaning they arrived at school one day unaware it was a non-uniform day. ""All the other children were in fancy dress and ours were the odd ones out,"" Mr Coombes said. ""We don't want much - just a bit of stability and normality for the kids. ""The kids are asking all of the time - they are confused and have been dragged from pillar to post. We feel guilty they are going through this. ""I don't want an extravagant house. I just want a place that is suitable for my family, kids and our dog. I'm not asking for five acres of land and a swimming pool."" Homeless man sets up home in parking space Footballer's B&B help for homeless man 'I've been left to live in a shed' Mrs Coombes said: ""It feels like forever. We are sick to death of being optimistic. We've been let down too many times. We have no enthusiasm anymore."" The family said they had bid for every suitable property that has come up on the council's Homechoice scheme in various parts of Cornwall. At one stage they even considered moving to Sunderland - more than 400 miles away - simply because they had heard housing may be available there, but said they eventually decided against it after researching the area. In a statement, Cornwall Council said it sympathised with the family, adding: ""Unfortunately accommodation can be difficult to arrange, especially for larger families who have pets. We review the availability of accommodation on a weekly basis and will move families to a more suitable place if appropriate. ""There is a plan for the family to move in to a privately rented home, however, like any other move where more than one family is concerned, we have to wait for the current tenants to move out before this family can move in."" Polly Neate, CEO at housing charity Shelter, said: ""Hit by budget cuts and a lack of affordable homes, overstretched councils are struggling to keep homeless families within local communities. â¯""To put an end to this, the government needs to ramp up efforts to build more social housing to give families the chance of a decent and permanent home.""â¯ Why did the council 'house' me in a tent?

"GPs and patients frustrated by a shortage of the new flu vaccine for over-65s are being told the final delivery batch will arrive by Saturday. NHS England said there would be enough vaccines for everyone to be protected ahead of winter. But doctors' leaders said more guidance should have been given to GPs and patients to avoid disruption over the phased delivery of supplies. Older adults are advised to get the flu jab by early December. This gives time for protection before flu starts to circulate, normally later in the month. However, the staggered delivery of supplies of the over-65s vaccine from the manufacturer Seqirus to GPs and pharmacies means some older patients have not been able to be vaccinated. In a survey of 650 GPs in Pulse,,externalnearly 70% said there had been a shortage of this flu vaccine at their practice. That meant they could not vaccinate as many elderly patients as they would have liked. Some GPs said they had to cancel appointments while others said it had created staffing problems. But a spokesperson for NHS England said that this week, ""100% of vaccines will have been delivered by the manufacturer to those surgeries and pharmacists who placed an order on time"". ""So the public can be assured that there is sufficient supply of the vaccine in stock for everyone to get protected ahead of winter."" The new vaccine is the best way of protecting older adults against flu strains Dr Richard Vautrey, chairman of the GP committee at the British Medical Association (BMA), said it had not been an easy time for GPs. ""As practices begin planning for next year, NHS England must learn lessons from the disruption seen in the past weeks. ""Adequate notice and guidance to all practices must be given well in advance of the ordering period, to allow both practices and manufacturers to ensure there are no further supply problems for next year. ""Improving information for the public would also be beneficial,"" he said. Public Health England said theadjuvanted flu vaccine,which is designed to help the immune systems of older people fight off flu, was worth having. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at PHE, said: ""We encourage all older adults to get an appointment with their GP or pharmacist by early December before flu typically starts to circulate later in the month. ""However, it's always worth getting vaccinated even if it's later in winter - it's the best defence we have against an unpredictable virus."" The new flu vaccine is also available to over-65s in Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, it is only available to the over-75s.

"Jim Anderson now age 72 holds the bottle he found decades ago A diver who discovered a 150-year-old bottle of Tennent's off the coast of Australia has brought the stout back to Scotland. Jim Anderson sent the artefact back to the Glasgow brewery after finding it on a shipwreck in the 1970s. The bottle was on board The Light of The Age when its drunken captain caused the clipper to sink near Melbourne on 16 January 1868. It is thought to be the oldest bottle of beer in Scotland. Recalling the discovery, 72-year-old Mr Anderson said: ""I could see the inscription Wellpark Brewery on it, and I set about finding where that was. ""I found out it was in Glasgow, and I contacted Tennent's to see if they were interested in the bottle, which they were, and I was delighted. ""Now people can look at it, and think about the connection between Australia and Scotland, too. It's very special."" The artefact is carefully handled before going on display The Light of The Age was carrying 42 people on a voyage from Liverpool, with a cargo of salt, slates, pipes, preserves and liquors including stout from Wellpark. The Scottish brewery had well-established agents in Liverpool and Australia, and regular shipments from Glasgow via Liverpool were common. However the captain, who was found to be drunk by a marine board investigation, took the ship off course and ran it aground. The bottle top from the stout eroded after years under water The ship sank outside Port Phillip Heads near Melbourne - but the bottle of Tennent's survived. A member of the Geelong Skindivers Club, Mr Anderson discovered the bottle before Australian laws changed to protect wreck sites. He added: ""It took a bit of clearance to get it to Glasgow because artefacts are protected in Australia and we need special authorisation for things like this to leave the country. ""I sought all that, and it's amazing to see it back where it started, 150 years later, metres from where it started its journey."" Jim Anderson is a member of the Geelong Skindivers Club The stout and its story will be put on display at the brewery'snew visitor centre opening on 22 November. Tennent's have also developed a commemorative edition of the stout after brewers researched the firm's old recipes. Tennent's have developed a commemorative brew to celebrate the bottle's return Alan McGarrie, group brand director for Tennent's said: ""Pre-dating Tennent's Lager, which was first brewed in 1885, the stout is one of the oldest bottles of beer in Britain, returned to Wellpark by the diver who found it. ""Unlike the drunken captain who ran his ship aground close to Port Phillip Heads, Jim has ensured his historic cargo reached its final destination - by flying round the world to put it in place himself.""

"This video can not be played Drone footage shows complete devastation in the Californian town of Paradise The number of people missing in northern California's devastating wildfire has leapt to more than 600, and seven more bodies have been found, according to local authorities. The missing persons' list has doubled since earlier on Thursday. The Camp Fire, the state's deadliest and most destructive blaze, has killed at least 63 people. Nearly 12,000 buildings have been destroyed. Three more people have also died in the Woolsey Fire, further south. Wildfire survivors: 'We swam to safety' Is Trump right about California wildfires? Before and after snapshots President Donald Trump will travel to California on Saturday to survey the damage and meet those affected. About 9,400 firefighters are currently battling wildfires across the state. The Camp Fire - which broke out eight days ago - swept through a swathe of the north at high speed, leaving residents little time to escape. The official list more than doubled from 300 to 631 on Thursday. At a news briefing, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said this was because investigators had thoroughly cross-checked their information, including emergency calls made since the Camp Fire started on 8 November. ""I want you to understand that the chaos we were dealing with was extraordinary,"" Mr Honea said. He stressed that the number of the missing would most likely fluctuate. ""If you look at that list and see your name, or the name of a friend or loved one, please call to let us know,"" Mr Honea appealed to the public. The California Fire Department says it has now contained about 40% of the Camp Fire blaze. ""We continue to engage in the fire fight. We continue to keep our eye on the ball,"" chief fire department official Ken Pimlott said. Officials say they do not expect to fully contain the blaze - which has razed 145,000 acres (56,600 ha) - until the end of the month. They are also battling several other fires. The Woolsey Fire in Ventura County near Los Angeles covers nearly 100,000 acres and is 62% contained. The smaller Hill Fire, also in Ventura County, covers 4,530 acres and is 99% contained. The Morgan Fire in Contra Costa County, near San Francisco, covers 20 acres and is 60% contained. Before and after snapshots Is it advisable to escape a wildfire by car? Red carpets cancelled after wildfires The worst-hit area is the town of Paradise, with officials saying it will need a ""total rebuild"" job that will take several years. The town of Paradise was gutted by the blaze Brock Long, administrator of Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), said the damage to Paradise was ""one of the worst disasters"" he had ever seen.

Watch: Long battle against California wildfires Watch: Why California wildfires are so deadly Officials have warned the search operation could take weeks. Officials have not yet confirmed what started any of the blazes, as investigations are continuing. Several people have already filed a lawsuit against a local power company, alleging that the Camp Fire started when a high-voltage transmission line failed. Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn - but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. Low humidity, warm winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. Have you been affected by the wildfires? If it is safe to do so please get in touch.

"There are now discrepancies between copies of the kilogram and the master version held in a French vault Scientists have changed the way the kilogram is defined. Currently, it is defined by the weight of a platinum-based ingot called ""Le Grand K"" which is locked away in a safe in Paris. On Friday, researchers meeting in Versailles voted to get rid of it in favour of defining a kilogram in terms of an electric current. The decision was made at theGeneral Conference on Weights and Measures,external. But some scientists, such as Perdi Williams at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK, have expressed mixed feelings about the change. ""I haven't been on this project for too long but I feel a weird attachment to the kilogram,"" she said. ""I think it is such an exciting thing and this is a really big moment. So I'm a little bit sad about [the change]. But it is an important step forward and so the new system is going to work a lot better. It is also a really exciting time, and I can't wait for it to happen."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Le Grand K has been at the forefront of the international system of measuring weights since 1889. Several close replicas were made and distributed around the globe. But the master kilogram and its copies were seen to change - ever so slightly - as they deteriorated. In a world where accurate measurement is now critical in many areas, such as in drug development, nanotechnology and precision engineering - those responsible for maintaining the international system had no option but to move beyond Le Grand K to a more robust definition. The change was approved at the General Conference on Weights and Measures The fluctuation is about 50 parts in a billion, less than the weight of a single eyelash. But although it is tiny, the change can have important consequences. Coming in is an electrical measurement which Dr Stuart Davidson, head of mass metrology at NPL, says is more stable, more accurate and more egalitarian. ""We know from comparing the kilogram in Paris with all the copies of the kilogram that are all around the world that there are discrepancies between them and Le Grand K itself,"" he said. ""This is not acceptable from a scientific point of view. So even though Le Grand K is fit for purpose at the moment, it won't be in 100 years' time."" Electromagnets generate a force. Scrap-yards use them on cranes to lift and move large metal objects, such as old cars. The pull of the electromagnet, the force it exerts, is directly related to the amount of electrical current going through its coils. There is, therefore, a direct relationship between electricity and weight. So, in principle, scientists can define a kilogram, or any other weight, in terms of the amount of electricity needed to counteract the weight (gravitational force acting on a mass). 'Anti-vaxxers' in US chickenpox outbreak Mystery of wombats' cubed poop revealed The remote UK community living off-grid There is a quantity that relates weight to electrical current, called Planck's constant - named after the German physicist Max Planck and denoted by the symbolh. Buthis an incredibly small number and to measure it, the research scientist Dr Bryan Kibble built a super-accurate set of scales. The Kibble balance, as it has become known, has an electromagnet that pulls down on one side of the scales and a weight - say, a kilogram - on the other. The electrical current going through the electromagnet is increased until the two sides are perfectly balanced. By measuring the current running through the electromagnet to incredible precision, the researchers are able to calculatehto an accuracy of 0.000001%. This breakthrough has paved the way for Le Grand K to be deposed by ""die kleineh"". Scientists celebrated the outcome of the vote Every few decades, all the replica kilograms in the world had to be checked against Le Grand K. The new system, now that it's been adopted, will allow anyone with a Kibble balance to check their weights anytime and anywhere, according to NPL's Dr Ian Robinson. ""It feels really good to be at this point. I feel it is the right decision. Once we've done this it will be stable for the foreseeable future,"" he said.

"Informal exclusions are unlawful A dozen schools in England, Northern Ireland and Wales have admitted informally excluding pupils at some stage last year, the BBC has learned. BBC News asked more than 1,000 secondary schools whether they informally excluded children last year, using Freedom of Information requests. And six schools in England, five in Northern Ireland and one in Wales have admitted doing so. A few schools offered reasons for informally excluding children. More than one school said they had taken the measure to defuse or investigate an incident between pupils. One email obtained by BBC News from a school illustrates the lack of choice given to a parent asked to keep their child at home. The email advises their son take two days off ""to calm down"", an act the school says ""may avoid fixed-term exclusions at this stage"". BBC News has also received two reports from within schools of senior leaders regularly sending challenging pupils home immediately after second attendance. One current headmaster, who wished not to be named, said a senior leader in his previous school had regularly asked children to go home after 12:30, the time when the second attendance mark was awarded. Charlie Crittenden, now 21, says he was often informally excluded from school. ""Some days I was getting sent home twice a week. You just feel worthless. You've got no meaning in life,"" says Charlie. He says his time in isolation and frequent informal exclusions left him feeling school was ""pointless"". Charlie says he was often sent home without it being formally recorded He acknowledges he misbehaved at school. ""I did get involved with the naughty kids but I wasn't exactly an absolute demon,"" he says. He says he spent every day of a year in the school's inclusion unit and was frequently unofficially excluded for what he says were ""tiny things"". ""It makes you want to give up more,"" he says. Charlie says he was placed on a two-hour-a-day timetable for the final two months of his last year at the school. ""No-one ever agreed to that,"" he says. ""One day I just came into school and the next day they just told me, 'Now, this is what's happening.' I had no say whatsoever, neither did my mum or dad."" His mother says the school told her that they had ""failed"" Charlie. The school is unable to comment as it has now closed. Government guidance in England,externalsays that ""informal"" or ""unofficial"" exclusions, such as sending a pupil home ""to cool off"", are unlawful, regardless of whether they occur with the agreement of parents or carers. A school's head teacher must inform parents in writing of the reason and length of a fixed-term or permanent exclusion. It adds: ""The threat of exclusion must never be used to influence parents to remove their child."" In 2013, a report by the then Children's Commissioner for England called for head teachers to face disciplinary proceedings when informal exclusions were proven and prosecution when school records were falsified to cover them up. Maggie Atkinson said ""there seems to be a reluctance to act"" despite the damage that could be caused to young people's lives. ""You flip under the radar almost immediately and you can stay there,"" she added. Schools Minister Nick Gibb said evidence of informal exclusions would be taken ""very seriously"". He said it was ""a very small number of people that are engaged in unlawful activity such as informal exclusions."" But he added that he recognised the damage it did to a child. ""It disrupts their education, it opens them up to all kinds of vulnerabilities."" The Welsh government said informal exclusions ""deny learners their right to an education"" and ""do little to address the underlying issues behind challenging behaviour"".

"This video can not be played Drone footage shows complete devastation in the Californian town of Paradise The number of people missing in northern California's devastating wildfire has leapt to more than 600, and seven more bodies have been found, according to local authorities. The missing persons' list has doubled since earlier on Thursday. The Camp Fire, the state's deadliest and most destructive blaze, has killed at least 63 people. Nearly 12,000 buildings have been destroyed. Three more people have also died in the Woolsey Fire, further south. Wildfire survivors: 'We swam to safety' Is Trump right about California wildfires? Before and after snapshots President Donald Trump will travel to California on Saturday to survey the damage and meet those affected. About 9,400 firefighters are currently battling wildfires across the state. The Camp Fire - which broke out eight days ago - swept through a swathe of the north at high speed, leaving residents little time to escape. The official list more than doubled from 300 to 631 on Thursday. At a news briefing, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said this was because investigators had thoroughly cross-checked their information, including emergency calls made since the Camp Fire started on 8 November. ""I want you to understand that the chaos we were dealing with was extraordinary,"" Mr Honea said. He stressed that the number of the missing would most likely fluctuate. ""If you look at that list and see your name, or the name of a friend or loved one, please call to let us know,"" Mr Honea appealed to the public. The California Fire Department says it has now contained about 40% of the Camp Fire blaze. ""We continue to engage in the fire fight. We continue to keep our eye on the ball,"" chief fire department official Ken Pimlott said. Officials say they do not expect to fully contain the blaze - which has razed 145,000 acres (56,600 ha) - until the end of the month. They are also battling several other fires. The Woolsey Fire in Ventura County near Los Angeles covers nearly 100,000 acres and is 62% contained. The smaller Hill Fire, also in Ventura County, covers 4,530 acres and is 99% contained. The Morgan Fire in Contra Costa County, near San Francisco, covers 20 acres and is 60% contained. Before and after snapshots Is it advisable to escape a wildfire by car? Red carpets cancelled after wildfires The worst-hit area is the town of Paradise, with officials saying it will need a ""total rebuild"" job that will take several years. The town of Paradise was gutted by the blaze Brock Long, administrator of Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), said the damage to Paradise was ""one of the worst disasters"" he had ever seen.

Watch: Long battle against California wildfires Watch: Why California wildfires are so deadly Officials have warned the search operation could take weeks. Officials have not yet confirmed what started any of the blazes, as investigations are continuing. Several people have already filed a lawsuit against a local power company, alleging that the Camp Fire started when a high-voltage transmission line failed. Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn - but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. Low humidity, warm winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. Have you been affected by the wildfires? If it is safe to do so please get in touch.

"The pair are already serving life sentences For the first time, two leaders of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia have been convicted of genocide. His deputy Nuon Chea, 92, and head of state Khieu Samphan, 87, faced trial on charges of exterminating Cham Muslim and ethnic Vietnamese communities. This was the first genocide verdict given by the UN-backed tribunal on Pol Pot's brutal 1975-1979 regime. Up to two million people, mostly from the Khmer majority, are believed to have died during those four years. 'I live next to my torturer' But the larger-scale killings of the Cambodian population do not fit the narrow definition of genocide under international law, says BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, and have instead been prosecuted as crimes against humanity. Friday's verdicts will almost certainly be the last from an unusual attempt at transnational justice that has lasted more than a decade, our correspondent adds. The pair were also found guilty of a litany of other crimes, including the crimes against humanity of murder, extermination, enslavement and torture. Khieu Samphan was in court to hear the verdict The two men - already serving life sentences for crimes against humanity from a separate trial - have again been sentenced to life. They are two of only three people ever convicted by the tribunal, which has faced criticism for its slow pace and for being subject to alleged political interference. What is genocide? Judge Nil Nonn read out the lengthy and much-anticipated ruling to a courtroom in Phnom Penh full of people who suffered under the Khmer Rouge. He described the terror of the regime, and spoke of forced marriages where couples were ordered to have children. Victims and their relatives were in the courtroom to see the ruling read out But the landmark moment came when Nuon Chea was found guilty of genocide for the attempt to wipe out Cham Muslims and ethnic Vietnamese Cambodians, and Khieu Samphan was found guilty of genocide against the ethnic Vietnamese. Researchers estimate that 36% of the Cham population of 300,000 died under the Khmer Rouge. Most of the Vietnamese community were deported, and the 20,000 who remained were all killed. More on Cambodia's brutal Khmer Rouge regime When the UN ran a country The Khmer Rouge's crimes have long been referred to as the ""Cambodian genocide"", but academics and journalists have debated for years as to whether what they did amounts to that crime. Cambodia has become known for ""the killing fields"", a reference to the scale of slaughter that took place there The UN Convention on Genocide speaks of ""intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group"". So prosecutors at the tribunal tried to prove that the Khmer Rouge specifically tried to do that to these groups - something some experts, including Pol Pot biographer Philip Short, say they did not. During the trial, a 1978 speech from Pol Pot was cited in which he said that there was ""not one seed"" of Vietnamese to be found in Cambodia. And historians say that indeed a community of a few hundred thousand was reduced to zero by deportations or killings. Apart from being targeted in mass executions, Cham victims have said they were banned from following their religion and forced to eat pork under the regime. The verdict today may not end the debate completely, but victims groups have long waited for this symbol of justice. ""They brought suffering to my relatives"" 72-year-old Cham Muslim Los Sat, who lost many family members, told the AFP news agency at the court. "" I am really satisfied with the sentences."" Led by Saloth Sar, better known as Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge was a radical Maoist movement founded by French-educated intellectuals. Pol Pot (left) had a vision of Cambodia as a classless agrarian utopia They sought to create a self-reliant, agrarian society: cities were emptied and residents forced to work on rural co-operatives. Many were worked to death while others starved as the economy imploded. During the four violent years they were in power from 1975 to 1979, the Khmer Rouge tortured and killed all those perceived to be enemies - intellectuals, minorities, former government officials - and their families. The scale and brutality of the killings - many of them meticulously documented by officials - means the regime remains one of the bloodiest of the 20th Century. The regime was defeated in a Vietnamese invasion in 1979. Pol Pot fled and remained free until 1997 - he died under house arrest a year later. This could be the final decision of the tribunal, officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC). Established in 2006 with both Cambodian and international judges, it has so far only convicted three people for the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge regime at a cost of $300m (Â£232m). This video can not be played I survived Khmer Rouge torture prison In 2010 it convicted Kaing Guek Eav, also known as Duch, who was in charge of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture centre and prison in Phnom Penh. He is serving a life sentence. Former Khmer Rouge foreign minister Ieng Sary was a co-defendant with Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea but died before judges delivered a verdict in the first of the two sub-trials in 2014. His wife Ieng Thirith, the regime's social affairs minister and the fourth co-defendant, was ruled mentally unfit to stand trial and died in 2015. Hun Sen: Cambodia's strongman prime minister How two men survived a prison where 12,000 died Although there are cases against four other Khmer Rouge members, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has been vocal about his opposition to the tribunal starting any new trials and there is little chance this will happen. A former mid-level member of the Khmer Rouge regime himself, he says his people want to move on and that further prosecutions could lead to violence. The Khmer Rouge waged an insurgency after they were toppled from power, although thousands defected to the government in the 1990s before the group disbanded completely in 1999. There are parts of the country where victims and perpetrators live side by side in villages. But many Cambodians pay little attention to the tribunal, and young people in particular are keen for their country to be known for something other than the ""Killing Fields"".

"Investigators examine one of the engines from the doomed Lion Air flight JT 610 The family of a passenger killed when a Lion Air flight crashed into the sea near Indonesia are suing Boeing over an alleged fault with the jet's design. The lawsuit accuses the US aircraft manufacturer of failing to inform pilots and airlines of a feature with its new 737 Max plane system that could ""push the nose down unexpectedly"". Investigators have been looking into reported technical issues. Boeing maintains that it is ""confident in the safety of the 737 Max"". Lion Air flight JT 610 was carrying 189 people when it crashed on 29 October. It plummeted into the Java Sea following a request from the pilot for permission to turn back to the airport just moments after taking off from Jakarta. It was later established that the aircraft had had an airspeed indicator problem on its final four flights. Victim's fiancÃ©e takes wedding photos alone Lion Air crash: Images of the unfolding tragedy Social media identifies crash couple On Thursday, a complaint was filed by a Florida-based law firm on behalf of the parents of Rio Nanda Pratama, who was on board the ill-fated flight JT 610. The lawsuit focuses on the 737 Max's new automated flight control system,external, which it says was designed to help prevent pilots from raising the aircraft's nose ""dangerously high"". However, the lawsuit adds: ""Under certain conditions [the system] can push the nose down unexpectedly and so strongly that the pilot cannot pull it back up in time to avoid a crash. ""This automated feature can be triggered even if pilots are manually flying the aircraft and don't expect flight-control computers to kick in. ""It is particularly surprising to hear from safety experts and the heads of pilots' unions that Boeing failed to warn its customers and the pilots of its new 737 Max aircraft about this significant change in the flight-control systems."" Boeing, meanwhile, has said that it is not able to ""discuss specifics of an ongoing investigation"". The relatives of victims devastated by the loss of loved ones have demanded answers Mr Pratama was a passenger on flight JT 610 travelling home to marry his fiancÃ©e, Intan Syari. Ms Syari, who said she wanted to fulfil his last wish, appeared alonewearing her white gown and wedding ring in photos posted to her Instagram account earlier this week. There is as yet no indication of what caused the crash but the plane had experienced technical problems related to airspeed and altitude readings. Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee said an ""angle-of-attack"" sensor had been changed the day before the crash. One of the black box recorders from the flight has been retrieved but authorities say it could take months to analyse the data from it. The plane was making a one-hour journey to the western city of Pangkal Pinang when it went down. No survivors were found.

"Dean and Amy Coombes have been in temporary accommodation since June A family of six has been moved by their local authority 13 times since becoming homeless four months ago. Dean and Amy Coombes were evicted from their house in St Austell, Cornwall, on 29 June, along with their four children aged under eight. Since then they have been placed in caravans on campsites, holiday cottages, a hotel and a room above a pub, in different parts of the county. Mr Coombes said the experience felt like being ""strangled"". Cornwall Council said it was supporting the family but ""unfortunately there is a high demand for temporary accommodation, which includes our own housing stock, properties that we rent, or other accommodation"". The latest figures reveal61,190 households with children,externalin England are in temporary accommodation, with110 in Cornwall,external. Mr Coombes said they had been told three times a property had been found for them, only to have the offer withdrawn soon afterwards. Mr and Mrs Coombes were evicted after being given eight weeks' notice by their landlord, who wanted his property back. They are now waiting for a house they have been told will become available in Truro, but fear they will be let down, having had the moving date pushed back three times. ""They say 'we'll give you a house' and then the next day they say 'no we won't',"" Mr Coombes said. ""It feels like we are being strangled. Your hopes are up, and then you are shot down again."" ""We have run out of enthusiasm"", added Mrs Coombes. ""We feel deflated - you want to throw the towel in. You want to give up but know you can't. ""The kids are the reason we haven't given up."" The children have been moved to a new school The family has belongings in storage, a dog in kennels and a cat in a cattery. On occasions they have been told to move out of their property without knowing where they are going to spend that night. ""We left one place in the morning, packed the car with all our bags, drove to St Austell and just waited in the car with the children. Then they rung us up and said we were booked back into the same campsite we had just left,"" Mr Coombes said. Three of the children have moved to a new school 10 miles from their current residence, a holiday cottage in a rural location near Falmouth. Because of a poor internet connection they have been unable to easily check the school website, meaning they arrived at school one day unaware it was a non-uniform day. ""All the other children were in fancy dress and ours were the odd ones out,"" Mr Coombes said. ""We don't want much - just a bit of stability and normality for the kids. ""The kids are asking all of the time - they are confused and have been dragged from pillar to post. We feel guilty they are going through this. ""I don't want an extravagant house. I just want a place that is suitable for my family, kids and our dog. I'm not asking for five acres of land and a swimming pool."" Homeless man sets up home in parking space Footballer's B&B help for homeless man 'I've been left to live in a shed' Mrs Coombes said: ""It feels like forever. We are sick to death of being optimistic. We've been let down too many times. We have no enthusiasm anymore."" The family said they had bid for every suitable property that has come up on the council's Homechoice scheme in various parts of Cornwall. At one stage they even considered moving to Sunderland - more than 400 miles away - simply because they had heard housing may be available there, but said they eventually decided against it after researching the area. In a statement, Cornwall Council said it sympathised with the family, adding: ""Unfortunately accommodation can be difficult to arrange, especially for larger families who have pets. We review the availability of accommodation on a weekly basis and will move families to a more suitable place if appropriate. ""There is a plan for the family to move in to a privately rented home, however, like any other move where more than one family is concerned, we have to wait for the current tenants to move out before this family can move in."" Polly Neate, CEO at housing charity Shelter, said: ""Hit by budget cuts and a lack of affordable homes, overstretched councils are struggling to keep homeless families within local communities. â¯""To put an end to this, the government needs to ramp up efforts to build more social housing to give families the chance of a decent and permanent home.""â¯ Why did the council 'house' me in a tent?

The family of a mother-of-four who vanished 15 years ago said they have to accept she has died - despite no body ever being found. Sandra Gant was 48 when she was last seen leaving an address in Hayes Road, Clacton, Essex, on 15 November 2003. Four people were arrested on suspicion of murder but no-one has been charged in connection with her disappearance. Her daughter, Carrie Mead, said she had ""to make my mind believe that she died, like people do"". She said her mum's life had gone ""downhill"" following her 1994 divorce and she had had alcohol problems. Mrs Mead, 40, who still lives in Essex, said she would see her mother at least once a week in a ""kind of supporting role... rather than just a daughter"". Sandra Gant had three grandchildren when she disappeared, including Kyhia, who is now 20 Ms Gant was last seen by her family the day before she disappeared, after she and two friends went for a drink at a house with a man they had just met. Her youngest daughter Lauren Redpath, said: ""I don't believe that my mum would be on this Earth and be away from us for even a week, let alone years. ""We never didn't know where she was. She was just that type of person who kept us informed of where she was living because with her lifestyle with being a drinker she knew we worried about her."" Sandra Gant with her youngest daughter Lauren Ms Gant was reported missing on 21 November by Mrs Mead, who had gone to see her at her home. Mrs Mead, a full-time carer, said: ""I know my mum is not here. I have to put in my mind she has passed away. I have to make my mind believe that she died, like people do. You kind of think about all the ins and outs of it, and she didn't die like everybody else dies. ""Even though my mum might have had a difficult life towards the end it doesn't mean she was less of a mum and doesn't mean we love her any less."" She added she feels the Essex Police officers involved ""did all they could"" to get the answers for the family. Sandra Gant's disappearance sparked a police murder investigation Ms Gant had three grandchildren at the time of her disappearance, but six more have since been born. Mrs Redpath, who lives in Colchester, said they tell the youngsters ""that nanny Sandra is missing and that we can't find her"" but the older grandchildren know more about the circumstances. She added the family ""desperately need to have some kind of closure and finally put it to rest"". ""The worst thing about it is there's never been a body found,"" she said. ""She could be lying anywhere - we don't have a resting place to go to, we don't have a place to go to to get that comfort."" In a statement, Essex Police said they were still investigating, adding that they ""take all opportunities"" to ""provide closure for those families concerned"" in cases like the disappearance of Ms Gant.

"Rooney replaced former Manchester United team-mate Jesse Lingard in the second half Manager Gareth Southgate saw ""a glimpse of the future"" as England celebrated Wayne Rooney's final international appearance with a comfortable friendly win over the United States at Wembley. Southgate gave debuts to three players and they all impressed, with Bournemouth forward Callum Wilson's goal capping an industrious performance up front. Brighton defender Lewis Dunk and Southampton goalkeeper Alex McCarthy, a second-half substitute, were barely tested but both were solid on their first appearances, while Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho played the full game as he won his second cap. Rooney, winning his 120th cap in a fund-raiser for his charitable foundation, made a 33-minute appearance on a night England showed their appreciation for their 33-year-old record goalscorer. But it was the players at the start of their international careers who stole the show, as Southgate fielded England's most inexperienced starting XI in nearly 40 years. The team that began the game had only 94 caps between them coming into the match - the last time England fielded a more inexperienced side was in May 1980 against Australia. ""We wanted to use this game to look at young players,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. ""We had a glimpse of the future, and were able to get Wayne on to show some wonderful touches. ""We had a really inexperienced team out there, so they've come through and learned a lot, and we've paid our respects to one of our greatest ever players. ""Some of our attacking play in the first half-hour in particular was really exciting."" The young side were 2-0 up by the time Rooney was finally introduced - Jesse Lingard opening the scoring with a spectacular curling effort, and Trent Alexander-Arnold adding a low, angled drive for his first international goal. If it was a memorable night for Rooney, who was denied a dream goal by Brad Guzan's stoppage-time save, it was the same for the hard-working Wilson when he produced a near-post finish 13 minutes from time. It set England up nicely for Sunday's Uefa Nations League game with Croatia at Wembley, which takes on great importance after the World Cup finalists'3-2 victory over Spainin Zagreb. If England win they will finish top of Group A4 and qualify for next June's semi-final and final. If they lose, they will be relegated. Kane will break my record, says Rooney after 'special night' 'Rooney feels Wembley's warmth as Sancho sparks squeals' Can you name England's top 10 goalscorers? For all the mixed opinions evoked by the Football Association's decision to give Rooney a sentimental final run-out for his 120th cap, there appeared no doubt in the minds of the Wembley crowd that this was a worthwhile exercise. When the former England captain appeared before kick-off with his four children through a guard of honour formed by both teams to receive a presentation from FA chairman Greg Clarke and Harry Kane, it was the start of a genuine show of affection. And Rooney beamed in appreciation as he warmed up near the touchline when Liverpool youngster Alexander-Arnold - another Merseysider - drilled in his first England goal. The DC United striker was given a standing ovation when the big moment arrived, and he came on for Lingard for that final 33-minute appearance. Rooney, who has excelled in Major League Soccer, looked trim and fit as the crowd cheered his every move, willing him to produce one more special England moment. He almost delivered the dream finale in stoppage time when only the outstretched right arm of Guzan stopped him adding a 54th goal to his all-time England record. And, agonisingly, he was just unable to stretch enough to meet a cross six yards out seconds later. Rooney took the acclaim of the crowd at the final whistle as the curtain came down on his England career. I became embarrassed at Man Utd - Rooney England's night may have been partly ceremonial as Wembley paid that final tribute to Rooney, but it was also a night of serious business for Southgate. He and his players needed to build on the momentum delivered by the superb win against Spain in Seville, which was one of the factors leading to the criticism this was effectively turned into a Rooney testimonial. Southgate can certainly be satisfied with plenty of what he saw, albeit against a United States side that looked very poor, despite Christian Pulisic forcing a fine save from Jordan Pickford at 0-0. England, though much-changed, played with pace and there was certainly plenty to be encouraged by from the new-look side. Southgate is now likely to select his strongest available side for what is a winner-takes-all final Nations League fixture here against Croatia on Sunday. Croatia inflicted a second successive defeat on Spain while England were winning here so the equation is clear cut - and the World Cup finalists have demonstrated once more what a dangerous side they can be. ""We knew tonight would be tough for Spain,"" Southgate said. ""Croatia have shown again their resilience, it sets Sunday up to be a very special tie. I'm sure whoever devised the Nations League is sitting smugly somewhere in Switzerland. ""We know not to underestimate Croatia, they have a huge lift tonight and the great thing is it sets up a brilliant game at the end of what has been a really exciting year."" England manager Gareth Southgate said:""The players will have taken on board Wayne Rooney's humility, even after everything he has given to the game. He mucked in during training and worked hard in the five-a-sides and in the game he was tracking back. ""We've got really good competition for places and it was a good test for them. We've got a brilliant game to come now, this is what the Nations League is all about."" England debutant and goalscorer Callum Wilson:""There was a chance just before the goal when Trent Alexander-Arnold slid the ball in and I thought the chance might have gone because I saw Marcus Rashford on the side of the pitch warming up. ""But there was one last opportunity and I managed to get my foot around it, which is one of the hardest finishes, so I'm delighted it went in."" Man-of-the-match Trent Alexander-Arnold:""A dream come true, first game at Wembley and for my country. It was exciting and we want to show what we are made of. ""It's been exciting, looking back on Wayne Rooney's career, he was one of the best players for the country and it was good to share the pitch with him. As a Liverpool lad, it is good to show people in Liverpool that it is possible."" England have won all three of their games against the US at Wembley, by an aggregate score of 7-0. England's starting XI had just 94 caps between them coming into this match - the last time they fielded a more inexperienced side was in May 1980 against Australia (46). This was England's biggest home win since beating Scotland 3-0 in November 2016. There were just 104 seconds between Lingard's opener and Alexander-Arnold making it 2-0. At 20 years and 39 days, Alexander-Arnold became the youngest Liverpool player to score for England since Michael Owen against Luxembourg in September 1999 (19y 264d). Wilson became the first Bournemouth player to score for England, and the first player to score on his debut for England since Marcus Rashford in May 2016.

"Jim Anderson now age 72 holds the bottle he found decades ago A diver who discovered a 150-year-old bottle of Tennent's off the coast of Australia has brought the stout back to Scotland. Jim Anderson sent the artefact back to the Glasgow brewery after finding it on a shipwreck in the 1970s. The bottle was on board The Light of The Age when its drunken captain caused the clipper to sink near Melbourne on 16 January 1868. It is thought to be the oldest bottle of beer in Scotland. Recalling the discovery, 72-year-old Mr Anderson said: ""I could see the inscription Wellpark Brewery on it, and I set about finding where that was. ""I found out it was in Glasgow, and I contacted Tennent's to see if they were interested in the bottle, which they were, and I was delighted. ""Now people can look at it, and think about the connection between Australia and Scotland, too. It's very special."" The artefact is carefully handled before going on display The Light of The Age was carrying 42 people on a voyage from Liverpool, with a cargo of salt, slates, pipes, preserves and liquors including stout from Wellpark. The Scottish brewery had well-established agents in Liverpool and Australia, and regular shipments from Glasgow via Liverpool were common. However the captain, who was found to be drunk by a marine board investigation, took the ship off course and ran it aground. The bottle top from the stout eroded after years under water The ship sank outside Port Phillip Heads near Melbourne - but the bottle of Tennent's survived. A member of the Geelong Skindivers Club, Mr Anderson discovered the bottle before Australian laws changed to protect wreck sites. He added: ""It took a bit of clearance to get it to Glasgow because artefacts are protected in Australia and we need special authorisation for things like this to leave the country. ""I sought all that, and it's amazing to see it back where it started, 150 years later, metres from where it started its journey."" Jim Anderson is a member of the Geelong Skindivers Club The stout and its story will be put on display at the brewery'snew visitor centre opening on 22 November. Tennent's have also developed a commemorative edition of the stout after brewers researched the firm's old recipes. Tennent's have developed a commemorative brew to celebrate the bottle's return Alan McGarrie, group brand director for Tennent's said: ""Pre-dating Tennent's Lager, which was first brewed in 1885, the stout is one of the oldest bottles of beer in Britain, returned to Wellpark by the diver who found it. ""Unlike the drunken captain who ran his ship aground close to Port Phillip Heads, Jim has ensured his historic cargo reached its final destination - by flying round the world to put it in place himself.""

"Informal exclusions are unlawful A dozen schools in England, Northern Ireland and Wales have admitted informally excluding pupils at some stage last year, the BBC has learned. BBC News asked more than 1,000 secondary schools whether they informally excluded children last year, using Freedom of Information requests. And six schools in England, five in Northern Ireland and one in Wales have admitted doing so. A few schools offered reasons for informally excluding children. More than one school said they had taken the measure to defuse or investigate an incident between pupils. One email obtained by BBC News from a school illustrates the lack of choice given to a parent asked to keep their child at home. The email advises their son take two days off ""to calm down"", an act the school says ""may avoid fixed-term exclusions at this stage"". BBC News has also received two reports from within schools of senior leaders regularly sending challenging pupils home immediately after second attendance. One current headmaster, who wished not to be named, said a senior leader in his previous school had regularly asked children to go home after 12:30, the time when the second attendance mark was awarded. Charlie Crittenden, now 21, says he was often informally excluded from school. ""Some days I was getting sent home twice a week. You just feel worthless. You've got no meaning in life,"" says Charlie. He says his time in isolation and frequent informal exclusions left him feeling school was ""pointless"". Charlie says he was often sent home without it being formally recorded He acknowledges he misbehaved at school. ""I did get involved with the naughty kids but I wasn't exactly an absolute demon,"" he says. He says he spent every day of a year in the school's inclusion unit and was frequently unofficially excluded for what he says were ""tiny things"". ""It makes you want to give up more,"" he says. Charlie says he was placed on a two-hour-a-day timetable for the final two months of his last year at the school. ""No-one ever agreed to that,"" he says. ""One day I just came into school and the next day they just told me, 'Now, this is what's happening.' I had no say whatsoever, neither did my mum or dad."" His mother says the school told her that they had ""failed"" Charlie. The school is unable to comment as it has now closed. Government guidance in England,externalsays that ""informal"" or ""unofficial"" exclusions, such as sending a pupil home ""to cool off"", are unlawful, regardless of whether they occur with the agreement of parents or carers. A school's head teacher must inform parents in writing of the reason and length of a fixed-term or permanent exclusion. It adds: ""The threat of exclusion must never be used to influence parents to remove their child."" In 2013, a report by the then Children's Commissioner for England called for head teachers to face disciplinary proceedings when informal exclusions were proven and prosecution when school records were falsified to cover them up. Maggie Atkinson said ""there seems to be a reluctance to act"" despite the damage that could be caused to young people's lives. ""You flip under the radar almost immediately and you can stay there,"" she added. Schools Minister Nick Gibb said evidence of informal exclusions would be taken ""very seriously"". He said it was ""a very small number of people that are engaged in unlawful activity such as informal exclusions."" But he added that he recognised the damage it did to a child. ""It disrupts their education, it opens them up to all kinds of vulnerabilities."" The Welsh government said informal exclusions ""deny learners their right to an education"" and ""do little to address the underlying issues behind challenging behaviour"".

"Sean Cox is receiving treatment in the National Rehabilitation Centre in Dun Laoghaire. Roma football club is to donate â¬150,000 (Â£133,000) towards the medical and rehabilitation costs of a fan who was attacked in Liverpool. Sean Cox, 53, from Ireland, suffered a brain injury before a match between Liverpool and Roma in April. The club said officials had visited Mr Cox and his wife and would work with them on initiatives to help cover care costs ""over a multi-year period"". Martina Cox said her husband ""will require care for the rest of his life"". The father-of-three, from Dunboyne, Co Meath, was attacked outside Anfield on 24 April before the first leg of Liverpool's Champion League semi-final. He is receiving treatment in the National Rehabilitation Centre in Dun Laoghaire, County Dublin. Roma said it would donate â¬100,000 and chairman Jim Pallotta will make a personal donation of â¬50,000. Mr Pallotta said: ""What happened to Sean Cox should never happen to anyone attending a football match. ""Our thoughts today, as they have been from day one, are with Sean, Martina and their whole family. ""We all hope Sean makes as full a recovery as possible."" Mrs Cox said: ""Our life has been turned upside down by what has happened to Sean. ""There is no sign of Sean being able to return home any time soon and even with extensive specialist rehabilitation efforts, which will take years, he will require care for the rest of his life."" Jurgen Klopp earlier donated 5,000 euros towards Mr Cox's treatment Liverpool FC manager Jurgen Klopp has donated 5,000 euros (Â£4,400) towards Mr Cox's long-term care. In October, Roma fan Filippo Lombardi, 21, was cleared of being part of a joint attack on Mr Cox, but admitted violent disorder. During the trial, Mr Cox's brother Martin said his brother could not speak or sit up unaided following the attack.

"Kate McClure (left) and partner Mark D'Amico (not pictured) are accused of conspiring with homeless man Johnny Bobbitt to take advantage of donors' good will The US protagonists in a viral fundraising campaign for a homeless man have been charged with theft by deception and conspiracy. Kate McClure and Mark D'Amico raised more than $400,000 (Â£313,000) for homeless ex-marine Johnny Bobbitt. But in August, Mr Bobbitt launched legal action against the couple, claiming he did not get his fair share. Now, prosecutors in New Jersey say Mr Bobbitt was complicit in the alleged plot. All three face the same charges. A lawyer for Mr D'Amico, 39 and Ms McClure, 28, declined to comment, according to US media. At Thursday's press conference, Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina said the story ""that drove this fundraiser might seem too good to be true. Unfortunately, it was"". ""The entire campaign was predicated on a lie,"" he added. The prosecutors believe the campaign was concocted a month before it was launched. The campaign text had said that Mr Bobbitt had used ""his last $20"" to help Ms McClure when her car broke down in 2017. Mr Bobbitt remains in custody, and the couple were released pending a court date on 24 December. The three face potential sentences of five to 10 years for the second-degree crimes.

Mr Bobbitt and the couple first came to prominence in November 2017 when Ms McClure launched a crowdfunding GoFundMe campaign, which, they said, was to re-pay the debt of a homeless man who came to her aid at the side of a road. A photograph of Ms McClure and Mr Bobbitt, a veteran and drug addict who had lived on the streets for several years, standing on the side of the road, fronted the fundraising campaign. More than 14,000 people donated, many inspired by the story's details, such as Mr Bobbitt instructing Ms McClure to lock her car doors before he returned with a can of petrol. Officials said on Thursday they believe the photo was staged after the three met previously when Ms McClure and Mr D'Amico visited a casino near an underpass where Mr Bobbitt spent time. Kate McClure, Mark D'Amico, Johnny Bobbitt The relationship between the three soured in August when Mr Bobbitt brought legal action against the couple, alleging they were using the funds as their personal ""piggy bank"" to fund an extravagant lifestyle. US homeless man sues couple over $400,000 fundraiser money After exceeding their original fundraising goal of $10,000, they bought clothing and a new camper van for Mr Bobbitt, but later reportedly asked him to remove it from outside their property. Ms McClure and Mr D'Amico told their online supporters the money would go to two financial trusts for Mr Bobbitt, as well as a lawyer and a financial adviser to help him manage all the money. ""Every dollar he ever touched was used for drugs,"" Mr D'Amico told NBC in a nationally televised interview in August. Life at an open-air drug camp in Philadelphia Investigators claimed the three originally made up the story to make people feel bad and compel donors to contribute to a cause. Net proceeds for Ms McClure and Mr D'Amico amounted to more than $367,000 (Â£287,000) and were spent on a car, holidays, high-end handbags and casino gambling, Mr Coffina said. The prosecutor said that Mr Bobbitt received about $75,000 (Â£58,000). In thousands of text messages read by police, the couple had discussed financial woes, inability to pay bills and debts, and Mr D'Amico said he hoped to raise more money by pursuing a book deal about the story. Expressing sympathy for Mr Bobbitt's homelessness, the prosecutor nonetheless accused the veteran of being ""fully complicit"" in the campaign, promoting it in several media appearances and appearing in the original photograph. Mr Bobbitt posted a similar story on Facebook in 2012 about helping a woman who had run out of petrol, officials say, but that ""full responsibility"" should be ascribed to all three. In a statement to CNN, a spokesman for the crowdfunding site Go Fund Me confirmed donors who contributed to the campaign would receive a refund.

"Several brands including Canada Goose are covered by the ban A school in Merseyside has banned pupils from wearing expensive designer coats in a bid to stop ""poverty-shaming"" among its students. In a letter to parents, Woodchurch High School in Birkenhead said pupils would not be allowed to wear branded coats such as Moncler, Pyrenex and Canada Goose. Head teacher Rebekah Phillips said pupils and parents supported the move. However, some people on Twitter have called the ban ""absolutely ridiculous"". The labels banned by the school include children's sizes which sell for between Â£400 and Â£1,000. The ban will be introduced after the Christmas holidays. Mrs Phillips said: ""We are very concerned as a school about poverty-proofing our school environment and, as such, we met with groups of pupils and made the decision in consultation with them. ""The pupils spoke to us about the pressure on families and the pressure on themselves to wear particular branded coats. A few years ago we introduced a school bag for the same reason. ""We have had parents approaching us asking us to introduce a ban prior to us writing the letter."" Moncler quilted jackets were created for mountaineers and skiers in the Alps There has been a mixed reaction on social media with people writing both in support and against the school's designer label ban. One Twitter user wrote: ""Absolutely ridiculous, banning those coats. It's a fact of life that there are poor kids, get over it.""
