"This video can not be played Oliver Dowden: ""We remain confident that we can deliver"" on vaccine rollout More than 30m people in the UK have had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, it has been announced, as the government says it is ""confident"" everyone will receive their second jab within 12 weeks. Asked about the concerns over supply, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said ""we always knew there would be ups and downs"" but the timetable was on track. Data shows more than 3.5m adults have now received their second dose. Meanwhile, the first Moderna jabs are due to arrive in the UK by late April. It is the third vaccine of seven that the UK has put in an order for - and the UK is lined up to receive 17 million doses. Like the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca jabs which are already in use, the Moderna jab is given in two doses several weeks apart. Thelatest government figures,externalshow 423,852 UK adults received a first dose of either the Pfizer or the Oxford vaccine on Saturday, taking the overall number to 30,151,287 - with 233,964 having their second dose, bringing that total to 3,527,481. Another 19 deaths of people within 28 days of a positive Covid test were recorded on Sunday, compared to 33 on the same day last week, along with a further 3,862 cases. Vaccine supply issues have continued to make the rollout bumpy. Earlier this month,the NHS warned of a significant reductionin jabs available in England in April, andthere has been a delayto Oxford-AstraZeneca shipments from India. There are also tensions from the EU over the supply of jabs. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Fosterhas said she hopes the UKwill give vaccine doses to the Republic of Ireland, in a bid to help stop the spread of infection in Northern Ireland. She said the idea was ""very practical"" and she would speak to Boris Johnson about it again. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Mr Dowden said: ""We're on track both with the rollout of the vaccine and the roadmap. ""You will have seen the ups and downs - we were surging ahead a couple of weeks ago, there's been a bit of a slow-down now. ""But that doesn't undermine our confidence that we will be able to deliver for that crucial group, the over-50s, by the middle of April and then for the rest of the adult population by the end of July."" Asked whether there will be enough supply for everyone to get their second dose, Mr Dowden said: ""That is absolutely essential and in all our planning throughout this, we have borne in mind that we have to get that second top-up and so we're confident we will be able to deliver it."" He also said the government was confident that vaccination centres could meet the 12-week deadline on second doses without resorting to mixing of vaccines - giving a Oxford jab to someone who had Pfizer first time round or vice versa. Prof Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said the Moderna vaccine was an ""extra string to our bow"" but shipments would be more limited than of the other two vaccines currently in use. He said it ""adds a further line of supply to enable the vaccine programme to move forward into the under-50s"" but with Moderna primarily directing their supplies towards the US, it is not a ""game-changer"". As of Friday,,externalmore than 3.2 million people have now had their second dose To work out whether the NHS has so far been giving doses within the 12 week-timeframe, we can go back and look at when 3.2 million people had their first dose - that was achieved by 15 January So all those 3.2 million people needed to have their second dose by 9 April; that's still 12 days away, which suggests the programme is meeting its targets, even accounting for small changes in the order of people being recalled for second doses However, the rate at which first vaccines were given accelerated sharply from mid-January - so it will become more challenging in the coming weeks to deliver the same number of second jabs Mr Dowden also said people ""still need to abide by the rules after Monday"", which is when lockdown rules are next eased in England. From Monday, six people or two households are allowed to gather together outside and the ""stay at home"" guidance will be lifted, which coincides with forecasts of warm and sunny weather in some areas. In Wales, the ""stay local"" rule was lifted on Saturday and people were allowed to meet in groups of six outside. Some experts have expressed hesitancy at the planned relaxation of rules. Prof Mark Woolhouse, who sits on a group that feeds into the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said with the vaccine rollout performing at its current rate the UK ""can get quite close to a full release"", but he was ""a little bit nervous"" about the full relaxation planned for 21 June at the earliest. Mr Dowden defended the plan, saying it was ""cautious"" - and the five week gaps between each stage means the government has ""four weeks to see the effect of the spread from the easing and then a week to prepare the rules"". What can I do from Monday... and what comes next? When will over-40s get a jab? But some have been critical of the pace. Sir Richard Sykes, chairman of the scientific body the Royal Institution, said the UK has ""gone from being cavalier to crippling caution"" when it comes to handling Covid. He told BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme: ""If we are not now well prepared to put up with anything that's thrown at us, then it's God help all of us because that's the best we can do at this point in time.""

"Tugboats managed to move the Ever Given 30 degrees in both directions, but it is still stuck A giant container ship remains stuck across Egypt's Suez Canal after attempts to dislodge it on Saturday's high tide failed. Canal officials said some progress had been made, however, and more tugboats were joining the effort on Sunday. Alternative arrangements are being put in place in case the operation fails. Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has ordered preparations to lighten the load of the stranded ship. That would involve transferring some containers to another vessel or to the canal bank. Experts earlier told the BBC that such an operation would involve bringing in specialist equipment, including a crane that would need to stretch more than 60m (200ft) high, and could take weeks. The Suez Canal is one of the world's busiest trade routes, and the Ever Given - part of the Evergreen fleet - has been wedged in it since Tuesday. More than 300 ships are stuck on either side of the blockage and some vessels have had to reroute around Africa. 'Our customers are worried about the Suez blockage' How do you refloat a giant cargo ship? The Suez Canal blockage in numbers In pictures: Efforts to shift huge ship from canal On Saturday 14 tugboats pulled and pushed the Ever Given at high tide to try to dislodge it. At the same time, dredgers continued to remove thousands of tonnes of sand and clay from where the bow was trapped in the canal's bank. Although strong tides and winds complicated efforts, the tugboats managed to move the ship ""30 degrees from left and right"", said General Osama Rabie, chairman of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA). Footage posted on Twitter appeared to show the tugboats honking their horns to celebrate this small victory. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The SCA said in a statement that dredgers had so far shifted 27,000 cubic metres of sand to a depth of 18m (59ft). Gen Rabie said on Sunday that although the vessel was still stuck there were ""positive indicators"" from the past two days' efforts. ""The rudder was not moving and it is now moving, the propeller is working now, there was no water underneath the bow, and now there is water under it, and yesterday there was a 4m (13ft) deviation in the bow and the stern,"" he told Egyptian state TV. It may be necessary to remove containers to raise the ship in the water However, in a possible complication, SCA sources quoted by Reuters news agency said that a mass of rock had been discovered under the bow of the ship. Gen Rabie said that President Sisi had ordered preparations for the possible removal of some of the ship's 18,300 containers. He had previously said he hoped such an operation would not be necessary. Initial reports said the 400m-long (1,300ft), 200,000-tonne vessel ran aground due to high winds and a sandstorm that affected visibility. However, Gen Rabie said on Saturday that weather conditions were ""not the main reasons"" for the ship's grounding. ""There may have been technical or human errors,"" he told reporters, without giving details. ""All of these factors will become apparent in the investigation."" This video can not be played A salvage company, working to free the Ever Given, says the operation could take weeks About 12% of global trade passes through the 193km (120-mile) canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. An alternative route, around the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa, can take two weeks longer. According to data from Lloyd's List, the blockage is holding up an estimated $9.6bn (Â£7bn) of goods each day - or $400m an hour. Gen Rabie estimated that Egypt was losing up to $14m in revenue each day that the canal was closed. In Syria, authorities have begun to ration fuel after supplies were held up by the stalled traffic in the Suez Canal. The war-torn country was already struggling with power cuts and inflation pushing up the price of goods.

"Brisbane Airport on Monday was bustling as people flew out of the city prior to its lockdown The Australian city of Brisbane will enter another snap three-day lockdown to contain a coronavirus outbreak which has grown to seven cases. The Queensland state capital - home to over two million residents - will begin the lockdown at 17:00 Monday local time (06:00 GMT). In January, the city also shut down for three days due to a single case. The city has seen very few locally acquired cases since Australia's first wave of the virus a year ago. The Brisbane outbreak, first reported on Saturday, marks the first cluster of community transmissions in Australia in almost a month. Health officials are yet to determine how the virus leaked into the community, but say it is potentially linked to a hospital doctor who was infectious two weeks ago. After the lockdown was announced, locals rushed to shops to stock up on goods despite officials urging this was unnecessary. Video online also showed plane passengers in Sydney scrambling to disembark a flight bound for Brisbane after learning of the announcement. Australians offered cheap flights to boost tourism Australia's first line of defence against Covid This video can not be played I cycled every street allowed under Melbourneâs tough lockdown Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the discovery of four more local cases, reported on Monday, showed there was ""more community transmission"" in the city. A lockdown was necessary to help contact tracers contain the spread, she said. ""I know it is really tough. We have Easter coming up, we have school holidays coming up,"" she said at a press conference on Monday. ""But let's do it now and let's do it right and let's see if we can come through it at the other end."" The lockdown will affect the Greater Brisbane area, which includes the councils of Brisbane, Logan, Moreton Bay, Ipswich and Redlands. As with previous lockdowns, people will only be able to leave their homes for four essential reasons: exercise, shopping, necessary work and caregiving. Schools and workplaces will be closed as well as non-essential businesses and services. Simon Atkinson, BBC News in Brisbane Brisbane has been here before. And today - just as in early January - many people's instinct was to head to the supermarket. In an inner-city branch of Woolworths, shoppers lined up out the door. Once inside, queues ran the length of the store - certainly not typical for a Monday morning. And while Australians are known for their love of alcohol, I was slightly surprised to see quite so many people heading into in the ""bottlo"" next door to get in supplies. All a bit unseemly for 09:00. Shoppers queue in Brisbane on Monday There is no rationale for the rush. Supermarkets and off licences are classed as essential and the state premier has already urged locals to avoid stockpiling. But equally, there is no sense of panic. Only one in five shoppers were wearing masks (they become mandatory in a few hours time), and nearby cafes remained packed. Life here has been pretty much normal for months. Most appreciate how good they have it. But the chatter over coffee was pessimistic, with plenty of talk about the Easter plans that'll be in tatters should this snap shutdown be extended. Elsewhere across Queensland, residents will have to wear face masks again in shops and on public transport, and home gatherings will be limited to 30 people. Ms Palaszczuk said: ""This is essential everyone that we do this to stop further transmission. We've seen what's happened in other countries. I don't want to see that happen to Queensland."" The popular tourist town of Byron Bay, south of Brisbane, has also been placed on high alert after two infected people visited on the weekend. Australia has reported 909 deaths and about 29,200 cases since the pandemic began - a number far lower than many nations. It's in the early stages of its vaccine rollout. The nation has faced sporadic outbreaks over the past year, with the most severe in Melbourne last July triggeringa punishing lockdown that lasted almost four months. Since then, authorities have acted fast at the start of outbreaks to curtail them early on. Several cities have experienced snap lockdowns in recent months: Nov 2020:Adelaide (and South Australia state) for three days Dec 2020:Parts of Sydney for three weeks Jan 2021:Brisbane for three days Feb 2021:Perth for five days Feb 2021:Melbourne for five days Lockdowns have proved to be an effective health measure but the unpredictable shutdowns of cities have left a significant economic toll, experts say. Australia's domestic tourism industry has been particularly hit hard, with states often shutting their borders to people from declared hotspots. Interstate travel to and from Brisbane will now be restricted until it's no longer listed as a virus hotspot.

"Mourners at the funeral on Sunday for protester Kyaw Win Maung in Mandalay The killing of more than 100 anti-coup protesters in Myanmar has drawn global outrage, with defence ministers of 12 nations condemning the military. The US accused the security forces of a ""reign of terror"" on Saturday, the deadliest day since last month's coup. Coup leader Min Aung Hlaing and his generals still threw a lavish party that night for Armed Forces Day. On Sunday, funerals were held, with some reports the military had tried to intervene in the mourning. More than 400 people have now been killed in the suppression of protests in Myanmar since the 1 February coup. The victims of Myanmar's deadliest day Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? The military seized control of the South East Asian country after an election which Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party won by a landslide. The defence chiefs of a dozen nations, including the UK, on Sunday issued a rare joint statement condemning the military's violent actions. The US, Japan and Australia were also among the signatories of a statement that said: ""A professional military follows international standards for conduct and is responsible for protecting - not harming - the people it serves."" The UK government has also urged all British nationals in Myanmar to ""leave the country as soon as possible"". The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said the advice ""follows the significant increase in violence on 27 March"". ""We were previously advising British nationals to leave unless they had an urgent need to stay,"" it added. Security forces opened fire in more than 40 locations on Saturday. The commercial centre, Yangon, saw dozens of deaths, but killings were recorded from Kachin in the north to Taninthartharyi in the far south. Demonstrators with an image of detained leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Mandalay The US said it was ""horrified"" by the killings. Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused the military of ""sacrificing the lives of the people to serve the few."" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was ""deeply shocked"" by the violence, and British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called it a ""new low"". UN Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews called for an international emergency summit. China and Russia have not joined the criticism, which means taking action through the UN Security Council - where they have vetoes - could be difficult. The luxury military party on Saturday was held to mark the annual Armed Forces Day, which commemorates the start of Myanmar's military resistance against Japanese occupation in 1945. Images from state TV shared on social media showed military officials, including Min Aung Hlaing, wearing white uniforms and bow ties, walking along a red carpet smiling, and seated at large tables for dinner. The event drew an angry response from some on social media, including Burmese activist Maung Zarni. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A number of Twitter posts placed pictures of the party alongside images of victims. Earlier on Saturday, the military held a parade and heard a speech from Min Aung Hlaing, who said he wanted to ""safeguard democracy"" but also warned against ""violent acts"". The military held a parade to mark Armed Forces Day Representatives of Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand attended. On Sunday, families held funerals for some of those killed the day before. One was for Kyaw Win Maung, who was shot dead in Mandalay. Street tales from Myanmar: 'Take care of our baby if I die' 1988 v 2021: A tale of two Myanmar protests Another service in the city was held for Aye Ko, a father of four. ""We are told by the neighbours that Aye Ko was shot and thrown into the fire,"" one relative told AFP news agency. ""He was the only one who fed the family, losing him is a great loss for the family."" Witnesses told Reuters news agency that security forces opened fire at a funeral for a 20-year-old student in the city of Bago ""While we [were] singing the revolution song for him, security forces just arrived and shot at us,"" a woman who was at the service said. ""People, including us, ran away as they opened fire."" There were no immediate reports of casualties. There were no reports of large-scale protests in Yangon or Mandalay, which saw the most casualties in Saturday's crackdowns. But there were rallies in towns including Katha and Hsipaw, according to reports. Twelve deaths were recorded on Sunday by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) advocacy group. This video can not be played Myanmar coup: How did we get here? Moe Myint, BBC Burmese Fourteen-year-old Pan Ei Phyu's mother says she rushed to close all the doors when she heard the military coming down her street. But she wasn't fast enough. A moment later, she was holding her daughter's blood-soaked body. ""I saw her collapse and initially thought she just slipped and fell. But then blood spurted out from her chest,"" she told BBC Burmese from Meiktila in central Myanmar. It was the randomness of Saturday's killings that was particularly shocking. Armed with battlefield weapons, the security forces appeared willing to shoot anyone they saw on the streets. The brutality they showed they were capable of is on another level from what we have seen since the coup. Neither side - the military nor the pro-democracy movement - is willing to back down. The military thinks it can terrorise people to achieve ""stability and security"". But the movement on the streets, led by young people, is determined to rid the country of the military dictatorship once and for all. It's painful to have to count the mounting dead, especially the children. Myanmar, also known as Burma, became independent from Britain in 1948. For much of its modern history, it has been under military rule Restrictions began loosening from 2010 onwards, leading to free elections in 2015 and the installation of a government headed by veteran opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi the following year In 2017, Myanmar's army responded to attacks on police by Rohingya militants with a deadly crackdown, driving more than half a million Rohingya Muslims across the border into Bangladesh in what the UN later called a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" Country profile The general who returned Myanmar to military rule Who are the rulers who executed Myanmar activists?

"When it comes to the coronavirus vaccine there is one question most people are asking - when will I get it? A handful of countries have set very specific vaccination targets, but for the rest of the world the picture is less clear. Getting the world vaccinated against Covid-19 is a matter of life and death, involving complicated scientific processes, multinational corporations, government promises and backroom deals. So figuring out when and how everyone in the world will get the vaccine is not easy. Agathe Demarais is the director of global forecasting at the Economist Intelligence Unit, which has done some of the most comprehensive research on the topic. She has looked at the world's production capacity, along with the healthcare facilities needed to get vaccines into people's arms, the number of people a country has to contend with, and what they can afford. Coronavirus cases, deaths, vaccinations by country Will countries be left behind in the vaccine race? The vaccines that work - and the others on the way Many of the findings seem to fall along predictable lines of rich v poor. The UK and the US are both well supplied with vaccines right now because they could afford to invest a lot of money into vaccine development and put themselves at the front of the queue. Rich countries that didn't do that, like Canada or those in the EU bloc, are a little further behind. Canada was criticised at the end of last year for buying up five times the supply it needs to cover its population, but it seems it wasn't positioned for priority delivery. That's partly because the country decided to invest in vaccines from European factories, afraid that the US under Donald Trump would issue export bans. It turned out to be a bad bet. European factories are struggling with supply and recently it has been the EU, not the US, that has been threatening export bans. ""As long as the European market doesn't have enough vaccines, I think that big imports to Canada are going to remain off the cards,"" says Ms Demarais. Most low-income countries haven't started vaccinating yet. But some countries in the middle are doing better than expected.       Source: Our World in Data  Serbia is eighth in the worldin terms of the percentage of its population vaccinated, ahead of any country in the EU. Its success is partly down to an efficient roll-out but it's also benefitting from vaccine diplomacy - a battle between Russia and China for influence in eastern Europe. It's one of the few places where the Russian vaccine Sputnik V and the Chinese vaccine SinoPharm are already available. On paper, Serbians are given a choice of what vaccine they would prefer - Pfizer, Sputnik or SinoPharm. In reality, most people end up being given SinoPharm. And the influence China is exerting here is likely to be long-term. Countries giving a first and second dose of one of theChinese vaccinesare also likely to look to Beijing for booster doses if needed. India: How do you vaccinate a billions people? Africa's long wait for the Covid-19 vaccine What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? The United Arab Emirates is also relying heavily on the SinoPharm vaccine - it makes up 80% of the doses being administered there right now. And the UAE is building a SinoPharm production facility. ""China is coming with production facilities, trained workers, so it's going to give long-term influence to China,"" says Ms Demarais. ""And it will make it very, very tricky for recipient governments to say no to China for anything in the future."" Being a global vaccine superpower, however, doesn't mean your population will be vaccinated first. The EIU's research predicts two of the world's vaccine production powerhouses, China and India, may not be sufficiently vaccinated until the end of 2022. That's because they have huge populations to contend with, as well as a shortage of health workers. In India, the country's success as a Covid vaccine producer is largely down to one man, Adar Poonawalla. He's chief executive of the Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine producer. Last year, his family started to think he has lost his mind when he began betting hundreds of millions of dollars of his own money on vaccines that he didn't know would work. In January, the first of those vaccines, developed by Oxford and AstraZeneca, was delivered to the Indian government. Now he's producing 2.4 million doses a day. He's one of two main suppliers to the Indian government - and is also supplying Brazil, Morocco, Bangladesh and South Africa. ""I thought the pressure and all the madness would end now that we've made the product,"" he says. ""But the real challenge is trying to keep everybody happy. ""I thought there'd be so many other manufacturers who would be able to supply. But sadly, at the moment at least, in the first quarter, and perhaps even the second quarter of 2021, we're not going to see a substantial increase in supply."" He says production cannot be ramped up overnight. ""It takes time,"" Mr Ponnawalla adds. ""People think that the Serum Institute has got a magic sauce. Yes, we're good at what we do but it's not a magic wand."" He currently has an edge because he started building facilities in March last year, as well as stockpiling things like chemicals and glass vials in August. For manufacturers starting production now, it will take months to produce vaccines. And the same applies to any boosters that might be needed to tackle new variants. Mr Ponnawalla says he is committed to supplying India and then Africa through a scheme called the Covax facility. Covax, an initiative led by the WHO and other health organisations, aims to get affordable vaccines to every country in the world. Countries that can't afford vaccines will get them for free through a special fund. The rest will pay. But the theory is that they will get a better price by negotiating through the bloc than if they had done so on their own. Covax is planning to start delivering vaccines this month. But the plan is being undermined by the fact many countries involved are also negotiating their own deals on the side. Mr Poonawalla says almost every leader in Africa has been in touch with him to access vaccines independently. Last week, Uganda announced it had secured 18 million doses from the Serum Institute at $7 a jab - much more than the $4 being paid by Covax. The institute says it is in talks with Uganda but denies this deal was ever signed. In total, Mr Poonawalla's firm is due to supply 200m doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Covax and has promised 900m more doses in the future. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has since advised against rollout of the vaccine in countries where the South African strain is present. He says he is still committed to the scheme, but admits it faces problems. It's dealing with too many different vaccine producers, he says, each offering varying prices and timelines for delivery. Ms Demarais and the EIU are not overly optimistic about what Covax can achieve either. The timelines for delivery of vaccines are still not clear and even if things go according to plan, the scheme only aims to cover 20-27% of a country's population this year. ""It's going to make a small marginal difference, but not a game-changer,"" she says. In her forecast, some countries may not get widespread coverage even by 2023. Some may never be fully covered. Vaccination may not be a priority for every country, especially one that has a young population and is not seeing huge numbers of people getting sick. The problem with that scenario is as long as the virus can prosper somewhere it will be able to mutate and migrate. Vaccine-resistant variants will continue to evolve. It's not all bad news. Vaccines are being produced faster than ever but the scale of the task - inoculating 7.8 billion people around the world - is gigantic. And it's never been attempted before. Ms Demarais believes governments should level with their people on what is possible. ""It's very difficult for a government to say, 'No, we're not going to achieve widespread immunisation coverage before several years.' Nobody wants to say that.""

"Cuts to addiction services for young people with drug and alcohol problems in England mean many are missing out on specialist help, according to the Royal College of Psychiatrists. It says eight out of nine regions in England have made real terms reductions in funding since 2014, and 37% overall. The situation has only been made worse by the pandemic, which has badly disrupted services. A plan to support people with mental health issues has been announced. The government aims to train up more mental health staff and target specific groups affected by the pandemic, including young people, frontline staff and those with severe mental illness. Earlier this month, it confirmedÂ£79m would be allocated to support children and young people's mental healthin schools and the community. But without specialist help for drug and alcohol dependency, mental health doctors say some young people are at risk of a lifetime of addiction, poor health or early death. The vast majority of young people seeking help for addiction do so because of problems around cannabis use or alcohol. Alcohol deaths hit record high during pandemic 'He drinks six bottles of wine a day' Cautious welcome for child mental health support How has coronavirus affected mental health? But with funding reduced by Â£26m between 2014 and 2020, and the number of young people accessing treatment down by 40%, psychiatrists say more money is urgently needed for youth addiction services. Services in the North West, the West Midlands and London have been hardest hit by cuts, the college's analysis found. Dr Emily Finch, vice-chairwoman of the addictions faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the cuts were ""completely unsustainable and unbelievably short-sighted"". ""We need to wake-up to the fact that money spent on addiction services saves the NHS a whole lot more in the long run, whether that's in A&E or in other mental health services,"" she said. ""On top of all this, the pandemic has made a dire situation even worse, as even more young people have been left unable to access services."" In 2018, 88% of young people accessing services said they had a problem with cannabis use - a drug that has become stronger and more harmful since then. The second most common problem in nearly half of young people was with alcohol. There were more than 40,000 alcohol-related admissions among the under-24s in 2019, and a quarter of those were for mental and behavioural disorders due to the use of alcohol. Dr Adrian James, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ""More young people will continue to have their lives blighted by the harms of drugs and alcohol unless the government acts now and commits to substantial investment in public health, including youth addictions services. ""Addictions services do have a cost, but the cost of addiction to society is far greater."" The college is calling for Â£43m to be invested in youth addiction services. A government spokesperson said: ""We are determined to confront the harms caused by drugs across the UK, and deliver for the public by making our streets safer and protecting the most vulnerable.""

"The Office's fictional paper company Wernham Hogg was located in Slough Trading Estate Ricky Gervais put its trading estate on the map in The Office, while poet John Betjeman famously invited friendly bombs to fall on Slough. But now the Berkshire town looks set to gain a new claim to fame as it will get the Chinese ""sponge city"" treatment. The flood defence system sees selected roads transformed with permeable surfaces that soak up surface water. It is one of 25 innovative new environmental projects around England to be backed with government cash. Eight more things that Slough gave the world Builders 'behind UK flooding risk' Natural solutions boosted to help prevent floods Pioneered in China - Wuhan, now best known for an entirely different reason, is considered its leading sponge city - the project in Slough sees participating areas turn a proportion of their urban land into sponge features to absorb rain and flood water. Under the programme, managed by the Environment Agency, the town will also use natural vegetation to improve drainage. Slough Borough Council said the six-year project would use plants and trees to absorb water ""to such an extent it will minimise the risk to homes and businesses of flooding"". It added: ""They act as sponges, soaking up surface water, creating an environment where water can be captured, controlled and in some cases re-used."" The sponge city approach will be implemented at multiple sites along Salt Hill Street and Chalvey Ditches, the authority said. Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst What's new about the sponge city story is not the concept, but the title. For years, local councils have been encouraged to make city surfaces porous whenever they can. Neath in South Wales has installed clever landscape tricks such as detention basins, retention ponds, soakaways, and swales. They have a great scheme to turn a school playing field into a lake during heavy rain and they have dug a pond system which teaches kids about frogs as well as floods. But this all sounds a bit nerdy, and funding has been short for what are known as SuDS - Sustainable Drainage Systems. Where front gardens are paved over, for instance, they are supposed to be engineered so they allow water to seep back into the ground, rather than rushing into the sewers. But in most places there is little cash for enforcement and tradespeople carry on as before. Perhaps the new title of sponge city will help common sense to prevail. Follow Roger on Twitter@rharrabin,external A further 24 schemes aimed at improving waterway defences and coastal resilience will also get a share of Â£150m as part of the government's newflood and coastal resilience innovation programme,external. Slough, which has always been ahead of the curve, is also the place that invented the wheelie bin They include the restoration of sub-tidal habitats like kelp beds, oyster reefs and sea grass near South Tyneside. Residents in Buckinghamshire will get an app to warn them about the threat of groundwater. And in Northumberland artificial intelligence and new sensor technology will be used to detect rising water levels. Environment minister Rebecca Pow said the 25 projects will help shape future approaches in preparing communities for flooding and coastal change. It will also help ""reinforce the UK's position as a world leader in innovation and new technology as we build back better,"" she added. Emma Howard Boyd, chairwoman of the Environment Agency, called the project ""extremely exciting"" and said it could be replicated on a larger scale around the world if successful.

"The government has rejected a request for Â£170m in financial support for Liberty Steel. The firm's founder Sanjeev Gupta sent a letter last week asking for help to pay day-to-day operating expenses and absorb recent losses. Liberty's owner GFG employs 5,000 staff at its 12 UK sites, which include Rotherham, Motherwell and Newport. GFG's key financial backer, Greensill Capital, filed for insolvency earlier this month. 'If the steelworks shuts it will destroy Rotherham' Liberty Steel: Government looking at 'all options' Liberty Steel asks customers to pay up front Government sources told the BBC last week they had concerns about the ""opaque"" nature of Mr Gupta's empire, which employs 35,000 worldwide. Any assistance was more likely to come following an administration process, the sources indicated, to support UK jobs as opposed to the corporate entity that owns it. GFG, a holding company for Mr Gupta's assets, was the biggest recipient of finance from Greensill. Lucy Powell, Labour's shadow minister for business and consumer affairs, told the BBC that some sort of support was needed. ""The financial structure and the tie in to the Greensill administration is very complex so I'm not surprised by this but, as we've been calling for two or three weeks now, the government really does need to lay out a plan B for what it is going to do to support domestic steel making and retain these cutting edge viable plants in the UK."" For metal workers in Rotherham, a town steeped in steel, this uncertainty will feel all too familiar. It has been a difficult few decades for the UK's steel industry, now a fraction of its previous size. Many of the major plants have gone under only to be rescued and passed through different pairs of hands. Only four years ago, Sanjeev Gupta stepped in to save the Rotherham plan under the brand of Liberty Steel. Now he's battling to secure finance for it and the rest of his UK business. However, the UK government's rejection of his loan request may not mean the end of the road for Liberty and the five thousand people it employs. Analysts point to the example of British Steel, which was funded by UK taxpayers for almost a year after it went into administration until it was sold on to a Chinese firm in March 2020.

"The mural was painted over within days of its completion A mural tribute to Drag Race UK star Bimini Bon Boulash has been painted over in an apparent act of vandalism. The work was painted in the Pottergate underpass in Norwich on Wednesday by local artist Knapple, with help from transgender activist Sharpay Salazar. However, on Sunday morning, the work was found covered over. Bimini, from Great Yarmouth, responded to the defacementon Twitter,external, saying they felt ""sorry for the people who felt threatened"" by the mural. In the post, they added: ""I will never stop being myself. ""I'll never shy away from living an authentically queer experience even if there are people that disagree with our existence.

"Mercedes Lewis Hamilton held off Max Verstappen's Red Bull for victory in an extraordinary finish to the Bahrain Grand Prix. Verstappen actually took the lead from Hamilton with four laps to go but handed the position back because he had overtaken by running off the track. The move - an order from race control - cost the Red Bull driver the victory. Verstappen never quite got close enough again to challenge Hamilton. It was a remarkable climax to a tense and thrilling strategic battle that bodes well for an epic season between the two men. Verstappen complained over the radio about being ordered by his team to hand the lead back, but was told they had no choice. The drivers had been referred by the race director before the race to a rule that says they cannot not leave the track and gain a lasting advantage, and that officials can give them the ""opportunity to give back the whole of any advantage gained by leaving the track"". How the Bahrain Grand Prix unfolded Quiz: Can you name every F1 opening race winner since 1980? It was a brutal end to the race for Verstappen, who had taken a dominant pole position and had looked to have pulled off a great comeback drive for victory. But both men drove brilliantly, as Mercedes and Red Bull fought a strategic battle for superiority in one of the most gripping races for some time. Verstappen converted his pole into a lead at the start, but Hamilton moved in front when Mercedes stopped him earlier to go for the so-called undercut, when a driver pits to gain from the speed benefit of fresher tyres. That gave Hamilton track position, and he kept it through his second pit stop. Verstappen was told to hand the lead back to Hamilton Red Bull decided to run Verstappen 11 laps longer to give him a tyre advantage at the end of the race, and he stopped with 18 laps to go, setting up a grandstand finish. Hamilton had to measure his pace to hold Verstappen for as long as possible while also keeping his tyres in decent shape for the inevitable battle in the closing laps. Verstappen was on Hamilton's tail with five laps to go, and passed him a lap later around the outside at Turn Four. It looked to be a superb move to clinch what would have been a deserving victory and an emphasis that Red Bull had the fastest car this weekend. But a flick of oversteer as he went around Hamilton took him wide, and he broke the rule that said drivers had to stay the right side of the exit kerb on the outside of the corner. Ironically, Red Bull had complained earlier in the race that Hamilton had been using that piece of track, and the world champion was told to stop doing it by race control or risk a penalty. The officials treated Verstappen with the same strictness and he was immediately told to let Hamilton by, which he did on the straight down to Turn 11. It looked a certainty that Verstappen would simply climb back on to Hamilton's tail and do the move again, but his pace had dropped and Hamilton had just enough to hold him off, to take the 96th victory of his career after a remarkable drive.

Life was made even harder for Hamilton when his team-mate Valtteri Bottas suffered a slow second pit stop when a front tyre proved difficult to remove. Had the stop gone smoothly, Verstappen would either have had to stop shortly afterwards, minimising his tyre advantage over Hamilton, or run long and then had to pass both Mercedes to win. But the removal of the Finn allowed Red Bull to delay Verstappen's stop to give him a much bigger grip advantage over Hamilton for the end of the race. Bottas drove a steady race while never looking likely to trouble the fight for victory, while Lando Norris drove an exceptional race to win the fight for best of the rest in his McLaren. The Briton set the stage for his result with a combative opening part of the race, in which he fought past team-mate Daniel Ricciardo on the first lap and then, after an early safety car to recover the crashed Haas of Nikita Mazepin, passed Pierre Gasly's Alpha Tauri and Charles Leclerc's Ferrari to take the place he would not lose for the rest of the race. Norris finished in fourth place, while new McLaren team-mate Ricciardo ended the day seventh Red Bull's Sergio Perez had to start from the pit lane after his engine cut out on the formation lap, but climbed back up the field in trademark style to take fifth place ahead of Leclerc and Ricciardo. Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was eighth, Japanese rookie Yuki Tsunoda scored points on his debut in ninth for Alpha Tauri and Lance Stroll's Aston Martin rounded out the top 10. Stroll's team-mate Sebastian Vettel had a difficult day, and was penalised 10 seconds for ramming into the back of Esteban Ocon's Alpine after being overtaken on the approach to Turn One. Mick Schumacher finished last in the Haas, after he copied Mazepin's spin at Turn Two on the restart after the safety car period, albeit without clouting the wall. Fernando Alonso retired his Alpine after a brake failure caused by debris in his brake ducts, and had also been having problems with his engine. Two men stood out, Hamilton and Verstappen in a race of their own. But Hamilton gets it for the controlled manner in which he managed his pace under intense pressure A three-week break before the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola. After this, the anticipation for round two will be sky high. Lewis Hamilton:""Wow. What a difficult race that was. Stopping early we knew would be difficult but we had to cover Max, they have had an amazing performance all weekend. Max was all over me at the end and I was just about able to hold him off. That was one of the hardest races I've had for a while."" Max Verstappen:""It's a shame but you also have to see the positive. We are really taking the fight to them, and I think that's great to start the year like that. Overall we managed to score good points."" Valtteri Bottas:""Disappointing for sure but a good thing for the team we got good points. It feels for me that it was on the defensive side and not attacking. Not ideal and I had a slow pit stop which in the end took away any opportunities.""

"Experts had warned that the true number of Covid-related deaths in Mexico was higher than the official figures Mexico has published revised figures indicating that the number of deaths caused by coronavirus is 60% higher than previously reported. More than 321,000 people are now believed to have died from Covid-19 in the country. The revised toll places Mexico with the second highest number of Covid-related deaths in the world, after the US. President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador has faced widespread criticism over his handling of the crisis. The opposition has accused him of downplaying the severity of the pandemic and blamed him for delays in the vaccination programme. Covid map: Where are cases the highest? US to send 4m vaccine doses to Canada and Mexico Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? The revised report issued by Mexico's health ministry (in Spanish),externalshowed that by the end of the sixth week of 2021 there had been 294,287 deaths ""associated with Covid-19"" - up from the 182,301 confirmed figure given previously. Since mid-February more than 26,772 Covid-19-related deaths have been reported across Mexico which would take the total to more than 321,000. That places Mexico above Brazil, which has registered 310,000 deaths, and below the US which has recorded 549,000 fatalities - despite having a population of 126 million which is far smaller than either country. The government has been criticised for the slow rollout of vaccines Experts have long warned that Mexico's true death toll is probably much higher due to a lack of testing. It is also believed that a shortage of intensive care beds in many states has led to a large number of people dying at home. The new figures came after a review of ""excess deaths"" and a review of death certificates. Last week, Hugo LÃ³pez-Gatell, who is heading Mexico's response to the pandemic, warned that the country risked a new wave of infections as millions prepared for the Easter holidays. Mr LÃ³pez Obrador, who has himself recovered from Covid-19, has been repeatedly accused by his opponents of not taking the crisis seriously enough and is often seen in public without wearing a face mask. Meanwhile, Mexico's vaccination programme has seen about 6.1 million doses administered so far. The US recently announced it would release four million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Mexico and Canada. Both countries have approved the AstraZeneca inoculation, but the US has not. However, the US has a stockpile of the jab. The White House said that 2.5m of the US's 7m jabs would go to Mexico and 1.5m to Canada. Leaders from both countries had asked the White House for assistance. Mexican officials even pressed the Biden team on the issue during a conversation about border security earlier this month.

"David Cameron has been defended as ""a man of the utmost integrity"" by a current cabinet minister, after a fresh row about the former prime minister's dealings with a banker.

Oliver Dowden said he had ""no doubt"" the former PM ""behaved properly"". Labour is calling for an ""urgent inquiry"". Mr Cameron wascleared this week by a watchdogwhich looked at whether he should have declared himself on the register of consultant lobbyists over work he had done for Greensill Capital. The company, which went bust recently, was a key financial backer of Liberty Steel. Greensill's collapse raised questions about the future of Liberty Steel and thousands of jobs there. Liberty Steel bailout plea turned down Labour seeks probe over Cameron Greensill lobbying Ex-PM Cameron to be investigated by lobbying body There were reports Mr Cameron tried unsuccessfully to increase Greensill Capital's access to government-backed loans by contacting officials as well as the chancellor, Rishi Sunak. Now the Sunday Times has reported that, during Mr Cameron's time at Number 10, Mr Greensill gained privileged access to Whitehall where he promoted a financial product that he would - in later years - go on to benefit from. The Pharmacy Early Payment Scheme, announced in 2012, saw banks swiftly reimburse pharmacists for providing NHS prescriptions, for a fee, before recovering the money from the government. Greensill Capital went on to provide funds for the scheme. Mr Dowden, who worked as a special adviser and deputy chief of staff at Downing Street from 2010 to 2015, was questioned about the matter on The Andrew Marr Show. The culture secretary said while he didn't know the ""full ins and outs"", he had ""no doubt"" Mr Cameron would have behaved properly throughout. ""As far as I can tell, no decision in government policy was changed as a result of any meetings that took place,"" he said. ""They'd be properly declared."" Labour's shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Rachel Reeves, said: ""These reports raise very serious questions about the conduct of former Conservative prime minister David Cameron and the access he gave Lex Greensill to ministers and Whitehall departments. ""The British people deserve answers to those questions. That's why the Conservatives should agree to an urgent inquiry so we can get to the bottom of this latest scandal."" A government spokesman said Mr Greensill had previously acted as a supply chain finance adviser and Crown Representative - adding the appointment had been unpaid and was approved in the normal manner. Neither Mr Greensill nor Mr Cameron have commented.

"Police at the scene of the accident A 16-year-old boy has died and a 15-year-old girl is critically ill after they were involved in a single-car crash near Alness in the Highlands. They were passengers in a blue Audi RS4 which was being driven by a 39-year-old man, who remains in hospital. The accident happened on the B9176, known locally as Struie Road, Fyrish, at about 21:35 on Saturday. A 22-year-old woman, who was a front-seat passenger, was also taken to hospital but has since been released. Police said the car was travelling west on the B817 but then turned right onto the B9176 when the driver appears to have lost control and hit a wall at the junction of Fyrish Substation. The 16-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene. He was a rear seat passenger along with the 15-year-old girl, who is in a critical condition. Sgt David Miller said: ""We are appealing to any other road users who were in the area around the time of the incident to contact us, did you see a blue Audi, did you pass it on the road?

"Neale Hanvey was elected to Westminster in December 2019, representing constituents in Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath Neale Hanvey has become the second MP to defect from the SNP and join Alex Salmond's new pro-independence party. On Saturday, former justice secretary Kenny MacAskill said he would stand as a candidate for the Alba Party. Mr Hanvey, who holds the Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath seat, said the new party provided ""a tonic for our movement"" . Alex Salmond launched Alba on Friday with the aim of building ""a supermajority for independence"" at Holyrood after the election in May. Mr Hanvey said: ""Like so many, I have been angered by our powerlessness in the face of Brexit and share the frustration of many who feel the aspirations of the independence movement are being ignored. ""The Alba Party provide a tonic for our movement with an unashamedly optimistic vision for Scotland's impending transition to an independent European nation."" MP Kenny MacAskill quits SNP for new Alba Party Former SNP leader Alex Salmond launches new party SNP results may cause problems for Nicola Sturgeon He added: ""The Alba party's growing membership will shape our policy priorities in the coming week. The people of Scotland will always be my priority so it's a very real honour to be standing for Alba and an independence supermajority."" The SNP said only both votes on 6 May ""can put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands - not Boris Johnson's"". A spokesman said: ""The SNP is focused on tackling Covid and securing a strong, fair and green recovery for Scotland as an independent country in a post-pandemic referendum."" Alba now has more MPs than Scottish Labour who only have Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray. Two days after it launched, the Alba Party now has a bigger presence in the Commons than either Scottish Labour or the Greens. Alex Salmond's breakaway from the SNP includes the former Scottish justice secretary Kenny MacAskill, who has talked about forming a group at Westminster - suggesting further defections to come. So far, the new party has attracted those who empathise with Alex Salmond and his desire for a bigger focus on securing Scottish independence. With Neale Hanvey and former SNP councillors Lynne Anderson and Caroline McAllister joining today, Alba also appears to be a home for those who fear that gender self-identification for trans people poses a threat to women's rights. The strongest voice for this argument within the SNP is MP Joanna Cherry who was recently dumped from the party's front bench but she has rejected speculation about her defection. Mr Hanvey had not always been on the right side of SNP officials. In February he was sacked from his frontbench role as vaccines spokesman. And during theDecember 2019 Westminster election campaignhe was suspended by the SNP after it emerged he had used anti-Semitic language on a social media post in 2016. Following his suspension Mr Hanvey said he did not consider himself to be anti-Semitic and was ""genuinely and deeply sorry"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: ""Sturgeon and Salmond may now despise each other but they are united by their obsessive determination to rip Scotland out of the United Kingdom. ""All focus should be on the pandemic and our recovery but Sturgeon's SNP and Salmond's ultra-nationalists want this election to be another divisive fight about the constitution. ""With the very real threat of a so-called Nationalist 'super majority', pro-union parties cannot sit on the fence and continuing to do so would be naive in the extreme."" SNP MP Neale Hanvey sacked from frontbench SNP to readmit MP after anti-Semitism probe Scottish Labour's campaign co-chairman Neil Bibby said: ""The defection of the controversial Neale Hanvey to the Alba Party reveals the utter disarray that the SNP is in. Scotland deserves so much better than this politics of grudge, personality and ego. ""Neale Hanvey and Kenny MacAskill must both stand down and give their constituents the chance to elect politicians more interested in guaranteeing Scotland's recovery than endlessly refighting yesterday's war."" Scottish Liberal Democrat campaign chairman Alistair Carmichael MP said: ""Like paint chipping off an old and decaying wall, Neale Hanvey's defection is the latest episode in the Nationalists' bitter, twisted and divided civil war."" Lorna Slater, co-leader of the pro-independence Scottish Greens, said the new Alba Party would not affect her party's chances of doing well at the Holyrood election. She told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme: ""I absolutely don't agree that we are competing for the same voters. Scottish green voters care about the climate, they care about fairness, they care about human rights."" The Alba Party will only be standing candidates in the regional lists in an attempt to boost pro-independence numbers at Holyrood. Supporters of Alex Salmond's new political project have had details hacked from its website. On Saturday, it emerged that the Alba Party had details hacked from its website. The party was alerted to a potential breach of the names of those supporting its events on the site, the day after its launch. It claims this was the only detail to be hacked and said users could be ""confident"" the site was now secure. A statement said: ""We apologise that our site did not withstand this breach but assure all supporters that we will not allow this type of black arts activity to deflect from our entirely positive campaign to gain a supermajority for independence in the Scottish Parliament."" The party claimed it had closed the functionality which allowed the breach at 10:30 on Saturday and informed the Information Commissioner's Office of the action. SCOTLAND'S ELECTION: THE BASICS What elections are happening?On 6 May, people across Scotland will vote to elect 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The party that wins the most seats will form the Scottish government.Find out more here. What powers does the Scottish Parliament have?MSPs pass laws on most aspects of day-to-day life in Scotland, such as health, education and transport. They also have control over some taxes and welfare benefits. Defence, foreign policy and immigration are decided by the UK Parliament. How do I vote?Â Anyone who lives in Scotland and is registered to vote is eligible, so long as they are aged 16 or over on the day of the election. You canÂregister to vote online,external. By Sir John Curtice, Professor of Politics at Strathclyde University The honest answer is, we do not know what impact the Alba Party might have until we get some opinion polls. And the early polls will be important for Alex Salmond. If they suggest that less than 5% of the public are minded to vote for his party then he is running the risk of emerging from the election empty handed. And if that persists for a couple of weeks or so then we may suddenly discover that the wind has gone out of this particular story. Remember, for example,BBC Scotland is holding its leaders' debateon Tuesday and Mr Salmond will not be there. However, what we can look at just now is evidence of opinion polls on how popular or unpopular Mr Salmond is. The Alba Party for the most part is going to be regarded by many as Alex Salmond's party and therefore what they think of Mr Salmond is likely to matter. The problem Mr Salmond faces is he is not a very popular politician anymore. We have had two opinion polls which asked people if they regarded Mr Salmond favourably or unfavourably. They both came back with the same answer - 14% of the public in Scotland regarded him favourably and among SNP voters, not much higher at about 16%. If you make the generous assumption that perhaps Mr Salmond might be able to persuade all of those people who are minded to vote for the SNP on the list and think of him favourably and vote for his party on that second ballot then, yes, you can see how he might get 7% or 8% of the vote. That would take the Alba Party over the threshold of picking up a regional list seat. But that is being pretty optimistic, in politics you rarely succeed in getting 100% of a particular niche market.

The RMT said the strikes would take place each Sunday until 2 May, with the possibility of further action if no agreement is reached with ScotRail. Key routes affected,externalcan be found on the ScotRail website. The union said the dispute centred around enhanced payments for rest-day working. ScotRail conductors to stage series of strikes ScotRail conductors vote for industrial action In a previous statement, ScotRail said it would not be able to provide the same level of services over the next six Sundays. It warned that services would be cancelled on a number of key routes and would have ""a significant impact"" on people who needed to travel, including NHS workers delivering services during the pandemic. The RMT said its members were putting themselves at risk during the crisis. General Secretary Mick Cash said: ""The wholesale cancellation of services is entirely down to ScotRailâ and their pig-headed refusal to treat their conductors with the equity and fairness that they deserve."" He said that instead of issuing statements about front-line workers who had kept essential services moving throughout the pandemic ""ScotRail should be back at the negotiating table settling this very basic issue of equality on enhancements for rest day working"".

However, on Sunday morning, the work was found covered over. Bimini, from Great Yarmouth, responded to the defacementon Twitter,external, saying they felt ""sorry for the people who felt threatened"" by the mural. In the post, they added: ""I will never stop being myself. ""I'll never shy away from living an authentically queer experience even if there are people that disagree with our existence.

"This video can not be played Oliver Dowden: ""We remain confident that we can deliver"" on vaccine rollout More than 30m people in the UK have had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, it has been announced, as the government says it is ""confident"" everyone will receive their second jab within 12 weeks. Asked about the concerns over supply, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said ""we always knew there would be ups and downs"" but the timetable was on track. Data shows more than 3.5m adults have now received their second dose. Meanwhile, the first Moderna jabs are due to arrive in the UK by late April. It is the third vaccine of seven that the UK has put in an order for - and the UK is lined up to receive 17 million doses. Like the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca jabs which are already in use, the Moderna jab is given in two doses several weeks apart. Thelatest government figures,externalshow 423,852 UK adults received a first dose of either the Pfizer or the Oxford vaccine on Saturday, taking the overall number to 30,151,287 - with 233,964 having their second dose, bringing that total to 3,527,481. Another 19 deaths of people within 28 days of a positive Covid test were recorded on Sunday, compared to 33 on the same day last week, along with a further 3,862 cases. Vaccine supply issues have continued to make the rollout bumpy. Earlier this month,the NHS warned of a significant reductionin jabs available in England in April, andthere has been a delayto Oxford-AstraZeneca shipments from India. There are also tensions from the EU over the supply of jabs. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Fosterhas said she hopes the UKwill give vaccine doses to the Republic of Ireland, in a bid to help stop the spread of infection in Northern Ireland. She said the idea was ""very practical"" and she would speak to Boris Johnson about it again. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Mr Dowden said: ""We're on track both with the rollout of the vaccine and the roadmap. ""You will have seen the ups and downs - we were surging ahead a couple of weeks ago, there's been a bit of a slow-down now. ""But that doesn't undermine our confidence that we will be able to deliver for that crucial group, the over-50s, by the middle of April and then for the rest of the adult population by the end of July."" Asked whether there will be enough supply for everyone to get their second dose, Mr Dowden said: ""That is absolutely essential and in all our planning throughout this, we have borne in mind that we have to get that second top-up and so we're confident we will be able to deliver it."" He also said the government was confident that vaccination centres could meet the 12-week deadline on second doses without resorting to mixing of vaccines - giving a Oxford jab to someone who had Pfizer first time round or vice versa. Prof Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said the Moderna vaccine was an ""extra string to our bow"" but shipments would be more limited than of the other two vaccines currently in use. He said it ""adds a further line of supply to enable the vaccine programme to move forward into the under-50s"" but with Moderna primarily directing their supplies towards the US, it is not a ""game-changer"". As of Friday,,externalmore than 3.2 million people have now had their second dose To work out whether the NHS has so far been giving doses within the 12 week-timeframe, we can go back and look at when 3.2 million people had their first dose - that was achieved by 15 January So all those 3.2 million people needed to have their second dose by 9 April; that's still 12 days away, which suggests the programme is meeting its targets, even accounting for small changes in the order of people being recalled for second doses However, the rate at which first vaccines were given accelerated sharply from mid-January - so it will become more challenging in the coming weeks to deliver the same number of second jabs Mr Dowden also said people ""still need to abide by the rules after Monday"", which is when lockdown rules are next eased in England. From Monday, six people or two households are allowed to gather together outside and the ""stay at home"" guidance will be lifted, which coincides with forecasts of warm and sunny weather in some areas. In Wales, the ""stay local"" rule was lifted on Saturday and people were allowed to meet in groups of six outside. Some experts have expressed hesitancy at the planned relaxation of rules. Prof Mark Woolhouse, who sits on a group that feeds into the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said with the vaccine rollout performing at its current rate the UK ""can get quite close to a full release"", but he was ""a little bit nervous"" about the full relaxation planned for 21 June at the earliest. Mr Dowden defended the plan, saying it was ""cautious"" - and the five week gaps between each stage means the government has ""four weeks to see the effect of the spread from the easing and then a week to prepare the rules"". What can I do from Monday... and what comes next? When will over-40s get a jab? But some have been critical of the pace. Sir Richard Sykes, chairman of the scientific body the Royal Institution, said the UK has ""gone from being cavalier to crippling caution"" when it comes to handling Covid. He told BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme: ""If we are not now well prepared to put up with anything that's thrown at us, then it's God help all of us because that's the best we can do at this point in time.""

"A group of charities is urging Boris Johnson to ""swiftly clarify"" how many Covid vaccine doses the UK is prepared to donate to poorer countries. Save the Children and the Wellcome Trust are among those calling on the PM to start donating jabs through Covax. This scheme aims to provide jabs for low and middle-income countries. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the UK does not currently have a surplus of vaccines, but when it does that surplus will be shared. The UK, which has ordered 400 million vaccine doses and will have many left over, has said itwill donate most of its surplus vaccine supply to poorer countries. The lower income countries most likely to receive the first vaccines through Covax include Afghanistan, Haiti, DR Congo, Ethiopia and Somalia. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Fosterhas said she hopesthe UK will give vaccine doses to the Republic of Ireland, in a bid to help stop the spread of infection in Northern Ireland. Ms Foster said sharing excess supply with Ireland was ""a runner"" and she will ""be making that point again"" when she speaks to Mr Johnson. The scheme to share unused vaccines with other countries 'Some countries can't afford the Covid vaccine' So far, more than 29 million UK adults have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine. In a letter, the charities say the UK is ""one of the world's highest per-capita buyers"" of vaccines and is on track to have more than 100 million surplus doses. ""There is therefore the high risk that the UK will be hoarding limited supply whilst health workers and the most vulnerable in low and middle-income countries do not have access,"" the letter says. ""The UK will be sitting on enough surplus vaccine doses to vaccinate the world's frontline health workers twice over."" The group urges the UK to immediately begin donating doses through the Covax initiative. FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:What tests are available? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? Scientist Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the UK will still have contractual access to at least 100 million surplus doses once the entire population is vaccinated, which he said ""won't be of use in the UK"". ""Now is the time to think beyond our borders,"" he said. ""The world won't be safe while any single country is still fighting the virus. ""If left to spread, it risks mutating to an extent where our vaccines and treatments no longer work. This goes beyond ethics - it's a scientific and economic imperative."" This video can not be played Covax vaccine plan: What is it and how will it work? Charities that signed the letter include anti-poverty campaigns One and Global Citizen, the Results UK charity and the Pandemic Action Network. On Sunday, Mr Dowden told Sky News' Sophy Ridge programme: ""Clearly our first priority is ensuring that we deliver vaccines in the United Kingdom ""We clearly don't currently have a surplus of vaccines. Should we get to the point where we have a surplus of vaccines, we'd make a decision on the allocation of that surplus."" The government said the UK has ""played a leading role in championing global access to coronavirus vaccines"", including a Â£548m contribution to the Covax Advance Market Commitment. This makes the UK ""one of the largest donors"" and the contribution ""has already helped 20 lower-middle countries to receive doses"". ""The prime minister has confirmed the UK will share the majority of any future surplus coronavirus vaccines from our supply with the Covax pool, when these are available,"" a spokesman said. ""No-one is safe until we are all safe.""

"More than 30m people in the UK have now received a first vaccine dose Health Secretary Matt Hancock described the figures as a 'phenomenal achievement' Nineteen people who tested positive for coronavirus within the past 28 days have died in the past 24 hours in the UK There have been a further 3,862 positive cases - the lowest UK daily figure since 17 September Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has said the Moderna vaccine is expected to be rolled out in the UK in April Mr Dowden also said he ""fully expects"" the UK to host the biggest moments of this summer's Uefa's European Championships He said he had 'every confidence' that this was England's last lockdown - but experience taught him 'you can't rule things out' Workers including lorry drivers and cabin crew travelling to England from outside the UK, who stay for two days or more, will be required to take a Covid test The chief medical director at NHS England is warning people not to ""squander the gains"" made in the latest lockdown Prof Stephen Powis says progress made so far ""does not mean job done"" In the latest step of the government's roadmap, curbs on outdoor gatherings and sports ease in England from Monday A group of charities is urging the prime minister to ""swiftly clarify"" how many Covid vaccine doses the UK is prepared to donate to poorer countries Poland has reported 29,253 new coronavirus cases on Sunday - up 34% compared with one week ago Edited by Julian Joyce That's all for today. Join us tomorrow morning for all the latest updates on the coronavirus pandemic. Your writers today were George Bowden, Jo Couzens and Victoria Lindrea. The page was edited by Julian Joyce. We're bringing our live page to a close. Here is a brief round-up of today's main headlines from the UK and around the world. The Moderna jab - due to arrive in the UK next month - will give the UK ""an extra line of security"" after concerns were raised last week that supply chains of other vaccines may be held up. So says Professor Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation ""The quantities that Moderna are capable of providing are likely to
be many fewer doses than we are seeing from AstraZeneca and Pfizer,"" Prof Finn told the PA news agency. ""Partly because they are a small outfit and partly because they are
primarily directing their supplies towards the US rather than Europe. ""So I don't think it's a game changer, I think it's an incremental change. ""It adds an extra string to our bow, if you like, and it gives us an extra line
of security."" That means it is due to arrive in the UK in the same month that the NHS has warned ofa ""significant reduction"" in vaccine supplieselsewhere. Moderna isthe third vaccine of seven that the UK has put in an order for- and the UK is lined up to receive 17 million doses.  Here's some more detail - and charts - on those figures from earlier. We carried the story of a steady fall in deaths with coronavirus - 19 deaths in the past 24 hours (reported on Sunday). The number of cases continues to dip. They are now on a par with the numbers being reported last September. Meanwhile the government's vaccination schedule remains on track. Some 57% of all UK adults have had a first jab, while 6% of adults have had a second dose, the government said. However, data shows that the rate at which first vaccines were given accelerated sharply from mid-January. But it's expected to become more of a challenge in coming weeks to deliver the same number of second jabs. Research has shown pets can have a huge benefit to our mental health - especially this past year. ""I don't know what I would have done without him,"" 24-year-old Francesca Balon tells Newsbeat. She's registered blind and credits her guide dog, Sean, with getting her through a year of lockdowns. ""He's a real character and it's funny because he's so clever when he's working but he has absolutely no common sense,"" she says. Francesca had Sean three years ago when her vision started to worsen, hitting her confidence. Read morehere. Up to six people, or two households, will be able to meet outside from Monday The Met Police has urged Londoners to remain ""vigilant"" when lockdown restrictions ease tomorrow, with groups of up to six people, or two households, able to meet outside. While people will also be allowed to take part in formally organised outdoor sport, large gatherings - unless certain exemptions apply - will remain unlawful and risk further spreading the virus, the force warned. The Met's deputy assistant commissioner, Jane Connors, said: ""We must not let Monday's news distract us, or usher in any complacency."" But she said the risk of Covid-19 ""has not vanished"" and wherever possible people should ""continue to be vigilant, minimise our contact as much as possible, wear a face covering where required and keep ourselves safe"". ""That means avoiding any large gathering,"" she added. The force said it will continue to take enforcement action and hand out fines for ""house parties or dangerous raves"", adding it makes ""no apology for our tough stance"" on shutting down large gatherings which risk public safety. Official government figures indicate 19 people who tested positive for coronavirus within the past 28 days have died in the past 24 hours. This compares to the 33 deaths reported last Sunday. Figures on Sunday and Monday tend to be lower due to a lag in reporting. Data also show there have been a further 3,862 positive cases - significantly lower than in recent days and the lowest daily figure since 17 September. As reported earlier, the number of first dose vaccinations has topped 30m - while more than 3.5m have received both doses.  The ""tireless efforts"" of medical staff, pharmacists and volunteers lay behind the success of the UK's vaccine programme, the vaccines minister has said. As the number of first jabs passes 30m, Nadhim Zahawi said he was ""immensely proud"" of the programme's speed. He urged those who are eligible for a jab - now all those over-50 - to come forward. Health Secretary Matt Hancock added: âThe vaccine is saving lives and is our route out of this pandemic. I want to say a massive thanks to the team. âWhen you get the call - get the jab.â The latest milestone was reached after Saturday saw 650,000 vaccinations in a single day, according to the Department of Health. Some 57% of all UK adults have had a jab - 6% of adults have now had a second dose, the government said. Meanwhile, the department said ""real-world"" data showed both the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines were ""highly effective"" in reducing Covid-19 among older people aged 70 years and over. For much of the past year Westminster has felt deserted. When Boris Johnson delivered his first stay-at-home order last March, the Palace of Westminster - better known as the Houses of Parliament - changed overnight. The tea rooms fell silent. The pubs shut. And the seemingly endless corridors emptied, save for a smattering of hand sanitising stations. Elizabeth Rubiopuello knows the corridors of the Palace of Westminster better than most But as many MPs Zoomed into debates from the relative comfort of home, the staff of the House of Commons Heritage Cleaning team have been present throughout. ""It's important to have the place as safe as possible for the people who are still working here,"" says Elizabeth Rubiopuello. So who are the heritage cleaners, what have they been doing differently over the past year - and what challenges have they faced? Westminster Hour'sJack Fenwick has been to Parliament to talk to them. More than 30m people in the UK have now received the first dose of a Covid vaccine. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that it was ""a phenomenal achievement"". Public Health England figures show 25,651,406 first jabs have been administered in England. Separate figures show 2,385,709 first doses have been given in Scotland, 1,387,583 in Wales and 726,589 in Northern Ireland. It brings the total number of first vaccinations across the four nations to 30,151,287. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Crowds returned to Barry Island on Saturday with travel restrictions eased Wales' first minister willset out the next steps for reopening society there on Thursdayand give hospitality bosses ""the certainty that it's looking for"". But Mark Drakeford warned he would not give ""false assurances too far into the future"" as non-essential retailers, gyms and tourism sector hope to reopen. He said he would set out ""the prospectus through the whole of April and into May"". But he told BBC One'sAndrew Marr Showit was ""inherently an uncertain time"". Drakeford said he hoped people would be able to enjoy outdoor hospitality by the end of April but meeting indoors would ""likely have to wait until May"". On Saturday, Wales became the first UK nation tolift travel restrictionswithin its borders. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Immunity explained Can you become reinfected with coronavirus if you've already had it once? It seems the answer lies in how our immune system works. The BBC'sRachel Schraer takes a look at what we know so farabout Covid immunity. Serbia has been inoculating citizens of neighbouring countries amid a surplus of vaccines and a reluctance among many Serbs to have the jab, BBC World Service reported. Queues were seen on the borders with North Macedonia and Bosnia as word got out that vaccines were being distributed for free in Belgrade. A German doctor was also reported to be among those getting a vaccine at the main centre in Belgrade, as the rollout in Germany struggles to keep pace with a third wave of coronavirus infections there. Serbia has also begun vaccinating refugees in camps, in a move praised by the UN Refugee Agency. Chris MasonPolitical correspondent The return of the legal right in England to go for a walk in the rain with five other people feels like quite a big moment. And that reminds us of something: alongside the health emergency, the hundreds of thousands of grieving relatives and an economic crisis, this is the ongoing era of liberties crushed for everyone. Thatâs why the government is so desperate to avoid the psychological whiplash of yet another slamming on of the brakes, or a reversal. Thatâs why thereâs the constant refrain of the roadmap being ""cautious, but irreversible"". And thatâs why, despite the prime ministerâs natural instinct to inject his language with optimism, thereâs been a concerted effort in recent months to manage our expectations. For this pandemic has cruelly taught us, repeatedly, that the track back to normality will contain hairpins we havenât yet seen. And for every fleeting moment of feeling like we are getting there -  itâs still another fortnight in England, at least, before itâs legal to go to the hairdressers. The abnormal has become normal, but itâs worth reminding ourselves just how remarkable it still is. We've heard that lorry drivers will be subject to a new testing regime if they come to England from outside the UK for more than two days. Now it emerges that aircraft cabin crew, prison escorts and seasonal workers are also among those affected by the new rules. From 6 April, people who stay in the country for 48 hours or more - but who are exempt from quarantine because of their job - will have to take a lateral flow test by the end of the second day. Those remaining in the UK for any longer than 2 days will then be required to take a further test every 3 days - typically on days five and eight. The tougher measures are to ""ensure we keep track of any future coronavirus variants of concern"", Grant Shapps wrote on Twitter. The new rules will primarily affect hauliers entering from Europe. Read morehere. It's worth a quick re-cap of our top story this afternoon. The government is ""confident"" everyone in the UK will get a second dose of the Covid vaccine within 12 weeks of their first, the culture secretary has said. Oliver Dowden said ""we always knew there would be ups and downs"" but the timetable was on track. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr it was ""essential"" to provide second doses and it would not require mixing vaccines. Mr Dowden added that the Moderna jab was due to arrive in the UK in April. Read morehere. New coronavirus variants that escape the protection offered by current vaccines are a ""risk"", and the answer is to vaccinate as many people as soon as possible, a leading immunologist has said. Prof Robin Shattock, of Imperial College London, told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that a rise in overall infection rates could ""potentially knock us off course"" as lockdown begins to ease. ""If we can keep [the rates] low, then hopefully cautiously we can go through these different stages of unlocking always remembering that we may need to turn back if we see a spike in cases,"" Shattock said. New variants of the virus that make current jabs ""less effective"" mean ministers should take extra care when unlocking restrictions, he said. He also described a second dose as being important for protection and that speeding these up could offer a better defence against new variants. There were no images of the president being vaccinated - although he is not usually considered camera-shy President Vladimir Putin has said he expects Russia to reach herd immunity by the end of the summer. Speaking on television, the president said he was aiming to lift all coronavirus restrictions at the same time. Mr Putin, who was vaccinated this week with a Russian-made

vaccine, also said the only side effects he experienced post jab werea brief muscle ache and some discomfort at the site of the injection. Last Monday the president revealed 6.3 million Russians had so far received one dose of a Covid vaccine - around 5% of Russia's adult population. His target is to protect 60% of adults by July - sufficient for ""collective immunity"" to stop the virus spreading. But that would require boosting the current vaccination rate from just a few thousand to more than 700,000 every day - and that's just a single dose of the vaccine,reports the BBC's Sarah Rainsford. The daily count of deaths with coronavirus in Russia has reached 95,818 since the pandemic began - though the number of excess deaths recorded so far is some four times higher.  The UK's year of lockdowns has had a profound effect on crime and criminal justice. From the first coronavirus fines for everyday activity, to sudden fluctuations in offences because of the impact of restrictions on our lives, these changes to community safety will have a lasting impact for years to come. From fewer thefts in lockdown to a spike in recorded drug offences, the BBC's Dominic Casciani & Ben Butcherhave taken a deeper look. The Irish Government has said it is ""not aware of any specific plans"" by the UK to share its vaccine supply ""at this stage"". It follows a story in the Sunday Times which reported the UK was planning to give 3.7 million vaccines to Ireland when it had spare capacity. ""The UK has previously indicated that once it has achieved a high level of vaccination of its own population, it would consider sharing vaccines with other countries,"" a spokesman for the Irish Government said on Sunday. But added there were no ""specific plans"" currently. ""The Irish and UK governments maintain close contact across all matters of common interest."" Speaking on Sunday morning, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said there was no vaccine surplus at present. ""We clearly don't currently have a surplus of vaccines. Should we get to the point where we have a surplus of vaccines we'd make a decision on the allocation of that surplus."" ""Our first priority is to deliver vaccines in the UK,"" he told Sky News' Sophy Ridge. Earlier this month,the NHS warned of a significant reductionin jabs available in England in April, andthere has been a delayto Oxford-AstraZeneca shipments from India. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The government has rejected a request for Â£170m in financial support for Liberty Steel. The firm's founder Sanjeev Gupta sent a letter last week asking for help to pay day-to-day operating expenses and absorb recent losses. Liberty's owner GFG employs 5,000 staff at its 12 UK sites, which include Rotherham, Motherwell and Newport. GFG's key financial backer, Greensill Capital, filed for insolvency earlier this month. 'If the steelworks shuts it will destroy Rotherham' Liberty Steel: Government looking at 'all options' Liberty Steel asks customers to pay up front Government sources told the BBC last week they had concerns about the ""opaque"" nature of Mr Gupta's empire, which employs 35,000 worldwide. Any assistance was more likely to come following an administration process, the sources indicated, to support UK jobs as opposed to the corporate entity that owns it. GFG, a holding company for Mr Gupta's assets, was the biggest recipient of finance from Greensill. Lucy Powell, Labour's shadow minister for business and consumer affairs, told the BBC that some sort of support was needed. ""The financial structure and the tie in to the Greensill administration is very complex so I'm not surprised by this but, as we've been calling for two or three weeks now, the government really does need to lay out a plan B for what it is going to do to support domestic steel making and retain these cutting edge viable plants in the UK."" For metal workers in Rotherham, a town steeped in steel, this uncertainty will feel all too familiar. It has been a difficult few decades for the UK's steel industry, now a fraction of its previous size. Many of the major plants have gone under only to be rescued and passed through different pairs of hands. Only four years ago, Sanjeev Gupta stepped in to save the Rotherham plan under the brand of Liberty Steel. Now he's battling to secure finance for it and the rest of his UK business. However, the UK government's rejection of his loan request may not mean the end of the road for Liberty and the five thousand people it employs. Analysts point to the example of British Steel, which was funded by UK taxpayers for almost a year after it went into administration until it was sold on to a Chinese firm in March 2020.

"Mourners at the funeral on Sunday for protester Kyaw Win Maung in Mandalay The killing of more than 100 anti-coup protesters in Myanmar has drawn global outrage, with defence ministers of 12 nations condemning the military. The US accused the security forces of a ""reign of terror"" on Saturday, the deadliest day since last month's coup. Coup leader Min Aung Hlaing and his generals still threw a lavish party that night for Armed Forces Day. On Sunday, funerals were held, with some reports the military had tried to intervene in the mourning. More than 400 people have now been killed in the suppression of protests in Myanmar since the 1 February coup. The victims of Myanmar's deadliest day Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? The military seized control of the South East Asian country after an election which Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party won by a landslide. The defence chiefs of a dozen nations, including the UK, on Sunday issued a rare joint statement condemning the military's violent actions. The US, Japan and Australia were also among the signatories of a statement that said: ""A professional military follows international standards for conduct and is responsible for protecting - not harming - the people it serves."" The UK government has also urged all British nationals in Myanmar to ""leave the country as soon as possible"". The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said the advice ""follows the significant increase in violence on 27 March"". ""We were previously advising British nationals to leave unless they had an urgent need to stay,"" it added. Security forces opened fire in more than 40 locations on Saturday. The commercial centre, Yangon, saw dozens of deaths, but killings were recorded from Kachin in the north to Taninthartharyi in the far south. Demonstrators with an image of detained leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Mandalay The US said it was ""horrified"" by the killings. Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused the military of ""sacrificing the lives of the people to serve the few."" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was ""deeply shocked"" by the violence, and British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called it a ""new low"". UN Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews called for an international emergency summit. China and Russia have not joined the criticism, which means taking action through the UN Security Council - where they have vetoes - could be difficult. The luxury military party on Saturday was held to mark the annual Armed Forces Day, which commemorates the start of Myanmar's military resistance against Japanese occupation in 1945. Images from state TV shared on social media showed military officials, including Min Aung Hlaing, wearing white uniforms and bow ties, walking along a red carpet smiling, and seated at large tables for dinner. The event drew an angry response from some on social media, including Burmese activist Maung Zarni. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A number of Twitter posts placed pictures of the party alongside images of victims. Earlier on Saturday, the military held a parade and heard a speech from Min Aung Hlaing, who said he wanted to ""safeguard democracy"" but also warned against ""violent acts"". The military held a parade to mark Armed Forces Day Representatives of Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand attended. On Sunday, families held funerals for some of those killed the day before. One was for Kyaw Win Maung, who was shot dead in Mandalay. Street tales from Myanmar: 'Take care of our baby if I die' 1988 v 2021: A tale of two Myanmar protests Another service in the city was held for Aye Ko, a father of four. ""We are told by the neighbours that Aye Ko was shot and thrown into the fire,"" one relative told AFP news agency. ""He was the only one who fed the family, losing him is a great loss for the family."" Witnesses told Reuters news agency that security forces opened fire at a funeral for a 20-year-old student in the city of Bago ""While we [were] singing the revolution song for him, security forces just arrived and shot at us,"" a woman who was at the service said. ""People, including us, ran away as they opened fire."" There were no immediate reports of casualties. There were no reports of large-scale protests in Yangon or Mandalay, which saw the most casualties in Saturday's crackdowns. But there were rallies in towns including Katha and Hsipaw, according to reports. Twelve deaths were recorded on Sunday by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) advocacy group. This video can not be played Myanmar coup: How did we get here? Moe Myint, BBC Burmese Fourteen-year-old Pan Ei Phyu's mother says she rushed to close all the doors when she heard the military coming down her street. But she wasn't fast enough. A moment later, she was holding her daughter's blood-soaked body. ""I saw her collapse and initially thought she just slipped and fell. But then blood spurted out from her chest,"" she told BBC Burmese from Meiktila in central Myanmar. It was the randomness of Saturday's killings that was particularly shocking. Armed with battlefield weapons, the security forces appeared willing to shoot anyone they saw on the streets. The brutality they showed they were capable of is on another level from what we have seen since the coup. Neither side - the military nor the pro-democracy movement - is willing to back down. The military thinks it can terrorise people to achieve ""stability and security"". But the movement on the streets, led by young people, is determined to rid the country of the military dictatorship once and for all. It's painful to have to count the mounting dead, especially the children. Myanmar, also known as Burma, became independent from Britain in 1948. For much of its modern history, it has been under military rule Restrictions began loosening from 2010 onwards, leading to free elections in 2015 and the installation of a government headed by veteran opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi the following year In 2017, Myanmar's army responded to attacks on police by Rohingya militants with a deadly crackdown, driving more than half a million Rohingya Muslims across the border into Bangladesh in what the UN later called a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" Country profile The general who returned Myanmar to military rule Who are the rulers who executed Myanmar activists?

"Tugboats managed to move the Ever Given 30 degrees in both directions, but it is still stuck A giant container ship remains stuck across Egypt's Suez Canal after attempts to dislodge it on Saturday's high tide failed. Canal officials said some progress had been made, however, and more tugboats were joining the effort on Sunday. Alternative arrangements are being put in place in case the operation fails. Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has ordered preparations to lighten the load of the stranded ship. That would involve transferring some containers to another vessel or to the canal bank. Experts earlier told the BBC that such an operation would involve bringing in specialist equipment, including a crane that would need to stretch more than 60m (200ft) high, and could take weeks. The Suez Canal is one of the world's busiest trade routes, and the Ever Given - part of the Evergreen fleet - has been wedged in it since Tuesday. More than 300 ships are stuck on either side of the blockage and some vessels have had to reroute around Africa. 'Our customers are worried about the Suez blockage' How do you refloat a giant cargo ship? The Suez Canal blockage in numbers In pictures: Efforts to shift huge ship from canal On Saturday 14 tugboats pulled and pushed the Ever Given at high tide to try to dislodge it. At the same time, dredgers continued to remove thousands of tonnes of sand and clay from where the bow was trapped in the canal's bank. Although strong tides and winds complicated efforts, the tugboats managed to move the ship ""30 degrees from left and right"", said General Osama Rabie, chairman of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA). Footage posted on Twitter appeared to show the tugboats honking their horns to celebrate this small victory. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The SCA said in a statement that dredgers had so far shifted 27,000 cubic metres of sand to a depth of 18m (59ft). Gen Rabie said on Sunday that although the vessel was still stuck there were ""positive indicators"" from the past two days' efforts. ""The rudder was not moving and it is now moving, the propeller is working now, there was no water underneath the bow, and now there is water under it, and yesterday there was a 4m (13ft) deviation in the bow and the stern,"" he told Egyptian state TV. It may be necessary to remove containers to raise the ship in the water However, in a possible complication, SCA sources quoted by Reuters news agency said that a mass of rock had been discovered under the bow of the ship. Gen Rabie said that President Sisi had ordered preparations for the possible removal of some of the ship's 18,300 containers. He had previously said he hoped such an operation would not be necessary. Initial reports said the 400m-long (1,300ft), 200,000-tonne vessel ran aground due to high winds and a sandstorm that affected visibility. However, Gen Rabie said on Saturday that weather conditions were ""not the main reasons"" for the ship's grounding. ""There may have been technical or human errors,"" he told reporters, without giving details. ""All of these factors will become apparent in the investigation."" This video can not be played A salvage company, working to free the Ever Given, says the operation could take weeks About 12% of global trade passes through the 193km (120-mile) canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. An alternative route, around the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa, can take two weeks longer. According to data from Lloyd's List, the blockage is holding up an estimated $9.6bn (Â£7bn) of goods each day - or $400m an hour. Gen Rabie estimated that Egypt was losing up to $14m in revenue each day that the canal was closed. In Syria, authorities have begun to ration fuel after supplies were held up by the stalled traffic in the Suez Canal. The war-torn country was already struggling with power cuts and inflation pushing up the price of goods.

"ScotRail has warned passengers of disruption across the country as conductors stage a series of 24-hour strikes in a dispute over overtime payments. A number of services have been cancelled. The RMT said the strikes would take place each Sunday until 2 May, with the possibility of further action if no agreement is reached with ScotRail. Key routes affected,externalcan be found on the ScotRail website. The union said the dispute centred around enhanced payments for rest-day working. ScotRail conductors to stage series of strikes ScotRail conductors vote for industrial action In a previous statement, ScotRail said it would not be able to provide the same level of services over the next six Sundays. It warned that services would be cancelled on a number of key routes and would have ""a significant impact"" on people who needed to travel, including NHS workers delivering services during the pandemic. The RMT said its members were putting themselves at risk during the crisis. General Secretary Mick Cash said: ""The wholesale cancellation of services is entirely down to ScotRailâ and their pig-headed refusal to treat their conductors with the equity and fairness that they deserve."" He said that instead of issuing statements about front-line workers who had kept essential services moving throughout the pandemic ""ScotRail should be back at the negotiating table settling this very basic issue of equality on enhancements for rest day working"". The RMT is currently balloting ScotRail ticket examiners for strike action over the same issue. The ballot runs until 8 April.

Join us tomorrow morning for all the latest updates on the coronavirus pandemic. Your writers today were George Bowden, Jo Couzens and Victoria Lindrea. The page was edited by Julian Joyce. We're bringing our live page to a close. Here is a brief round-up of today's main headlines from the UK and around the world. The Moderna jab - due to arrive in the UK next month - will give the UK ""an extra line of security"" after concerns were raised last week that supply chains of other vaccines may be held up. So says Professor Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation ""The quantities that Moderna are capable of providing are likely to
be many fewer doses than we are seeing from AstraZeneca and Pfizer,"" Prof Finn told the PA news agency. ""Partly because they are a small outfit and partly because they are
primarily directing their supplies towards the US rather than Europe. ""So I don't think it's a game changer, I think it's an incremental change. ""It adds an extra string to our bow, if you like, and it gives us an extra line
of security."" That means it is due to arrive in the UK in the same month that the NHS has warned ofa ""significant reduction"" in vaccine supplieselsewhere. Moderna isthe third vaccine of seven that the UK has put in an order for- and the UK is lined up to receive 17 million doses.  Here's some more detail - and charts - on those figures from earlier. We carried the story of a steady fall in deaths with coronavirus - 19 deaths in the past 24 hours (reported on Sunday). The number of cases continues to dip. They are now on a par with the numbers being reported last September. Meanwhile the government's vaccination schedule remains on track. Some 57% of all UK adults have had a first jab, while 6% of adults have had a second dose, the government said. However, data shows that the rate at which first vaccines were given accelerated sharply from mid-January. But it's expected to become more of a challenge in coming weeks to deliver the same number of second jabs. Research has shown pets can have a huge benefit to our mental health - especially this past year. ""I don't know what I would have done without him,"" 24-year-old Francesca Balon tells Newsbeat. She's registered blind and credits her guide dog, Sean, with getting her through a year of lockdowns. ""He's a real character and it's funny because he's so clever when he's working but he has absolutely no common sense,"" she says. Francesca had Sean three years ago when her vision started to worsen, hitting her confidence. Read morehere. Up to six people, or two households, will be able to meet outside from Monday The Met Police has urged Londoners to remain ""vigilant"" when lockdown restrictions ease tomorrow, with groups of up to six people, or two households, able to meet outside. While people will also be allowed to take part in formally organised outdoor sport, large gatherings - unless certain exemptions apply - will remain unlawful and risk further spreading the virus, the force warned. The Met's deputy assistant commissioner, Jane Connors, said: ""We must not let Monday's news distract us, or usher in any complacency."" But she said the risk of Covid-19 ""has not vanished"" and wherever possible people should ""continue to be vigilant, minimise our contact as much as possible, wear a face covering where required and keep ourselves safe"". ""That means avoiding any large gathering,"" she added. The force said it will continue to take enforcement action and hand out fines for ""house parties or dangerous raves"", adding it makes ""no apology for our tough stance"" on shutting down large gatherings which risk public safety. Official government figures indicate 19 people who tested positive for coronavirus within the past 28 days have died in the past 24 hours. This compares to the 33 deaths reported last Sunday. Figures on Sunday and Monday tend to be lower due to a lag in reporting. Data also show there have been a further 3,862 positive cases - significantly lower than in recent days and the lowest daily figure since 17 September. As reported earlier, the number of first dose vaccinations has topped 30m - while more than 3.5m have received both doses.  The ""tireless efforts"" of medical staff, pharmacists and volunteers lay behind the success of the UK's vaccine programme, the vaccines minister has said. As the number of first jabs passes 30m, Nadhim Zahawi said he was ""immensely proud"" of the programme's speed. He urged those who are eligible for a jab - now all those over-50 - to come forward. Health Secretary Matt Hancock added: âThe vaccine is saving lives and is our route out of this pandemic. I want to say a massive thanks to the team. âWhen you get the call - get the jab.â The latest milestone was reached after Saturday saw 650,000 vaccinations in a single day, according to the Department of Health. Some 57% of all UK adults have had a jab - 6% of adults have now had a second dose, the government said. Meanwhile, the department said ""real-world"" data showed both the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines were ""highly effective"" in reducing Covid-19 among older people aged 70 years and over. For much of the past year Westminster has felt deserted. When Boris Johnson delivered his first stay-at-home order last March, the Palace of Westminster - better known as the Houses of Parliament - changed overnight. The tea rooms fell silent. The pubs shut. And the seemingly endless corridors emptied, save for a smattering of hand sanitising stations. Elizabeth Rubiopuello knows the corridors of the Palace of Westminster better than most But as many MPs Zoomed into debates from the relative comfort of home, the staff of the House of Commons Heritage Cleaning team have been present throughout. ""It's important to have the place as safe as possible for the people who are still working here,"" says Elizabeth Rubiopuello. So who are the heritage cleaners, what have they been doing differently over the past year - and what challenges have they faced? Westminster Hour'sJack Fenwick has been to Parliament to talk to them. More than 30m people in the UK have now received the first dose of a Covid vaccine. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that it was ""a phenomenal achievement"". Public Health England figures show 25,651,406 first jabs have been administered in England. Separate figures show 2,385,709 first doses have been given in Scotland, 1,387,583 in Wales and 726,589 in Northern Ireland. It brings the total number of first vaccinations across the four nations to 30,151,287. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But Mark Drakeford warned he would not give ""false assurances too far into the future"" as non-essential retailers, gyms and tourism sector hope to reopen. He said he would set out ""the prospectus through the whole of April and into May"". But he told BBC One'sAndrew Marr Showit was ""inherently an uncertain time"". Drakeford said he hoped people would be able to enjoy outdoor hospitality by the end of April but meeting indoors would ""likely have to wait until May"". On Saturday, Wales became the first UK nation tolift travel restrictionswithin its borders.

The BBC'sRachel Schraer takes a look at what we know so farabout Covid immunity. Serbia has been inoculating citizens of neighbouring countries amid a surplus of vaccines and a reluctance among many Serbs to have the jab, BBC World Service reported. Queues were seen on the borders with North Macedonia and Bosnia as word got out that vaccines were being distributed for free in Belgrade. A German doctor was also reported to be among those getting a vaccine at the main centre in Belgrade, as the rollout in Germany struggles to keep pace with a third wave of coronavirus infections there. Serbia has also begun vaccinating refugees in camps, in a move praised by the UN Refugee Agency. Chris MasonPolitical correspondent The return of the legal right in England to go for a walk in the rain with five other people feels like quite a big moment. And that reminds us of something: alongside the health emergency, the hundreds of thousands of grieving relatives and an economic crisis, this is the ongoing era of liberties crushed for everyone. Thatâs why the government is so desperate to avoid the psychological whiplash of yet another slamming on of the brakes, or a reversal. Thatâs why thereâs the constant refrain of the roadmap being ""cautious, but irreversible"". And thatâs why, despite the prime ministerâs natural instinct to inject his language with optimism, thereâs been a concerted effort in recent months to manage our expectations. For this pandemic has cruelly taught us, repeatedly, that the track back to normality will contain hairpins we havenât yet seen. And for every fleeting moment of feeling like we are getting there -  itâs still another fortnight in England, at least, before itâs legal to go to the hairdressers. The abnormal has become normal, but itâs worth reminding ourselves just how remarkable it still is. We've heard that lorry drivers will be subject to a new testing regime if they come to England from outside the UK for more than two days. Now it emerges that aircraft cabin crew, prison escorts and seasonal workers are also among those affected by the new rules. From 6 April, people who stay in the country for 48 hours or more - but who are exempt from quarantine because of their job - will have to take a lateral flow test by the end of the second day. Those remaining in the UK for any longer than 2 days will then be required to take a further test every 3 days - typically on days five and eight. The tougher measures are to ""ensure we keep track of any future coronavirus variants of concern"", Grant Shapps wrote on Twitter. The new rules will primarily affect hauliers entering from Europe. Read morehere. It's worth a quick re-cap of our top story this afternoon. The government is ""confident"" everyone in the UK will get a second dose of the Covid vaccine within 12 weeks of their first, the culture secretary has said. Oliver Dowden said ""we always knew there would be ups and downs"" but the timetable was on track. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr it was ""essential"" to provide second doses and it would not require mixing vaccines. Mr Dowden added that the Moderna jab was due to arrive in the UK in April. Read morehere. New coronavirus variants that escape the protection offered by current vaccines are a ""risk"", and the answer is to vaccinate as many people as soon as possible, a leading immunologist has said. Prof Robin Shattock, of Imperial College London, told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that a rise in overall infection rates could ""potentially knock us off course"" as lockdown begins to ease. ""If we can keep [the rates] low, then hopefully cautiously we can go through these different stages of unlocking always remembering that we may need to turn back if we see a spike in cases,"" Shattock said. New variants of the virus that make current jabs ""less effective"" mean ministers should take extra care when unlocking restrictions, he said. He also described a second dose as being important for protection and that speeding these up could offer a better defence against new variants. There were no images of the president being vaccinated - although he is not usually considered camera-shy President Vladimir Putin has said he expects Russia to reach herd immunity by the end of the summer. Speaking on television, the president said he was aiming to lift all coronavirus restrictions at the same time. Mr Putin, who was vaccinated this week with a Russian-made

vaccine, also said the only side effects he experienced post jab werea brief muscle ache and some discomfort at the site of the injection. Last Monday the president revealed 6.3 million Russians had so far received one dose of a Covid vaccine - around 5% of Russia's adult population. His target is to protect 60% of adults by July - sufficient for ""collective immunity"" to stop the virus spreading. But that would require boosting the current vaccination rate from just a few thousand to more than 700,000 every day - and that's just a single dose of the vaccine,reports the BBC's Sarah Rainsford. The daily count of deaths with coronavirus in Russia has reached 95,818 since the pandemic began - though the number of excess deaths recorded so far is some four times higher.  The UK's year of lockdowns has had a profound effect on crime and criminal justice. From the first coronavirus fines for everyday activity, to sudden fluctuations in offences because of the impact of restrictions on our lives, these changes to community safety will have a lasting impact for years to come. From fewer thefts in lockdown to a spike in recorded drug offences, the BBC's Dominic Casciani & Ben Butcherhave taken a deeper look. The Irish Government has said it is ""not aware of any specific plans"" by the UK to share its vaccine supply ""at this stage"". It follows a story in the Sunday Times which reported the UK was planning to give 3.7 million vaccines to Ireland when it had spare capacity. ""The UK has previously indicated that once it has achieved a high level of vaccination of its own population, it would consider sharing vaccines with other countries,"" a spokesman for the Irish Government said on Sunday. But added there were no ""specific plans"" currently. ""The Irish and UK governments maintain close contact across all matters of common interest."" Speaking on Sunday morning, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said there was no vaccine surplus at present. ""We clearly don't currently have a surplus of vaccines. Should we get to the point where we have a surplus of vaccines we'd make a decision on the allocation of that surplus."" ""Our first priority is to deliver vaccines in the UK,"" he told Sky News' Sophy Ridge. Earlier this month,the NHS warned of a significant reductionin jabs available in England in April, andthere has been a delayto Oxford-AstraZeneca shipments from India. Â© 2025 BBC.

"A much-promoted grants scheme to help householders in England insulate their home is to be scrapped within days. The Green Homes Grant (GHG) reached just 10% of the 600,000 homes the chancellor promised would be improved. The scheme will be stopped on Wednesday and the cash allocated to a separate insulation fund run by councils. The Â£300m previously allocated for the GHG will now go into a programme administered by local authorities, targeted at lower income households. Don't raid home insulation scheme, MPs urge ministers Government home insulation programme criticised Green plan to upgrade homes was 'botched', say MPs Some 19 million homes in the UK need to be insulated or the emissions from gas boilers will wreck the UK's chances of achieving its climate change targets. But the GHG scheme, which launched in September in a bid to tackle that, has struggled from the start. The government said many households were reluctant to apply for the grants - up to Â£10,000 - because they feared catching Covid from contractors coming into their homes. However, in some parts of the country installers were actually overwhelmed with demand, and families could not even get firms to answer the phone. Then checks on the way the money was spent were so stringent that some installers went out of business because payments were so badly delayed. And despite the checks, some builders appear to have hugely overcharged for their work. One joiner told me he had witnessed an installer carry out work worth Â£3,000 at most, then deliver an invoice for Â£5,000. It seems clear there is frustration in Whitehall at the American consultants brought in to manage the scheme for able-to-pay families. The parallel insulation scheme administered by local authorities is running much more smoothly but ministers still need to create a new programme to nudge able-to-pay home owners into improving their insulation for the UK to hit its climate change targets. There is no sign yet what that new programme might look like, or when it might happen. A government source pointed out that the Conservatives promised in their manifesto to spend Â£9bn on insulation - and insisted that this cash would definitely be made available. Campaigners, industry figures, and MPs saidthe current scheme was botchedand called for the Chancellor Rishi Sunak to create an insulation programme stretching for decades, so that installers and suppliers have the chance to build up stocks and expertise. Previously many firms have been driven out of the sector following stop-start government funding. On announcing the move, Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng chose to focus on the transfer of cash to the local authority fund, rather than the scrapping of the GHG. He said: ""Upgrading the country's homes with energy efficiency measures means we can cut emissions and save people money on their energy bills. ""Today's funding boost will mean even more households across England are able to access these vital grants through their local authority. ""This latest announcement takes our total energy efficiency spending to over Â£1.3bn in the next financial year, giving installers the certainty they need to plan ahead, create new jobs and train the next generation of builders, plumbers and tradespeople."" First announced last summer, the GHG scheme wasextended in November,externalfor another year until the end of March 2022. Greenpeace UK described the rollout of the GHG scheme as ""shambolic"". The organisation's Kate Blagojevic said the ""biggest hole"" in England's energy efficiency was private households and you can't ""boost the situation with a smaller pot of money"". She added: ""The government is plain wrong to try and frame it as such."" Ed Matthew, from climate change think tank E3G said: ""The end of the government's flagship green homes scheme is a tragedy that was avoidable. ""There was plenty of demand for the grants but the scheme was plagued by incompetent administration. The reality is that we can't get to net-zero without decarbonising our homes."" He called for a new grant scheme to replace it - but said it was key to get the grants out quickly. The demise of the GHG follows theprevious failure of the government's Green Dealwhich flopped because householders could get cheaper finance through their bank. Matthew Pennycook, the shadow minister for climate change, said: ""The funding announced today doesn't even come close to plugging the investment gap created by the government's decision to slash more than Â£1bn from its Green Homes Grant scheme and then scrap it altogether. ""Ministers might talk a good game on energy efficiency but their staggering ineptitude when it comes to decarbonising the country's housing stock speaks for itself"".

Some 57% of all UK adults have had a first jab, while 6% of adults have had a second dose, the government said. However, data shows that the rate at which first vaccines were given accelerated sharply from mid-January. But it's expected to become more of a challenge in coming weeks to deliver the same number of second jabs. Research has shown pets can have a huge benefit to our mental health - especially this past year. ""I don't know what I would have done without him,"" 24-year-old Francesca Balon tells Newsbeat. She's registered blind and credits her guide dog, Sean, with getting her through a year of lockdowns. ""He's a real character and it's funny because he's so clever when he's working but he has absolutely no common sense,"" she says. Francesca had Sean three years ago when her vision started to worsen, hitting her confidence. Read morehere. Up to six people, or two households, will be able to meet outside from Monday The Met Police has urged Londoners to remain ""vigilant"" when lockdown restrictions ease tomorrow, with groups of up to six people, or two households, able to meet outside. While people will also be allowed to take part in formally organised outdoor sport, large gatherings - unless certain exemptions apply - will remain unlawful and risk further spreading the virus, the force warned. The Met's deputy assistant commissioner, Jane Connors, said: ""We must not let Monday's news distract us, or usher in any complacency."" But she said the risk of Covid-19 ""has not vanished"" and wherever possible people should ""continue to be vigilant, minimise our contact as much as possible, wear a face covering where required and keep ourselves safe"". ""That means avoiding any large gathering,"" she added. The force said it will continue to take enforcement action and hand out fines for ""house parties or dangerous raves"", adding it makes ""no apology for our tough stance"" on shutting down large gatherings which risk public safety. Official government figures indicate 19 people who tested positive for coronavirus within the past 28 days have died in the past 24 hours. This compares to the 33 deaths reported last Sunday. Figures on Sunday and Monday tend to be lower due to a lag in reporting. Data also show there have been a further 3,862 positive cases - significantly lower than in recent days and the lowest daily figure since 17 September. As reported earlier, the number of first dose vaccinations has topped 30m - while more than 3.5m have received both doses.  The ""tireless efforts"" of medical staff, pharmacists and volunteers lay behind the success of the UK's vaccine programme, the vaccines minister has said. As the number of first jabs passes 30m, Nadhim Zahawi said he was ""immensely proud"" of the programme's speed. He urged those who are eligible for a jab - now all those over-50 - to come forward. Health Secretary Matt Hancock added: âThe vaccine is saving lives and is our route out of this pandemic. I want to say a massive thanks to the team. âWhen you get the call - get the jab.â The latest milestone was reached after Saturday saw 650,000 vaccinations in a single day, according to the Department of Health. Some 57% of all UK adults have had a jab - 6% of adults have now had a second dose, the government said. Meanwhile, the department said ""real-world"" data showed both the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines were ""highly effective"" in reducing Covid-19 among older people aged 70 years and over. For much of the past year Westminster has felt deserted. When Boris Johnson delivered his first stay-at-home order last March, the Palace of Westminster - better known as the Houses of Parliament - changed overnight. The tea rooms fell silent. The pubs shut. And the seemingly endless corridors emptied, save for a smattering of hand sanitising stations. Elizabeth Rubiopuello knows the corridors of the Palace of Westminster better than most But as many MPs Zoomed into debates from the relative comfort of home, the staff of the House of Commons Heritage Cleaning team have been present throughout. ""It's important to have the place as safe as possible for the people who are still working here,"" says Elizabeth Rubiopuello. So who are the heritage cleaners, what have they been doing differently over the past year - and what challenges have they faced? Westminster Hour'sJack Fenwick has been to Parliament to talk to them. More than 30m people in the UK have now received the first dose of a Covid vaccine. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that it was ""a phenomenal achievement"". Public Health England figures show 25,651,406 first jabs have been administered in England. Separate figures show 2,385,709 first doses have been given in Scotland, 1,387,583 in Wales and 726,589 in Northern Ireland. It brings the total number of first vaccinations across the four nations to 30,151,287. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Crowds returned to Barry Island on Saturday with travel restrictions eased Wales' first minister willset out the next steps for reopening society there on Thursdayand give hospitality bosses ""the certainty that it's looking for"". But Mark Drakeford warned he would not give ""false assurances too far into the future"" as non-essential retailers, gyms and tourism sector hope to reopen. He said he would set out ""the prospectus through the whole of April and into May"". But he told BBC One'sAndrew Marr Showit was ""inherently an uncertain time"". Drakeford said he hoped people would be able to enjoy outdoor hospitality by the end of April but meeting indoors would ""likely have to wait until May"". On Saturday, Wales became the first UK nation tolift travel restrictionswithin its borders. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Immunity explained Can you become reinfected with coronavirus if you've already had it once? It seems the answer lies in how our immune system works. The BBC'sRachel Schraer takes a look at what we know so farabout Covid immunity. Serbia has been inoculating citizens of neighbouring countries amid a surplus of vaccines and a reluctance among many Serbs to have the jab, BBC World Service reported. Queues were seen on the borders with North Macedonia and Bosnia as word got out that vaccines were being distributed for free in Belgrade. A German doctor was also reported to be among those getting a vaccine at the main centre in Belgrade, as the rollout in Germany struggles to keep pace with a third wave of coronavirus infections there. Serbia has also begun vaccinating refugees in camps, in a move praised by the UN Refugee Agency. Chris MasonPolitical correspondent The return of the legal right in England to go for a walk in the rain with five other people feels like quite a big moment. And that reminds us of something: alongside the health emergency, the hundreds of thousands of grieving relatives and an economic crisis, this is the ongoing era of liberties crushed for everyone. Thatâs why the government is so desperate to avoid the psychological whiplash of yet another slamming on of the brakes, or a reversal. Thatâs why thereâs the constant refrain of the roadmap being ""cautious, but irreversible"". And thatâs why, despite the prime ministerâs natural instinct to inject his language with optimism, thereâs been a concerted effort in recent months to manage our expectations. For this pandemic has cruelly taught us, repeatedly, that the track back to normality will contain hairpins we havenât yet seen. And for every fleeting moment of feeling like we are getting there -  itâs still another fortnight in England, at least, before itâs legal to go to the hairdressers. The abnormal has become normal, but itâs worth reminding ourselves just how remarkable it still is. We've heard that lorry drivers will be subject to a new testing regime if they come to England from outside the UK for more than two days. Now it emerges that aircraft cabin crew, prison escorts and seasonal workers are also among those affected by the new rules. From 6 April, people who stay in the country for 48 hours or more - but who are exempt from quarantine because of their job - will have to take a lateral flow test by the end of the second day. Those remaining in the UK for any longer than 2 days will then be required to take a further test every 3 days - typically on days five and eight. The tougher measures are to ""ensure we keep track of any future coronavirus variants of concern"", Grant Shapps wrote on Twitter. The new rules will primarily affect hauliers entering from Europe. Read morehere. It's worth a quick re-cap of our top story this afternoon. The government is ""confident"" everyone in the UK will get a second dose of the Covid vaccine within 12 weeks of their first, the culture secretary has said. Oliver Dowden said ""we always knew there would be ups and downs"" but the timetable was on track. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr it was ""essential"" to provide second doses and it would not require mixing vaccines. Mr Dowden added that the Moderna jab was due to arrive in the UK in April. Read morehere. New coronavirus variants that escape the protection offered by current vaccines are a ""risk"", and the answer is to vaccinate as many people as soon as possible, a leading immunologist has said. Prof Robin Shattock, of Imperial College London, told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that a rise in overall infection rates could ""potentially knock us off course"" as lockdown begins to ease. ""If we can keep [the rates] low, then hopefully cautiously we can go through these different stages of unlocking always remembering that we may need to turn back if we see a spike in cases,"" Shattock said. New variants of the virus that make current jabs ""less effective"" mean ministers should take extra care when unlocking restrictions, he said. He also described a second dose as being important for protection and that speeding these up could offer a better defence against new variants. There were no images of the president being vaccinated - although he is not usually considered camera-shy President Vladimir Putin has said he expects Russia to reach herd immunity by the end of the summer. Speaking on television, the president said he was aiming to lift all coronavirus restrictions at the same time. Mr Putin, who was vaccinated this week with a Russian-made

vaccine, also said the only side effects he experienced post jab werea brief muscle ache and some discomfort at the site of the injection. Last Monday the president revealed 6.3 million Russians had so far received one dose of a Covid vaccine - around 5% of Russia's adult population. His target is to protect 60% of adults by July - sufficient for ""collective immunity"" to stop the virus spreading. But that would require boosting the current vaccination rate from just a few thousand to more than 700,000 every day - and that's just a single dose of the vaccine,reports the BBC's Sarah Rainsford. The daily count of deaths with coronavirus in Russia has reached 95,818 since the pandemic began - though the number of excess deaths recorded so far is some four times higher.  The UK's year of lockdowns has had a profound effect on crime and criminal justice. From the first coronavirus fines for everyday activity, to sudden fluctuations in offences because of the impact of restrictions on our lives, these changes to community safety will have a lasting impact for years to come. From fewer thefts in lockdown to a spike in recorded drug offences, the BBC's Dominic Casciani & Ben Butcherhave taken a deeper look. The Irish Government has said it is ""not aware of any specific plans"" by the UK to share its vaccine supply ""at this stage"". It follows a story in the Sunday Times which reported the UK was planning to give 3.7 million vaccines to Ireland when it had spare capacity. ""The UK has previously indicated that once it has achieved a high level of vaccination of its own population, it would consider sharing vaccines with other countries,"" a spokesman for the Irish Government said on Sunday. But added there were no ""specific plans"" currently. ""The Irish and UK governments maintain close contact across all matters of common interest."" Speaking on Sunday morning, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said there was no vaccine surplus at present. ""We clearly don't currently have a surplus of vaccines. Should we get to the point where we have a surplus of vaccines we'd make a decision on the allocation of that surplus."" ""Our first priority is to deliver vaccines in the UK,"" he told Sky News' Sophy Ridge. Earlier this month,the NHS warned of a significant reductionin jabs available in England in April, andthere has been a delayto Oxford-AstraZeneca shipments from India. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Mourners at the funeral on Sunday for protester Kyaw Win Maung in Mandalay The killing of more than 100 anti-coup protesters in Myanmar has drawn global outrage, with defence ministers of 12 nations condemning the military. The US accused the security forces of a ""reign of terror"" on Saturday, the deadliest day since last month's coup. Coup leader Min Aung Hlaing and his generals still threw a lavish party that night for Armed Forces Day. On Sunday, funerals were held, with some reports the military had tried to intervene in the mourning. More than 400 people have now been killed in the suppression of protests in Myanmar since the 1 February coup. The victims of Myanmar's deadliest day Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? The military seized control of the South East Asian country after an election which Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party won by a landslide. The defence chiefs of a dozen nations, including the UK, on Sunday issued a rare joint statement condemning the military's violent actions. The US, Japan and Australia were also among the signatories of a statement that said: ""A professional military follows international standards for conduct and is responsible for protecting - not harming - the people it serves."" The UK government has also urged all British nationals in Myanmar to ""leave the country as soon as possible"". The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said the advice ""follows the significant increase in violence on 27 March"". ""We were previously advising British nationals to leave unless they had an urgent need to stay,"" it added. Security forces opened fire in more than 40 locations on Saturday. The commercial centre, Yangon, saw dozens of deaths, but killings were recorded from Kachin in the north to Taninthartharyi in the far south. Demonstrators with an image of detained leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Mandalay The US said it was ""horrified"" by the killings. Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused the military of ""sacrificing the lives of the people to serve the few."" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was ""deeply shocked"" by the violence, and British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called it a ""new low"". UN Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews called for an international emergency summit. China and Russia have not joined the criticism, which means taking action through the UN Security Council - where they have vetoes - could be difficult. The luxury military party on Saturday was held to mark the annual Armed Forces Day, which commemorates the start of Myanmar's military resistance against Japanese occupation in 1945. Images from state TV shared on social media showed military officials, including Min Aung Hlaing, wearing white uniforms and bow ties, walking along a red carpet smiling, and seated at large tables for dinner. The event drew an angry response from some on social media, including Burmese activist Maung Zarni. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""People, including us, ran away as they opened fire."" There were no immediate reports of casualties. There were no reports of large-scale protests in Yangon or Mandalay, which saw the most casualties in Saturday's crackdowns.

"Neale Hanvey was elected to Westminster in December 2019, representing constituents in Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath Neale Hanvey has become the second MP to defect from the SNP and join Alex Salmond's new pro-independence party. On Saturday, former justice secretary Kenny MacAskill said he would stand as a candidate for the Alba Party. Mr Hanvey, who holds the Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath seat, said the new party provided ""a tonic for our movement"" . Alex Salmond launched Alba on Friday with the aim of building ""a supermajority for independence"" at Holyrood after the election in May. Mr Hanvey said: ""Like so many, I have been angered by our powerlessness in the face of Brexit and share the frustration of many who feel the aspirations of the independence movement are being ignored. ""The Alba Party provide a tonic for our movement with an unashamedly optimistic vision for Scotland's impending transition to an independent European nation."" MP Kenny MacAskill quits SNP for new Alba Party Former SNP leader Alex Salmond launches new party SNP results may cause problems for Nicola Sturgeon He added: ""The Alba party's growing membership will shape our policy priorities in the coming week. The people of Scotland will always be my priority so it's a very real honour to be standing for Alba and an independence supermajority."" The SNP said only both votes on 6 May ""can put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands - not Boris Johnson's"". A spokesman said: ""The SNP is focused on tackling Covid and securing a strong, fair and green recovery for Scotland as an independent country in a post-pandemic referendum."" Alba now has more MPs than Scottish Labour who only have Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray. Two days after it launched, the Alba Party now has a bigger presence in the Commons than either Scottish Labour or the Greens. Alex Salmond's breakaway from the SNP includes the former Scottish justice secretary Kenny MacAskill, who has talked about forming a group at Westminster - suggesting further defections to come. So far, the new party has attracted those who empathise with Alex Salmond and his desire for a bigger focus on securing Scottish independence. With Neale Hanvey and former SNP councillors Lynne Anderson and Caroline McAllister joining today, Alba also appears to be a home for those who fear that gender self-identification for trans people poses a threat to women's rights. The strongest voice for this argument within the SNP is MP Joanna Cherry who was recently dumped from the party's front bench but she has rejected speculation about her defection. Mr Hanvey had not always been on the right side of SNP officials. In February he was sacked from his frontbench role as vaccines spokesman. And during theDecember 2019 Westminster election campaignhe was suspended by the SNP after it emerged he had used anti-Semitic language on a social media post in 2016. Following his suspension Mr Hanvey said he did not consider himself to be anti-Semitic and was ""genuinely and deeply sorry"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: ""Sturgeon and Salmond may now despise each other but they are united by their obsessive determination to rip Scotland out of the United Kingdom. ""All focus should be on the pandemic and our recovery but Sturgeon's SNP and Salmond's ultra-nationalists want this election to be another divisive fight about the constitution. ""With the very real threat of a so-called Nationalist 'super majority', pro-union parties cannot sit on the fence and continuing to do so would be naive in the extreme."" SNP MP Neale Hanvey sacked from frontbench SNP to readmit MP after anti-Semitism probe Scottish Labour's campaign co-chairman Neil Bibby said: ""The defection of the controversial Neale Hanvey to the Alba Party reveals the utter disarray that the SNP is in. Scotland deserves so much better than this politics of grudge, personality and ego. ""Neale Hanvey and Kenny MacAskill must both stand down and give their constituents the chance to elect politicians more interested in guaranteeing Scotland's recovery than endlessly refighting yesterday's war."" Scottish Liberal Democrat campaign chairman Alistair Carmichael MP said: ""Like paint chipping off an old and decaying wall, Neale Hanvey's defection is the latest episode in the Nationalists' bitter, twisted and divided civil war."" Lorna Slater, co-leader of the pro-independence Scottish Greens, said the new Alba Party would not affect her party's chances of doing well at the Holyrood election. She told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme: ""I absolutely don't agree that we are competing for the same voters. Scottish green voters care about the climate, they care about fairness, they care about human rights."" The Alba Party will only be standing candidates in the regional lists in an attempt to boost pro-independence numbers at Holyrood. Supporters of Alex Salmond's new political project have had details hacked from its website. On Saturday, it emerged that the Alba Party had details hacked from its website. The party was alerted to a potential breach of the names of those supporting its events on the site, the day after its launch. It claims this was the only detail to be hacked and said users could be ""confident"" the site was now secure. A statement said: ""We apologise that our site did not withstand this breach but assure all supporters that we will not allow this type of black arts activity to deflect from our entirely positive campaign to gain a supermajority for independence in the Scottish Parliament."" The party claimed it had closed the functionality which allowed the breach at 10:30 on Saturday and informed the Information Commissioner's Office of the action.

By Sir John Curtice, Professor of Politics at Strathclyde University The honest answer is, we do not know what impact the Alba Party might have until we get some opinion polls. And the early polls will be important for Alex Salmond. If they suggest that less than 5% of the public are minded to vote for his party then he is running the risk of emerging from the election empty handed. And if that persists for a couple of weeks or so then we may suddenly discover that the wind has gone out of this particular story. Remember, for example,BBC Scotland is holding its leaders' debateon Tuesday and Mr Salmond will not be there. However, what we can look at just now is evidence of opinion polls on how popular or unpopular Mr Salmond is. The Alba Party for the most part is going to be regarded by many as Alex Salmond's party and therefore what they think of Mr Salmond is likely to matter. The problem Mr Salmond faces is he is not a very popular politician anymore. We have had two opinion polls which asked people if they regarded Mr Salmond favourably or unfavourably. They both came back with the same answer - 14% of the public in Scotland regarded him favourably and among SNP voters, not much higher at about 16%. If you make the generous assumption that perhaps Mr Salmond might be able to persuade all of those people who are minded to vote for the SNP on the list and think of him favourably and vote for his party on that second ballot then, yes, you can see how he might get 7% or 8% of the vote. That would take the Alba Party over the threshold of picking up a regional list seat. But that is being pretty optimistic, in politics you rarely succeed in getting 100% of a particular niche market.

"The 64-year-old general has spent his entire career in the influential military Min Aung Hlaing rose steadily through the ranks of the Tatmadaw, Myanmar's powerful military, but as commander-in-chief for the past decade he also wielded significant political influence before the 1 February coup. He successfully maintained the Tatmadaw's power even as Myanmar transitioned to democracy, but received international condemnation and sanctions for his alleged role in the military's attacks of ethnic minorities. As Myanmar returns to military rule under his leadership, Min Aung Hlaing now looks set to extend his power and shape the country's immediate future. Myanmar's coup: Why now - and what's next? Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi The 64-year-old general has spent his entire career in the influential military, which he joined as a cadet. A former law student at Yangon University, he entered the Defence Services Academy on his third attempt in 1974. The relatively unassuming infantryman kept getting regular promotions and moved up the ladder, eventually becoming commander of the Bureau of Special Operations-2 in 2009. Myanmar has the second-largest army in South East Asia In this role, he oversaw operations in north-eastern Myanmar, which led to tens of thousands of ethnic minority refugees fleeing the eastern Shan province and the Kokang region, along the Chinese border. Despite allegations of murder, rape and arson against his troops, Min Aung Hlaing continued to rise and in August 2010 he became joint chief of staff. Less than a year later, he was tapped for the military's top post ahead of more senior generals, succeeding long-time leader Than Shwe as commander-in-chief in March 2011. When Min Aung Hlaing became military chief, blogger and writer Hla Oo - who said they had known each other in childhood - described him as ""a battle-hardened warrior of brutal Burmese Army"", but also called him a ""serious scholar and gentleman"". Min Aung Hlaing began his tenure as military chief as Myanmar transitioned to democracy in 2011 after decades of military rule, but remained keen on maintaining the Tatmadaw's power. His political influence and social media presence increased as the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) led the government. In 2016, when Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) came to power, he seemingly adapted to the change by working and appearing at public events with her. Min Aung Hlaing was once happy to work with Aung San Suu Kyi Despite the change, he ensured the Tatmadaw continued to hold 25% of parliamentary seats and crucial security-related cabinet portfolios, while resisting the NLD's attempts to amend the constitution and limit military power. In 2016 and 2017, the military intensified a crackdown on the Rohingya ethnic minority in the northern Rakhine state, leading to many Rohingya Muslims fleeing Myanmar. The military chief was condemned internationally for the alleged ""genocide"", and in August 2018 the UN Human Rights Council said: ""Myanmar's top military generals, including Commander-in-Chief Senior-General Min Aung Hlaing, must be investigated and prosecuted for genocide in the north of Rakhine State, as well as for crimes against humanity and war crimes in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States."" Following the council's statement, Facebook deleted his account, along with those of other individuals and organisations who it said had ""committed or enabled serious human rights abuses in the country"". The US sanctioned him twice - in 2019 for his alleged role in ""ethnic cleansing"" and human rights violations, and in July 2020 the UK also imposed sanctions on him. The November 2020 general election saw a landslide win for the NLD, according to official figures, but in subsequent months the Tatmadaw and military-backed USDP repeatedly disputed the results. The USDP made allegations of widespread electoral fraud. Those claims were dismissed by the election commission ahead of a planned parliament session on 1 February to confirm the new government. Speculation of a coup grew amid the stand-off between the government and the armed forces. On 27 January Min Aung Hlaing warned that ""the constitution shall be abolished, if not followed"", citing example of previous military coups in 1962 and 1988. His office seemingly reversed this stance by 30 January, saying that the media had misinterpreted military officials' words about abolishing the constitution. However, on the morning of 1 February, the Tatmadaw detained State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and other senior leaders, and declared a year-long state of emergency. This video can not be played The early morning arrest of regional MP Pa Pa Han was live streamed on Facebook by her husband Min Aung Hlaing assumed all state power for this period in his capacity as commander-in-chief, and immediately prioritised the alleged electoral irregularities. A meeting of the National Defence and Security Council led by him said it would investigate the fraud claims and hold new elections, effectively invalidating the NLD's win. This video can not be played How did this peace icon end up at a genocide trial? Min Aung Hlaing was originally due to step down as commander-in-chief after reaching the retirement age of 65 in July this year, but has now given himself at least another year in power - and potentially longer - with Myanmar's apparent return to military rule. As Myanmar faces an uncertain future with the state of emergency, he has cemented his power and taken charge of the country.

"More than 30m people in the UK have now received a first vaccine dose Health Secretary Matt Hancock described the figures as a 'phenomenal achievement' Nineteen people who tested positive for coronavirus within the past 28 days have died in the past 24 hours in the UK There have been a further 3,862 positive cases - the lowest UK daily figure since 17 September Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has said the Moderna vaccine is expected to be rolled out in the UK in April Mr Dowden also said he ""fully expects"" the UK to host the biggest moments of this summer's Uefa's European Championships He said he had 'every confidence' that this was England's last lockdown - but experience taught him 'you can't rule things out' Workers including lorry drivers and cabin crew travelling to England from outside the UK, who stay for two days or more, will be required to take a Covid test The chief medical director at NHS England is warning people not to ""squander the gains"" made in the latest lockdown Prof Stephen Powis says progress made so far ""does not mean job done"" In the latest step of the government's roadmap, curbs on outdoor gatherings and sports ease in England from Monday A group of charities is urging the prime minister to ""swiftly clarify"" how many Covid vaccine doses the UK is prepared to donate to poorer countries Poland has reported 29,253 new coronavirus cases on Sunday - up 34% compared with one week ago Edited by Julian Joyce That's all for today. Join us tomorrow morning for all the latest updates on the coronavirus pandemic. Your writers today were George Bowden, Jo Couzens and Victoria Lindrea. The page was edited by Julian Joyce. We're bringing our live page to a close. Here is a brief round-up of today's main headlines from the UK and around the world. The Moderna jab - due to arrive in the UK next month - will give the UK ""an extra line of security"" after concerns were raised last week that supply chains of other vaccines may be held up. So says Professor Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation ""The quantities that Moderna are capable of providing are likely to
be many fewer doses than we are seeing from AstraZeneca and Pfizer,"" Prof Finn told the PA news agency. ""Partly because they are a small outfit and partly because they are
primarily directing their supplies towards the US rather than Europe. ""So I don't think it's a game changer, I think it's an incremental change. ""It adds an extra string to our bow, if you like, and it gives us an extra line
of security."" That means it is due to arrive in the UK in the same month that the NHS has warned ofa ""significant reduction"" in vaccine supplieselsewhere. Moderna isthe third vaccine of seven that the UK has put in an order for- and the UK is lined up to receive 17 million doses.  Here's some more detail - and charts - on those figures from earlier. We carried the story of a steady fall in deaths with coronavirus - 19 deaths in the past 24 hours (reported on Sunday). The number of cases continues to dip. They are now on a par with the numbers being reported last September. Meanwhile the government's vaccination schedule remains on track. Some 57% of all UK adults have had a first jab, while 6% of adults have had a second dose, the government said. However, data shows that the rate at which first vaccines were given accelerated sharply from mid-January. But it's expected to become more of a challenge in coming weeks to deliver the same number of second jabs. Research has shown pets can have a huge benefit to our mental health - especially this past year. ""I don't know what I would have done without him,"" 24-year-old Francesca Balon tells Newsbeat. She's registered blind and credits her guide dog, Sean, with getting her through a year of lockdowns. ""He's a real character and it's funny because he's so clever when he's working but he has absolutely no common sense,"" she says. Francesca had Sean three years ago when her vision started to worsen, hitting her confidence. Read morehere. Up to six people, or two households, will be able to meet outside from Monday The Met Police has urged Londoners to remain ""vigilant"" when lockdown restrictions ease tomorrow, with groups of up to six people, or two households, able to meet outside. While people will also be allowed to take part in formally organised outdoor sport, large gatherings - unless certain exemptions apply - will remain unlawful and risk further spreading the virus, the force warned. The Met's deputy assistant commissioner, Jane Connors, said: ""We must not let Monday's news distract us, or usher in any complacency."" But she said the risk of Covid-19 ""has not vanished"" and wherever possible people should ""continue to be vigilant, minimise our contact as much as possible, wear a face covering where required and keep ourselves safe"". ""That means avoiding any large gathering,"" she added. The force said it will continue to take enforcement action and hand out fines for ""house parties or dangerous raves"", adding it makes ""no apology for our tough stance"" on shutting down large gatherings which risk public safety. Official government figures indicate 19 people who tested positive for coronavirus within the past 28 days have died in the past 24 hours. This compares to the 33 deaths reported last Sunday. Figures on Sunday and Monday tend to be lower due to a lag in reporting. Data also show there have been a further 3,862 positive cases - significantly lower than in recent days and the lowest daily figure since 17 September. As reported earlier, the number of first dose vaccinations has topped 30m - while more than 3.5m have received both doses.  The ""tireless efforts"" of medical staff, pharmacists and volunteers lay behind the success of the UK's vaccine programme, the vaccines minister has said. As the number of first jabs passes 30m, Nadhim Zahawi said he was ""immensely proud"" of the programme's speed. He urged those who are eligible for a jab - now all those over-50 - to come forward. Health Secretary Matt Hancock added: âThe vaccine is saving lives and is our route out of this pandemic. I want to say a massive thanks to the team. âWhen you get the call - get the jab.â The latest milestone was reached after Saturday saw 650,000 vaccinations in a single day, according to the Department of Health. Some 57% of all UK adults have had a jab - 6% of adults have now had a second dose, the government said. Meanwhile, the department said ""real-world"" data showed both the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines were ""highly effective"" in reducing Covid-19 among older people aged 70 years and over. For much of the past year Westminster has felt deserted. When Boris Johnson delivered his first stay-at-home order last March, the Palace of Westminster - better known as the Houses of Parliament - changed overnight. The tea rooms fell silent. The pubs shut. And the seemingly endless corridors emptied, save for a smattering of hand sanitising stations. Elizabeth Rubiopuello knows the corridors of the Palace of Westminster better than most But as many MPs Zoomed into debates from the relative comfort of home, the staff of the House of Commons Heritage Cleaning team have been present throughout. ""It's important to have the place as safe as possible for the people who are still working here,"" says Elizabeth Rubiopuello. So who are the heritage cleaners, what have they been doing differently over the past year - and what challenges have they faced? Westminster Hour'sJack Fenwick has been to Parliament to talk to them. More than 30m people in the UK have now received the first dose of a Covid vaccine. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that it was ""a phenomenal achievement"". Public Health England figures show 25,651,406 first jabs have been administered in England. Separate figures show 2,385,709 first doses have been given in Scotland, 1,387,583 in Wales and 726,589 in Northern Ireland. It brings the total number of first vaccinations across the four nations to 30,151,287. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Crowds returned to Barry Island on Saturday with travel restrictions eased Wales' first minister willset out the next steps for reopening society there on Thursdayand give hospitality bosses ""the certainty that it's looking for"". But Mark Drakeford warned he would not give ""false assurances too far into the future"" as non-essential retailers, gyms and tourism sector hope to reopen. He said he would set out ""the prospectus through the whole of April and into May"". But he told BBC One'sAndrew Marr Showit was ""inherently an uncertain time"". Drakeford said he hoped people would be able to enjoy outdoor hospitality by the end of April but meeting indoors would ""likely have to wait until May"". On Saturday, Wales became the first UK nation tolift travel restrictionswithin its borders. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Immunity explained Can you become reinfected with coronavirus if you've already had it once? It seems the answer lies in how our immune system works. The BBC'sRachel Schraer takes a look at what we know so farabout Covid immunity. Serbia has been inoculating citizens of neighbouring countries amid a surplus of vaccines and a reluctance among many Serbs to have the jab, BBC World Service reported. Queues were seen on the borders with North Macedonia and Bosnia as word got out that vaccines were being distributed for free in Belgrade. A German doctor was also reported to be among those getting a vaccine at the main centre in Belgrade, as the rollout in Germany struggles to keep pace with a third wave of coronavirus infections there. Serbia has also begun vaccinating refugees in camps, in a move praised by the UN Refugee Agency. Chris MasonPolitical correspondent The return of the legal right in England to go for a walk in the rain with five other people feels like quite a big moment. And that reminds us of something: alongside the health emergency, the hundreds of thousands of grieving relatives and an economic crisis, this is the ongoing era of liberties crushed for everyone. Thatâs why the government is so desperate to avoid the psychological whiplash of yet another slamming on of the brakes, or a reversal. Thatâs why thereâs the constant refrain of the roadmap being ""cautious, but irreversible"". And thatâs why, despite the prime ministerâs natural instinct to inject his language with optimism, thereâs been a concerted effort in recent months to manage our expectations. For this pandemic has cruelly taught us, repeatedly, that the track back to normality will contain hairpins we havenât yet seen. And for every fleeting moment of feeling like we are getting there -  itâs still another fortnight in England, at least, before itâs legal to go to the hairdressers. The abnormal has become normal, but itâs worth reminding ourselves just how remarkable it still is. We've heard that lorry drivers will be subject to a new testing regime if they come to England from outside the UK for more than two days. Now it emerges that aircraft cabin crew, prison escorts and seasonal workers are also among those affected by the new rules. From 6 April, people who stay in the country for 48 hours or more - but who are exempt from quarantine because of their job - will have to take a lateral flow test by the end of the second day. Those remaining in the UK for any longer than 2 days will then be required to take a further test every 3 days - typically on days five and eight. The tougher measures are to ""ensure we keep track of any future coronavirus variants of concern"", Grant Shapps wrote on Twitter. The new rules will primarily affect hauliers entering from Europe. Read morehere. It's worth a quick re-cap of our top story this afternoon. The government is ""confident"" everyone in the UK will get a second dose of the Covid vaccine within 12 weeks of their first, the culture secretary has said. Oliver Dowden said ""we always knew there would be ups and downs"" but the timetable was on track. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr it was ""essential"" to provide second doses and it would not require mixing vaccines. Mr Dowden added that the Moderna jab was due to arrive in the UK in April. Read morehere. New coronavirus variants that escape the protection offered by current vaccines are a ""risk"", and the answer is to vaccinate as many people as soon as possible, a leading immunologist has said. Prof Robin Shattock, of Imperial College London, told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that a rise in overall infection rates could ""potentially knock us off course"" as lockdown begins to ease. ""If we can keep [the rates] low, then hopefully cautiously we can go through these different stages of unlocking always remembering that we may need to turn back if we see a spike in cases,"" Shattock said. New variants of the virus that make current jabs ""less effective"" mean ministers should take extra care when unlocking restrictions, he said. He also described a second dose as being important for protection and that speeding these up could offer a better defence against new variants. There were no images of the president being vaccinated - although he is not usually considered camera-shy President Vladimir Putin has said he expects Russia to reach herd immunity by the end of the summer. Speaking on television, the president said he was aiming to lift all coronavirus restrictions at the same time. Mr Putin, who was vaccinated this week with a Russian-made

vaccine, also said the only side effects he experienced post jab werea brief muscle ache and some discomfort at the site of the injection. Last Monday the president revealed 6.3 million Russians had so far received one dose of a Covid vaccine - around 5% of Russia's adult population. His target is to protect 60% of adults by July - sufficient for ""collective immunity"" to stop the virus spreading. But that would require boosting the current vaccination rate from just a few thousand to more than 700,000 every day - and that's just a single dose of the vaccine,reports the BBC's Sarah Rainsford. The daily count of deaths with coronavirus in Russia has reached 95,818 since the pandemic began - though the number of excess deaths recorded so far is some four times higher.  The UK's year of lockdowns has had a profound effect on crime and criminal justice. From the first coronavirus fines for everyday activity, to sudden fluctuations in offences because of the impact of restrictions on our lives, these changes to community safety will have a lasting impact for years to come. From fewer thefts in lockdown to a spike in recorded drug offences, the BBC's Dominic Casciani & Ben Butcherhave taken a deeper look. The Irish Government has said it is ""not aware of any specific plans"" by the UK to share its vaccine supply ""at this stage"". It follows a story in the Sunday Times which reported the UK was planning to give 3.7 million vaccines to Ireland when it had spare capacity. ""The UK has previously indicated that once it has achieved a high level of vaccination of its own population, it would consider sharing vaccines with other countries,"" a spokesman for the Irish Government said on Sunday. But added there were no ""specific plans"" currently. ""The Irish and UK governments maintain close contact across all matters of common interest."" Speaking on Sunday morning, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said there was no vaccine surplus at present. ""We clearly don't currently have a surplus of vaccines. Should we get to the point where we have a surplus of vaccines we'd make a decision on the allocation of that surplus."" ""Our first priority is to deliver vaccines in the UK,"" he told Sky News' Sophy Ridge. Earlier this month,the NHS warned of a significant reductionin jabs available in England in April, andthere has been a delayto Oxford-AstraZeneca shipments from India. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Mourners at the funeral on Sunday for protester Kyaw Win Maung in Mandalay The killing of more than 100 anti-coup protesters in Myanmar has drawn global outrage, with defence ministers of 12 nations condemning the military. The US accused the security forces of a ""reign of terror"" on Saturday, the deadliest day since last month's coup. Coup leader Min Aung Hlaing and his generals still threw a lavish party that night for Armed Forces Day. On Sunday, funerals were held, with some reports the military had tried to intervene in the mourning. More than 400 people have now been killed in the suppression of protests in Myanmar since the 1 February coup. The victims of Myanmar's deadliest day Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? The military seized control of the South East Asian country after an election which Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party won by a landslide. The defence chiefs of a dozen nations, including the UK, on Sunday issued a rare joint statement condemning the military's violent actions. The US, Japan and Australia were also among the signatories of a statement that said: ""A professional military follows international standards for conduct and is responsible for protecting - not harming - the people it serves."" The UK government has also urged all British nationals in Myanmar to ""leave the country as soon as possible"". The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said the advice ""follows the significant increase in violence on 27 March"". ""We were previously advising British nationals to leave unless they had an urgent need to stay,"" it added. Security forces opened fire in more than 40 locations on Saturday. The commercial centre, Yangon, saw dozens of deaths, but killings were recorded from Kachin in the north to Taninthartharyi in the far south. Demonstrators with an image of detained leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Mandalay The US said it was ""horrified"" by the killings. Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused the military of ""sacrificing the lives of the people to serve the few."" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was ""deeply shocked"" by the violence, and British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called it a ""new low"". UN Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews called for an international emergency summit. China and Russia have not joined the criticism, which means taking action through the UN Security Council - where they have vetoes - could be difficult. The luxury military party on Saturday was held to mark the annual Armed Forces Day, which commemorates the start of Myanmar's military resistance against Japanese occupation in 1945. Images from state TV shared on social media showed military officials, including Min Aung Hlaing, wearing white uniforms and bow ties, walking along a red carpet smiling, and seated at large tables for dinner. The event drew an angry response from some on social media, including Burmese activist Maung Zarni. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A number of Twitter posts placed pictures of the party alongside images of victims. Earlier on Saturday, the military held a parade and heard a speech from Min Aung Hlaing, who said he wanted to ""safeguard democracy"" but also warned against ""violent acts"". The military held a parade to mark Armed Forces Day Representatives of Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand attended. On Sunday, families held funerals for some of those killed the day before. One was for Kyaw Win Maung, who was shot dead in Mandalay. Street tales from Myanmar: 'Take care of our baby if I die' 1988 v 2021: A tale of two Myanmar protests Another service in the city was held for Aye Ko, a father of four. ""We are told by the neighbours that Aye Ko was shot and thrown into the fire,"" one relative told AFP news agency. ""He was the only one who fed the family, losing him is a great loss for the family."" Witnesses told Reuters news agency that security forces opened fire at a funeral for a 20-year-old student in the city of Bago ""While we [were] singing the revolution song for him, security forces just arrived and shot at us,"" a woman who was at the service said. ""People, including us, ran away as they opened fire."" There were no immediate reports of casualties. There were no reports of large-scale protests in Yangon or Mandalay, which saw the most casualties in Saturday's crackdowns. But there were rallies in towns including Katha and Hsipaw, according to reports. Twelve deaths were recorded on Sunday by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) advocacy group. This video can not be played Myanmar coup: How did we get here? Moe Myint, BBC Burmese Fourteen-year-old Pan Ei Phyu's mother says she rushed to close all the doors when she heard the military coming down her street. But she wasn't fast enough. A moment later, she was holding her daughter's blood-soaked body. ""I saw her collapse and initially thought she just slipped and fell. But then blood spurted out from her chest,"" she told BBC Burmese from Meiktila in central Myanmar. It was the randomness of Saturday's killings that was particularly shocking. Armed with battlefield weapons, the security forces appeared willing to shoot anyone they saw on the streets. The brutality they showed they were capable of is on another level from what we have seen since the coup. Neither side - the military nor the pro-democracy movement - is willing to back down. The military thinks it can terrorise people to achieve ""stability and security"". But the movement on the streets, led by young people, is determined to rid the country of the military dictatorship once and for all. It's painful to have to count the mounting dead, especially the children. Myanmar, also known as Burma, became independent from Britain in 1948. For much of its modern history, it has been under military rule Restrictions began loosening from 2010 onwards, leading to free elections in 2015 and the installation of a government headed by veteran opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi the following year In 2017, Myanmar's army responded to attacks on police by Rohingya militants with a deadly crackdown, driving more than half a million Rohingya Muslims across the border into Bangladesh in what the UN later called a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" Country profile The general who returned Myanmar to military rule Who are the rulers who executed Myanmar activists?

"More than 30m people in the UK have now received a first vaccine dose Health Secretary Matt Hancock described the figures as a 'phenomenal achievement' Nineteen people who tested positive for coronavirus within the past 28 days have died in the past 24 hours in the UK There have been a further 3,862 positive cases - the lowest UK daily figure since 17 September Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has said the Moderna vaccine is expected to be rolled out in the UK in April Mr Dowden also said he ""fully expects"" the UK to host the biggest moments of this summer's Uefa's European Championships He said he had 'every confidence' that this was England's last lockdown - but experience taught him 'you can't rule things out' Workers including lorry drivers and cabin crew travelling to England from outside the UK, who stay for two days or more, will be required to take a Covid test The chief medical director at NHS England is warning people not to ""squander the gains"" made in the latest lockdown Prof Stephen Powis says progress made so far ""does not mean job done"" In the latest step of the government's roadmap, curbs on outdoor gatherings and sports ease in England from Monday A group of charities is urging the prime minister to ""swiftly clarify"" how many Covid vaccine doses the UK is prepared to donate to poorer countries Poland has reported 29,253 new coronavirus cases on Sunday - up 34% compared with one week ago Edited by Julian Joyce That's all for today. Join us tomorrow morning for all the latest updates on the coronavirus pandemic. Your writers today were George Bowden, Jo Couzens and Victoria Lindrea. The page was edited by Julian Joyce. We're bringing our live page to a close. Here is a brief round-up of today's main headlines from the UK and around the world. The Moderna jab - due to arrive in the UK next month - will give the UK ""an extra line of security"" after concerns were raised last week that supply chains of other vaccines may be held up. So says Professor Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation ""The quantities that Moderna are capable of providing are likely to
be many fewer doses than we are seeing from AstraZeneca and Pfizer,"" Prof Finn told the PA news agency. ""Partly because they are a small outfit and partly because they are
primarily directing their supplies towards the US rather than Europe. ""So I don't think it's a game changer, I think it's an incremental change. ""It adds an extra string to our bow, if you like, and it gives us an extra line
of security."" That means it is due to arrive in the UK in the same month that the NHS has warned ofa ""significant reduction"" in vaccine supplieselsewhere. Moderna isthe third vaccine of seven that the UK has put in an order for- and the UK is lined up to receive 17 million doses.  Here's some more detail - and charts - on those figures from earlier. We carried the story of a steady fall in deaths with coronavirus - 19 deaths in the past 24 hours (reported on Sunday). The number of cases continues to dip. They are now on a par with the numbers being reported last September. Meanwhile the government's vaccination schedule remains on track. Some 57% of all UK adults have had a first jab, while 6% of adults have had a second dose, the government said. However, data shows that the rate at which first vaccines were given accelerated sharply from mid-January. But it's expected to become more of a challenge in coming weeks to deliver the same number of second jabs. Research has shown pets can have a huge benefit to our mental health - especially this past year. ""I don't know what I would have done without him,"" 24-year-old Francesca Balon tells Newsbeat. She's registered blind and credits her guide dog, Sean, with getting her through a year of lockdowns. ""He's a real character and it's funny because he's so clever when he's working but he has absolutely no common sense,"" she says. Francesca had Sean three years ago when her vision started to worsen, hitting her confidence. Read morehere. Up to six people, or two households, will be able to meet outside from Monday The Met Police has urged Londoners to remain ""vigilant"" when lockdown restrictions ease tomorrow, with groups of up to six people, or two households, able to meet outside. While people will also be allowed to take part in formally organised outdoor sport, large gatherings - unless certain exemptions apply - will remain unlawful and risk further spreading the virus, the force warned. The Met's deputy assistant commissioner, Jane Connors, said: ""We must not let Monday's news distract us, or usher in any complacency."" But she said the risk of Covid-19 ""has not vanished"" and wherever possible people should ""continue to be vigilant, minimise our contact as much as possible, wear a face covering where required and keep ourselves safe"". ""That means avoiding any large gathering,"" she added. The force said it will continue to take enforcement action and hand out fines for ""house parties or dangerous raves"", adding it makes ""no apology for our tough stance"" on shutting down large gatherings which risk public safety. Official government figures indicate 19 people who tested positive for coronavirus within the past 28 days have died in the past 24 hours. This compares to the 33 deaths reported last Sunday. Figures on Sunday and Monday tend to be lower due to a lag in reporting. Data also show there have been a further 3,862 positive cases - significantly lower than in recent days and the lowest daily figure since 17 September. As reported earlier, the number of first dose vaccinations has topped 30m - while more than 3.5m have received both doses.  The ""tireless efforts"" of medical staff, pharmacists and volunteers lay behind the success of the UK's vaccine programme, the vaccines minister has said. As the number of first jabs passes 30m, Nadhim Zahawi said he was ""immensely proud"" of the programme's speed. He urged those who are eligible for a jab - now all those over-50 - to come forward. Health Secretary Matt Hancock added: âThe vaccine is saving lives and is our route out of this pandemic. I want to say a massive thanks to the team. âWhen you get the call - get the jab.â The latest milestone was reached after Saturday saw 650,000 vaccinations in a single day, according to the Department of Health. Some 57% of all UK adults have had a jab - 6% of adults have now had a second dose, the government said. Meanwhile, the department said ""real-world"" data showed both the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines were ""highly effective"" in reducing Covid-19 among older people aged 70 years and over. For much of the past year Westminster has felt deserted. When Boris Johnson delivered his first stay-at-home order last March, the Palace of Westminster - better known as the Houses of Parliament - changed overnight. The tea rooms fell silent. The pubs shut. And the seemingly endless corridors emptied, save for a smattering of hand sanitising stations. Elizabeth Rubiopuello knows the corridors of the Palace of Westminster better than most But as many MPs Zoomed into debates from the relative comfort of home, the staff of the House of Commons Heritage Cleaning team have been present throughout. ""It's important to have the place as safe as possible for the people who are still working here,"" says Elizabeth Rubiopuello. So who are the heritage cleaners, what have they been doing differently over the past year - and what challenges have they faced? Westminster Hour'sJack Fenwick has been to Parliament to talk to them. More than 30m people in the UK have now received the first dose of a Covid vaccine. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that it was ""a phenomenal achievement"". Public Health England figures show 25,651,406 first jabs have been administered in England. Separate figures show 2,385,709 first doses have been given in Scotland, 1,387,583 in Wales and 726,589 in Northern Ireland. It brings the total number of first vaccinations across the four nations to 30,151,287. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This video can not be played Coronavirus: Immunity explained Can you become reinfected with coronavirus if you've already had it once? It seems the answer lies in how our immune system works. The BBC'sRachel Schraer takes a look at what we know so farabout Covid immunity. Serbia has been inoculating citizens of neighbouring countries amid a surplus of vaccines and a reluctance among many Serbs to have the jab, BBC World Service reported. Queues were seen on the borders with North Macedonia and Bosnia as word got out that vaccines were being distributed for free in Belgrade. A German doctor was also reported to be among those getting a vaccine at the main centre in Belgrade, as the rollout in Germany struggles to keep pace with a third wave of coronavirus infections there. Serbia has also begun vaccinating refugees in camps, in a move praised by the UN Refugee Agency. Chris MasonPolitical correspondent The return of the legal right in England to go for a walk in the rain with five other people feels like quite a big moment. And that reminds us of something: alongside the health emergency, the hundreds of thousands of grieving relatives and an economic crisis, this is the ongoing era of liberties crushed for everyone. Thatâs why the government is so desperate to avoid the psychological whiplash of yet another slamming on of the brakes, or a reversal. Thatâs why thereâs the constant refrain of the roadmap being ""cautious, but irreversible"". And thatâs why, despite the prime ministerâs natural instinct to inject his language with optimism, thereâs been a concerted effort in recent months to manage our expectations. For this pandemic has cruelly taught us, repeatedly, that the track back to normality will contain hairpins we havenât yet seen. And for every fleeting moment of feeling like we are getting there -  itâs still another fortnight in England, at least, before itâs legal to go to the hairdressers. The abnormal has become normal, but itâs worth reminding ourselves just how remarkable it still is. We've heard that lorry drivers will be subject to a new testing regime if they come to England from outside the UK for more than two days. Now it emerges that aircraft cabin crew, prison escorts and seasonal workers are also among those affected by the new rules. From 6 April, people who stay in the country for 48 hours or more - but who are exempt from quarantine because of their job - will have to take a lateral flow test by the end of the second day. Those remaining in the UK for any longer than 2 days will then be required to take a further test every 3 days - typically on days five and eight. The tougher measures are to ""ensure we keep track of any future coronavirus variants of concern"", Grant Shapps wrote on Twitter. The new rules will primarily affect hauliers entering from Europe. Read morehere. It's worth a quick re-cap of our top story this afternoon. The government is ""confident"" everyone in the UK will get a second dose of the Covid vaccine within 12 weeks of their first, the culture secretary has said. Oliver Dowden said ""we always knew there would be ups and downs"" but the timetable was on track. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr it was ""essential"" to provide second doses and it would not require mixing vaccines. Mr Dowden added that the Moderna jab was due to arrive in the UK in April. Read morehere. New coronavirus variants that escape the protection offered by current vaccines are a ""risk"", and the answer is to vaccinate as many people as soon as possible, a leading immunologist has said. Prof Robin Shattock, of Imperial College London, told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that a rise in overall infection rates could ""potentially knock us off course"" as lockdown begins to ease. ""If we can keep [the rates] low, then hopefully cautiously we can go through these different stages of unlocking always remembering that we may need to turn back if we see a spike in cases,"" Shattock said. New variants of the virus that make current jabs ""less effective"" mean ministers should take extra care when unlocking restrictions, he said. He also described a second dose as being important for protection and that speeding these up could offer a better defence against new variants. There were no images of the president being vaccinated - although he is not usually considered camera-shy President Vladimir Putin has said he expects Russia to reach herd immunity by the end of the summer. Speaking on television, the president said he was aiming to lift all coronavirus restrictions at the same time. Mr Putin, who was vaccinated this week with a Russian-made

vaccine, also said the only side effects he experienced post jab werea brief muscle ache and some discomfort at the site of the injection. Last Monday the president revealed 6.3 million Russians had so far received one dose of a Covid vaccine - around 5% of Russia's adult population. His target is to protect 60% of adults by July - sufficient for ""collective immunity"" to stop the virus spreading. But that would require boosting the current vaccination rate from just a few thousand to more than 700,000 every day - and that's just a single dose of the vaccine,reports the BBC's Sarah Rainsford. The daily count of deaths with coronavirus in Russia has reached 95,818 since the pandemic began - though the number of excess deaths recorded so far is some four times higher.  The UK's year of lockdowns has had a profound effect on crime and criminal justice. From the first coronavirus fines for everyday activity, to sudden fluctuations in offences because of the impact of restrictions on our lives, these changes to community safety will have a lasting impact for years to come. From fewer thefts in lockdown to a spike in recorded drug offences, the BBC's Dominic Casciani & Ben Butcherhave taken a deeper look. The Irish Government has said it is ""not aware of any specific plans"" by the UK to share its vaccine supply ""at this stage"". It follows a story in the Sunday Times which reported the UK was planning to give 3.7 million vaccines to Ireland when it had spare capacity. ""The UK has previously indicated that once it has achieved a high level of vaccination of its own population, it would consider sharing vaccines with other countries,"" a spokesman for the Irish Government said on Sunday. But added there were no ""specific plans"" currently. ""The Irish and UK governments maintain close contact across all matters of common interest."" Speaking on Sunday morning, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said there was no vaccine surplus at present. ""We clearly don't currently have a surplus of vaccines. Should we get to the point where we have a surplus of vaccines we'd make a decision on the allocation of that surplus."" ""Our first priority is to deliver vaccines in the UK,"" he told Sky News' Sophy Ridge. Earlier this month,the NHS warned of a significant reductionin jabs available in England in April, andthere has been a delayto Oxford-AstraZeneca shipments from India. Â© 2025 BBC.

primarily directing their supplies towards the US rather than Europe. ""So I don't think it's a game changer, I think it's an incremental change. ""It adds an extra string to our bow, if you like, and it gives us an extra line
of security."" That means it is due to arrive in the UK in the same month that the NHS has warned ofa ""significant reduction"" in vaccine supplieselsewhere. Moderna isthe third vaccine of seven that the UK has put in an order for- and the UK is lined up to receive 17 million doses.  Here's some more detail - and charts - on those figures from earlier. We carried the story of a steady fall in deaths with coronavirus - 19 deaths in the past 24 hours (reported on Sunday). The number of cases continues to dip. They are now on a par with the numbers being reported last September. Meanwhile the government's vaccination schedule remains on track. Some 57% of all UK adults have had a first jab, while 6% of adults have had a second dose, the government said. However, data shows that the rate at which first vaccines were given accelerated sharply from mid-January. But it's expected to become more of a challenge in coming weeks to deliver the same number of second jabs. Research has shown pets can have a huge benefit to our mental health - especially this past year. ""I don't know what I would have done without him,"" 24-year-old Francesca Balon tells Newsbeat. She's registered blind and credits her guide dog, Sean, with getting her through a year of lockdowns. ""He's a real character and it's funny because he's so clever when he's working but he has absolutely no common sense,"" she says. Francesca had Sean three years ago when her vision started to worsen, hitting her confidence. Read morehere. Up to six people, or two households, will be able to meet outside from Monday The Met Police has urged Londoners to remain ""vigilant"" when lockdown restrictions ease tomorrow, with groups of up to six people, or two households, able to meet outside. While people will also be allowed to take part in formally organised outdoor sport, large gatherings - unless certain exemptions apply - will remain unlawful and risk further spreading the virus, the force warned. The Met's deputy assistant commissioner, Jane Connors, said: ""We must not let Monday's news distract us, or usher in any complacency."" But she said the risk of Covid-19 ""has not vanished"" and wherever possible people should ""continue to be vigilant, minimise our contact as much as possible, wear a face covering where required and keep ourselves safe"". ""That means avoiding any large gathering,"" she added. The force said it will continue to take enforcement action and hand out fines for ""house parties or dangerous raves"", adding it makes ""no apology for our tough stance"" on shutting down large gatherings which risk public safety. Official government figures indicate 19 people who tested positive for coronavirus within the past 28 days have died in the past 24 hours. This compares to the 33 deaths reported last Sunday. Figures on Sunday and Monday tend to be lower due to a lag in reporting. Data also show there have been a further 3,862 positive cases - significantly lower than in recent days and the lowest daily figure since 17 September. As reported earlier, the number of first dose vaccinations has topped 30m - while more than 3.5m have received both doses.  The ""tireless efforts"" of medical staff, pharmacists and volunteers lay behind the success of the UK's vaccine programme, the vaccines minister has said. As the number of first jabs passes 30m, Nadhim Zahawi said he was ""immensely proud"" of the programme's speed. He urged those who are eligible for a jab - now all those over-50 - to come forward. Health Secretary Matt Hancock added: âThe vaccine is saving lives and is our route out of this pandemic. I want to say a massive thanks to the team. âWhen you get the call - get the jab.â The latest milestone was reached after Saturday saw 650,000 vaccinations in a single day, according to the Department of Health. Some 57% of all UK adults have had a jab - 6% of adults have now had a second dose, the government said. Meanwhile, the department said ""real-world"" data showed both the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines were ""highly effective"" in reducing Covid-19 among older people aged 70 years and over. For much of the past year Westminster has felt deserted. When Boris Johnson delivered his first stay-at-home order last March, the Palace of Westminster - better known as the Houses of Parliament - changed overnight. The tea rooms fell silent. The pubs shut. And the seemingly endless corridors emptied, save for a smattering of hand sanitising stations. Elizabeth Rubiopuello knows the corridors of the Palace of Westminster better than most But as many MPs Zoomed into debates from the relative comfort of home, the staff of the House of Commons Heritage Cleaning team have been present throughout. ""It's important to have the place as safe as possible for the people who are still working here,"" says Elizabeth Rubiopuello. So who are the heritage cleaners, what have they been doing differently over the past year - and what challenges have they faced? Westminster Hour'sJack Fenwick has been to Parliament to talk to them. More than 30m people in the UK have now received the first dose of a Covid vaccine. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that it was ""a phenomenal achievement"". Public Health England figures show 25,651,406 first jabs have been administered in England. Separate figures show 2,385,709 first doses have been given in Scotland, 1,387,583 in Wales and 726,589 in Northern Ireland. It brings the total number of first vaccinations across the four nations to 30,151,287. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The BBC'sRachel Schraer takes a look at what we know so farabout Covid immunity. Serbia has been inoculating citizens of neighbouring countries amid a surplus of vaccines and a reluctance among many Serbs to have the jab, BBC World Service reported. Queues were seen on the borders with North Macedonia and Bosnia as word got out that vaccines were being distributed for free in Belgrade. A German doctor was also reported to be among those getting a vaccine at the main centre in Belgrade, as the rollout in Germany struggles to keep pace with a third wave of coronavirus infections there. Serbia has also begun vaccinating refugees in camps, in a move praised by the UN Refugee Agency. Chris MasonPolitical correspondent The return of the legal right in England to go for a walk in the rain with five other people feels like quite a big moment. And that reminds us of something: alongside the health emergency, the hundreds of thousands of grieving relatives and an economic crisis, this is the ongoing era of liberties crushed for everyone. Thatâs why the government is so desperate to avoid the psychological whiplash of yet another slamming on of the brakes, or a reversal. Thatâs why thereâs the constant refrain of the roadmap being ""cautious, but irreversible"". And thatâs why, despite the prime ministerâs natural instinct to inject his language with optimism, thereâs been a concerted effort in recent months to manage our expectations. For this pandemic has cruelly taught us, repeatedly, that the track back to normality will contain hairpins we havenât yet seen. And for every fleeting moment of feeling like we are getting there -  itâs still another fortnight in England, at least, before itâs legal to go to the hairdressers. The abnormal has become normal, but itâs worth reminding ourselves just how remarkable it still is. We've heard that lorry drivers will be subject to a new testing regime if they come to England from outside the UK for more than two days. Now it emerges that aircraft cabin crew, prison escorts and seasonal workers are also among those affected by the new rules. From 6 April, people who stay in the country for 48 hours or more - but who are exempt from quarantine because of their job - will have to take a lateral flow test by the end of the second day. Those remaining in the UK for any longer than 2 days will then be required to take a further test every 3 days - typically on days five and eight. The tougher measures are to ""ensure we keep track of any future coronavirus variants of concern"", Grant Shapps wrote on Twitter. The new rules will primarily affect hauliers entering from Europe. Read morehere. It's worth a quick re-cap of our top story this afternoon. The government is ""confident"" everyone in the UK will get a second dose of the Covid vaccine within 12 weeks of their first, the culture secretary has said. Oliver Dowden said ""we always knew there would be ups and downs"" but the timetable was on track. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr it was ""essential"" to provide second doses and it would not require mixing vaccines. Mr Dowden added that the Moderna jab was due to arrive in the UK in April. Read morehere. New coronavirus variants that escape the protection offered by current vaccines are a ""risk"", and the answer is to vaccinate as many people as soon as possible, a leading immunologist has said. Prof Robin Shattock, of Imperial College London, told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that a rise in overall infection rates could ""potentially knock us off course"" as lockdown begins to ease. ""If we can keep [the rates] low, then hopefully cautiously we can go through these different stages of unlocking always remembering that we may need to turn back if we see a spike in cases,"" Shattock said. New variants of the virus that make current jabs ""less effective"" mean ministers should take extra care when unlocking restrictions, he said. He also described a second dose as being important for protection and that speeding these up could offer a better defence against new variants. There were no images of the president being vaccinated - although he is not usually considered camera-shy President Vladimir Putin has said he expects Russia to reach herd immunity by the end of the summer. Speaking on television, the president said he was aiming to lift all coronavirus restrictions at the same time. Mr Putin, who was vaccinated this week with a Russian-made

vaccine, also said the only side effects he experienced post jab werea brief muscle ache and some discomfort at the site of the injection. Last Monday the president revealed 6.3 million Russians had so far received one dose of a Covid vaccine - around 5% of Russia's adult population. His target is to protect 60% of adults by July - sufficient for ""collective immunity"" to stop the virus spreading. But that would require boosting the current vaccination rate from just a few thousand to more than 700,000 every day - and that's just a single dose of the vaccine,reports the BBC's Sarah Rainsford. The daily count of deaths with coronavirus in Russia has reached 95,818 since the pandemic began - though the number of excess deaths recorded so far is some four times higher.  The UK's year of lockdowns has had a profound effect on crime and criminal justice. From the first coronavirus fines for everyday activity, to sudden fluctuations in offences because of the impact of restrictions on our lives, these changes to community safety will have a lasting impact for years to come. From fewer thefts in lockdown to a spike in recorded drug offences, the BBC's Dominic Casciani & Ben Butcherhave taken a deeper look. The Irish Government has said it is ""not aware of any specific plans"" by the UK to share its vaccine supply ""at this stage"". It follows a story in the Sunday Times which reported the UK was planning to give 3.7 million vaccines to Ireland when it had spare capacity. ""The UK has previously indicated that once it has achieved a high level of vaccination of its own population, it would consider sharing vaccines with other countries,"" a spokesman for the Irish Government said on Sunday. But added there were no ""specific plans"" currently. ""The Irish and UK governments maintain close contact across all matters of common interest."" Speaking on Sunday morning, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said there was no vaccine surplus at present. ""We clearly don't currently have a surplus of vaccines.

"A group of charities is urging Boris Johnson to ""swiftly clarify"" how many Covid vaccine doses the UK is prepared to donate to poorer countries. Save the Children and the Wellcome Trust are among those calling on the PM to start donating jabs through Covax. This scheme aims to provide jabs for low and middle-income countries. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the UK does not currently have a surplus of vaccines, but when it does that surplus will be shared. The UK, which has ordered 400 million vaccine doses and will have many left over, has said itwill donate most of its surplus vaccine supply to poorer countries. The lower income countries most likely to receive the first vaccines through Covax include Afghanistan, Haiti, DR Congo, Ethiopia and Somalia. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Fosterhas said she hopesthe UK will give vaccine doses to the Republic of Ireland, in a bid to help stop the spread of infection in Northern Ireland. Ms Foster said sharing excess supply with Ireland was ""a runner"" and she will ""be making that point again"" when she speaks to Mr Johnson. The scheme to share unused vaccines with other countries 'Some countries can't afford the Covid vaccine' So far, more than 29 million UK adults have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine. In a letter, the charities say the UK is ""one of the world's highest per-capita buyers"" of vaccines and is on track to have more than 100 million surplus doses. ""There is therefore the high risk that the UK will be hoarding limited supply whilst health workers and the most vulnerable in low and middle-income countries do not have access,"" the letter says. ""The UK will be sitting on enough surplus vaccine doses to vaccinate the world's frontline health workers twice over."" The group urges the UK to immediately begin donating doses through the Covax initiative. FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:What tests are available? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? Scientist Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the UK will still have contractual access to at least 100 million surplus doses once the entire population is vaccinated, which he said ""won't be of use in the UK"". ""Now is the time to think beyond our borders,"" he said. ""The world won't be safe while any single country is still fighting the virus. ""If left to spread, it risks mutating to an extent where our vaccines and treatments no longer work. This goes beyond ethics - it's a scientific and economic imperative.""

Charities that signed the letter include anti-poverty campaigns One and Global Citizen, the Results UK charity and the Pandemic Action Network. On Sunday, Mr Dowden told Sky News' Sophy Ridge programme: ""Clearly our first priority is ensuring that we deliver vaccines in the United Kingdom ""We clearly don't currently have a surplus of vaccines. Should we get to the point where we have a surplus of vaccines, we'd make a decision on the allocation of that surplus."" The government said the UK has ""played a leading role in championing global access to coronavirus vaccines"", including a Â£548m contribution to the Covax Advance Market Commitment. This makes the UK ""one of the largest donors"" and the contribution ""has already helped 20 lower-middle countries to receive doses"". ""The prime minister has confirmed the UK will share the majority of any future surplus coronavirus vaccines from our supply with the Covax pool, when these are available,"" a spokesman said.

"More than 30m people in the UK have now received a first vaccine dose Health Secretary Matt Hancock described the figures as a 'phenomenal achievement' Nineteen people who tested positive for coronavirus within the past 28 days have died in the past 24 hours in the UK There have been a further 3,862 positive cases - the lowest UK daily figure since 17 September Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has said the Moderna vaccine is expected to be rolled out in the UK in April Mr Dowden also said he ""fully expects"" the UK to host the biggest moments of this summer's Uefa's European Championships He said he had 'every confidence' that this was England's last lockdown - but experience taught him 'you can't rule things out' Workers including lorry drivers and cabin crew travelling to England from outside the UK, who stay for two days or more, will be required to take a Covid test The chief medical director at NHS England is warning people not to ""squander the gains"" made in the latest lockdown Prof Stephen Powis says progress made so far ""does not mean job done"" In the latest step of the government's roadmap, curbs on outdoor gatherings and sports ease in England from Monday A group of charities is urging the prime minister to ""swiftly clarify"" how many Covid vaccine doses the UK is prepared to donate to poorer countries Poland has reported 29,253 new coronavirus cases on Sunday - up 34% compared with one week ago Edited by Julian Joyce That's all for today. Join us tomorrow morning for all the latest updates on the coronavirus pandemic. Your writers today were George Bowden, Jo Couzens and Victoria Lindrea. The page was edited by Julian Joyce. We're bringing our live page to a close. Here is a brief round-up of today's main headlines from the UK and around the world. The Moderna jab - due to arrive in the UK next month - will give the UK ""an extra line of security"" after concerns were raised last week that supply chains of other vaccines may be held up. So says Professor Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation ""The quantities that Moderna are capable of providing are likely to
be many fewer doses than we are seeing from AstraZeneca and Pfizer,"" Prof Finn told the PA news agency. ""Partly because they are a small outfit and partly because they are
primarily directing their supplies towards the US rather than Europe. ""So I don't think it's a game changer, I think it's an incremental change. ""It adds an extra string to our bow, if you like, and it gives us an extra line
of security."" That means it is due to arrive in the UK in the same month that the NHS has warned ofa ""significant reduction"" in vaccine supplieselsewhere. Moderna isthe third vaccine of seven that the UK has put in an order for- and the UK is lined up to receive 17 million doses.  Here's some more detail - and charts - on those figures from earlier. We carried the story of a steady fall in deaths with coronavirus - 19 deaths in the past 24 hours (reported on Sunday). The number of cases continues to dip. They are now on a par with the numbers being reported last September. Meanwhile the government's vaccination schedule remains on track. Some 57% of all UK adults have had a first jab, while 6% of adults have had a second dose, the government said. However, data shows that the rate at which first vaccines were given accelerated sharply from mid-January. But it's expected to become more of a challenge in coming weeks to deliver the same number of second jabs. Research has shown pets can have a huge benefit to our mental health - especially this past year. ""I don't know what I would have done without him,"" 24-year-old Francesca Balon tells Newsbeat. She's registered blind and credits her guide dog, Sean, with getting her through a year of lockdowns. ""He's a real character and it's funny because he's so clever when he's working but he has absolutely no common sense,"" she says. Francesca had Sean three years ago when her vision started to worsen, hitting her confidence. Read morehere. Up to six people, or two households, will be able to meet outside from Monday The Met Police has urged Londoners to remain ""vigilant"" when lockdown restrictions ease tomorrow, with groups of up to six people, or two households, able to meet outside. While people will also be allowed to take part in formally organised outdoor sport, large gatherings - unless certain exemptions apply - will remain unlawful and risk further spreading the virus, the force warned. The Met's deputy assistant commissioner, Jane Connors, said: ""We must not let Monday's news distract us, or usher in any complacency."" But she said the risk of Covid-19 ""has not vanished"" and wherever possible people should ""continue to be vigilant, minimise our contact as much as possible, wear a face covering where required and keep ourselves safe"". ""That means avoiding any large gathering,"" she added. The force said it will continue to take enforcement action and hand out fines for ""house parties or dangerous raves"", adding it makes ""no apology for our tough stance"" on shutting down large gatherings which risk public safety. Official government figures indicate 19 people who tested positive for coronavirus within the past 28 days have died in the past 24 hours. This compares to the 33 deaths reported last Sunday. Figures on Sunday and Monday tend to be lower due to a lag in reporting. Data also show there have been a further 3,862 positive cases - significantly lower than in recent days and the lowest daily figure since 17 September. As reported earlier, the number of first dose vaccinations has topped 30m - while more than 3.5m have received both doses.  The ""tireless efforts"" of medical staff, pharmacists and volunteers lay behind the success of the UK's vaccine programme, the vaccines minister has said. As the number of first jabs passes 30m, Nadhim Zahawi said he was ""immensely proud"" of the programme's speed. He urged those who are eligible for a jab - now all those over-50 - to come forward. Health Secretary Matt Hancock added: âThe vaccine is saving lives and is our route out of this pandemic. I want to say a massive thanks to the team. âWhen you get the call - get the jab.â The latest milestone was reached after Saturday saw 650,000 vaccinations in a single day, according to the Department of Health. Some 57% of all UK adults have had a jab - 6% of adults have now had a second dose, the government said. Meanwhile, the department said ""real-world"" data showed both the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines were ""highly effective"" in reducing Covid-19 among older people aged 70 years and over. For much of the past year Westminster has felt deserted. When Boris Johnson delivered his first stay-at-home order last March, the Palace of Westminster - better known as the Houses of Parliament - changed overnight. The tea rooms fell silent. The pubs shut. And the seemingly endless corridors emptied, save for a smattering of hand sanitising stations. Elizabeth Rubiopuello knows the corridors of the Palace of Westminster better than most But as many MPs Zoomed into debates from the relative comfort of home, the staff of the House of Commons Heritage Cleaning team have been present throughout. ""It's important to have the place as safe as possible for the people who are still working here,"" says Elizabeth Rubiopuello. So who are the heritage cleaners, what have they been doing differently over the past year - and what challenges have they faced? Westminster Hour'sJack Fenwick has been to Parliament to talk to them. More than 30m people in the UK have now received the first dose of a Covid vaccine. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that it was ""a phenomenal achievement"". Public Health England figures show 25,651,406 first jabs have been administered in England. Separate figures show 2,385,709 first doses have been given in Scotland, 1,387,583 in Wales and 726,589 in Northern Ireland. It brings the total number of first vaccinations across the four nations to 30,151,287. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Crowds returned to Barry Island on Saturday with travel restrictions eased Wales' first minister willset out the next steps for reopening society there on Thursdayand give hospitality bosses ""the certainty that it's looking for"". But Mark Drakeford warned he would not give ""false assurances too far into the future"" as non-essential retailers, gyms and tourism sector hope to reopen. He said he would set out ""the prospectus through the whole of April and into May"". But he told BBC One'sAndrew Marr Showit was ""inherently an uncertain time"". Drakeford said he hoped people would be able to enjoy outdoor hospitality by the end of April but meeting indoors would ""likely have to wait until May"". On Saturday, Wales became the first UK nation tolift travel restrictionswithin its borders. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Immunity explained Can you become reinfected with coronavirus if you've already had it once? It seems the answer lies in how our immune system works. The BBC'sRachel Schraer takes a look at what we know so farabout Covid immunity. Serbia has been inoculating citizens of neighbouring countries amid a surplus of vaccines and a reluctance among many Serbs to have the jab, BBC World Service reported. Queues were seen on the borders with North Macedonia and Bosnia as word got out that vaccines were being distributed for free in Belgrade. A German doctor was also reported to be among those getting a vaccine at the main centre in Belgrade, as the rollout in Germany struggles to keep pace with a third wave of coronavirus infections there. Serbia has also begun vaccinating refugees in camps, in a move praised by the UN Refugee Agency. Chris MasonPolitical correspondent The return of the legal right in England to go for a walk in the rain with five other people feels like quite a big moment. And that reminds us of something: alongside the health emergency, the hundreds of thousands of grieving relatives and an economic crisis, this is the ongoing era of liberties crushed for everyone. Thatâs why the government is so desperate to avoid the psychological whiplash of yet another slamming on of the brakes, or a reversal. Thatâs why thereâs the constant refrain of the roadmap being ""cautious, but irreversible"". And thatâs why, despite the prime ministerâs natural instinct to inject his language with optimism, thereâs been a concerted effort in recent months to manage our expectations. For this pandemic has cruelly taught us, repeatedly, that the track back to normality will contain hairpins we havenât yet seen. And for every fleeting moment of feeling like we are getting there -  itâs still another fortnight in England, at least, before itâs legal to go to the hairdressers. The abnormal has become normal, but itâs worth reminding ourselves just how remarkable it still is. We've heard that lorry drivers will be subject to a new testing regime if they come to England from outside the UK for more than two days. Now it emerges that aircraft cabin crew, prison escorts and seasonal workers are also among those affected by the new rules. From 6 April, people who stay in the country for 48 hours or more - but who are exempt from quarantine because of their job - will have to take a lateral flow test by the end of the second day. Those remaining in the UK for any longer than 2 days will then be required to take a further test every 3 days - typically on days five and eight. The tougher measures are to ""ensure we keep track of any future coronavirus variants of concern"", Grant Shapps wrote on Twitter. The new rules will primarily affect hauliers entering from Europe. Read morehere. It's worth a quick re-cap of our top story this afternoon. The government is ""confident"" everyone in the UK will get a second dose of the Covid vaccine within 12 weeks of their first, the culture secretary has said. Oliver Dowden said ""we always knew there would be ups and downs"" but the timetable was on track. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr it was ""essential"" to provide second doses and it would not require mixing vaccines. Mr Dowden added that the Moderna jab was due to arrive in the UK in April. Read morehere. New coronavirus variants that escape the protection offered by current vaccines are a ""risk"", and the answer is to vaccinate as many people as soon as possible, a leading immunologist has said. Prof Robin Shattock, of Imperial College London, told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that a rise in overall infection rates could ""potentially knock us off course"" as lockdown begins to ease. ""If we can keep [the rates] low, then hopefully cautiously we can go through these different stages of unlocking always remembering that we may need to turn back if we see a spike in cases,"" Shattock said. New variants of the virus that make current jabs ""less effective"" mean ministers should take extra care when unlocking restrictions, he said. He also described a second dose as being important for protection and that speeding these up could offer a better defence against new variants. There were no images of the president being vaccinated - although he is not usually considered camera-shy President Vladimir Putin has said he expects Russia to reach herd immunity by the end of the summer. Speaking on television, the president said he was aiming to lift all coronavirus restrictions at the same time. Mr Putin, who was vaccinated this week with a Russian-made

vaccine, also said the only side effects he experienced post jab werea brief muscle ache and some discomfort at the site of the injection. Last Monday the president revealed 6.3 million Russians had so far received one dose of a Covid vaccine - around 5% of Russia's adult population. His target is to protect 60% of adults by July - sufficient for ""collective immunity"" to stop the virus spreading. But that would require boosting the current vaccination rate from just a few thousand to more than 700,000 every day - and that's just a single dose of the vaccine,reports the BBC's Sarah Rainsford. The daily count of deaths with coronavirus in Russia has reached 95,818 since the pandemic began - though the number of excess deaths recorded so far is some four times higher.  The UK's year of lockdowns has had a profound effect on crime and criminal justice. From the first coronavirus fines for everyday activity, to sudden fluctuations in offences because of the impact of restrictions on our lives, these changes to community safety will have a lasting impact for years to come. From fewer thefts in lockdown to a spike in recorded drug offences, the BBC's Dominic Casciani & Ben Butcherhave taken a deeper look. The Irish Government has said it is ""not aware of any specific plans"" by the UK to share its vaccine supply ""at this stage"". It follows a story in the Sunday Times which reported the UK was planning to give 3.7 million vaccines to Ireland when it had spare capacity. ""The UK has previously indicated that once it has achieved a high level of vaccination of its own population, it would consider sharing vaccines with other countries,"" a spokesman for the Irish Government said on Sunday. But added there were no ""specific plans"" currently. ""The Irish and UK governments maintain close contact across all matters of common interest."" Speaking on Sunday morning, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said there was no vaccine surplus at present. ""We clearly don't currently have a surplus of vaccines. Should we get to the point where we have a surplus of vaccines we'd make a decision on the allocation of that surplus."" ""Our first priority is to deliver vaccines in the UK,"" he told Sky News' Sophy Ridge. Earlier this month,the NHS warned of a significant reductionin jabs available in England in April, andthere has been a delayto Oxford-AstraZeneca shipments from India. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Tugboats managed to move the Ever Given 30 degrees in both directions, but it is still stuck A giant container ship remains stuck across Egypt's Suez Canal after attempts to dislodge it on Saturday's high tide failed. Canal officials said some progress had been made, however, and more tugboats were joining the effort on Sunday. Alternative arrangements are being put in place in case the operation fails. Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has ordered preparations to lighten the load of the stranded ship. That would involve transferring some containers to another vessel or to the canal bank. Experts earlier told the BBC that such an operation would involve bringing in specialist equipment, including a crane that would need to stretch more than 60m (200ft) high, and could take weeks. The Suez Canal is one of the world's busiest trade routes, and the Ever Given - part of the Evergreen fleet - has been wedged in it since Tuesday. More than 300 ships are stuck on either side of the blockage and some vessels have had to reroute around Africa. 'Our customers are worried about the Suez blockage' How do you refloat a giant cargo ship? The Suez Canal blockage in numbers In pictures: Efforts to shift huge ship from canal On Saturday 14 tugboats pulled and pushed the Ever Given at high tide to try to dislodge it. At the same time, dredgers continued to remove thousands of tonnes of sand and clay from where the bow was trapped in the canal's bank. Although strong tides and winds complicated efforts, the tugboats managed to move the ship ""30 degrees from left and right"", said General Osama Rabie, chairman of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA). Footage posted on Twitter appeared to show the tugboats honking their horns to celebrate this small victory. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The SCA said in a statement that dredgers had so far shifted 27,000 cubic metres of sand to a depth of 18m (59ft). Gen Rabie said on Sunday that although the vessel was still stuck there were ""positive indicators"" from the past two days' efforts. ""The rudder was not moving and it is now moving, the propeller is working now, there was no water underneath the bow, and now there is water under it, and yesterday there was a 4m (13ft) deviation in the bow and the stern,"" he told Egyptian state TV. It may be necessary to remove containers to raise the ship in the water However, in a possible complication, SCA sources quoted by Reuters news agency said that a mass of rock had been discovered under the bow of the ship. Gen Rabie said that President Sisi had ordered preparations for the possible removal of some of the ship's 18,300 containers. He had previously said he hoped such an operation would not be necessary. Initial reports said the 400m-long (1,300ft), 200,000-tonne vessel ran aground due to high winds and a sandstorm that affected visibility. However, Gen Rabie said on Saturday that weather conditions were ""not the main reasons"" for the ship's grounding. ""There may have been technical or human errors,"" he told reporters, without giving details. ""All of these factors will become apparent in the investigation."" This video can not be played A salvage company, working to free the Ever Given, says the operation could take weeks About 12% of global trade passes through the 193km (120-mile) canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. An alternative route, around the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa, can take two weeks longer. According to data from Lloyd's List, the blockage is holding up an estimated $9.6bn (Â£7bn) of goods each day - or $400m an hour. Gen Rabie estimated that Egypt was losing up to $14m in revenue each day that the canal was closed. In Syria, authorities have begun to ration fuel after supplies were held up by the stalled traffic in the Suez Canal. The war-torn country was already struggling with power cuts and inflation pushing up the price of goods.

"The trade union Unite is setting up a hotline for Amazon staff to complain about their treatment at work. Organiser Sharon Graham told the BBC it was time the internet retail giant shared its ""bonanza profits with the workers who help make them"". Amazon had itsmost lucrative year ever in 2020, helped by a surge in online shopping during the pandemic. The company said it offered its staff ""excellent"" pay, benefits and career opportunities, plus ""safe"" conditions. It added that it was ""proud"" to have created 10,000 jobs in the UK last year. Amazon: The rise and rise of the internet giant Billionaire fortunes hit record high during pandemic Will trade union contests help or hinder Starmer? Union-tracking software proposed by Amazon Ahead of the hotline's launch on Monday, Unite said it wanted to agree a ""social contract"" with Amazon and for the company to recognise trade unions. These changes, Ms Graham argued, would help secure higher wages and end ""relentless"" work targets. She said staff needed to speak about ""the exploitation they suffer day after day as a consequence of Amazon's merciless drive for profit"". Ms Graham - who is planning to run in the contest to replace current Unite general secretary Len McCluskey when he steps down next year - told the BBC the hotline was ""not a stunt"" and the union was ""in this for the long haul"". It wants to hear from staff who have had ""had timed toilet breaks"", done ""back-breaking piece work with never-ending targets"", had ""compulsory"" overtime imposed and needed to talk about ""the horrendous record of injuries on the job"", she said. But Amazon rejected Unite's criticisms, with a spokesman saying: ""The fact is we already offer our employees excellent pay, excellent benefits and excellent opportunities for career growth, all while working in a safe, modern work environment."" He added that the company's ""competitive wages"" started at Â£9.70 or Â£10.80 per hour, depending on location, and he would ""encourage anyone to compare this to the wages and benefits offered by other retailers"". ""We're proud to have created 10,000 new permanent roles across the UK in 2020, taking our total permanent UK workforce to more than 40,000,"" the spokesman said. ""Our people have played a critical role in serving customers in these unprecedented times and the new roles help us continue to meet customer demand and support small and medium-sized businesses selling on Amazon.""

"A group of charities is urging Boris Johnson to ""swiftly clarify"" how many Covid vaccine doses the UK is prepared to donate to poorer countries. Save the Children and the Wellcome Trust are among those calling on the PM to start donating jabs through Covax. This scheme aims to provide jabs for low and middle-income countries. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the UK does not currently have a surplus of vaccines, but when it does that surplus will be shared. The UK, which has ordered 400 million vaccine doses and will have many left over, has said itwill donate most of its surplus vaccine supply to poorer countries. The lower income countries most likely to receive the first vaccines through Covax include Afghanistan, Haiti, DR Congo, Ethiopia and Somalia. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Fosterhas said she hopesthe UK will give vaccine doses to the Republic of Ireland, in a bid to help stop the spread of infection in Northern Ireland. Ms Foster said sharing excess supply with Ireland was ""a runner"" and she will ""be making that point again"" when she speaks to Mr Johnson. The scheme to share unused vaccines with other countries 'Some countries can't afford the Covid vaccine' So far, more than 29 million UK adults have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine. In a letter, the charities say the UK is ""one of the world's highest per-capita buyers"" of vaccines and is on track to have more than 100 million surplus doses. ""There is therefore the high risk that the UK will be hoarding limited supply whilst health workers and the most vulnerable in low and middle-income countries do not have access,"" the letter says. ""The UK will be sitting on enough surplus vaccine doses to vaccinate the world's frontline health workers twice over."" The group urges the UK to immediately begin donating doses through the Covax initiative. FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:What tests are available? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? Scientist Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the UK will still have contractual access to at least 100 million surplus doses once the entire population is vaccinated, which he said ""won't be of use in the UK"". ""Now is the time to think beyond our borders,"" he said. ""The world won't be safe while any single country is still fighting the virus. ""If left to spread, it risks mutating to an extent where our vaccines and treatments no longer work. This goes beyond ethics - it's a scientific and economic imperative.""

Charities that signed the letter include anti-poverty campaigns One and Global Citizen, the Results UK charity and the Pandemic Action Network. On Sunday, Mr Dowden told Sky News' Sophy Ridge programme: ""Clearly our first priority is ensuring that we deliver vaccines in the United Kingdom ""We clearly don't currently have a surplus of vaccines. Should we get to the point where we have a surplus of vaccines, we'd make a decision on the allocation of that surplus."" The government said the UK has ""played a leading role in championing global access to coronavirus vaccines"", including a Â£548m contribution to the Covax Advance Market Commitment. This makes the UK ""one of the largest donors"" and the contribution ""has already helped 20 lower-middle countries to receive doses"". ""The prime minister has confirmed the UK will share the majority of any future surplus coronavirus vaccines from our supply with the Covax pool, when these are available,"" a spokesman said. ""No-one is safe until we are all safe.""

"The trade union Unite is setting up a hotline for Amazon staff to complain about their treatment at work. Organiser Sharon Graham told the BBC it was time the internet retail giant shared its ""bonanza profits with the workers who help make them"". Amazon had itsmost lucrative year ever in 2020, helped by a surge in online shopping during the pandemic. The company said it offered its staff ""excellent"" pay, benefits and career opportunities, plus ""safe"" conditions. It added that it was ""proud"" to have created 10,000 jobs in the UK last year. Amazon: The rise and rise of the internet giant Billionaire fortunes hit record high during pandemic Will trade union contests help or hinder Starmer? Union-tracking software proposed by Amazon Ahead of the hotline's launch on Monday, Unite said it wanted to agree a ""social contract"" with Amazon and for the company to recognise trade unions. These changes, Ms Graham argued, would help secure higher wages and end ""relentless"" work targets. She said staff needed to speak about ""the exploitation they suffer day after day as a consequence of Amazon's merciless drive for profit"". Ms Graham - who is planning to run in the contest to replace current Unite general secretary Len McCluskey when he steps down next year - told the BBC the hotline was ""not a stunt"" and the union was ""in this for the long haul"". It wants to hear from staff who have had ""had timed toilet breaks"", done ""back-breaking piece work with never-ending targets"", had ""compulsory"" overtime imposed and needed to talk about ""the horrendous record of injuries on the job"", she said. But Amazon rejected Unite's criticisms, with a spokesman saying: ""The fact is we already offer our employees excellent pay, excellent benefits and excellent opportunities for career growth, all while working in a safe, modern work environment."" He added that the company's ""competitive wages"" started at Â£9.70 or Â£10.80 per hour, depending on location, and he would ""encourage anyone to compare this to the wages and benefits offered by other retailers"". ""We're proud to have created 10,000 new permanent roles across the UK in 2020, taking our total permanent UK workforce to more than 40,000,"" the spokesman said. ""Our people have played a critical role in serving customers in these unprecedented times and the new roles help us continue to meet customer demand and support small and medium-sized businesses selling on Amazon.""
