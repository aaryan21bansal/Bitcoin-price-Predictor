"The virus continues to spread in Brazil amid a lack of co-ordinated measures The number of deaths related to Covid-19 has passed 500,000 in Brazil, the second-highest in the world, as experts say the outbreak could worsen amid slow vaccination and the start of winter. The virus continues to spread as President Jair Bolsonaro refuses to back measures like social distancing. The health institute Fiocruz says the situation is ""critical"". Only 11% of adults are fully vaccinated. Tens of thousands of Brazilians joined anti-government protests on Saturday. President Bolsonaro has been heavily criticised for not implementing a co-ordinated national response and for his scepticism toward vaccines, lockdowns and mask-wearing requirements, which he has sought to loosen. Covid - what's gone wrong in Brazil? Why are so many babies dying of Covid-19 in Brazil? What happened when a whole town got Covid jabs? The country has reported, on average, 70,000 cases and 2,000 deaths daily in the past week. Most of the new infections and deaths were among people aged 20-59, Fiocruz said, warning that the start of winter in the southern hemisphere, next week, could result in more infections. Despite this, governors and mayors have already relaxed the restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the virus. In many cities, restaurants, bars and shops have reopened while many people in the streets do not wear face masks or follow social distancing. ""People in Brazil are tired and they normalise death now so I think we still have a long way to go,"" Dr Natalia Pasternak Taschner, a microbiologist at the Question of Science Institute, told the BBC. ""If we're not successful in changing the behaviour of people and if we don't have campaigns for mask wearing, social distancing and vaccinations coming directly from the central government we're not going to be able to control it."" There have been protests across Brazil, including in the city of Cuiaba On Saturday, protests against President Bolsonaro were held in cities across the country, with demonstrators accusing him of delaying the purchase of vaccines while prioritising unproven treatments, such as hydroxychloroquine. In rallies in Rio de Janeiro, BrasÃ­lia and elsewhere, furious Brazilians carried banners with slogans like ""Bolsonaro must go"" or simply ""500,000"". ""His position on Covid and his denialism are absurd. He has abandoned reality and common sense. There is no explaining this, it is surreal,"" Robert Almeida, a 50-year-old marching in Rio, told AFP. Protester Denise Azevedo told Reuters: ""Herd immunity won't do any good. The only immunity you can get is with the vaccine. There is no early treatment. I have lost many friends, almost lost a cousin... people are orphans, fatherless, motherless, and childless."" The outbreak in Brazil has been fuelled by more transmissible variants of the virus, including the one first identified in the Amazon region and now known as Gamma. The rate of occupancy of intensive care unit beds remains at or above 80% in most states, while cities struggle with short supplies of vaccines. This video can not be played Looking after the babies and children in Brazil's Covid ICU A parliamentary inquiry at the Brazilian Senate is looking into President Bolsonaro's handling of the pandemic. The opposition accuses him of delaying vaccine orders for political reasons, as he has consistently played down the severity of the pandemic. But the president, whose popularity has plummeted, says he has done all he can to buy vaccines from several countries. He also insists the impact of lockdowns on the economy would be worse than the virus, a position shared by his supporters. President Bolsonaro has not commented on the 500,000 deaths. On Twitter, Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga expressed solidarity with the ""fathers, mothers, friends and relatives"" of those who had died.

"Morrisons has rejected a Â£5.5bn takeover proposal from US private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. The UK's fourth-largest supermarket, with 118,000 staff, said the offer ""significantly undervalues"" the firm. CD&R, where former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy is an advisor, confirmed it was considering a formal bid after weekend media speculation about its plans. The US firm has previously made investments in the discount shop chain B&M, from which it made more than Â£1bn. Morrisons said in a statement it had ""evaluated the conditional proposal together with its financial adviser, Rothschild & Co, and unanimously concluded that the conditional proposal significantly undervalued Morrisons and its future prospects"". CD&R's proposal, worth 230 pence a share, does not constitute a formal offer, and under UK takeover rules it has until 17 July to announce a firm intention to bid or walk away. Morrisons boss suffers huge revolt over Â£1.7m bonus Morrisons hails 'renaissance of the supermarket' People return to supermarkets as online sales slow The move by CD&R, one of the biggest takeover firms in the world, would have been one of the most high profile of many bids for UK companies in the past year. BBC business correspondent Katie Prescott said the flurry of takeover activity was being fuelled by relatively low share prices of businesses in the UK compared to abroad and cheap money because of low interest rates. CD&R has this year agreed a Â£2.8bn takeover of UK healthcare group UDG, and a Â£308m bid for the plumbing group Wolseley. Morrisons' boss David Potts used to work at Tesco with Sir Terry Leahy, now an advisor to CD&R. In February, Zuber and Mohsin Issa and private equity firm TDR Capital purchased a majority stake in Asda from Walmart in a deal valuing the UK supermarket group at Â£6.8bn. That deal followed Sainsbury's failure to take over Asda, which was blocked by the competition regulator. Morrisons - with its 500-store property portfolio, most of which it owns outright - and its 10% of the grocery market - is an attractive proposition. There has been speculation about bids for Morrisons in the past from Amazon, which sells the supermarket's products on its site. According to the Financial Times, which along with Sky News, first revealed details of CD&R's intentions,the US buy-out firm approached Morrisons on 14 June.,externalIn addition to the cash offer, CD&R would take on Morrisons' Â£3.2bn of debt, taking the total value of any deal to almost Â£9bn. A formal bid from CD&R could involve Mr Leahy, who when at Tesco was the boss of Andrew Higginson and David Potts, now Morrisons' chairman and chief executive respectively. Last month, Morrisons said sales had increased by 2.7% in the 14 weeks to 9 May. But in the previous three months alone it had faced a Â£27m bill for Covid-related costs. Earlier this month, Morrisons was rebuked by investors over executive pay, with more than 70% of votes cast at its annual shareholders' meeting rejecting its pay report.

"More than a year into the pandemic, deaths in Brazil are now at their peak. But despite the overwhelming evidence that Covid-19 rarely kills young children, in Brazil 1,300 babies have died from the virus. One doctor refused to test Jessika Ricarte's one-year-old son for Covid, saying his symptoms did not fit the profile of the virus. Two months later he died of complications from the disease. After two years of trying, and failed fertility treatments, teacher Jessika Ricarte had all but given up on having a family. Then she fell pregnant with Lucas. ""His name comes from luminous. And he was a light in our life. He showed that happiness was much more than we imagined,"" she says. Lucas with his parents Israel and Jessika on his first birthday She first suspected something was wrong when Lucas, always a good eater, lost his appetite. At first Jessika wondered if he was teething. Lucas's godmother, a nurse, suggested that he might just have a sore throat. But after he developed a fever, then fatigue and slightly laboured breathing, Jessika took him to hospital, and asked for him to be tested for Covid. ""The doctor put on the oximeter. Lucas's levels were 86%. Now I know that is not normal,"" says Jessika. But he was not feverish, so the doctor said: ""My dear, don't worry. There's no need for a Covid test. It's probably just a minor sore throat."" He told Jessika that Covid-19 was rare in children, gave her some antibiotics and sent her home. Despite her misgivings, there was no option to have Lucas tested privately at the time. Jessika says that some of his symptoms dissipated at the end of his 10-day antibiotics course, but the tiredness remained - as did her concerns about coronavirus. ""I sent several videos to his godmother, my parents, my mother-in-law, and everyone said that I was exaggerating, that I should stop watching the news, that it was making me paranoid. But I knew that my son was not himself, that he was not breathing normally."" Jessika sent videos of Lucas to her family because she was concerned This was May 2020, and the coronavirus epidemic was growing. Two people had already died in her town, Tamboril in CearÃ¡, north-east Brazil. ""Everyone knows each other here. The town was in shock."" Jessika's husband Israel was worried that another hospital visit would increase the risk that she and Lucas would become infected with the virus. But the weeks went by, and Lucas became sleepier and sleepier. Finally on 3 June, Lucas vomited over and over again after eating lunch, and Jessika knew she had to act. They returned to their local hospital, where the doctor tested Lucas for Covid, to rule it out. Lucas's godmother, who worked there, broke the news to the couple that his test result was positive. ""At the time, the hospital did not even have a resuscitator,"" says Jessika. Lucas was transferred to a paediatric intensive care unit in Sobral, over two hours away, where he was diagnosed with a condition calledmulti-system inflammatory syndrome,external(MIS). This is an extreme immune response to the virus, which can cause inflammation of vital organs. Experts say the syndrome, whichaffects children up to six weeks after they are infected with coronavirus, is rare, but leading epidemiologist Dr Fatima Marinho from the University of SÃ£o Paolo, says that, during the pandemic, she is seeing more cases of MIS than ever before. Although it doesn't account for all deaths. When Lucas was intubated, Jessika wasn't allowed to stay in the same room. She rang her sister-in-law to try and distract herself. ""We could still hear the sound of the machine, the beep, until the machine stopped and there was that constant beep. And we know that happens when the person dies. After a few minutes, the machine started working again and I started to cry."" The doctor told her Lucas had suffered a cardiac arrest but they had managed to revive him. Dr Manuela Monte, the paediatric doctor who treated Lucas for over a month in the ICU in Sobral, said she was surprised that Lucas's condition was so serious, because he did not have any risk factors. Most children affected by Covid have comorbidities - existing conditions such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease - or are overweight, according to Lohanna Tavares, a paediatric infectologist at Albert Sabin Children's Hospital in Fortaleza, the state capital. But that wasn't the case with Lucas. During the 33 days Lucas was in the ICU, Jessika was only allowed to see him three times. Lucas needed immunoglobulin  - a very expensive medication - to deflate his heart, but luckily an adult patient who had bought his own had donated one leftover ampoule to the hospital. Lucas was so ill that he went on to receive a second dose of immunoglobulin. He developed a rash on his body and was running a persistent fever. He needed support to breathe. Then Lucas began to improve and the doctors decided to take out his oxygen tube. They video-called Jessika and Israel so that he wouldn't feel alone as he regained consciousness. ""When he heard our voices he started to cry,"" says Jessika. It was the last time they were to see their boy react. During the next video call ""he had a paralysed look"". The hospital requested a CT scan and discovered Lucas had had a stroke. Still, the couple were told Lucas would make a good recovery with the right care and would soon be moved out of ICU and into a general ward. When Jessika and Israel went to visit him, the doctor was just as hopeful as they were, she says. ""That night, I put my cell phone on silent. I dreamed Lucas came up to me and kissed my nose. And the dream was a great feeling of love, gratitude and I woke up very happy. Then I saw my cell phone and saw the 10 calls that the doctor had made."" The doctor told Jessika that Lucas's heart rate and oxygen levels had dropped suddenly, and he had died early that morning. She feels sure that if Lucas had been given a Covid test when she had requested it back in early May he would have survived. ""It is important that doctors, even if they believe it is not Covid, do the test to eliminate the possibility,"" she says. ""A baby does not say what he is feeling, so we depend on tests."" Jessika believes that the delay in proper treatment made his condition more serious. ""Lucas had several inflammations, 70% of the lung was compromised, the heart increased by 40%. It was a situation that could have been avoided."" Dr Monte, who treated Lucas, agrees. She says that although MIS cannot be prevented, treatment is much more successful if the condition is diagnosed and treated early. ""The earlier he would have received specialised care, the better,"" she says. ""He arrived at the hospital already critically ill. I believe he could have had a different outcome if we could have treated him earlier."" Jessika now wants to share Lucas's story to help others who may miss critical symptoms. ""Every child I know was saved by some warning and the mother says: 'I saw your posts, I took my son to the hospital and he is now at home.' It's as if it were a little bit of Lucas,"" she says. ""I have been doing for these people what I wish they had done for me. If I had had information, I would have been even more cautious."" There is a misconception that children are at zero risk for Covid, says Dr Fatima Marinho, who is also a senior adviser to the international health NGO Vital Strategies. Marinho's research has found that a shockingly high number of children and babies have been affected by the virus. Between February 2020 and 15 March 2021, Covid-19 killed at least852 of Brazil's children up to the age of nine,external, including 518 babies under one year old, according to figures from the Brazilian Ministry of Health. But Dr Marinho estimates that more than twice this number of children died of Covid. A serious problem of underreporting due to lack of Covid testing is bringing the numbers down, she says. Dr Marinho calculated the excess of deaths by unspecified acute respiratory syndrome during the pandemic, and found that there were 10 times more deaths by unexplained respiratory syndrome than in previous years. By adding these numbers, she estimates that the virus in fact killed 2,060 children under nine years old, including 1,302 babies. This video can not be played Looking after the babies and children in Brazil's Covid ICU Experts say the sheer number of Covid cases in the country -the second-highest number in the world,external- have increased the likelihood that Brazil's babies and young children are affected. ""Of course, the more cases we have and, as a result, the more hospitalisations, the greater the number of deaths in all age groups, including children. But if the pandemic were controlled, this scenario could evidently be minimised,"" says Renato Kfouri, president of the Scientific Department of Immunisations of the Brazilian Society of Pediatrics. Such a high infection rate has overwhelmed Brazil's entire health care system. Across the country, oxygen supplies are dwindling, there is a shortage of basic medicines and in many ICUs across the country there are simply no more beds. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro continues to oppose lockdowns and the infection rate is being driven by a variant called P.1 which emerged in Manaus, in northern Brazil, last year, and is thought to be much more contagious. Twice the number of people died last month than in any other month of the pandemic, and the upward trend is continuing. Covid-19: Why have deaths soared in Brazil? Covid: Younger Brazilians fall ill as cases explode Brazil's health system has 'collapsed' with Covid Another problem driving the high rates in children is a lack of testing. Marinho says that for children often the Covid diagnosis comes too late, when they are already seriously ill. ""We have a serious problem detecting cases. We don't have enough tests for the general population, even fewer for children. Because there is a delay in the diagnosis, there is a delay in care for the child,"" she says. This is not just because there is little testing capacity, but also because it is easier to miss, or misdiagnose, the symptoms of children suffering from Covid-19, as the disease tends to present differently in younger people. Medical staff have bought tablets and phones to make video calls between parents and children ""A child has a lot more diarrhoea, a lot more abdominal pain, and chest pain, than the classic Covid picture. Because there is a delay in diagnosis, when the child arrives at the hospital they are in a serious condition and can end up complicating - and dying,"" she says. But it's also about poverty and access to health care. An observational study of 5,857Covid-19 patients under the age of 20,external, carried out by Brazilian paediatricians led by Braian Sousa from the SÃ£o Paolo school of medicine, identified both comorbidities and socioeconomic vulnerabilities as risk factors for the worst outcome of Covid-19 in children. Marinho agreesthis is an important factor,external. ""Most vulnerable are black children, and those from very poor families, as they have the most difficulty accessing help. These are the children most at risk of death."" She says this is because crowded housing conditions make it impossible to socially distance when infected, and because poorer communities do not have access to a local ICU. These children are also at risk of malnutrition, which is ""terrible for the immune response"", Marinho says. WhenCovid payments stopped, millions were plunged back,externalinto poverty. ""We went from7 million to 21 millio,externaln people below the poverty line in one year. So people are also going hungry. All of this is impacting mortality."" Sousa says his study identifies certain risk groups among children that should be prioritised for vaccination. Currently, there areno vaccines available,externalfor children under 16 years of age. Visits by relatives to children in ICU have been restricted since the beginning of the pandemic, for fear of infection. Dr Cinara Carneiro, an ICU doctor at Albert Sabin Children's Hospital, says this has been immensely challenging, not just because parents are a comfort to their children, but because they can also help in a clinical sense - they can tell when their child is in pain or in psychological distress and when they need soothing rather than medicating. Dr Cinara Carneiro And she says the parents' absence intensifies their own trauma when they hear their child's condition has deteriorated and they haven't been there to witness it. ""It hurts to see a child dying without seeing their parents,"" says Dr Carneiro. In an attempt to improve the communication between parents and their children, staff at Albert Sabin hospital clubbed together to buy phones and tablets to facilitate video calls. Dr Carneiro says this has helped immensely. ""We have made over 100 video calls between family members and patients. This contact has greatly reduced the stress."" Scientists stress the risk of death in this age group is still ""very low"" - the current figures suggest only 0.58% of Brazil's 345,287 Covid deaths to date have been of 0-9 year olds - but that is more than 2,000 children. ""The numbers are really scary,"" says Dr Carneiro. While coronavirus is infectious to children, it is rarely serious. If your child is unwell it is likely to be a non-coronavirus illness, rather than coronavirus itself. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health advises parents seek URGENT help (call 111 or go to A&E)  if their child is: Becoming pale, mottled and feeling abnormally cold to the touch Has pauses in their breathing (apnoeas), has an irregular breathing pattern or starts grunting Has severe difficulty in breathing, becoming agitated or unresponsive Is going blue round the lips Has a fit/seizure Becomes extremely distressed (crying inconsolably despite distraction), confused, very lethargic (difficult to wake) or unresponsive Develops a rash that does not disappear with pressure (the 'Glass test') Has testicular pain, especially in teenage boys Fierce winds threaten more fire destruction as LA struggles to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Judge sentencing Trump in historic New York criminal case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"The crisis caused by the pandemic has forced a growing number of people to depend on food donations The queue snakes around the block and each day it gets longer: hungry residents of Heliopolis, SÃ£o Paulo's largest favela, waiting in line for the handout that will keep them going until the next morning. They are given a bowl of pasta with meat and a portion of rice, two packets of biscuits and a carton of milk, shared between a whole household and usually their only meal of the day. Before the pandemic, 300 people would queue up here. Now it is over 1,000, and the charity that runs it has 650 others across SÃ£o Paulo. ""The vast majority of people who live in the favelas work in the informal economy, as cleaners in homes or helping to bake cakes, so when businesses close or houses stop using them, they feel the impact,"" says Marcivan Barreto, the local co-ordinator. ""You see people queuing up at 03:00 for food. I'm very worried that as the pandemic continues, a hungry father will start looting supermarkets. When you're starving, despair hits."" Why are so many babies dying of Covid-19 in Brazil? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? What is the Brazil variant and do vaccines work against it? During the first wave of the pandemic, Brazil's government introduced emergency relief, known as ""coronavouchers"". More than 67 million people received a monthly sum of 600 reais (Â£83; $107, at the time). It was the biggest single injection of financial aid in Brazil's history, introduced by a president, Jair Bolsonaro, who had previously railed against welfare spending. It pushed extreme poverty to its lowest level since the 1970s - and boosted the president's support. But the relief was temporary. With ballooning public debt,the government first suspended the programmeand then reintroduced it but at a far lower level of 250 reais and for fewer people. Marcivan Barreto, who helps co-ordinate the food distribution, says he is worried: ""When you're starving, despair hits"" The drop in aid has hit Luciana Firmino and her family hard. She and her husband now depend on the food handout to feed their five children, living in a cramped couple of rooms in one of the favela's narrow alleyways. When the pandemic hit, she lost her job in a manicure studio and her husband's occasional work dried up. Clutching her nine-month-old daughter, she says each day is a decision whether to pay for milk or diapers. ""We can't afford the rent anymore. So we will soon be out in the streets or under a bridge."" Then she breaks down. ""I was hoping for a good life,"" she says through tears. ""Sometimes I think I should give my children away to social services."" Luciana with her nine-month-old daughter breaks down: ""Sometimes I think I should give my children away to social services"" Brazil is in the grip of a health and social emergency. It has the world's second-highest death toll from the pandemic at over 370,000, and hospitals are near collapse. A study last week found that 60% of Brazilian households have food insecurity, lacking sufficient access to enough to eat. President Bolsonaro - who once dismissed the virus as ""just a little flu"", opposed lockdowns and failed to secure vaccine supplies in time - has lost support, particularly as the food handouts have declined. Attempts at impeachment are stirring. But he still has his devoted fans, who insist ""the establishment"" are trying to destroy him. This video can not be played Brazil's Covid crisis: 'I thought it was the end' Three hours' drive out of SÃ£o Paulo, the corn harvest is underway on Frederico D'Avila's farm. He has 1,300 hectares of the crop, as well as soybean, barley and fava, nestled beside dense pine forests. And as the harvester cuts through the stalks of corn, he talks of how the president is slashing ""the system of kleptocracy - chains of corruption - that have run here for 35 years"". ""President Bolsonaro wants to preserve liberty; he wants people to get out, work, feed their children,"" he says. ""He wants people to decide if they want the vaccine, not to be obligated by the state. Freedom in Brazil has always been under threat."" I put it to him that the price of that policy is the public health disaster that Brazil is living through. ""It's not a disaster"", he replies. ""We don't have all the data from other countries so we don't know true numbers of dead."" Frederico D'Avila says the president's hands were tied by other institutions, a claim repeated by Bolsonaro supporters Supporters of the president echo the same line, hammered home by the effective Bolsonaro communication machine with claims that if other institutions, including the Supreme Court, had not tied his hands, he could have managed the pandemic fully. To the charge that Brazil was desperately slow to order vaccines, they reply that the shots could not have been ordered earlier as they had not yet been approved by Brazil's health regulator. When I remind him that many countries ordered large quantities of vaccines pending regulatory approval so they could then be rolled out quickly, Mr D'Avila tells me the Supreme Court could have sued the president if the shots were ordered and then not approved. ""If he had unlimited power like a king, it would be better. He wouldn't need to deal with the Supreme Court and pressure groups,"" he says. Brazil has become the epicentre of the pandemic, with thousands of deaths every day President Bolsonaro is on the back foot. Under fire for mishandling what is becoming a humanitarian crisis and facing a threat from former President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, whose conviction for corruption was recently overturned, paving the way to challenge the president in next year's election. And all the while hospitals fill up, the food queues grow longer, and this shattered country watches helplessly as fresh graves are dug. Why are so many babies dying of Covid-19 in Brazil?

"A crowd of football supporters gathered in George Square Crowds gathered in London's Leicester Square and George Square in Glasgow following Scotland's 0-0 draw with England. Scotland fans have been celebrating the result, which keeps alive hopes they could still qualify for the next round of the Euro 2020 tournament. There was large police presence in both cities, and in London 30 people were arrested, the Met Police said. Most arrests were made in central London and near Wembley Stadium. The force said offences included violence and disorder, possession of drugs, possession of an offensive weapon, racial aggravation, drunk and disorderly behaviour and assault of a police officer, who suffered minor injuries. When a ""large"" crowd gathered in Leicester Square, flares were set off as fans, many wearing kilts and draped in Scotland flags, sang Flower of Scotland and chanted ""No Scotland, no party"". Scotland frustrate England at Wembley Live: Reaction to the the England v Scotland result In pictures: Scotland fans celebrate England result The Met Police said at 00:45 BST officers encouraged people still in Leicester Square to leave, finally clearing the area by 01:15 BST. TV coverage of the game drew an average audience of 13.1 million, a peak of 20 million and a 79% audience share across ITV and STV. The match set a new streaming record for the channel with 4.8 million streams across ITV Hub and STV Player. It also becomes the most-watched football match in terms of peak viewing numbers since ITV's coverage of England's World Cup semi-final against Croatia in 2018, which earned 27.5 million viewers. Thousands of supporters travelled south for the matchdespite being urged not to unless they had a ticket or had organised somewhere to watch the game. Earlier adispersal order was issued for central London, giving police extra powers to break up groups of people where they believe their behaviour is causing a nuisance, harassment or distress. There was no indication of disorder in George Square but unauthorised large gatherings are prohibited in Scotland under Covid rules. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, had urged fans to ""be respectful to our hosts"" in London and not to behave in any way that was going to make the Covid problem worse. This video can not be played Supporters at Glasgow fan zone react to Scotland's draw with England The 3,000 strong crowd of supporters watching the match at Glasgow's fan zone erupted into huge cheers when the final whistle went on the 0-0 draw. And at Wembley the Scotland players lapped up the applause of the Tartan Army who stayed behind to celebrate the result as the England fans left. A fan zone in Trafalgar Square - where Scotland fans traditionally congregate when their team faces the Auld Enemy - was reserved for 750 key workers. Malcolm Gillespie, from Falkirk but living in London, was one of those who managed to secure a space in the area. He said the draw was an ""amazing"" result for Scotland. The 41-year-old, who attended with his son Santiago, eight, said: ""I'm happy but I definitely think we could have edged a win. They've played really well. ""It's been fantastic, a really nice atmosphere. I spoke to some English fans who were really friendly. We've loved every minute of it."" Supporters gathered in Glasgow's George Square And in Glasgow's George Square, police kept an eye on supporters who had gathered to celebrate Mark Cumberworth, 58 and from Essex, said he was disappointed with the result, adding: ""It's almost like we've settled for a draw, which isn't the worst result in the world. ""Scotland have played well. England have no chance [of winning the Euros] playing like this."" The Scotland National Team tweeted that it had been a ""monumental"" effort from ""every one"" of the team. And Mrs Sturgeon tweeted: ""Yes, sir, you all boogied."" It was a reference to a video of ecstatic Scotland players dancing to the 1970s disco classic that went viral when they clinched qualification for the tournament by defeating Serbia on penalties in November.

Scotland will face Croatia at Hampden at 20:00 BST on 22 June, while England will play the Czech Republic at Wembley at the same time. Wembley and Hampden are among 11 venues across Europe hosting the games in the tournament, which was delayed for a year because of the pandemic. Scotland's men have never made it past the group stage before, but the top two - or possibly three - teams will go through to the knockout phase. Wembley was open at 25% capacity for the match, with supporters having to show either proof of vaccination or a negative lateral flow test before entry. The Tartan Army were allocated only about 2,600 tickets for Wembley, due to Covid rules. Scotland fans gathered in Leicester Square and put a cone on a Shakespeare statue Throughout the day crowds gathered in Leicester Square In the absence of access to the stadium or official fan zones, many supporters instead booked to watch the match from pubs and bars across London. Some gathered in Hyde Park and Leicester Square throughout the day, with police moving Scotland fans on from the square during the second half of the match. It is understood it came after an opposing group tried to approach the visiting fans.

"This video can not be played Wariness and welcome for Iran's president-elect Hardliner Ebrahim Raisi has won Iran's presidential election in a race that was widely seen as being designed to favour him. He thanked Iranians for their support, after securing 62% of the votes. Mr Raisi is Iran's top judge and holds ultra-conservative views. He is under US sanctions and has been linked to past executions of political prisoners. Iran's president is the second-highest ranking official in the country, after the supreme leader. Who is Ebrahim Raisi, Iran's next president? The unusual way power is held in Iran Iran's presidential election: Four ways it matters Mr Raisi will be inaugurated in early August, and will have significant influence over domestic policy and foreign affairs. But in Iran's political system it is the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the top religious cleric, who has the final say on all state matters. Iran is run according to conservative Shia Islamic values, and there have been curbs on political freedoms since its Islamic Revolution in 1979. Many Iranians saw this latest election as having been engineered for Mr Raisi to win, and shunned the poll. Official figures showed voter turnout was the lowest ever for a presidential election, at 48.8%, compared to more than 70% for the previous vote in 2017. The 60-year-old cleric has served as a prosecutor for most of his career. From an early age, Mr Raisi held powerful and high-ranking positions - when he was just 20 years old, he was already serving as the chief prosecutor of the city of Karaj. He was appointed head of the judiciary in 2019, two years after he lost by a landslide to Hassan Rouhani in the last presidential election. Mr Raisi has presented himself as the best person to fight corruption and inequality, and solve Iran's economic problems. ""Our people's grievances over shortcomings are real,"" he said as he cast his vote in Tehran. The man who wears a black turban identifying him in Shia tradition as a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad is fiercely loyal to Iran's ruling clerics, and has even been seen as a possible successor to Ayatollah Khamenei. Turnout was reportedly significantly down on the previous election in 2017 But many Iranians and rights groups have pointed to Mr Raisi's alleged role in the mass executions of political prisoners in 1988, when he was 27 years old. He is said to have been part of a so-called ""death committee"" - one of four judges who oversaw secret death sentences for about 5,000 prisoners in jails near Tehran, according to Amnesty International. It says the location of the mass graves where the men and women were buried is being ""systematically concealed by the Iranian authorities"". ""That Ebrahim Raisi has risen to the presidency instead of being investigated for the crimes against humanity of murder, enforced disappearance and torture, is a grim reminder that impunity reigns supreme in Iran,"" said Amnesty chief AgnÃ¨s Callamard. Mr Raisi has repeatedly denied his role in the death sentences. But he has also said they were justified because of a fatwa, or religious ruling, by former supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini. Amnesty also says that as head of the judiciary Mr Raisi oversaw impunity for officials and security forces accused of killing protesters during unrest in 2019. Mr Raisi has promised to ease unemployment and work to remove US sanctions that have contributed to economic hardship for ordinary Iranians and caused widespread discontent. BBC Persian correspondent Kasra Naji adds that under Mr Raisi, Iran's hardliners will seek to reinforce a puritanical system of Islamic government, possibly meaning more controls on social activities, fewer freedoms and jobs for women, and tighter control of social media and the press. The hardliners are suspicious of the West, but both Mr Raisi and Supreme Leader Khamenei favour a return to an international deal on Iran's nuclear activity. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, signed in 2015, gave Iran relief from Western sanctions in return for limiting its nuclear activities. The US pulled out of the deal in 2018, and President Trump's administration re-imposed crippling limits on Iran's ability to trade. Mr Raisi was among the officials put under sanctions. Iran has responded by re-starting nuclear operations that were banned under the deal. Talks aimed at resurrecting the deal are ongoing in Vienna, with President Joe Biden also keen to revive it. But both sides say the other must make the first move. Analysis by Kasra Naji, BBC Persian The election was engineered to pave the way for Mr Raisi to win. This has alienated a good number of Iranians already deeply discontented with their living conditions in an economy that is crippled by US sanctions but also mismanagement. The result of the election will not help with their concerns and may even lead to more instability at home. In the past few years Iran has witnessed at least two rounds of serious nationwide protests - with hundreds, some say thousands, killed. With Mr Raisi taking the presidency the hardliners will have taken all the centres of power: the executive branch as well as the legislative and the judiciary. Iran will be a more closed society. Freedoms will likely be curtailed even more than before. The regime will look to China to help the economy out of deep crisis. There will be more tension with the West. Indirect talks between Iran and the US in Vienna over reviving the nuclear deal may face more uncertainty. There are already reports that the talks will now break up for a few weeks, allowing all sides to take stock of the new reality in Iran. Almost 600 hopefuls, including 40 women, registered to be candidates in the election. But in the end only seven men were approved last month by the 12 jurists and theologians on the Guardian Council, an unelected body that has the ultimate decision with regard to candidates' qualifications. Three of those candidates subsequently pulled out before polling day. Before he withdrew, reformist candidate Mohsen Mehralizadeh hinted that the vote would be a foregone conclusion, saying during a candidates' TV debate that the ruling clerics had aligned ""sun, moon and the heavens to make one particular person the president,"" according to The Economist. Meanwhile former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, one of those barred from running, said in a video message that he would not vote, declaring: ""I do not want to have a part in this sin.""

"As one of the most famous faces of the 2000s, people think they know the story of Paris Hilton. So, when the 40-year-old released a YouTube documentary about her life last year, many were shocked to learn about her decades-long struggle with trauma. Hilton tearfully recounted how she was woken up by strangers in her bedroom in the middle of the night as a teenager and forcibly taken across the country. She said her unanswered cries for help repeatedly play out in nightmares which make it difficult to sleep. Her story, though shocking, is not unique. Hilton is one of thousands of American children sent every year by their parents into a private network of ""tough love"" residential programmes and schools marketed at reforming their behaviour. No-one knows how many for sure, because nobody is keeping track. ""My parents got me kidnapped and dropped off in the middle of the mountains,"" 21-year-old Daniel says in a TikTok video watched more than a million times. As a teenager, Daniel suffered anxiety and depression. He was 15 and had recently come out as gay when he self-harmed so severely that he required hospital care. It was in hospital that he was shaken awake in the middle of the night by two men. They told him the process could be easy or hard - depending on how much he resisted. With little fight left in him, Daniel went with the pair. But when he asked a stranger if he could use a telephone to call his parents on a brief stop for food, he says the escorts threatened him with handcuffs. Daniel was sent to a wilderness programme in Georgia where he spent 77 days living outdoors, hiking miles a day on rations. He vividly remembers feeling cold, hungry and dirty for weeks on end and witnessing others attempt to run away and try to take their own lives. Like many others sent to wilderness programmes, he was then enrolled directly into a long-term facility - this time in Montana - where he would spend another 15 months. The Troubled Teen Industry (TTI) has become an umbrella term for a wide scope of private residential programmes like these aimed at modifying adolescent behaviour. From boot camps to boarding schools, these facilities are marketed as treatment for a broad range of behavioural and mental health issues including eating disorders, drug use and defiance. The people who took Hilton and Daniel were from companies specially marketed to families concerned about how their children might react to being enrolled in a programme. These youth transportation services are well-advertised and often come recommended, with parents typically paying a few thousand dollars to have their children taken from their beds and securely dropped off across the country. Parents are sometimes referred to the industry by third parties after feeling they have exhausted other means of getting their children help. Programmes sell themselves on high levels of anecdotal success, with testimonials from families and students on their marketing materials and in online reviews describing them as transformative and even life-saving. But for years, other former residents have been painting a very different picture of their time within these facilities, including in lawsuits and criminal complaints, alleging emotional and physical abuse. The BBC has spoken to 20 people who identify as troubled teen survivors, aged from 20 to their late 40s, about their experiences within the industry over the last few decades. Although their individual backgrounds and reasons for being sent away differ, patterns emerge across their accounts and the hundreds more shared in TTI survivor support networks online. The size of the industry and its yearly turnover of teenagers across the US remains elusive because there is no federal regulator monitoring it. The US Government Accountability Office was tasked with investigating allegations of neglect and abuse across the industry in 2007, but found it difficult to grasp the national picture due to irregular licensing rules at the state level and ambiguity surrounding the labels facilities use to describe themselves - like boot camps or therapeutic boarding schools. Their investigators found thousands of allegations of abuse and examined a number of deaths at behavioural programmes across the US and in American-owned businesses operating abroad. Their reports raised concerns about the level of training required of staff as well as what they described as deceptive and questionable marketing practices aimed at parents. Subsequent hearings in Congress saw parents whose children died within the industry testify. Cynthia Clark Harvey was one of them. Her daughter Erica was just 15 when she died of heatstroke and dehydration on her first full day in a wilderness programme in Nevada in 2002. Cynthia remembers her daughter as a bright, thoughtful and athletic young girl who had always done well academically until she began suffering from mental health problems aged 14. Her struggles led her to become suicidal and begin experimenting with illegal drugs. When Erica was admitted to hospital and excluded from school, the family felt frightened and out of their depth. At the time, the situation felt drastic. Erica had been doing better but her psychiatrist recommended that residential treatment could help her path to recovery. The programme her family chose was well-known and accredited. They felt reassured Erica was in safe hands and would grow from the experience. After weeks of deliberation and planning, they travelled to Nevada under the guise of a family trip with her younger sister. When the deception was revealed, Erica became scared and angry and refused to get out of the car. After a turbulent hours-long group therapy session with other families, she and the other children were taken away. This was the last time Cynthia and her husband ever saw their daughter alive. By the time they got back home to Arizona the following evening, there was already a message waiting on their answering phone telling them to call. They were told Erica had an accident and staff were performing CPR. ""I don't remember the time frame, but at that point she probably had been dead already for quite some time,"" Cynthia says. Erica's obituary could only say that she died hiking in Nevada. Her parents would not find out her cause of death for weeks - and it took years and a lawsuit for them to get records and find out the truth of what happened that day. Cynthia says they eventually settled with the programme for an undisclosed amount on the condition they could speak freely about the circumstances of their daughter's death. She learned Erica had been pushed to keep hiking as her condition worsened throughout the day. She later testified to Congress about how her daughter's distress had been mistaken for teenage belligerence by staff. Even after Erica fell off the trail into brush and rocks, she did not receive medical help for almost an hour. The remote location of the trek and a series of blunders in calling help to their location meant it took hours more for an emergency helicopter to arrive and take her to hospital where she was officially declared dead, long past the point her life could have been saved. Cynthia continues to grapple with regret and grief over what happened and came to connect with other parents who found themselves in the same unimaginable position. No criminal charges were ever filed over her daughter's death but 19 years on, Cynthia continues to speak publicly in favour of industry-wide reform. The National Association of Therapeutic Schools and Programs (Natsap) - the largest membership association of its kind - appeared on behalf of the industry in the congressional hearings, where it was grilled by lawmakers about the protections and checks in place. Natsap's website today says it and the industry have changed over time. It emphasises that it has ethical standards in place and requires members to be licensed by their appropriate state agency or a national accrediting body and have therapeutic services overseen by a qualified clinician, though it does not accredit facilities themselves. Campaigners argue that current levels of oversight are not enough. They say the lack of cohesive national monitoring has allowed bad actors to move around the industry and can enable facilities to rebrand under new names and distance themselves from complaints. In online networks they have built, people who identify as survivors of the industry connect and offer support across the country - pooling information and resources to track alleged abuses and a revolving door of programmes and staff. One Reddit forum on the topic has more than 20,000 members alone. While a number of the more controversial programmes and organisations have closed down in recent years, allegations continue to plague the industry. A lot of the stories and experiences former residents recounted to the BBC had a lot in common - whether they got out decades ago or within the last couple of years. Many described arrival processes that left them feeling degraded and dehumanised. Those taken by transport companies described the process as disorienting and frightening. Some, including sex abuse victims, complained of invasive strip searches and examinations. One person, who was sent due to struggles with depression stemming from gender dysphoria, recounted undergoing a smear test as a virgin aged 14. Others described having their heads shaved and having blood and drugs testing despite having no history of substance abuse themselves. Some claim to have witnessed and experienced practices like isolation and restraint and say they were also expected to punish and restrain others. Many of the systems they described were based on levels where active participation, including in ""attack therapy"" sessions where group members are expected to confront and criticise one another, was required to progress and gain basic privileges. Others described arbitrary physical labour, collective punishments and periods of mandated silence which could last weeks. They all described repressive environments with extreme limits and censorship of their contact with the outside world. Many believe their parents were misled about the reality of the programmes they enrolled them in, and describe rules that seeded mistrust between them and their families. Some recounted ongoing damage to relationships and enduring fears of opening up about their experiences, even after leaving, for fear of being sent back or not being believed. Some told the BBC they witnessed physical violence, self-harm and suicide attempts and many know other residents who took their own lives after leaving. Others have subsequently been diagnosed with conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder and say they continue to suffer long-term social difficulties, including in trusting in others, because of their experience. In 2006, journalist Maia Szalavitz wrote a book that urged parents to seek evidence-based treatment for children instead of resorting to behavioural modification facilities. Her book traces the origins of many of the methods used in the industry, including confrontational group therapy, to controversial and discredited programmes from decades ago. Advocates for change say the teenage ""tough love"" industry, which first began to take off in the 1980s, has been able to endure decades of controversy in part because of social stigma surrounding the issues why parents seek help. It is not uncommon for teenagers to spend years within the system and monthly tuition, sometimes in the thousands, can mount up fast. Many, including Szalavitz, believe those referring families can exploit or exaggerate fears children will end up dead or incarcerated because of issues like drug abuse. Both she and Dr Kate Truitt, a clinical psychologist and neuroscientist who works with former residents, say the trauma experienced at these facilities can actually perpetuate or lead to long-term battles with addiction and abusive relationships. Many ex-residents, including some the BBC spoke to, say they initially viewed their treatment as justified and even advocated for others to send their children. Some took years to change their opinion of their programme after they reflected on their experiences. Dr Truitt compares the trauma she has seen in some former residents to that experienced by former members of cults or prisoners of war. She points out that their experiences can be particularly damaging as adolescence is such a critical time for development. ""And because of the type of specific trauma they've endured, most survivors don't feel safe seeking out treatment, because the people who were the treatment providers are the perpetrators,"" she tells the BBC. Paris Hilton revealed she had already run away from a number of other placements before she was taken to Provo Canyon in Utah and kept for almost a year before she turned 18. The documentary This is Paris shows her reuniting with classmates as they go public with their ongoing trauma from alleged experiences of emotional and physical abuse there, including allegations of punishments like solitary confinement. Provo Canyon remains open. A statement pinned to the top of their website says it was sold to new owners in 2000 and it cannot comment on operations or patient experiences before this time. They also say they do not use methods like seclusion or mechanical restraint now. Hilton's documentary has been watched almost 30 million times and she has continued vocal advocacy since its release. This role marks a drastic departure from the persona she built her celebrity brand and business empire around. Although her teenage history was already known among those who went through the same systems, they say having someone as high-profile come forward has helped bring credibility and awareness to the issue. People within the community say the documentary has empowered some to speak out about their experience for the first time or has been useful to help others, including parents, understand what they went through. Some former residents have united under the idea of #BreakingCodeSilence, in reference to the periods of mandated social isolation used as a punishment and as a method of control in some facilities. ""One of the rules in many of these programmes is that you couldn't take anyone's phone number or name when you left. So, we were never meant to connect,"" Katherine McNamara, who went to Provo with Hilton, says about the groups that have emerged on social media. She and some others are now working together on a non-profit to help raise awareness, support those who identify as survivors and advocate for change. Other celebrities, including Paris Jackson and tattoo artist Kat von D, have been inspired by the documentary to come forward. Rapper Bhad Bhabie, real name Danielle Bregoli, has called for television personality Dr Phil to apologise for sending her and other teenagers to troubled teen facilities on his popular US show. It came after another former guest filed a lawsuit alleging she had been punished for reporting an alleged sexual assault by a staff member at the same therapeutic boarding ranch Bregoli was sent to. The facility, which the BBC contacted for a response, has previously denied the allegations against it and disputed their accounts. Phil McGraw said in an interview he was sad to hear of Bregoli's alleged bad experience but distanced himself and his show from her claims. Younger people, once isolated from their teenage peers because of their experience, are using social media to try and break the stigma. Some have gained huge followings on platforms like TikTok from telling their stories. But none of this is without personal risk - the BBC has seen legal letters sent to one content creator after they spoke publicly. Daniel has gained more than 240,000 followers and millions of likes since he started telling his and other people's stories last year. He now gets dozens of messages every day from others who went through similar situations and has had parents contact him to say they've reconsidered plans to send their children away after seeing his videos. ""If my 15-year-old self knew that people were out there fighting for me, I would have felt so relieved,"" he says about the movement. In some cases, social media has been a tool for tangible change. One woman, Amanda Householder, used TikTok to spread awareness of allegations surrounding her parents' treatment of girls at a religious boarding ranch they were running in Missouri. Millions viewed her videos and eventually officials closed the school. Prosecutors later filed more than 100 charges of physical and sexual abuse against the pair, which they have denied. All this attention has coincided with a cascade of state-level legislative reform. Householder testified to end religious exemptions in the state of Missouri that stopped even basic oversight of conditions at private religious facilities like the one her parents ran. She described the experience to the BBC as ""very catharticâ¦ knowing that maybe in the future kids won't have to go through what we went through"" and says she hopes to give evidence in their criminal case. Hilton was part of a group who spoke at a hearing to convince lawmakers to introduce better protections in Utah - the state thought to have the biggest density of troubled teen facilities in the US. ""I don't know if my nightmares will ever go away, but I do know that there are hundreds of thousands of kids going through this, and maybe if I stop their nightmares, it will help me stop mine,"" she testified. But for her and others, the real end goal is national change. Previous attempts to push for federal oversight and regulation have repeatedly faltered in Congress. But a spokesperson for Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff's office confirmed to the BBC that he is working to update and re-introduce legislation aimed at prohibiting and ending abuse at residential treatment centres and increasing national oversight of such facilities. Today, Erica Harvey should be in her mid-30s. ""It doesn't get better as the years go on, because it's just more milestones that go by,"" Cynthia reflects. It's been well over a decade since she took part in hearings pushing for federal regulation. But against all odds, she remains hopeful. Cynthia has been emboldened by the momentum building over the last year as more and more have come forward. ""When I first started doing my work after Erica's death, there were survivors out there, but they were not being listened to. And now they're starting to get listened to.""

"The virus continues to spread in Brazil amid a lack of co-ordinated measures The number of deaths related to Covid-19 has passed 500,000 in Brazil, the second-highest in the world, as experts say the outbreak could worsen amid slow vaccination and the start of winter. The virus continues to spread as President Jair Bolsonaro refuses to back measures like social distancing. The health institute Fiocruz says the situation is ""critical"". Only 11% of adults are fully vaccinated. Tens of thousands of Brazilians joined anti-government protests on Saturday. President Bolsonaro has been heavily criticised for not implementing a co-ordinated national response and for his scepticism toward vaccines, lockdowns and mask-wearing requirements, which he has sought to loosen. Covid - what's gone wrong in Brazil? Why are so many babies dying of Covid-19 in Brazil? What happened when a whole town got Covid jabs? The country has reported, on average, 70,000 cases and 2,000 deaths daily in the past week. Most of the new infections and deaths were among people aged 20-59, Fiocruz said, warning that the start of winter in the southern hemisphere, next week, could result in more infections. Despite this, governors and mayors have already relaxed the restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the virus. In many cities, restaurants, bars and shops have reopened while many people in the streets do not wear face masks or follow social distancing. ""People in Brazil are tired and they normalise death now so I think we still have a long way to go,"" Dr Natalia Pasternak Taschner, a microbiologist at the Question of Science Institute, told the BBC. ""If we're not successful in changing the behaviour of people and if we don't have campaigns for mask wearing, social distancing and vaccinations coming directly from the central government we're not going to be able to control it."" There have been protests across Brazil, including in the city of Cuiaba On Saturday, protests against President Bolsonaro were held in cities across the country, with demonstrators accusing him of delaying the purchase of vaccines while prioritising unproven treatments, such as hydroxychloroquine. In rallies in Rio de Janeiro, BrasÃ­lia and elsewhere, furious Brazilians carried banners with slogans like ""Bolsonaro must go"" or simply ""500,000"". ""His position on Covid and his denialism are absurd. He has abandoned reality and common sense. There is no explaining this, it is surreal,"" Robert Almeida, a 50-year-old marching in Rio, told AFP. Protester Denise Azevedo told Reuters: ""Herd immunity won't do any good. The only immunity you can get is with the vaccine. There is no early treatment. I have lost many friends, almost lost a cousin... people are orphans, fatherless, motherless, and childless."" The outbreak in Brazil has been fuelled by more transmissible variants of the virus, including the one first identified in the Amazon region and now known as Gamma. The rate of occupancy of intensive care unit beds remains at or above 80% in most states, while cities struggle with short supplies of vaccines. This video can not be played Looking after the babies and children in Brazil's Covid ICU A parliamentary inquiry at the Brazilian Senate is looking into President Bolsonaro's handling of the pandemic. The opposition accuses him of delaying vaccine orders for political reasons, as he has consistently played down the severity of the pandemic. But the president, whose popularity has plummeted, says he has done all he can to buy vaccines from several countries. He also insists the impact of lockdowns on the economy would be worse than the virus, a position shared by his supporters. President Bolsonaro has not commented on the 500,000 deaths. On Twitter, Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga expressed solidarity with the ""fathers, mothers, friends and relatives"" of those who had died. Only the US has reported more total deaths related to Covid-19.

"This video can not be played What do you think about a tourist tax? Tourism industry bosses have given ministers in Wales a blunt message on plans for a possible tourist tax: ""No way."" It followed Welsh government moves to explore a levy on visitors holidaying in Wales. The Wales Tourism Alliance said it would make the industry less competitive, and make Wales seem more expensive. Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said no decision had been made. Unveiling theWelsh government's programme of priorities,externalover the next five years, First Minister Mark Drakeford said a tourism levy ""could be a significant opportunity for local authorities to invest in the conditions that make tourism a success"". UK tourism spending 'worth just half of pre-pandemic level' Tourism facing tough summer despite relaxed rules Holiday cottages to get 'year's takings over summer' But the Wales Tourism Alliance chairman, Andrew Campbell, responded: ""Not only will it make the industry less competitive, sending out a perception that Wales will be a more expensive destination to visit, but businesses are already struggling to bounce back financially from the pandemic. ""Rather than proposing a new tax, the Welsh government should be focusing on financial support to help the sector."" Anglesey Tourism Alliance said there had already been many more visitors than usual to the island this year But within the sector, there were concerns the industry could overwhelm some local populations. Nia Jones, at Anglesey Tourism Alliance, said there had already been many more visitors to the island this year. ""Whitsun [half-term] was something else here on the island. I'd say the word 'sinking' comes to mind, not just with overnight visitors, but day visitors too."" Bed and breakfast owner George Reid said his Glangwilli Mansion in Carmarthenshire had seen unprecedented demand ""from the moment that we could open the doors"". ""The phone has never stopped ringing, literally from the moment that the restrictions were announced that it would be lifting."" Tourism bosses have said they are not in favour of the plans It's not just those relying on the trade for an income that have noticed an increase in visitors - those who live in honeypot towns, such as resort town Benllech on Anglesey, said there has been ""a heck of a lot more"" tourists. ""Usually we get a nice quiet period between Whitsun and the summer holidays, but it seems to me that everybody's staying here,"" said resident Gareth Hughes. Anglesey resident Gareth Hughes said he noticed there had been more visitors to the island Anglesey tourism chief Nia Jones accepted tourism levies had worked elsewhere, especially on mainland Europe. But she added: ""Is it something that the trade needs to deal and cope with at the moment? That's questionable. ""I think it shouldn't be a knee-jerk reaction. There needs to be much consultation with the trade, and the visitors of course, to get the fine balance. ""And we need to know exactly how that money's going to be spent."" Fellow resident Chris Lewis-Roberts was in favour of a tax ""as long as it was a minimum"" Ask those in locations such as Benllech though, and they broadly support a tax levy idea - residents and holidaymakers alike. ""I can't see why not, as long as it was a minimum. And it would make a lot of local people happy too,"" said Benllech resident Chris Lewis-Roberts. Gill Simpson, who is on holiday in Benllech with Dawn Warburton, said: ""I agree if it's going to improve the roads and improve infrastructure, but it depends whether it would be affordable."" Gill Simpson and Dawn Warburton were in favour if a tax improved roads and infrastructure Ms Warburton agreed - but also accepted ""it could put some people off coming and that wouldn't work very well"". Pet shop owner Lesley Jones backed the levy: ""I think it would be a good thing, as long as the money is then used to help areas that need it most."" She suggested the income raised should be used to help first time buyers on to the property ladder. Pet shop owner Lesley Jones said any money made should be ""used to help areas that need it most"" The economy minister said the tourism sector did not need to worry that changes would be forced on it - though it is unclear whether the Welsh government has the power to bring in a tourist tax. ""It's a conversation and a broad consultation we need to have now. It's got to involve local government because lots of visitors bring lots of pressure on local government services. ""We've got to take a health services perspective, and you then have to have a conversation with the people who are in the tourism industry itself as well. ""So I don't think people working in this industry need to worry that something is going to be done to them."" Welsh Conservative tourism spokesperson Tom Giffard MS said: ""The evidence and calls against a tourism tax in Wales are mounting, and the first minister now needs to confirm that this terrible idea is a non-starter.""

"Edinburgh and Glasgow are the two biggest tourism employers in Scotland Much of Scotland's tourism industry is facing poor levels of bookings in the coming months, despite thegradual easing of Covid restrictions, research has found. A survey by the Scottish Tourism Alliance (STA) found many operators are in a worse position than last year. Some of the sector remains closed while social distancing remains in place. And there have been calls for extra support in order for some firms to survive through to next summer. Most of mainland Scotland will move to level two from Monday, allowing groups of up to six adults from three households to meet indoors - and stay overnight. Pubs and restaurants will be allowed to serve alcohol indoors until 22:30, but people will still be required to maintain a physical distance - something that is under review by the government. What rules are changing, and when? Carry on staycationing What's the state of the outbreak in Scotland? Marc Crothall, the STA chief executive, said smaller self-catering businesses are looking to recovery with current bookings, but ""other accommodation providers are struggling as bookings are not coming in at the level needed to trade viably over what would be the busiest part of the year"". He added: ""Food and beverage income is far from healthy across the board, although this will hopefully change with the next easing of restrictions on 17 May. Of 271 firms in the Alliance survey, 30% intend to remain closed even though restrictions are being eased. The continuing restrictions and lack of consumer confidence mean they do not believe they can be viable. For 38% of firms, takings from food and drink since they were allowed to re-open have been below a fifth of normal levels. The findings point to ""an extremely slow start to accommodation bookings"". For more than 40% of hotels in the survey, bookings from this month to July point to occupancy at below 20%. There are relatively strong bookings for some rural locations, yet only 30% of firms say they expect occupancy above 60% of rooms. Scotland is expected to see a staycation boom this summer but that is not so far reflected across all of the tourism industry Reservations in city hotels are ""worryingly low"", according to the STA. Asked if they expect occupancy below half of their capacity, 98% of city hotel bosses said that is the case for June, and 87% for July. A different measure of bookings shows only 13% of rooms booked in Glasgow in July, and 15% in August. Edinburgh hotels report 19% bookings in July rising to 22% in the festival month of August. These findings follow a survey last month of the Association of Scottish Visitor Attractions, which found 54% of them intend to remain closed while they are required to retain two-metre social distancing. Mr Crothall said there was a recruitment crisis, with all those in the survey saying they have vacancies, and there was evidence of a significant shortage of chefs. ""A great deal rides on the further easing of restrictions which come into force from next Monday and beyond, particularly for the night time economy and events industry,"" he said. ""This really is the last chance for most of Scotland's tourism industry to start to recoup some of the lost income from the past year."" Wild Scotland, representing outdoor adventure firms, found 45% of 105 companies surveyed have to operate at below 50% of capacity due to Covid restrictions. The association says many adventure tourism businesses will require further financial support to survive into 2022, particularly those with a reliance on international visitors, and the marine sector, as they face a second year of being unable to trade.

"The city has a reputation for delivering popular cultural events, like the Liverpool Giants in 2018 Nearly 30 figures from politics, football and academia have signed a letter urging Unesco not to strip Liverpool of its World Heritage status.

"Mathew O'Toole had been sitting on a bench when he began vomiting and sweating A man who collapsed on a London street after suffering a stroke is hoping to track down the ""guardian angel"" who saved his life. Mathew O'Toole, 47, was outside Ole & Steen on Wigmore Street in Mayfair at 08:30 BST on 10 June when it happened. He was sitting on a bench when he began vomiting and sweating. His wife, Georgina, 44, shared a Twitter post hoping to track down the woman who helped. She wrote: ""He started vomiting. Many people passed by. Many probably assumed that he was drunk or hungover.

"Mathew O'Toole had been sitting on a bench when he began vomiting and sweating A man who collapsed on a London street after suffering a stroke is hoping to track down the ""guardian angel"" who saved his life. Mathew O'Toole, 47, was outside Ole & Steen on Wigmore Street in Mayfair at 08:30 BST on 10 June when it happened. He was sitting on a bench when he began vomiting and sweating. His wife, Georgina, 44, shared a Twitter post hoping to track down the woman who helped. She wrote: ""He started vomiting. Many people passed by. Many probably assumed that he was drunk or hungover. One lady stopped. ""She recognised the signs of a stroke, called the paramedics, and directed them to take him straight to UCH emergency stroke unit. ""If she hadn't done that, we might not have him here today. Or things could have been a lot worse than they are."" Mr O'Toole was able to return home to his family in Farnham after five days in hospital Mr O'Toole was able to return home to his family in Farnham, Surrey, after five days in hospital, and although he is lacking some balance and coordination, he is set to make a full recovery. ""The road to recovery is long and I know there are going to be ups and downs, but it's purely because of the help that woman gave me that I am here today,"" he said. ""It is Father's Day tomorrow, and I could have left two children, aged 16 and 12, and a wife, but as it is I am looking forward to opening some socks.""

He added: ""People do walk past, we don't always take the time to see what is going on around us, but if that woman hadn't stopped, I would have been dead. She was just so calming with me all the way through.""

"Lib Dem Sarah Green defeated Conservative candidate Peter Fleet (left) overturning a 16,000 Tory majority in Chesham and Amersham The government has been sent a ""warning shot"" by voters over planning reforms for England and the HS2 rail link, the co-chairman of the Tories has said.

"Morrisons has rejected a Â£5.5bn takeover proposal from US private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. The UK's fourth-largest supermarket, with 118,000 staff, said the offer ""significantly undervalues"" the firm. CD&R, where former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy is an advisor, confirmed it was considering a formal bid after weekend media speculation about its plans. The US firm has previously made investments in the discount shop chain B&M, from which it made more than Â£1bn. Morrisons said in a statement it had ""evaluated the conditional proposal together with its financial adviser, Rothschild & Co, and unanimously concluded that the conditional proposal significantly undervalued Morrisons and its future prospects"". CD&R's proposal, worth 230 pence a share, does not constitute a formal offer, and under UK takeover rules it has until 17 July to announce a firm intention to bid or walk away. Morrisons boss suffers huge revolt over Â£1.7m bonus Morrisons hails 'renaissance of the supermarket' People return to supermarkets as online sales slow The move by CD&R, one of the biggest takeover firms in the world, would have been one of the most high profile of many bids for UK companies in the past year. BBC business correspondent Katie Prescott said the flurry of takeover activity was being fuelled by relatively low share prices of businesses in the UK compared to abroad and cheap money because of low interest rates. CD&R has this year agreed a Â£2.8bn takeover of UK healthcare group UDG, and a Â£308m bid for the plumbing group Wolseley. Morrisons' boss David Potts used to work at Tesco with Sir Terry Leahy, now an advisor to CD&R. In February, Zuber and Mohsin Issa and private equity firm TDR Capital purchased a majority stake in Asda from Walmart in a deal valuing the UK supermarket group at Â£6.8bn. That deal followed Sainsbury's failure to take over Asda, which was blocked by the competition regulator. Morrisons - with its 500-store property portfolio, most of which it owns outright - and its 10% of the grocery market - is an attractive proposition. There has been speculation about bids for Morrisons in the past from Amazon, which sells the supermarket's products on its site. According to the Financial Times, which along with Sky News, first revealed details of CD&R's intentions,the US buy-out firm approached Morrisons on 14 June.,externalIn addition to the cash offer, CD&R would take on Morrisons' Â£3.2bn of debt, taking the total value of any deal to almost Â£9bn. A formal bid from CD&R could involve Mr Leahy, who when at Tesco was the boss of Andrew Higginson and David Potts, now Morrisons' chairman and chief executive respectively. Last month, Morrisons said sales had increased by 2.7% in the 14 weeks to 9 May. But in the previous three months alone it had faced a Â£27m bill for Covid-related costs. Earlier this month, Morrisons was rebuked by investors over executive pay, with more than 70% of votes cast at its annual shareholders' meeting rejecting its pay report.

"Walk-in vaccine clinics are opening in England, in a major push to offer coronavirus jabs to all remaining adults Queues have formed at pop-up vaccination centres at football grounds in London, including Chelsea and West Ham's stadiums More first doses of vaccines were given than second jabs on Thursday and Friday, reflecting the push to get the UK's younger adults vaccinated The UK records more than 10,000 daily cases for the third day in a row - after months of lower figures A new wave of infections is definitely under way in England, says Prof Adam Finn of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation But epidemiologist Dr Mike Tildesley says he is ""cautiously hopeful"" hospital admissions will not be on the same scale as in January Labour is calling for workers to have the right to work flexibly before coronavirus restrictions are fully lifted in England Some people on furlough are avoiding a return to work because it has been ""great"" for them, says Tory MP Andrea Leadsom The Palestinian Authority has cancelled a deal under which Israel was to give it one million Pfizer jabs because they were too close to expiry Edited by James Clarke That's all from the live page team, thanks for joining us today. Your updates were written by Jennifer Meierhans and Victoria Lindrea and edited by James Clarke. We will be back with more tomorrow, have a good evening. The London Stadium has opened as a walk-in vaccination centre We are going to be bringing our coronavirus updates to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's news: Pfizer BioNtech vaccines were given at the London Stadium About 3,000 Christians formed groups at one-mile intervals along a coastal path topray for those bereaved by the pandemic. Pastor Mark Pugh says: ""Some were individuals going to the mile spots, others were church groups so there was a real change of dynamics at each of those points."" The South West Coast Path runs from Minehead, Somerset, to Poole, Dorset. The footpath is 630 miles long (1,013km) and also takes in Devon and Cornwall. Churches have not been able to welcome congregations through the pandemic due to social-distancing restrictions. But pastor Pugh says: ""We believe the church is not the building, it's the people. ""Churches have been active running food banks, providing care for our communities just offering support and friendship to so many people."" From doodling families having their vaccines, to depicting intensive care staff trying to save patients, artists recorded some of the most significant moments in the coronavirus pandemic. Now they hope the touching moments their art has captured over the past 16 months will become part of history. Nathan Wyburn created a portrait of an NHS nurse made of 200 pictures of nurses. He says it ""just felt right"" to focus on key workers and ""realised it was kind of the perfect time for me to start creating work that meant something more to me, and focus on the everyday heroes"". Angie Stevens has been drawing for 10 years, documenting her family's experiences on her websitedoodlemum.com,external. Angie said drawing had helped her make sense of the pandemic and she wanted toportray how it was affecting her family. She says: ""We've got our data and graphs but history is about the personal, the everyday. I'm a normal person living my life and how it affects me is just as important."" Caerphilly Youth Forum has put together a time capsule to document how young people were living through the pandemic in 2020. It asked young people across the borough to send in photos, drawings, artwork, poems and small items that captured how life had changed.

A school with 1,200 pupils has closed its site to students as a ""precautionary measure"" over Covid concerns. Pupils at Greenhill School in Tenby, Pembrokeshire, will be taught online from Monday because of the number having to self-isolate and increasing case rates. Head Raymond McGovern says: ""Clearly, our locality and the school are part of this picture of increased rates."" It comes as Wales' first minister said Wales is at thestart of a third wave. Pembrokeshire has Wales' fifth highest rate of Covid cases for those aged under 25 - at 55.2 cases for every 100,000 of the population, according to Public Health Wales figures for this week. Greenhill School's year 10 age group is already isolating at homedue to a number of positive Covid cases. A woman in hospital for more than 10 weeks and unable to have visitors because of Covid rules says the loneliness is ""soul-destroying"". Margaret Evans, 86, from Nefyn in Gwynedd, says she felt ""torn away from the world"" with a ban on visitors at Ysbyty Alltwen, Tremadog. Margaret says it ""isn't fair"", because another nearby community hospital allowed garden visits. Elaine Beer from Minffordd said her 83-year-old mother has been at Ysbyty Gwynedd for two weeks and has also been unable to have visitors. ""Mum phones me in tears saying she's lonely,"" she says. ""It's not fair - either everyone can go [to visit] or nobody at all."" Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board says it appreciates visiting restrictions have been difficult for patients and their families, and is promising changes will be implemented across the board this week to allow visits by appointment.

Moderna vaccines arrive in Taiwan The US will ship 2.5 million Covid vaccine doses to Taiwan on Saturday - more than three times the previous number of shots allocated for the island by Washington, Reuters reports. The US administration had initially promised to donate 750,000 doses to Taiwan, but the huge increase follows President Joe Biden's pledge to send 80 million US-made shots around the world. Few people in Taiwan have yet received the vaccine, with the island struggling to access supplies - andunwilling to accept help from neighbouring China because the two sides are political foes. Taiwan's leaders favour more independence for the island, something China forcefully resists. Beijing believes Taiwan is part of its own territory, and wants it to unify with the mainland. Taipei has expressed concern about the safety of Chinese shots. The 2.5 million donated doses of the Moderna vaccine were flown out of Memphis early on Saturday. The US has denied it is seeking to exert any influence in Taiwan. ""We are not allocating these doses, or delivering these doses, based on political or economic conditions,"" a senior U.S. administration official says. ""We are donating these vaccines with the singular objective of savinglives. ""Our vaccines do not come with strings attached."" Covid infections remain comparatively low in Taiwan despite a spike in domestic cases. However, only about 6% of Taiwan's population of 23.5 million  have received at least one shot of a vaccine. The UK has recorded more than 10,000 new coronavirus infections for the third day in a row.

By Thea de Gallier BBC Three Lowri: 'You can feel like where you live is just a playground' One of the ongoing narratives we heard over the course of the pandemic was how remote working was leading people to give up city life in favour of bigger, cheaper and more rural living. For many people with desk-based jobs, there was no need to be within travelling distance of the office any more, so expensive flats in and around London and other major cities were traded in for houses in the countryside or by the sea.

The London Stadium has opened as a walk-in vaccination centre We are going to be bringing our coronavirus updates to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's news: Pfizer BioNtech vaccines were given at the London Stadium About 3,000 Christians formed groups at one-mile intervals along a coastal path topray for those bereaved by the pandemic. Pastor Mark Pugh says: ""Some were individuals going to the mile spots, others were church groups so there was a real change of dynamics at each of those points."" The South West Coast Path runs from Minehead, Somerset, to Poole, Dorset. The footpath is 630 miles long (1,013km) and also takes in Devon and Cornwall. Churches have not been able to welcome congregations through the pandemic due to social-distancing restrictions. But pastor Pugh says: ""We believe the church is not the building, it's the people. ""Churches have been active running food banks, providing care for our communities just offering support and friendship to so many people."" From doodling families having their vaccines, to depicting intensive care staff trying to save patients, artists recorded some of the most significant moments in the coronavirus pandemic. Now they hope the touching moments their art has captured over the past 16 months will become part of history. Nathan Wyburn created a portrait of an NHS nurse made of 200 pictures of nurses. He says it ""just felt right"" to focus on key workers and ""realised it was kind of the perfect time for me to start creating work that meant something more to me, and focus on the everyday heroes"". Angie Stevens has been drawing for 10 years, documenting her family's experiences on her websitedoodlemum.com,external. Angie said drawing had helped her make sense of the pandemic and she wanted toportray how it was affecting her family. She says: ""We've got our data and graphs but history is about the personal, the everyday. I'm a normal person living my life and how it affects me is just as important."" Caerphilly Youth Forum has put together a time capsule to document how young people were living through the pandemic in 2020.

A school with 1,200 pupils has closed its site to students as a ""precautionary measure"" over Covid concerns. Pupils at Greenhill School in Tenby, Pembrokeshire, will be taught online from Monday because of the number having to self-isolate and increasing case rates. Head Raymond McGovern says: ""Clearly, our locality and the school are part of this picture of increased rates."" It comes as Wales' first minister said Wales is at thestart of a third wave. Pembrokeshire has Wales' fifth highest rate of Covid cases for those aged under 25 - at 55.2 cases for every 100,000 of the population, according to Public Health Wales figures for this week. Greenhill School's year 10 age group is already isolating at homedue to a number of positive Covid cases. A woman in hospital for more than 10 weeks and unable to have visitors because of Covid rules says the loneliness is ""soul-destroying"". Margaret Evans, 86, from Nefyn in Gwynedd, says she felt ""torn away from the world"" with a ban on visitors at Ysbyty Alltwen, Tremadog. Margaret says it ""isn't fair"", because another nearby community hospital allowed garden visits. Elaine Beer from Minffordd said her 83-year-old mother has been at Ysbyty Gwynedd for two weeks and has also been unable to have visitors. ""Mum phones me in tears saying she's lonely,"" she says. ""It's not fair - either everyone can go [to visit] or nobody at all."" Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board says it appreciates visiting restrictions have been difficult for patients and their families, and is promising changes will be implemented across the board this week to allow visits by appointment.

Moderna vaccines arrive in Taiwan The US will ship 2.5 million Covid vaccine doses to Taiwan on Saturday - more than three times the previous number of shots allocated for the island by Washington, Reuters reports. The US administration had initially promised to donate 750,000 doses to Taiwan, but the huge increase follows President Joe Biden's pledge to send 80 million US-made shots around the world. Few people in Taiwan have yet received the vaccine, with the island struggling to access supplies - andunwilling to accept help from neighbouring China because the two sides are political foes. Taiwan's leaders favour more independence for the island, something China forcefully resists. Beijing believes Taiwan is part of its own territory, and wants it to unify with the mainland. Taipei has expressed concern about the safety of Chinese shots. The 2.5 million donated doses of the Moderna vaccine were flown out of Memphis early on Saturday. The US has denied it is seeking to exert any influence in Taiwan. ""We are not allocating these doses, or delivering these doses, based on political or economic conditions,"" a senior U.S. administration official says. ""We are donating these vaccines with the singular objective of savinglives. ""Our vaccines do not come with strings attached."" Covid infections remain comparatively low in Taiwan despite a spike in domestic cases. However, only about 6% of Taiwan's population of 23.5 million  have received at least one shot of a vaccine.

"The city has a reputation for delivering popular cultural events, like the Liverpool Giants in 2018 Nearly 30 figures from politics, football and academia have signed a letter urging Unesco not to strip Liverpool of its World Heritage status. The threat of demotion has rumbled on for more than a decade after modern developments on the city's waterfront. There are concerns the World Heritage committee will recommend that the city should lose the status in a Unesco report expected on Monday. Regional mayor Steve Rotheram is among those who said it would be a ""setback"". Liverpool received World Heritage status in 2004 Liverpool was granted the highly sought-after World Heritage status from the international cultural organisation Unesco in 2004. The accolade recognises the city's history as a major trading centre during the British Empire and its architectural landmarks. Unesco will confirm the sites on its World Heritage List ina meeting this July,external. World War One soldiers paraded outside St George's Hall in 1915 TheWorld Heritage Site,externalstretches from the city's famous waterfront, through the historic commercial districts, to St George's Hall. The city's bid was centred on its history as a major global port in the 18th and 19th Centuries, when it played a significant role in thegrowth of the British Empire,external. It was a hub for the mass movement of people, including migrants from Europe to America, and had a key role in thetransatlantic slave trade,external. The Albert Dock area features more Grade I-listed buildings than anywhere else in the UK. Liverpool is one of 32 World Heritage Sites in the UK, along with Stonehenge and the Giant's Causeway. On Saturday, figures including ex-politician Michael Heseltine, playwright Willy Russell and the chief executives of Liverpool and Everton football clubs signed a letter published in The Times, saying the city was in a ""far superior state than when the status was granted"". They said about Â£1.6bn had been invested in upgrading 157 heritage assets. An artist's impression of Everton's new stadium, which is being built at Bramley-Moore Dock The letter also said theforthcoming Â£500m Everton stadiumin Bramley-Moore Dock - in one of the city's poorest areas - would ""bring millions of people to the shores of the Mersey"", where they would also learn about ""the city's and Britain's maritime past"". However, the stadium plans were initially objected to by heritage body ICOMOS, acting on behalf of Unesco, as well as the Victorian Society and Historic England. In March, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it had ""decided not to intervene"". The letter's signatories urged World Heritage Committee members to ""defer any decision on the city's status and, instead, accept an invitation to visit Liverpool at some point during the next 12 months"".

"This video can not be played What do you think about a tourist tax? Tourism industry bosses have given ministers in Wales a blunt message on plans for a possible tourist tax: ""No way."" It followed Welsh government moves to explore a levy on visitors holidaying in Wales. The Wales Tourism Alliance said it would make the industry less competitive, and make Wales seem more expensive. Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said no decision had been made. Unveiling theWelsh government's programme of priorities,externalover the next five years, First Minister Mark Drakeford said a tourism levy ""could be a significant opportunity for local authorities to invest in the conditions that make tourism a success"". UK tourism spending 'worth just half of pre-pandemic level' Tourism facing tough summer despite relaxed rules Holiday cottages to get 'year's takings over summer' But the Wales Tourism Alliance chairman, Andrew Campbell, responded: ""Not only will it make the industry less competitive, sending out a perception that Wales will be a more expensive destination to visit, but businesses are already struggling to bounce back financially from the pandemic. ""Rather than proposing a new tax, the Welsh government should be focusing on financial support to help the sector."" Anglesey Tourism Alliance said there had already been many more visitors than usual to the island this year But within the sector, there were concerns the industry could overwhelm some local populations. Nia Jones, at Anglesey Tourism Alliance, said there had already been many more visitors to the island this year. ""Whitsun [half-term] was something else here on the island. I'd say the word 'sinking' comes to mind, not just with overnight visitors, but day visitors too."" Bed and breakfast owner George Reid said his Glangwilli Mansion in Carmarthenshire had seen unprecedented demand ""from the moment that we could open the doors"". ""The phone has never stopped ringing, literally from the moment that the restrictions were announced that it would be lifting."" Tourism bosses have said they are not in favour of the plans It's not just those relying on the trade for an income that have noticed an increase in visitors - those who live in honeypot towns, such as resort town Benllech on Anglesey, said there has been ""a heck of a lot more"" tourists. ""Usually we get a nice quiet period between Whitsun and the summer holidays, but it seems to me that everybody's staying here,"" said resident Gareth Hughes. Anglesey resident Gareth Hughes said he noticed there had been more visitors to the island Anglesey tourism chief Nia Jones accepted tourism levies had worked elsewhere, especially on mainland Europe. But she added: ""Is it something that the trade needs to deal and cope with at the moment? That's questionable. ""I think it shouldn't be a knee-jerk reaction. There needs to be much consultation with the trade, and the visitors of course, to get the fine balance. ""And we need to know exactly how that money's going to be spent."" Fellow resident Chris Lewis-Roberts was in favour of a tax ""as long as it was a minimum"" Ask those in locations such as Benllech though, and they broadly support a tax levy idea - residents and holidaymakers alike. ""I can't see why not, as long as it was a minimum. And it would make a lot of local people happy too,"" said Benllech resident Chris Lewis-Roberts. Gill Simpson, who is on holiday in Benllech with Dawn Warburton, said: ""I agree if it's going to improve the roads and improve infrastructure, but it depends whether it would be affordable."" Gill Simpson and Dawn Warburton were in favour if a tax improved roads and infrastructure Ms Warburton agreed - but also accepted ""it could put some people off coming and that wouldn't work very well"". Pet shop owner Lesley Jones backed the levy: ""I think it would be a good thing, as long as the money is then used to help areas that need it most."" She suggested the income raised should be used to help first time buyers on to the property ladder. Pet shop owner Lesley Jones said any money made should be ""used to help areas that need it most"" The economy minister said the tourism sector did not need to worry that changes would be forced on it - though it is unclear whether the Welsh government has the power to bring in a tourist tax. ""It's a conversation and a broad consultation we need to have now. It's got to involve local government because lots of visitors bring lots of pressure on local government services. ""We've got to take a health services perspective, and you then have to have a conversation with the people who are in the tourism industry itself as well. ""So I don't think people working in this industry need to worry that something is going to be done to them."" Welsh Conservative tourism spokesperson Tom Giffard MS said: ""The evidence and calls against a tourism tax in Wales are mounting, and the first minister now needs to confirm that this terrible idea is a non-starter.""

"This video can not be played Wariness and welcome for Iran's president-elect Hardliner Ebrahim Raisi has won Iran's presidential election in a race that was widely seen as being designed to favour him. He thanked Iranians for their support, after securing 62% of the votes. Mr Raisi is Iran's top judge and holds ultra-conservative views. He is under US sanctions and has been linked to past executions of political prisoners. Iran's president is the second-highest ranking official in the country, after the supreme leader. Who is Ebrahim Raisi, Iran's next president? The unusual way power is held in Iran Iran's presidential election: Four ways it matters Mr Raisi will be inaugurated in early August, and will have significant influence over domestic policy and foreign affairs. But in Iran's political system it is the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the top religious cleric, who has the final say on all state matters. Iran is run according to conservative Shia Islamic values, and there have been curbs on political freedoms since its Islamic Revolution in 1979. Many Iranians saw this latest election as having been engineered for Mr Raisi to win, and shunned the poll. Official figures showed voter turnout was the lowest ever for a presidential election, at 48.8%, compared to more than 70% for the previous vote in 2017. The 60-year-old cleric has served as a prosecutor for most of his career. From an early age, Mr Raisi held powerful and high-ranking positions - when he was just 20 years old, he was already serving as the chief prosecutor of the city of Karaj. He was appointed head of the judiciary in 2019, two years after he lost by a landslide to Hassan Rouhani in the last presidential election. Mr Raisi has presented himself as the best person to fight corruption and inequality, and solve Iran's economic problems. ""Our people's grievances over shortcomings are real,"" he said as he cast his vote in Tehran. The man who wears a black turban identifying him in Shia tradition as a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad is fiercely loyal to Iran's ruling clerics, and has even been seen as a possible successor to Ayatollah Khamenei. Turnout was reportedly significantly down on the previous election in 2017 But many Iranians and rights groups have pointed to Mr Raisi's alleged role in the mass executions of political prisoners in 1988, when he was 27 years old. He is said to have been part of a so-called ""death committee"" - one of four judges who oversaw secret death sentences for about 5,000 prisoners in jails near Tehran, according to Amnesty International. It says the location of the mass graves where the men and women were buried is being ""systematically concealed by the Iranian authorities"". ""That Ebrahim Raisi has risen to the presidency instead of being investigated for the crimes against humanity of murder, enforced disappearance and torture, is a grim reminder that impunity reigns supreme in Iran,"" said Amnesty chief AgnÃ¨s Callamard. Mr Raisi has repeatedly denied his role in the death sentences. But he has also said they were justified because of a fatwa, or religious ruling, by former supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini. Amnesty also says that as head of the judiciary Mr Raisi oversaw impunity for officials and security forces accused of killing protesters during unrest in 2019. Mr Raisi has promised to ease unemployment and work to remove US sanctions that have contributed to economic hardship for ordinary Iranians and caused widespread discontent. BBC Persian correspondent Kasra Naji adds that under Mr Raisi, Iran's hardliners will seek to reinforce a puritanical system of Islamic government, possibly meaning more controls on social activities, fewer freedoms and jobs for women, and tighter control of social media and the press. The hardliners are suspicious of the West, but both Mr Raisi and Supreme Leader Khamenei favour a return to an international deal on Iran's nuclear activity. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, signed in 2015, gave Iran relief from Western sanctions in return for limiting its nuclear activities. The US pulled out of the deal in 2018, and President Trump's administration re-imposed crippling limits on Iran's ability to trade. Mr Raisi was among the officials put under sanctions. Iran has responded by re-starting nuclear operations that were banned under the deal. Talks aimed at resurrecting the deal are ongoing in Vienna, with President Joe Biden also keen to revive it. But both sides say the other must make the first move. Analysis by Kasra Naji, BBC Persian The election was engineered to pave the way for Mr Raisi to win. This has alienated a good number of Iranians already deeply discontented with their living conditions in an economy that is crippled by US sanctions but also mismanagement. The result of the election will not help with their concerns and may even lead to more instability at home. In the past few years Iran has witnessed at least two rounds of serious nationwide protests - with hundreds, some say thousands, killed. With Mr Raisi taking the presidency the hardliners will have taken all the centres of power: the executive branch as well as the legislative and the judiciary. Iran will be a more closed society. Freedoms will likely be curtailed even more than before. The regime will look to China to help the economy out of deep crisis. There will be more tension with the West. Indirect talks between Iran and the US in Vienna over reviving the nuclear deal may face more uncertainty. There are already reports that the talks will now break up for a few weeks, allowing all sides to take stock of the new reality in Iran. Almost 600 hopefuls, including 40 women, registered to be candidates in the election. But in the end only seven men were approved last month by the 12 jurists and theologians on the Guardian Council, an unelected body that has the ultimate decision with regard to candidates' qualifications. Three of those candidates subsequently pulled out before polling day. Before he withdrew, reformist candidate Mohsen Mehralizadeh hinted that the vote would be a foregone conclusion, saying during a candidates' TV debate that the ruling clerics had aligned ""sun, moon and the heavens to make one particular person the president,"" according to The Economist. Meanwhile former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, one of those barred from running, said in a video message that he would not vote, declaring: ""I do not want to have a part in this sin.""

"England and Scotland share tame Wembley draw Spain, France, Germany and Portugal set for action Your reaction to the Wembley draw on #bbcfootball All the latest transfer news Luke Reddy Right then my friends. We've visited Berwick-upon-Tweed in this live text, shared some French phrases and a little Hungarian, and we've heard loads from Rio Ferdinand. As always, you guys have sent loads in and I can't thank you enough for it. I will bid you farewell. Go and dive into Hungary v France. Keep enjoying the tournament. I'll be back at 0600 to debate the latest from the 'Group of Death'. Au revoir. ViszontlÃ¡tÃ¡sra. Hungary v France (14:00 BST) Rio FerdinandFormer England defender on BBC Radio 5 Live Mbappe, wow. Beautiful to see. There were two players who made me feel like that - Nicolas Anelka and Michael Owen. Those two players when you were on the halfway line you were thinking 'can I phone a friend'. The moment the game opens up for Mbappe, you're at his mercy. Hungary v France (14:00 BST) France are ready to rock. Lucas Digne is in as the only change. So all the big hitters are out there. There'll be a live text starting on that one shortly with all the details. Rio FerdinandFormer England defender on BBC Radio 5 Live Kevin De Bruyne has been my best player so far in the tournament. He's been on 45 minutes. Hungary v France (14:00 BST) Mark LawrensonBBC football expert Hungary frustrated Portugal for more than 80 minutes before conceding three late goals on Tuesday night and no doubt they will sit in again here - I don't blame them either. The huge home crowd will help them, but I still don't think they will keep France out. Prediction:0-2 England 0-0 Scotland Rio FerdinandFormer England defender on BBC Radio 5 Live Playing two holding players yesterday was a no for me. I understand against teams with big attacking threats. And our full-backs didn't look like they were being told to push on. If you've not got the energy, none of it comes together. England 0-0 Scotland Rio FerdinandFormer England defender on BBC Radio 5 Live You change the energy and dynamic in the team. Whether that's personnel or making sure these guys know that if the intensity is not there, there will be changes. Tweet #bbcfootball wxmWoody:I honestly think England are the only country that would not be building a team around a player like Jack Grealish.

Germany v Portugal (17:00 BST) Cristiano Ronaldo is now looking to equal Miroslav Klose as the record European scorer at the Euros and World Cup combined. Klose scored 19 for Germany while Ronaldo has 18 and currently level with Gerd Muller. England 0-0 Scotland Rio FerdinandFormer England defender on BBC Radio 5 Live I'd still play Kane. I'd demand more from him. There's a conversation to be had. He's a top player. Last season the most assists and goals in the Premier League. You don't become a bad player overnight. If it's not working after 45 minutes, get someone else in there as sometimes less time is not enough. Outside influences and a transfer with him leaving Spurs, I went to the World Cup and there were rumours about me joining a new club. You don't even think about it, you're there for England. I told my agent do not talk to me about this transfer. Do your meetings, when I get back I will talk. To take him out now would be the wrong decision but I'd want to see a difference in his performance. England 0-0 Scotland BBC Radio 5 Live Rio Ferdinand reflects on the fine Billy Gilmour display:""He comes in and performs. There are times in games where things don't go his way which will happen. But he doesn't shy away. That's a really good sign for a young player. ""I think he will be a squad player at Chelsea for a while. He will do his learning behind Jorginho to be prepared for that role."" Italy v Wales (20 June, 17:00 BST) More now from Joe Allen who says Wales will thrive as underdogs against Italy in Rome on Sunday. ""It suits us down to the ground,"" Allen told Sky Sports. ""We know we can rely on being
solid defensively. We know that everyone's going to put a shift in and give absolutely
everything to protect our own goal. ""And with the likes of Gareth and Aaron linking up, Daniel James and Kieffer
Moore, we've got all sorts of threats. We've got threats off the bench as well that bring different attributes. We've got the ability to hurt teams."" Argentina 1-0 Uruguay Lionel Messi was providing rather than scoring last night. He teed up the winner as Argentina beat Uruguay in the Copa America. That's four points on the board for Argentina. There are two groups of five teams at the tournament and four will go through from each. Portugal v Germany (17:00 BST) The 'group of death' is back and it's thrown up another heavyweight clash for us later as Portugal take on Germany. Germany must be ""more vigorous"" in attack if they are to beat Portugal, says manager Joachim Low. Low's side lost 1-0 to France in Munich, while defending champions Portugal beat Hungary 3-0 in Budapest. Preview England 0-0 Scotland Rio FerdinandFormer England defender on BBC Radio 5 Live The timing of the substitutions was late. It doesn't give them a lot of time to get the rhythm. Give them a half. Get their feet wet on the pitch for a while. Let them feel it. There is no doubt in my mind we have players who can change a game. Utilise them. Sancho, statistically, for goal involvements over the last three seasons, it's Sterling number one Sancho two. I feel there are players we are desperate to see. I wish we had these wide players in my time as we'd have won everything. Sterling has 110 goal involvements in three seasons, Sancho 109. That tells you the kid has got it. England 0-0 Scotland BBC Radio 5 Live Rio Ferdinand is asked if he would look at social media were he in the England squad now:""I would try my hardest to disable all my social media apps. ""Most humans would look for validation on social media. You're looking for people really who have no qualifications on football. Say you have 100 comments and 99 are unbelievably positive, your energy will be fixed on the one negative comment. That will ruin your confidence and self esteem."" You can tune in now. England 0-0 Scotland Rio Ferdinand speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live:""I watched Croatia again yesterday. We beat an average, ageing Croatian team, let's be honest. ""They are not the team who got to the final of the World Cup. ""I hold my hand up, I got excited. We all get carried away. You have a right to get emotionally involved. But then realism kicks in.""

"Walk-in vaccine clinics are opening in England, in a major push to offer coronavirus jabs to all remaining adults Queues have formed at pop-up vaccination centres at football grounds in London, including Chelsea and West Ham's stadiums More first doses of vaccines were given than second jabs on Thursday and Friday, reflecting the push to get the UK's younger adults vaccinated The UK records more than 10,000 daily cases for the third day in a row - after months of lower figures A new wave of infections is definitely under way in England, says Prof Adam Finn of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation But epidemiologist Dr Mike Tildesley says he is ""cautiously hopeful"" hospital admissions will not be on the same scale as in January Labour is calling for workers to have the right to work flexibly before coronavirus restrictions are fully lifted in England Some people on furlough are avoiding a return to work because it has been ""great"" for them, says Tory MP Andrea Leadsom The Palestinian Authority has cancelled a deal under which Israel was to give it one million Pfizer jabs because they were too close to expiry Edited by James Clarke That's all from the live page team, thanks for joining us today. Your updates were written by Jennifer Meierhans and Victoria Lindrea and edited by James Clarke. We will be back with more tomorrow, have a good evening. The London Stadium has opened as a walk-in vaccination centre We are going to be bringing our coronavirus updates to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's news: Pfizer BioNtech vaccines were given at the London Stadium About 3,000 Christians formed groups at one-mile intervals along a coastal path topray for those bereaved by the pandemic. Pastor Mark Pugh says: ""Some were individuals going to the mile spots, others were church groups so there was a real change of dynamics at each of those points."" The South West Coast Path runs from Minehead, Somerset, to Poole, Dorset. The footpath is 630 miles long (1,013km) and also takes in Devon and Cornwall. Churches have not been able to welcome congregations through the pandemic due to social-distancing restrictions. But pastor Pugh says: ""We believe the church is not the building, it's the people. ""Churches have been active running food banks, providing care for our communities just offering support and friendship to so many people."" From doodling families having their vaccines, to depicting intensive care staff trying to save patients, artists recorded some of the most significant moments in the coronavirus pandemic. Now they hope the touching moments their art has captured over the past 16 months will become part of history. Nathan Wyburn created a portrait of an NHS nurse made of 200 pictures of nurses. He says it ""just felt right"" to focus on key workers and ""realised it was kind of the perfect time for me to start creating work that meant something more to me, and focus on the everyday heroes"". Angie Stevens has been drawing for 10 years, documenting her family's experiences on her websitedoodlemum.com,external. Angie said drawing had helped her make sense of the pandemic and she wanted toportray how it was affecting her family. She says: ""We've got our data and graphs but history is about the personal, the everyday. I'm a normal person living my life and how it affects me is just as important."" Caerphilly Youth Forum has put together a time capsule to document how young people were living through the pandemic in 2020. It asked young people across the borough to send in photos, drawings, artwork, poems and small items that captured how life had changed.

A school with 1,200 pupils has closed its site to students as a ""precautionary measure"" over Covid concerns. Pupils at Greenhill School in Tenby, Pembrokeshire, will be taught online from Monday because of the number having to self-isolate and increasing case rates. Head Raymond McGovern says: ""Clearly, our locality and the school are part of this picture of increased rates."" It comes as Wales' first minister said Wales is at thestart of a third wave. Pembrokeshire has Wales' fifth highest rate of Covid cases for those aged under 25 - at 55.2 cases for every 100,000 of the population, according to Public Health Wales figures for this week. Greenhill School's year 10 age group is already isolating at homedue to a number of positive Covid cases. A woman in hospital for more than 10 weeks and unable to have visitors because of Covid rules says the loneliness is ""soul-destroying"". Margaret Evans, 86, from Nefyn in Gwynedd, says she felt ""torn away from the world"" with a ban on visitors at Ysbyty Alltwen, Tremadog. Margaret says it ""isn't fair"", because another nearby community hospital allowed garden visits. Elaine Beer from Minffordd said her 83-year-old mother has been at Ysbyty Gwynedd for two weeks and has also been unable to have visitors. ""Mum phones me in tears saying she's lonely,"" she says. ""It's not fair - either everyone can go [to visit] or nobody at all."" Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board says it appreciates visiting restrictions have been difficult for patients and their families, and is promising changes will be implemented across the board this week to allow visits by appointment.

Moderna vaccines arrive in Taiwan The US will ship 2.5 million Covid vaccine doses to Taiwan on Saturday - more than three times the previous number of shots allocated for the island by Washington, Reuters reports. The US administration had initially promised to donate 750,000 doses to Taiwan, but the huge increase follows President Joe Biden's pledge to send 80 million US-made shots around the world. Few people in Taiwan have yet received the vaccine, with the island struggling to access supplies - andunwilling to accept help from neighbouring China because the two sides are political foes. Taiwan's leaders favour more independence for the island, something China forcefully resists. Beijing believes Taiwan is part of its own territory, and wants it to unify with the mainland. Taipei has expressed concern about the safety of Chinese shots. The 2.5 million donated doses of the Moderna vaccine were flown out of Memphis early on Saturday. The US has denied it is seeking to exert any influence in Taiwan. ""We are not allocating these doses, or delivering these doses, based on political or economic conditions,"" a senior U.S. administration official says. ""We are donating these vaccines with the singular objective of savinglives. ""Our vaccines do not come with strings attached."" Covid infections remain comparatively low in Taiwan despite a spike in domestic cases. However, only about 6% of Taiwan's population of 23.5 million  have received at least one shot of a vaccine. The UK has recorded more than 10,000 new coronavirus infections for the third day in a row. Today the figure is 10,321, though that is down from 10,476 yesterday and 11,007 on Thursday,according to government data.,external The previous time the number was higher than 10,000 was on 22 February. And daily cases had stayed below 3,000 for 43 days between 13 April and 25 May. Damian GrammaticasPolitical correspondent People in England who have had both Covid jabs and come into contact with someone infected with the virus could be spared having to isolate for 10 days. Government sources have told the BBC trials are examining whether it might be possible to scrap the quarantine period and instead allow double-vaccinated people to take daily tests. If the test, done each morning, was negative the individual would not have to quarantine that day. The trials are not expected to be completed until later in the summer. And it's thought the system would only come into effect if Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty was satisfied the daily tests would be a reliable way to prevent the spread of the virus. Yesterday,218,636first doses were given and188,858 secondjabs. It was the second day in a row more first doses were administered than second, perhaps reflecting the push of the past few days to get younger adults vaccinated. Before Thursday, the previous time more than half the vaccines in a day were first doses was 4 April, Easter Sunday. The total number of coronavirus vaccinations now given in the UK is73,766,593. That's42,679,268first doses and31,087,325second doses. As well as a push to get over-18s vaccinated, people over 40 in England and Scotland are being invited to get their second dose after eight weeks instead of 12 weeks because of concerns over theDelta variant. Here's how you can move your second jab forward. The UK has recorded 10,321 new coronavirus infections,the government's daily figues show.,external There have been a further 14 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK, according to the data. That brings the total number of people to have died in the 28 days after a positive Covid-19 test to 127,970. As we've been reporting, there's a real push on Covid vaccines this weekend as walk-in centres open across England in a race to get people immunised before the peak of a third wave. Charlton Athletic opened its Valley stadium in south-east London as a walk-in centre focusing on getting second doses into the arms of the over-40s. One woman in the queue told us: ""I guess for me I think the most important thing was just to feel well and a bit free in society and to not be a danger to others either."" It's expected to be a bumper weekend of walk-in in the north west of England too. The region has the highest case rates in the country but extra doses of vaccine and enhanced testing is hoping to slow the spread.Surge testing has started in Cumbria after a spike in cases. By Thea de Gallier BBC Three Lowri: 'You can feel like where you live is just a playground' One of the ongoing narratives we heard over the course of the pandemic was how remote working was leading people to give up city life in favour of bigger, cheaper and more rural living. For many people with desk-based jobs, there was no need to be within travelling distance of the office any more, so expensive flats in and around London and other major cities were traded in for houses in the countryside or by the sea. Something we heard less about, though, was the impact on people living in those regions where property increased in popularity over lockdown. In Wales, for example, house prices grew by 11% over the past year âthe highest growth rate in the UK. Younger buyers found that houses had offers for  significantly over the asking price by people who hadnât even viewed them. ""Iâm just burying my head in the sand and praying the market might crash,â says Lowri, a 29-year-old classroom assistant and freelance writer living in the Welsh county of Gwynedd. Lowri says the influx of people coming to Wales over the pandemic was âoverwhelmingâ. ""Iâm hearing about houses being bought unseen, and the prices in north Wales rising more than anywhere else in the UK.â Anya Martin, from Priced Out - an organisation campaigning for cheaper housing - believes the shift in outlook is ""bad news for renters and young people"". âItâs a natural eventuality that if people move out of London and cities, theyâll move to other regions. Thatâs not matched with an equivalent supply of new homes,â she tells the BBC. âIt means renters are less able to afford the amount of space they want and may end up in lower-quality housing. She adds: ""It's bad news for the local economy â thereâll be no one to provide care services or run cafes."" Read the full story. Timira Farah, 97, had her first Pfizer jab A walk-in coronavirus vaccination clinic for people aged 18 or over has opened in a park in Bristol's city centre. The clinic at Eastville Park is for those who live in the central and east-central parts of the city - particularly those over the age of 30 - who have not yet had their first vaccination. NHS vaccination lead, Clare Armour, says: ""We haven't done one in a park before so it's very new to us and it's very, very exciting."" Muna Abubakar persuaded her 97-year-old mum to have the jab on Saturday, despite her previous fears and reluctance. ""Today, finally she accepted the injection,"" Muna says. NHS health links worker, Amran Hussein, says: ""I rang Muna two weeks ago to speak to her mum. I'm so happy to see her here today."" The clinic has 800 Pfizer doses and will remain open until 17:00 BST. Amran Hussein has been encouraging vaccine take-up among Bristol's Somali community A marquee has been set up in the south part of Eastville Park A vaccine epidemiologist says the UK is ""well in the beginning of the third wave"" of coronavirus. Professor Mark Jit says the link between getting covid and being hospitalised or dying ""has been weakened but it's not been broken completely"". He told BBC News the UK's vaccines ""are really effective but they're not 100% effective"". He says: ""If people have two doses they might have a 90% or 95% lower chance of getting hospitalised or dying but that still leaves that 5-10% of people and when you multiply that by lots of people getting infected that's still a fair number of deaths, although a lot less than we would have seen without vaccination."" He says most people in hospital with coronavirus are unvaccinated ""so there is a bit of a race to get the vaccination out as soon as possible before the third wave gets really big."" He says: ""We will have a third wave unless we go back into lockdown because the virus is spreading faster than we can control it. But the size of this wave depends on how fast we can roll out the vaccine, how good test and trace is, and so forth."" The Queen is attending the final day of Royal Ascot,one of the government's pilot events,externallooking at how people can safely return to mass gatherings. The five-day event, in Berkshire,started on Tuesday. All those attending are required to provide evidence of a negative lateral flow test on arrival at the racecourse each day. Two further PCR tests must also be completed - one on the day before attendance and another five days afterwards. The Queen, who has a keen interest in racing, is usually a regular at the racing meet, but Saturday marked her first appearance this year. Crowds stood up and applauded as she arrived by car at the racecourse, wearing a mint green hat and matching coat. Her horses Reach For The Moon, Tactical, Light Refrain and King's Lynn are all set to run during the afternoon. Last year the event was held behind closed doors due to the pandemic. Withjust five Covid cases per 100,000 in the week up to 12 June, the Suffolk town of Ipswich has the lowest rate in England. But it has previously had one of the highest. Barman Adam Muir, 22, says the figures are ""rather surprising. ""t's not like I've been seeing everyone following the guidelines,"" he says. ""It's the regular stuff - no-one wearing their masks, no-one paying attention to the Covid guidelines. ""I suppose everyone is fed up with it, and I've seen it more so in hospitality - when you're drunk, you don't really pay attention."" Friends Rosie Loveday, 32, and Rhiannon Newby, 21, are also surprised at the low rate. ""I'm shocked,"" says Rosie. ""One day you hear we have the highest infection rate, and the next it's the lowest. ""I'm in town most days and most people are wearing masks, or they have exemption cards. Overall, it's not been too bad."" Rhiannon says: ""I'm the younger generation, and there hasn't been as much following the rules."" But BT worker Swapnil, 32, says he thinks people are following the rules. ""Ipswich is miles from London, so perhaps we don't have people coming from areas where it is high. ""People are out and about now, but they are taking the proper precautions."" He says everyone he knows are ""quite eager for their jabs"". There's more from the people we chatted to on Ipswich Waterfronthere. Pop-up testing centres are opening in certain areas of the city People living in areas experiencing a ""sharp"" rise in coronavirus cases in Leeds are being offered asymptomatic testing to stop the virus spreading. Hyde Park, Headingley, Little London and Woodhouse have seen an increase in cases, particularly among younger people, Leeds City Council said. PCR tests are being offered at new pop-up testing centres from Tuesday, including at the University of Leeds. Council staff will go door-to-door offering some tests to residents, whether they have symptoms or not. Testing centres are opening at Cinder Moor in Woodhouse Lane, the Gryphon Centre at the University of Leeds and the Mandela Community Centre in Chapeltown Road. ""We need people living in Headingley and Hyde Park and Little London and Woodhouse to work with us, get a test and help us identify where these Covid cases are so together we can stop the spread and ensure Leeds can carry on enjoying a safe summer,"" said councillor Salma Arif. A family's experience of Covid-19 has inspired a college student's end-of-year course project. Ethan Deery's hand-drawn animation reflected his grandfather's battle with Covid-19 and was a tribute to the NHS staff who helped save his life. The 18-year-old, who studies in Londonderry, spent two months using a technique called rotoscoping, which involved him tracing over videos and pictures and then animating the stills together frame-by-frame. Ethan's grandfather, Neil McCafferty, was admitted to Altnagelvin Hospital in October last year with a gall bladder infection and was also treated for sepsis before contracting Covid-19. The father-of-five, whose family wastold he would not survive Covid-19, spent several weeks being treated in intensive care and months in rehabilitation at Derry's Waterside Hospital. This video can not be played 'It restores your faith in human nature' Cumbrians aged 12-30 are being urged to get tested for coronavirus as Delta cases rise. Colin Cox, the county's director of public health, says it is ""critical"" people in the age group participate in thesurge testing announced today. ""Infections are spiking in Cumbria and while they are still lower than our neighbouring counties, without action we can expect many more people to become ill,"" he says. Infections have risen from 35 cases per week at the end of May to 250 per week now, Cumbria County Council says. ""Getting as many people tested as possible will help us find those people are infectious but don't know it, this is an important way we can slow the spread."" Cox says although the process could be an ""inconvenience"", it is simple and essential to get the virus back under control before restrictions can be further lifted. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Wariness and welcome for Iran's president-elect Hardliner Ebrahim Raisi has won Iran's presidential election in a race that was widely seen as being designed to favour him. He thanked Iranians for their support, after securing 62% of the votes. Mr Raisi is Iran's top judge and holds ultra-conservative views. He is under US sanctions and has been linked to past executions of political prisoners. Iran's president is the second-highest ranking official in the country, after the supreme leader. Who is Ebrahim Raisi, Iran's next president? The unusual way power is held in Iran Iran's presidential election: Four ways it matters Mr Raisi will be inaugurated in early August, and will have significant influence over domestic policy and foreign affairs. But in Iran's political system it is the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the top religious cleric, who has the final say on all state matters. Iran is run according to conservative Shia Islamic values, and there have been curbs on political freedoms since its Islamic Revolution in 1979. Many Iranians saw this latest election as having been engineered for Mr Raisi to win, and shunned the poll. Official figures showed voter turnout was the lowest ever for a presidential election, at 48.8%, compared to more than 70% for the previous vote in 2017. The 60-year-old cleric has served as a prosecutor for most of his career. From an early age, Mr Raisi held powerful and high-ranking positions - when he was just 20 years old, he was already serving as the chief prosecutor of the city of Karaj. He was appointed head of the judiciary in 2019, two years after he lost by a landslide to Hassan Rouhani in the last presidential election. Mr Raisi has presented himself as the best person to fight corruption and inequality, and solve Iran's economic problems. ""Our people's grievances over shortcomings are real,"" he said as he cast his vote in Tehran. The man who wears a black turban identifying him in Shia tradition as a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad is fiercely loyal to Iran's ruling clerics, and has even been seen as a possible successor to Ayatollah Khamenei. Turnout was reportedly significantly down on the previous election in 2017 But many Iranians and rights groups have pointed to Mr Raisi's alleged role in the mass executions of political prisoners in 1988, when he was 27 years old. He is said to have been part of a so-called ""death committee"" - one of four judges who oversaw secret death sentences for about 5,000 prisoners in jails near Tehran, according to Amnesty International. It says the location of the mass graves where the men and women were buried is being ""systematically concealed by the Iranian authorities"". ""That Ebrahim Raisi has risen to the presidency instead of being investigated for the crimes against humanity of murder, enforced disappearance and torture, is a grim reminder that impunity reigns supreme in Iran,"" said Amnesty chief AgnÃ¨s Callamard. Mr Raisi has repeatedly denied his role in the death sentences. But he has also said they were justified because of a fatwa, or religious ruling, by former supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini. Amnesty also says that as head of the judiciary Mr Raisi oversaw impunity for officials and security forces accused of killing protesters during unrest in 2019. Mr Raisi has promised to ease unemployment and work to remove US sanctions that have contributed to economic hardship for ordinary Iranians and caused widespread discontent. BBC Persian correspondent Kasra Naji adds that under Mr Raisi, Iran's hardliners will seek to reinforce a puritanical system of Islamic government, possibly meaning more controls on social activities, fewer freedoms and jobs for women, and tighter control of social media and the press. The hardliners are suspicious of the West, but both Mr Raisi and Supreme Leader Khamenei favour a return to an international deal on Iran's nuclear activity. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, signed in 2015, gave Iran relief from Western sanctions in return for limiting its nuclear activities. The US pulled out of the deal in 2018, and President Trump's administration re-imposed crippling limits on Iran's ability to trade. Mr Raisi was among the officials put under sanctions. Iran has responded by re-starting nuclear operations that were banned under the deal. Talks aimed at resurrecting the deal are ongoing in Vienna, with President Joe Biden also keen to revive it. But both sides say the other must make the first move. Analysis by Kasra Naji, BBC Persian The election was engineered to pave the way for Mr Raisi to win. This has alienated a good number of Iranians already deeply discontented with their living conditions in an economy that is crippled by US sanctions but also mismanagement. The result of the election will not help with their concerns and may even lead to more instability at home. In the past few years Iran has witnessed at least two rounds of serious nationwide protests - with hundreds, some say thousands, killed. With Mr Raisi taking the presidency the hardliners will have taken all the centres of power: the executive branch as well as the legislative and the judiciary. Iran will be a more closed society. Freedoms will likely be curtailed even more than before. The regime will look to China to help the economy out of deep crisis. There will be more tension with the West. Indirect talks between Iran and the US in Vienna over reviving the nuclear deal may face more uncertainty. There are already reports that the talks will now break up for a few weeks, allowing all sides to take stock of the new reality in Iran. Almost 600 hopefuls, including 40 women, registered to be candidates in the election. But in the end only seven men were approved last month by the 12 jurists and theologians on the Guardian Council, an unelected body that has the ultimate decision with regard to candidates' qualifications. Three of those candidates subsequently pulled out before polling day. Before he withdrew, reformist candidate Mohsen Mehralizadeh hinted that the vote would be a foregone conclusion, saying during a candidates' TV debate that the ruling clerics had aligned ""sun, moon and the heavens to make one particular person the president,"" according to The Economist.

"A crowd of football supporters gathered in George Square Crowds gathered in London's Leicester Square and George Square in Glasgow following Scotland's 0-0 draw with England. Scotland fans have been celebrating the result, which keeps alive hopes they could still qualify for the next round of the Euro 2020 tournament. There was large police presence in both cities, and in London 30 people were arrested, the Met Police said. Most arrests were made in central London and near Wembley Stadium. The force said offences included violence and disorder, possession of drugs, possession of an offensive weapon, racial aggravation, drunk and disorderly behaviour and assault of a police officer, who suffered minor injuries. When a ""large"" crowd gathered in Leicester Square, flares were set off as fans, many wearing kilts and draped in Scotland flags, sang Flower of Scotland and chanted ""No Scotland, no party"". Scotland frustrate England at Wembley Live: Reaction to the the England v Scotland result In pictures: Scotland fans celebrate England result The Met Police said at 00:45 BST officers encouraged people still in Leicester Square to leave, finally clearing the area by 01:15 BST. TV coverage of the game drew an average audience of 13.1 million, a peak of 20 million and a 79% audience share across ITV and STV. The match set a new streaming record for the channel with 4.8 million streams across ITV Hub and STV Player. It also becomes the most-watched football match in terms of peak viewing numbers since ITV's coverage of England's World Cup semi-final against Croatia in 2018, which earned 27.5 million viewers. Thousands of supporters travelled south for the matchdespite being urged not to unless they had a ticket or had organised somewhere to watch the game.

"This video can not be played What do you think about a tourist tax? Tourism industry bosses have given ministers in Wales a blunt message on plans for a possible tourist tax: ""No way."" It followed Welsh government moves to explore a levy on visitors holidaying in Wales. The Wales Tourism Alliance said it would make the industry less competitive, and make Wales seem more expensive. Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said no decision had been made. Unveiling theWelsh government's programme of priorities,externalover the next five years, First Minister Mark Drakeford said a tourism levy ""could be a significant opportunity for local authorities to invest in the conditions that make tourism a success"". UK tourism spending 'worth just half of pre-pandemic level' Tourism facing tough summer despite relaxed rules Holiday cottages to get 'year's takings over summer' But the Wales Tourism Alliance chairman, Andrew Campbell, responded: ""Not only will it make the industry less competitive, sending out a perception that Wales will be a more expensive destination to visit, but businesses are already struggling to bounce back financially from the pandemic. ""Rather than proposing a new tax, the Welsh government should be focusing on financial support to help the sector."" Anglesey Tourism Alliance said there had already been many more visitors than usual to the island this year But within the sector, there were concerns the industry could overwhelm some local populations. Nia Jones, at Anglesey Tourism Alliance, said there had already been many more visitors to the island this year. ""Whitsun [half-term] was something else here on the island. I'd say the word 'sinking' comes to mind, not just with overnight visitors, but day visitors too."" Bed and breakfast owner George Reid said his Glangwilli Mansion in Carmarthenshire had seen unprecedented demand ""from the moment that we could open the doors"". ""The phone has never stopped ringing, literally from the moment that the restrictions were announced that it would be lifting."" Tourism bosses have said they are not in favour of the plans It's not just those relying on the trade for an income that have noticed an increase in visitors - those who live in honeypot towns, such as resort town Benllech on Anglesey, said there has been ""a heck of a lot more"" tourists. ""Usually we get a nice quiet period between Whitsun and the summer holidays, but it seems to me that everybody's staying here,"" said resident Gareth Hughes. Anglesey resident Gareth Hughes said he noticed there had been more visitors to the island Anglesey tourism chief Nia Jones accepted tourism levies had worked elsewhere, especially on mainland Europe. But she added: ""Is it something that the trade needs to deal and cope with at the moment? That's questionable. ""I think it shouldn't be a knee-jerk reaction. There needs to be much consultation with the trade, and the visitors of course, to get the fine balance. ""And we need to know exactly how that money's going to be spent."" Fellow resident Chris Lewis-Roberts was in favour of a tax ""as long as it was a minimum"" Ask those in locations such as Benllech though, and they broadly support a tax levy idea - residents and holidaymakers alike. ""I can't see why not, as long as it was a minimum. And it would make a lot of local people happy too,"" said Benllech resident Chris Lewis-Roberts. Gill Simpson, who is on holiday in Benllech with Dawn Warburton, said: ""I agree if it's going to improve the roads and improve infrastructure, but it depends whether it would be affordable."" Gill Simpson and Dawn Warburton were in favour if a tax improved roads and infrastructure Ms Warburton agreed - but also accepted ""it could put some people off coming and that wouldn't work very well"". Pet shop owner Lesley Jones backed the levy: ""I think it would be a good thing, as long as the money is then used to help areas that need it most."" She suggested the income raised should be used to help first time buyers on to the property ladder. Pet shop owner Lesley Jones said any money made should be ""used to help areas that need it most"" The economy minister said the tourism sector did not need to worry that changes would be forced on it - though it is unclear whether the Welsh government has the power to bring in a tourist tax. ""It's a conversation and a broad consultation we need to have now. It's got to involve local government because lots of visitors bring lots of pressure on local government services. ""We've got to take a health services perspective, and you then have to have a conversation with the people who are in the tourism industry itself as well. ""So I don't think people working in this industry need to worry that something is going to be done to them."" Welsh Conservative tourism spokesperson Tom Giffard MS said: ""The evidence and calls against a tourism tax in Wales are mounting, and the first minister now needs to confirm that this terrible idea is a non-starter.""

"A crowd of football supporters gathered in George Square Crowds gathered in London's Leicester Square and George Square in Glasgow following Scotland's 0-0 draw with England. Scotland fans have been celebrating the result, which keeps alive hopes they could still qualify for the next round of the Euro 2020 tournament. There was large police presence in both cities, and in London 30 people were arrested, the Met Police said. Most arrests were made in central London and near Wembley Stadium. The force said offences included violence and disorder, possession of drugs, possession of an offensive weapon, racial aggravation, drunk and disorderly behaviour and assault of a police officer, who suffered minor injuries. When a ""large"" crowd gathered in Leicester Square, flares were set off as fans, many wearing kilts and draped in Scotland flags, sang Flower of Scotland and chanted ""No Scotland, no party"". Scotland frustrate England at Wembley Live: Reaction to the the England v Scotland result In pictures: Scotland fans celebrate England result The Met Police said at 00:45 BST officers encouraged people still in Leicester Square to leave, finally clearing the area by 01:15 BST. TV coverage of the game drew an average audience of 13.1 million, a peak of 20 million and a 79% audience share across ITV and STV. The match set a new streaming record for the channel with 4.8 million streams across ITV Hub and STV Player. It also becomes the most-watched football match in terms of peak viewing numbers since ITV's coverage of England's World Cup semi-final against Croatia in 2018, which earned 27.5 million viewers. Thousands of supporters travelled south for the matchdespite being urged not to unless they had a ticket or had organised somewhere to watch the game. Earlier adispersal order was issued for central London, giving police extra powers to break up groups of people where they believe their behaviour is causing a nuisance, harassment or distress.

"Walk-in vaccine clinics are opening in England, in a major push to offer coronavirus jabs to all remaining adults Queues have formed at pop-up vaccination centres at football grounds in London, including Chelsea and West Ham's stadiums More first doses of vaccines were given than second jabs on Thursday and Friday, reflecting the push to get the UK's younger adults vaccinated The UK records more than 10,000 daily cases for the third day in a row - after months of lower figures A new wave of infections is definitely under way in England, says Prof Adam Finn of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation But epidemiologist Dr Mike Tildesley says he is ""cautiously hopeful"" hospital admissions will not be on the same scale as in January Labour is calling for workers to have the right to work flexibly before coronavirus restrictions are fully lifted in England Some people on furlough are avoiding a return to work because it has been ""great"" for them, says Tory MP Andrea Leadsom The Palestinian Authority has cancelled a deal under which Israel was to give it one million Pfizer jabs because they were too close to expiry Edited by James Clarke That's all from the live page team, thanks for joining us today. Your updates were written by Jennifer Meierhans and Victoria Lindrea and edited by James Clarke. We will be back with more tomorrow, have a good evening. The London Stadium has opened as a walk-in vaccination centre We are going to be bringing our coronavirus updates to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's news: Pfizer BioNtech vaccines were given at the London Stadium About 3,000 Christians formed groups at one-mile intervals along a coastal path topray for those bereaved by the pandemic. Pastor Mark Pugh says: ""Some were individuals going to the mile spots, others were church groups so there was a real change of dynamics at each of those points."" The South West Coast Path runs from Minehead, Somerset, to Poole, Dorset. The footpath is 630 miles long (1,013km) and also takes in Devon and Cornwall. Churches have not been able to welcome congregations through the pandemic due to social-distancing restrictions. But pastor Pugh says: ""We believe the church is not the building, it's the people. ""Churches have been active running food banks, providing care for our communities just offering support and friendship to so many people."" From doodling families having their vaccines, to depicting intensive care staff trying to save patients, artists recorded some of the most significant moments in the coronavirus pandemic. Now they hope the touching moments their art has captured over the past 16 months will become part of history. Nathan Wyburn created a portrait of an NHS nurse made of 200 pictures of nurses. He says it ""just felt right"" to focus on key workers and ""realised it was kind of the perfect time for me to start creating work that meant something more to me, and focus on the everyday heroes"". Angie Stevens has been drawing for 10 years, documenting her family's experiences on her websitedoodlemum.com,external. Angie said drawing had helped her make sense of the pandemic and she wanted toportray how it was affecting her family. She says: ""We've got our data and graphs but history is about the personal, the everyday. I'm a normal person living my life and how it affects me is just as important."" Caerphilly Youth Forum has put together a time capsule to document how young people were living through the pandemic in 2020. It asked young people across the borough to send in photos, drawings, artwork, poems and small items that captured how life had changed. You can read more about artists expressing the impacts of the pandemic through their workhere. A school with 1,200 pupils has closed its site to students as a ""precautionary measure"" over Covid concerns. Pupils at Greenhill School in Tenby, Pembrokeshire, will be taught online from Monday because of the number having to self-isolate and increasing case rates. Head Raymond McGovern says: ""Clearly, our locality and the school are part of this picture of increased rates."" It comes as Wales' first minister said Wales is at thestart of a third wave. Pembrokeshire has Wales' fifth highest rate of Covid cases for those aged under 25 - at 55.2 cases for every 100,000 of the population, according to Public Health Wales figures for this week. Greenhill School's year 10 age group is already isolating at homedue to a number of positive Covid cases. A woman in hospital for more than 10 weeks and unable to have visitors because of Covid rules says the loneliness is ""soul-destroying"". Margaret Evans, 86, from Nefyn in Gwynedd, says she felt ""torn away from the world"" with a ban on visitors at Ysbyty Alltwen, Tremadog. Margaret says it ""isn't fair"", because another nearby community hospital allowed garden visits. Elaine Beer from Minffordd said her 83-year-old mother has been at Ysbyty Gwynedd for two weeks and has also been unable to have visitors. ""Mum phones me in tears saying she's lonely,"" she says. ""It's not fair - either everyone can go [to visit] or nobody at all."" Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board says it appreciates visiting restrictions have been difficult for patients and their families, and is promising changes will be implemented across the board this week to allow visits by appointment.

Moderna vaccines arrive in Taiwan The US will ship 2.5 million Covid vaccine doses to Taiwan on Saturday - more than three times the previous number of shots allocated for the island by Washington, Reuters reports. The US administration had initially promised to donate 750,000 doses to Taiwan, but the huge increase follows President Joe Biden's pledge to send 80 million US-made shots around the world. Few people in Taiwan have yet received the vaccine, with the island struggling to access supplies - andunwilling to accept help from neighbouring China because the two sides are political foes. Taiwan's leaders favour more independence for the island, something China forcefully resists. Beijing believes Taiwan is part of its own territory, and wants it to unify with the mainland. Taipei has expressed concern about the safety of Chinese shots. The 2.5 million donated doses of the Moderna vaccine were flown out of Memphis early on Saturday. The US has denied it is seeking to exert any influence in Taiwan. ""We are not allocating these doses, or delivering these doses, based on political or economic conditions,"" a senior U.S. administration official says. ""We are donating these vaccines with the singular objective of savinglives. ""Our vaccines do not come with strings attached."" Covid infections remain comparatively low in Taiwan despite a spike in domestic cases. However, only about 6% of Taiwan's population of 23.5 million  have received at least one shot of a vaccine. The UK has recorded more than 10,000 new coronavirus infections for the third day in a row. Today the figure is 10,321, though that is down from 10,476 yesterday and 11,007 on Thursday,according to government data.,external The previous time the number was higher than 10,000 was on 22 February. And daily cases had stayed below 3,000 for 43 days between 13 April and 25 May. Damian GrammaticasPolitical correspondent People in England who have had both Covid jabs and come into contact with someone infected with the virus could be spared having to isolate for 10 days. Government sources have told the BBC trials are examining whether it might be possible to scrap the quarantine period and instead allow double-vaccinated people to take daily tests. If the test, done each morning, was negative the individual would not have to quarantine that day. The trials are not expected to be completed until later in the summer. And it's thought the system would only come into effect if Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty was satisfied the daily tests would be a reliable way to prevent the spread of the virus. Yesterday,218,636first doses were given and188,858 secondjabs. It was the second day in a row more first doses were administered than second, perhaps reflecting the push of the past few days to get younger adults vaccinated. Before Thursday, the previous time more than half the vaccines in a day were first doses was 4 April, Easter Sunday. The total number of coronavirus vaccinations now given in the UK is73,766,593. That's42,679,268first doses and31,087,325second doses. As well as a push to get over-18s vaccinated, people over 40 in England and Scotland are being invited to get their second dose after eight weeks instead of 12 weeks because of concerns over theDelta variant. Here's how you can move your second jab forward. The UK has recorded 10,321 new coronavirus infections,the government's daily figues show.,external There have been a further 14 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK, according to the data. That brings the total number of people to have died in the 28 days after a positive Covid-19 test to 127,970. As we've been reporting, there's a real push on Covid vaccines this weekend as walk-in centres open across England in a race to get people immunised before the peak of a third wave. Charlton Athletic opened its Valley stadium in south-east London as a walk-in centre focusing on getting second doses into the arms of the over-40s. One woman in the queue told us: ""I guess for me I think the most important thing was just to feel well and a bit free in society and to not be a danger to others either."" It's expected to be a bumper weekend of walk-in in the north west of England too. The region has the highest case rates in the country but extra doses of vaccine and enhanced testing is hoping to slow the spread.Surge testing has started in Cumbria after a spike in cases. By Thea de Gallier BBC Three Lowri: 'You can feel like where you live is just a playground' One of the ongoing narratives we heard over the course of the pandemic was how remote working was leading people to give up city life in favour of bigger, cheaper and more rural living. For many people with desk-based jobs, there was no need to be within travelling distance of the office any more, so expensive flats in and around London and other major cities were traded in for houses in the countryside or by the sea. Something we heard less about, though, was the impact on people living in those regions where property increased in popularity over lockdown. In Wales, for example, house prices grew by 11% over the past year âthe highest growth rate in the UK. Younger buyers found that houses had offers for  significantly over the asking price by people who hadnât even viewed them. ""Iâm just burying my head in the sand and praying the market might crash,â says Lowri, a 29-year-old classroom assistant and freelance writer living in the Welsh county of Gwynedd. Lowri says the influx of people coming to Wales over the pandemic was âoverwhelmingâ. ""Iâm hearing about houses being bought unseen, and the prices in north Wales rising more than anywhere else in the UK.â Anya Martin, from Priced Out - an organisation campaigning for cheaper housing - believes the shift in outlook is ""bad news for renters and young people"". âItâs a natural eventuality that if people move out of London and cities, theyâll move to other regions. Thatâs not matched with an equivalent supply of new homes,â she tells the BBC. âIt means renters are less able to afford the amount of space they want and may end up in lower-quality housing. She adds: ""It's bad news for the local economy â thereâll be no one to provide care services or run cafes."" Read the full story. Timira Farah, 97, had her first Pfizer jab A walk-in coronavirus vaccination clinic for people aged 18 or over has opened in a park in Bristol's city centre. The clinic at Eastville Park is for those who live in the central and east-central parts of the city - particularly those over the age of 30 - who have not yet had their first vaccination. NHS vaccination lead, Clare Armour, says: ""We haven't done one in a park before so it's very new to us and it's very, very exciting."" Muna Abubakar persuaded her 97-year-old mum to have the jab on Saturday, despite her previous fears and reluctance. ""Today, finally she accepted the injection,"" Muna says. NHS health links worker, Amran Hussein, says: ""I rang Muna two weeks ago to speak to her mum. I'm so happy to see her here today."" The clinic has 800 Pfizer doses and will remain open until 17:00 BST. Amran Hussein has been encouraging vaccine take-up among Bristol's Somali community A marquee has been set up in the south part of Eastville Park A vaccine epidemiologist says the UK is ""well in the beginning of the third wave"" of coronavirus. Professor Mark Jit says the link between getting covid and being hospitalised or dying ""has been weakened but it's not been broken completely"". He told BBC News the UK's vaccines ""are really effective but they're not 100% effective"". He says: ""If people have two doses they might have a 90% or 95% lower chance of getting hospitalised or dying but that still leaves that 5-10% of people and when you multiply that by lots of people getting infected that's still a fair number of deaths, although a lot less than we would have seen without vaccination."" He says most people in hospital with coronavirus are unvaccinated ""so there is a bit of a race to get the vaccination out as soon as possible before the third wave gets really big."" He says: ""We will have a third wave unless we go back into lockdown because the virus is spreading faster than we can control it. But the size of this wave depends on how fast we can roll out the vaccine, how good test and trace is, and so forth."" The Queen is attending the final day of Royal Ascot,one of the government's pilot events,externallooking at how people can safely return to mass gatherings. The five-day event, in Berkshire,started on Tuesday. All those attending are required to provide evidence of a negative lateral flow test on arrival at the racecourse each day. Two further PCR tests must also be completed - one on the day before attendance and another five days afterwards. The Queen, who has a keen interest in racing, is usually a regular at the racing meet, but Saturday marked her first appearance this year. Crowds stood up and applauded as she arrived by car at the racecourse, wearing a mint green hat and matching coat. Her horses Reach For The Moon, Tactical, Light Refrain and King's Lynn are all set to run during the afternoon. Last year the event was held behind closed doors due to the pandemic. Withjust five Covid cases per 100,000 in the week up to 12 June, the Suffolk town of Ipswich has the lowest rate in England. But it has previously had one of the highest. Barman Adam Muir, 22, says the figures are ""rather surprising. ""t's not like I've been seeing everyone following the guidelines,"" he says. ""It's the regular stuff - no-one wearing their masks, no-one paying attention to the Covid guidelines. ""I suppose everyone is fed up with it, and I've seen it more so in hospitality - when you're drunk, you don't really pay attention."" Friends Rosie Loveday, 32, and Rhiannon Newby, 21, are also surprised at the low rate. ""I'm shocked,"" says Rosie. ""One day you hear we have the highest infection rate, and the next it's the lowest. ""I'm in town most days and most people are wearing masks, or they have exemption cards. Overall, it's not been too bad."" Rhiannon says: ""I'm the younger generation, and there hasn't been as much following the rules."" But BT worker Swapnil, 32, says he thinks people are following the rules. ""Ipswich is miles from London, so perhaps we don't have people coming from areas where it is high. ""People are out and about now, but they are taking the proper precautions."" He says everyone he knows are ""quite eager for their jabs"". There's more from the people we chatted to on Ipswich Waterfronthere. Pop-up testing centres are opening in certain areas of the city People living in areas experiencing a ""sharp"" rise in coronavirus cases in Leeds are being offered asymptomatic testing to stop the virus spreading. Hyde Park, Headingley, Little London and Woodhouse have seen an increase in cases, particularly among younger people, Leeds City Council said. PCR tests are being offered at new pop-up testing centres from Tuesday, including at the University of Leeds. Council staff will go door-to-door offering some tests to residents, whether they have symptoms or not. Testing centres are opening at Cinder Moor in Woodhouse Lane, the Gryphon Centre at the University of Leeds and the Mandela Community Centre in Chapeltown Road. ""We need people living in Headingley and Hyde Park and Little London and Woodhouse to work with us, get a test and help us identify where these Covid cases are so together we can stop the spread and ensure Leeds can carry on enjoying a safe summer,"" said councillor Salma Arif. A family's experience of Covid-19 has inspired a college student's end-of-year course project. Ethan Deery's hand-drawn animation reflected his grandfather's battle with Covid-19 and was a tribute to the NHS staff who helped save his life. The 18-year-old, who studies in Londonderry, spent two months using a technique called rotoscoping, which involved him tracing over videos and pictures and then animating the stills together frame-by-frame. Ethan's grandfather, Neil McCafferty, was admitted to Altnagelvin Hospital in October last year with a gall bladder infection and was also treated for sepsis before contracting Covid-19. The father-of-five, whose family wastold he would not survive Covid-19, spent several weeks being treated in intensive care and months in rehabilitation at Derry's Waterside Hospital.

Colin Cox, the county's director of public health, says it is ""critical"" people in the age group participate in thesurge testing announced today. ""Infections are spiking in Cumbria and while they are still lower than our neighbouring counties, without action we can expect many more people to become ill,"" he says. Infections have risen from 35 cases per week at the end of May to 250 per week now, Cumbria County Council says. ""Getting as many people tested as possible will help us find those people are infectious but don't know it, this is an important way we can slow the spread."" Cox says although the process could be an ""inconvenience"", it is simple and essential to get the virus back under control before restrictions can be further lifted. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Highlights: Both teams frustrated as iconic fixture ends in a goalless draw England and Scotland played out a goalless draw at Wembley to leave both countries with their hopes of reaching Euro 2020's knockout stage very much alive. The first meeting between the men's teams in a major tournament since Euro 96 was played out in a typically raucous atmosphere despite only 22,500 fans in attendance - and both sides had big opportunities to win. Most of the honours must go to Scotland, however, who bounced back from their opening defeat by the Czech Republic at Hampden Park with real resilience and character to fully deserve this important point. It was The Tartan Army who were elated at the final whistle while England's players heard the sound of loud jeering from their supporters. England, who were sluggish and disappointing, should have taken the lead early on when John Stones headed Mason Mount's corner against the woodwork. As Scotland settled and improved, England were grateful to Jordan Pickford's superb save from Stephen O'Donnell and a goal-line clearance from Reece James to divert Lyndon Dykes' goal-bound shot after the break. Gareth Southgate's side, with a win over Croatia in the bag, now have a chance to overtake the Czech Republic and win Group D in their final game while Scotland will chase victory against Croatia at Hampden Park. England one step closer to last 16 - Kane Scotland must build on draw - Robertson How 'Scotland's Kante' Gilmour shone at Wembley How social media reacted to nervy night of action Listen - Daily Euros: BBC Football Daily This video can not be played O'Donnell does everything right there' - dangerous volley saved by Pickford Scotland's players punched the air with delight when the final whistle sounded and they had secured a point that keeps them in the mix going into their final game. Manager Steve Clarke had his team well-drilled and, once they had survived an uncertain start, they gave as good as they got. The heroes' welcome they received when they went to thank the rain-sodden Tartan Army at the final whistle was thoroughly deserved. England had plenty of possession in the second half but this must never be portrayed as a Scottish rearguard action. It was anything but. Yes, they were forced back for periods but were always positive, on the lookout to attack and it needed that crucial intervention from James to deny Dykes a winner. And in 20-year-old Billy Gilmour, on his first Scotland start, they had the game's outstanding performer, the Chelsea's midfielder showing his class on the ball and a real fighting spirit in the physical challenges. It was an outstanding, mature display. Arsenal's Kieran Tierney also showed how much he was missed in that Czech defeat with a powerhouse performance that must give Scotland real hope against Croatia. Clarke got it right tactically but England counterpart Southgate has questions to ponder. There is no doubt who will be the happier manager. Czech Republic on verge of last 16 after draw with Croatia Listen - Daily Euros: BBC Football Daily This video can not be played Marshall rooted to the spot as Stones hits post from corner England were efficient rather than spectacular in victory against Croatia on Sunday but it was very much a case of job done to set the platform to face the old enemy in a repeat of that Euro 96 encounter. Instead, England faded badly after a bright start although Raheem Sterling was furious when Spanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz ignored his pleas for a second-half penalty when he tangled with Andy Robertson. England did not deserve victory but they are still in a very healthy position going into their final game. That does not mean Southgate can be satisfied after what was a very disappointing night - especially as he faces a dilemma he could not have been contemplating before this tournament started. Captain Harry Kane was poor before his substitution against Croatia on Sunday and was equally anonymous here. He looked sluggish, off the pace and short on threat. It was no surprise when he was replaced by Marcus Rashford with 16 minutes left, even though England were desperately chasing a winner. In his defence, Kane has been starved of good service. To suggest his place is in question is unthinkable but there can be no doubt Southgate wants and needs a lot more from his world-class captain. And Aston Villa's Jack Grealish may now also player a bigger part in the equation, although he could not alter the pattern of this game after he replaced Phil Foden. England's fans have made Grealish very much the people's champion and were chanting his name long before he eventually came on. Will Southgate bow to their demands and start him against the Czech Republic after an England display so lacking in spark? England are still in a very good position - but they will need to be so much better than this. This video can not be played 'England were too frantic' - Southgate In their 115th meeting in all competitions, England and Scotland shared a goalless draw for only the fourth time, also doing so in 1872, 1970 and 1987, although this was the first time in a game at Wembley in the 33rd meeting there. This was England's 17th goalless draw at a major tournament (Euros + World Cup), two more than any other team in the history of those competitions. England have kept 14 clean sheets in their last 18 matches in all competitions (W14 D2 L2) since losing 2-1 to the Czech Republic in a European Championship qualifier in October 2019. Scotland have failed to score in eight of their last 12 matches at major tournaments (W2 D3 L7), and are one of only two teams to have played twice at Euro 2020 and failed to score, along with Turkey. Since the new Wembley opened in 2007, this was only England's second ever goalless draw there in a competitive fixture, also drawing 0-0 in October 2010 against Montenegro in a European Championships qualifier under Fabio Capello. This was Luke Shaw's first appearance for England at a major tournament since June 2014 against Costa Rica in the World Cup, 2,551 days ago. The only two players with longer gaps between tournament appearances for the Three Lions are Martin Keown (2,917 days, 1992-2000) and Tony Adams (2,912 days, 1988-96). Jack Grealish came off the bench and won four fouls, the most by a substitute at Euro 2020 and the most by a sub in a Euros match since Eder won five for Portugal in the Euro 2016 final vs France. At 25 years and 31 days, England named their youngest ever starting XI at a major tournament, with the previous youngest their XI against Belgium in the 2018 World Cup third-place play-off match (25y 175d). Tonight was England's 32nd consecutive international match naming a unique starting XI, England's longest run of naming an XI for the first time since a run of 56 games between 1990 and 1996. This video can not be played England scramble in dying minutes but Scotland able to clear danger Group D plays to a conclusion on Tuesday, with England hosting the Czech Republic at Wembley and Scotland facing Croatia at Hampden Park. Both games are at 20:00 BST and all four team can still qualify for the last 16.

"This video can not be played Wariness and welcome for Iran's president-elect Hardliner Ebrahim Raisi has won Iran's presidential election in a race that was widely seen as being designed to favour him. He thanked Iranians for their support, after securing 62% of the votes. Mr Raisi is Iran's top judge and holds ultra-conservative views. He is under US sanctions and has been linked to past executions of political prisoners. Iran's president is the second-highest ranking official in the country, after the supreme leader. Who is Ebrahim Raisi, Iran's next president? The unusual way power is held in Iran Iran's presidential election: Four ways it matters Mr Raisi will be inaugurated in early August, and will have significant influence over domestic policy and foreign affairs. But in Iran's political system it is the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the top religious cleric, who has the final say on all state matters. Iran is run according to conservative Shia Islamic values, and there have been curbs on political freedoms since its Islamic Revolution in 1979. Many Iranians saw this latest election as having been engineered for Mr Raisi to win, and shunned the poll. Official figures showed voter turnout was the lowest ever for a presidential election, at 48.8%, compared to more than 70% for the previous vote in 2017. The 60-year-old cleric has served as a prosecutor for most of his career. From an early age, Mr Raisi held powerful and high-ranking positions - when he was just 20 years old, he was already serving as the chief prosecutor of the city of Karaj. He was appointed head of the judiciary in 2019, two years after he lost by a landslide to Hassan Rouhani in the last presidential election. Mr Raisi has presented himself as the best person to fight corruption and inequality, and solve Iran's economic problems. ""Our people's grievances over shortcomings are real,"" he said as he cast his vote in Tehran. The man who wears a black turban identifying him in Shia tradition as a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad is fiercely loyal to Iran's ruling clerics, and has even been seen as a possible successor to Ayatollah Khamenei. Turnout was reportedly significantly down on the previous election in 2017 But many Iranians and rights groups have pointed to Mr Raisi's alleged role in the mass executions of political prisoners in 1988, when he was 27 years old. He is said to have been part of a so-called ""death committee"" - one of four judges who oversaw secret death sentences for about 5,000 prisoners in jails near Tehran, according to Amnesty International. It says the location of the mass graves where the men and women were buried is being ""systematically concealed by the Iranian authorities"". ""That Ebrahim Raisi has risen to the presidency instead of being investigated for the crimes against humanity of murder, enforced disappearance and torture, is a grim reminder that impunity reigns supreme in Iran,"" said Amnesty chief AgnÃ¨s Callamard. Mr Raisi has repeatedly denied his role in the death sentences. But he has also said they were justified because of a fatwa, or religious ruling, by former supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini. Amnesty also says that as head of the judiciary Mr Raisi oversaw impunity for officials and security forces accused of killing protesters during unrest in 2019. Mr Raisi has promised to ease unemployment and work to remove US sanctions that have contributed to economic hardship for ordinary Iranians and caused widespread discontent. BBC Persian correspondent Kasra Naji adds that under Mr Raisi, Iran's hardliners will seek to reinforce a puritanical system of Islamic government, possibly meaning more controls on social activities, fewer freedoms and jobs for women, and tighter control of social media and the press. The hardliners are suspicious of the West, but both Mr Raisi and Supreme Leader Khamenei favour a return to an international deal on Iran's nuclear activity. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, signed in 2015, gave Iran relief from Western sanctions in return for limiting its nuclear activities. The US pulled out of the deal in 2018, and President Trump's administration re-imposed crippling limits on Iran's ability to trade. Mr Raisi was among the officials put under sanctions. Iran has responded by re-starting nuclear operations that were banned under the deal. Talks aimed at resurrecting the deal are ongoing in Vienna, with President Joe Biden also keen to revive it. But both sides say the other must make the first move. Analysis by Kasra Naji, BBC Persian The election was engineered to pave the way for Mr Raisi to win. This has alienated a good number of Iranians already deeply discontented with their living conditions in an economy that is crippled by US sanctions but also mismanagement. The result of the election will not help with their concerns and may even lead to more instability at home. In the past few years Iran has witnessed at least two rounds of serious nationwide protests - with hundreds, some say thousands, killed. With Mr Raisi taking the presidency the hardliners will have taken all the centres of power: the executive branch as well as the legislative and the judiciary. Iran will be a more closed society. Freedoms will likely be curtailed even more than before. The regime will look to China to help the economy out of deep crisis. There will be more tension with the West. Indirect talks between Iran and the US in Vienna over reviving the nuclear deal may face more uncertainty. There are already reports that the talks will now break up for a few weeks, allowing all sides to take stock of the new reality in Iran. Almost 600 hopefuls, including 40 women, registered to be candidates in the election. But in the end only seven men were approved last month by the 12 jurists and theologians on the Guardian Council, an unelected body that has the ultimate decision with regard to candidates' qualifications. Three of those candidates subsequently pulled out before polling day. Before he withdrew, reformist candidate Mohsen Mehralizadeh hinted that the vote would be a foregone conclusion, saying during a candidates' TV debate that the ruling clerics had aligned ""sun, moon and the heavens to make one particular person the president,"" according to The Economist. Meanwhile former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, one of those barred from running, said in a video message that he would not vote, declaring: ""I do not want to have a part in this sin.""

"Walk-in vaccine clinics are opening in England, in a major push to offer coronavirus jabs to all remaining adults Queues have formed at pop-up vaccination centres at football grounds in London, including Chelsea and West Ham's stadiums More first doses of vaccines were given than second jabs on Thursday and Friday, reflecting the push to get the UK's younger adults vaccinated The UK records more than 10,000 daily cases for the third day in a row - after months of lower figures A new wave of infections is definitely under way in England, says Prof Adam Finn of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation But epidemiologist Dr Mike Tildesley says he is ""cautiously hopeful"" hospital admissions will not be on the same scale as in January Labour is calling for workers to have the right to work flexibly before coronavirus restrictions are fully lifted in England Some people on furlough are avoiding a return to work because it has been ""great"" for them, says Tory MP Andrea Leadsom The Palestinian Authority has cancelled a deal under which Israel was to give it one million Pfizer jabs because they were too close to expiry Edited by James Clarke That's all from the live page team, thanks for joining us today. Your updates were written by Jennifer Meierhans and Victoria Lindrea and edited by James Clarke. We will be back with more tomorrow, have a good evening. The London Stadium has opened as a walk-in vaccination centre We are going to be bringing our coronavirus updates to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's news: Pfizer BioNtech vaccines were given at the London Stadium About 3,000 Christians formed groups at one-mile intervals along a coastal path topray for those bereaved by the pandemic. Pastor Mark Pugh says: ""Some were individuals going to the mile spots, others were church groups so there was a real change of dynamics at each of those points."" The South West Coast Path runs from Minehead, Somerset, to Poole, Dorset. The footpath is 630 miles long (1,013km) and also takes in Devon and Cornwall. Churches have not been able to welcome congregations through the pandemic due to social-distancing restrictions. But pastor Pugh says: ""We believe the church is not the building, it's the people. ""Churches have been active running food banks, providing care for our communities just offering support and friendship to so many people."" From doodling families having their vaccines, to depicting intensive care staff trying to save patients, artists recorded some of the most significant moments in the coronavirus pandemic. Now they hope the touching moments their art has captured over the past 16 months will become part of history. Nathan Wyburn created a portrait of an NHS nurse made of 200 pictures of nurses. He says it ""just felt right"" to focus on key workers and ""realised it was kind of the perfect time for me to start creating work that meant something more to me, and focus on the everyday heroes"". Angie Stevens has been drawing for 10 years, documenting her family's experiences on her websitedoodlemum.com,external. Angie said drawing had helped her make sense of the pandemic and she wanted toportray how it was affecting her family. She says: ""We've got our data and graphs but history is about the personal, the everyday. I'm a normal person living my life and how it affects me is just as important."" Caerphilly Youth Forum has put together a time capsule to document how young people were living through the pandemic in 2020. It asked young people across the borough to send in photos, drawings, artwork, poems and small items that captured how life had changed.

A school with 1,200 pupils has closed its site to students as a ""precautionary measure"" over Covid concerns. Pupils at Greenhill School in Tenby, Pembrokeshire, will be taught online from Monday because of the number having to self-isolate and increasing case rates. Head Raymond McGovern says: ""Clearly, our locality and the school are part of this picture of increased rates."" It comes as Wales' first minister said Wales is at thestart of a third wave. Pembrokeshire has Wales' fifth highest rate of Covid cases for those aged under 25 - at 55.2 cases for every 100,000 of the population, according to Public Health Wales figures for this week. Greenhill School's year 10 age group is already isolating at homedue to a number of positive Covid cases. A woman in hospital for more than 10 weeks and unable to have visitors because of Covid rules says the loneliness is ""soul-destroying"". Margaret Evans, 86, from Nefyn in Gwynedd, says she felt ""torn away from the world"" with a ban on visitors at Ysbyty Alltwen, Tremadog. Margaret says it ""isn't fair"", because another nearby community hospital allowed garden visits. Elaine Beer from Minffordd said her 83-year-old mother has been at Ysbyty Gwynedd for two weeks and has also been unable to have visitors. ""Mum phones me in tears saying she's lonely,"" she says. ""It's not fair - either everyone can go [to visit] or nobody at all.""

Moderna vaccines arrive in Taiwan The US will ship 2.5 million Covid vaccine doses to Taiwan on Saturday - more than three times the previous number of shots allocated for the island by Washington, Reuters reports. The US administration had initially promised to donate 750,000 doses to Taiwan, but the huge increase follows President Joe Biden's pledge to send 80 million US-made shots around the world. Few people in Taiwan have yet received the vaccine, with the island struggling to access supplies - andunwilling to accept help from neighbouring China because the two sides are political foes. Taiwan's leaders favour more independence for the island, something China forcefully resists. Beijing believes Taiwan is part of its own territory, and wants it to unify with the mainland. Taipei has expressed concern about the safety of Chinese shots. The 2.5 million donated doses of the Moderna vaccine were flown out of Memphis early on Saturday. The US has denied it is seeking to exert any influence in Taiwan. ""We are not allocating these doses, or delivering these doses, based on political or economic conditions,"" a senior U.S. administration official says. ""We are donating these vaccines with the singular objective of savinglives. ""Our vaccines do not come with strings attached."" Covid infections remain comparatively low in Taiwan despite a spike in domestic cases. However, only about 6% of Taiwan's population of 23.5 million  have received at least one shot of a vaccine. The UK has recorded more than 10,000 new coronavirus infections for the third day in a row. Today the figure is 10,321, though that is down from 10,476 yesterday and 11,007 on Thursday,according to government data.,external The previous time the number was higher than 10,000 was on 22 February. And daily cases had stayed below 3,000 for 43 days between 13 April and 25 May. Damian GrammaticasPolitical correspondent People in England who have had both Covid jabs and come into contact with someone infected with the virus could be spared having to isolate for 10 days. Government sources have told the BBC trials are examining whether it might be possible to scrap the quarantine period and instead allow double-vaccinated people to take daily tests. If the test, done each morning, was negative the individual would not have to quarantine that day. The trials are not expected to be completed until later in the summer. And it's thought the system would only come into effect if Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty was satisfied the daily tests would be a reliable way to prevent the spread of the virus. Yesterday,218,636first doses were given and188,858 secondjabs. It was the second day in a row more first doses were administered than second, perhaps reflecting the push of the past few days to get younger adults vaccinated. Before Thursday, the previous time more than half the vaccines in a day were first doses was 4 April, Easter Sunday. The total number of coronavirus vaccinations now given in the UK is73,766,593. That's42,679,268first doses and31,087,325second doses. As well as a push to get over-18s vaccinated, people over 40 in England and Scotland are being invited to get their second dose after eight weeks instead of 12 weeks because of concerns over theDelta variant. Here's how you can move your second jab forward. The UK has recorded 10,321 new coronavirus infections,the government's daily figues show.,external There have been a further 14 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK, according to the data. That brings the total number of people to have died in the 28 days after a positive Covid-19 test to 127,970. As we've been reporting, there's a real push on Covid vaccines this weekend as walk-in centres open across England in a race to get people immunised before the peak of a third wave. Charlton Athletic opened its Valley stadium in south-east London as a walk-in centre focusing on getting second doses into the arms of the over-40s. One woman in the queue told us: ""I guess for me I think the most important thing was just to feel well and a bit free in society and to not be a danger to others either."" It's expected to be a bumper weekend of walk-in in the north west of England too. The region has the highest case rates in the country but extra doses of vaccine and enhanced testing is hoping to slow the spread.Surge testing has started in Cumbria after a spike in cases. By Thea de Gallier BBC Three Lowri: 'You can feel like where you live is just a playground' One of the ongoing narratives we heard over the course of the pandemic was how remote working was leading people to give up city life in favour of bigger, cheaper and more rural living. For many people with desk-based jobs, there was no need to be within travelling distance of the office any more, so expensive flats in and around London and other major cities were traded in for houses in the countryside or by the sea. Something we heard less about, though, was the impact on people living in those regions where property increased in popularity over lockdown. In Wales, for example, house prices grew by 11% over the past year âthe highest growth rate in the UK. Younger buyers found that houses had offers for  significantly over the asking price by people who hadnât even viewed them. ""Iâm just burying my head in the sand and praying the market might crash,â says Lowri, a 29-year-old classroom assistant and freelance writer living in the Welsh county of Gwynedd. Lowri says the influx of people coming to Wales over the pandemic was âoverwhelmingâ. ""Iâm hearing about houses being bought unseen, and the prices in north Wales rising more than anywhere else in the UK.â Anya Martin, from Priced Out - an organisation campaigning for cheaper housing - believes the shift in outlook is ""bad news for renters and young people"". âItâs a natural eventuality that if people move out of London and cities, theyâll move to other regions. Thatâs not matched with an equivalent supply of new homes,â she tells the BBC. âIt means renters are less able to afford the amount of space they want and may end up in lower-quality housing. She adds: ""It's bad news for the local economy â thereâll be no one to provide care services or run cafes."" Read the full story. Timira Farah, 97, had her first Pfizer jab A walk-in coronavirus vaccination clinic for people aged 18 or over has opened in a park in Bristol's city centre.

NHS vaccination lead, Clare Armour, says: ""We haven't done one in a park before so it's very new to us and it's very, very exciting."" Muna Abubakar persuaded her 97-year-old mum to have the jab on Saturday, despite her previous fears and reluctance. ""Today, finally she accepted the injection,"" Muna says.

Head Raymond McGovern says: ""Clearly, our locality and the school are part of this picture of increased rates."" It comes as Wales' first minister said Wales is at thestart of a third wave. Pembrokeshire has Wales' fifth highest rate of Covid cases for those aged under 25 - at 55.2 cases for every 100,000 of the population, according to Public Health Wales figures for this week.

Moderna vaccines arrive in Taiwan The US will ship 2.5 million Covid vaccine doses to Taiwan on Saturday - more than three times the previous number of shots allocated for the island by Washington, Reuters reports. The US administration had initially promised to donate 750,000 doses to Taiwan, but the huge increase follows President Joe Biden's pledge to send 80 million US-made shots around the world. Few people in Taiwan have yet received the vaccine, with the island struggling to access supplies - andunwilling to accept help from neighbouring China because the two sides are political foes. Taiwan's leaders favour more independence for the island, something China forcefully resists. Beijing believes Taiwan is part of its own territory, and wants it to unify with the mainland. Taipei has expressed concern about the safety of Chinese shots. The 2.5 million donated doses of the Moderna vaccine were flown out of Memphis early on Saturday. The US has denied it is seeking to exert any influence in Taiwan. ""We are not allocating these doses, or delivering these doses, based on political or economic conditions,"" a senior U.S. administration official says. ""We are donating these vaccines with the singular objective of savinglives. ""Our vaccines do not come with strings attached."" Covid infections remain comparatively low in Taiwan despite a spike in domestic cases. However, only about 6% of Taiwan's population of 23.5 million  have received at least one shot of a vaccine. The UK has recorded more than 10,000 new coronavirus infections for the third day in a row. Today the figure is 10,321, though that is down from 10,476 yesterday and 11,007 on Thursday,according to government data.,external The previous time the number was higher than 10,000 was on 22 February.

Damian GrammaticasPolitical correspondent People in England who have had both Covid jabs and come into contact with someone infected with the virus could be spared having to isolate for 10 days. Government sources have told the BBC trials are examining whether it might be possible to scrap the quarantine period and instead allow double-vaccinated people to take daily tests. If the test, done each morning, was negative the individual would not have to quarantine that day. The trials are not expected to be completed until later in the summer. And it's thought the system would only come into effect if Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty was satisfied the daily tests would be a reliable way to prevent the spread of the virus. Yesterday,218,636first doses were given and188,858 secondjabs. It was the second day in a row more first doses were administered than second, perhaps reflecting the push of the past few days to get younger adults vaccinated. Before Thursday, the previous time more than half the vaccines in a day were first doses was 4 April, Easter Sunday. The total number of coronavirus vaccinations now given in the UK is73,766,593. That's42,679,268first doses and31,087,325second doses. As well as a push to get over-18s vaccinated, people over 40 in England and Scotland are being invited to get their second dose after eight weeks instead of 12 weeks because of concerns over theDelta variant. Here's how you can move your second jab forward. The UK has recorded 10,321 new coronavirus infections,the government's daily figues show.,external There have been a further 14 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK, according to the data. That brings the total number of people to have died in the 28 days after a positive Covid-19 test to 127,970. As we've been reporting, there's a real push on Covid vaccines this weekend as walk-in centres open across England in a race to get people immunised before the peak of a third wave. Charlton Athletic opened its Valley stadium in south-east London as a walk-in centre focusing on getting second doses into the arms of the over-40s. One woman in the queue told us: ""I guess for me I think the most important thing was just to feel well and a bit free in society and to not be a danger to others either."" It's expected to be a bumper weekend of walk-in in the north west of England too. The region has the highest case rates in the country but extra doses of vaccine and enhanced testing is hoping to slow the spread.Surge testing has started in Cumbria after a spike in cases. By Thea de Gallier BBC Three Lowri: 'You can feel like where you live is just a playground' One of the ongoing narratives we heard over the course of the pandemic was how remote working was leading people to give up city life in favour of bigger, cheaper and more rural living. For many people with desk-based jobs, there was no need to be within travelling distance of the office any more, so expensive flats in and around London and other major cities were traded in for houses in the countryside or by the sea. Something we heard less about, though, was the impact on people living in those regions where property increased in popularity over lockdown. In Wales, for example, house prices grew by 11% over the past year âthe highest growth rate in the UK. Younger buyers found that houses had offers for  significantly over the asking price by people who hadnât even viewed them. ""Iâm just burying my head in the sand and praying the market might crash,â says Lowri, a 29-year-old classroom assistant and freelance writer living in the Welsh county of Gwynedd. Lowri says the influx of people coming to Wales over the pandemic was âoverwhelmingâ. ""Iâm hearing about houses being bought unseen, and the prices in north Wales rising more than anywhere else in the UK.â Anya Martin, from Priced Out - an organisation campaigning for cheaper housing - believes the shift in outlook is ""bad news for renters and young people"". âItâs a natural eventuality that if people move out of London and cities, theyâll move to other regions. Thatâs not matched with an equivalent supply of new homes,â she tells the BBC. âIt means renters are less able to afford the amount of space they want and may end up in lower-quality housing. She adds: ""It's bad news for the local economy â thereâll be no one to provide care services or run cafes."" Read the full story. Timira Farah, 97, had her first Pfizer jab A walk-in coronavirus vaccination clinic for people aged 18 or over has opened in a park in Bristol's city centre.

The region has the highest case rates in the country but extra doses of vaccine and enhanced testing is hoping to slow the spread.Surge testing has started in Cumbria after a spike in cases. By Thea de Gallier BBC Three Lowri: 'You can feel like where you live is just a playground' One of the ongoing narratives we heard over the course of the pandemic was how remote working was leading people to give up city life in favour of bigger, cheaper and more rural living. For many people with desk-based jobs, there was no need to be within travelling distance of the office any more, so expensive flats in and around London and other major cities were traded in for houses in the countryside or by the sea. Something we heard less about, though, was the impact on people living in those regions where property increased in popularity over lockdown. In Wales, for example, house prices grew by 11% over the past year âthe highest growth rate in the UK. Younger buyers found that houses had offers for  significantly over the asking price by people who hadnât even viewed them. ""Iâm just burying my head in the sand and praying the market might crash,â says Lowri, a 29-year-old classroom assistant and freelance writer living in the Welsh county of Gwynedd. Lowri says the influx of people coming to Wales over the pandemic was âoverwhelmingâ. ""Iâm hearing about houses being bought unseen, and the prices in north Wales rising more than anywhere else in the UK.â Anya Martin, from Priced Out - an organisation campaigning for cheaper housing - believes the shift in outlook is ""bad news for renters and young people"". âItâs a natural eventuality that if people move out of London and cities, theyâll move to other regions. Thatâs not matched with an equivalent supply of new homes,â she tells the BBC. âIt means renters are less able to afford the amount of space they want and may end up in lower-quality housing.

Timira Farah, 97, had her first Pfizer jab A walk-in coronavirus vaccination clinic for people aged 18 or over has opened in a park in Bristol's city centre. The clinic at Eastville Park is for those who live in the central and east-central parts of the city - particularly those over the age of 30 - who have not yet had their first vaccination. NHS vaccination lead, Clare Armour, says: ""We haven't done one in a park before so it's very new to us and it's very, very exciting."" Muna Abubakar persuaded her 97-year-old mum to have the jab on Saturday, despite her previous fears and reluctance. ""Today, finally she accepted the injection,"" Muna says. NHS health links worker, Amran Hussein, says: ""I rang Muna two weeks ago to speak to her mum. I'm so happy to see her here today."" The clinic has 800 Pfizer doses and will remain open until 17:00 BST. Amran Hussein has been encouraging vaccine take-up among Bristol's Somali community A marquee has been set up in the south part of Eastville Park A vaccine epidemiologist says the UK is ""well in the beginning of the third wave"" of coronavirus. Professor Mark Jit says the link between getting covid and being hospitalised or dying ""has been weakened but it's not been broken completely"". He told BBC News the UK's vaccines ""are really effective but they're not 100% effective"". He says: ""If people have two doses they might have a 90% or 95% lower chance of getting hospitalised or dying but that still leaves that 5-10% of people and when you multiply that by lots of people getting infected that's still a fair number of deaths, although a lot less than we would have seen without vaccination."" He says most people in hospital with coronavirus are unvaccinated ""so there is a bit of a race to get the vaccination out as soon as possible before the third wave gets really big."" He says: ""We will have a third wave unless we go back into lockdown because the virus is spreading faster than we can control it. But the size of this wave depends on how fast we can roll out the vaccine, how good test and trace is, and so forth."" The Queen is attending the final day of Royal Ascot,one of the government's pilot events,externallooking at how people can safely return to mass gatherings. The five-day event, in Berkshire,started on Tuesday. All those attending are required to provide evidence of a negative lateral flow test on arrival at the racecourse each day. Two further PCR tests must also be completed - one on the day before attendance and another five days afterwards. The Queen, who has a keen interest in racing, is usually a regular at the racing meet, but Saturday marked her first appearance this year. Crowds stood up and applauded as she arrived by car at the racecourse, wearing a mint green hat and matching coat.

Withjust five Covid cases per 100,000 in the week up to 12 June, the Suffolk town of Ipswich has the lowest rate in England. But it has previously had one of the highest. Barman Adam Muir, 22, says the figures are ""rather surprising. ""t's not like I've been seeing everyone following the guidelines,"" he says. ""It's the regular stuff - no-one wearing their masks, no-one paying attention to the Covid guidelines. ""I suppose everyone is fed up with it, and I've seen it more so in hospitality - when you're drunk, you don't really pay attention."" Friends Rosie Loveday, 32, and Rhiannon Newby, 21, are also surprised at the low rate. ""I'm shocked,"" says Rosie. ""One day you hear we have the highest infection rate, and the next it's the lowest. ""I'm in town most days and most people are wearing masks, or they have exemption cards. Overall, it's not been too bad."" Rhiannon says: ""I'm the younger generation, and there hasn't been as much following the rules.""

Pop-up testing centres are opening in certain areas of the city People living in areas experiencing a ""sharp"" rise in coronavirus cases in Leeds are being offered asymptomatic testing to stop the virus spreading. Hyde Park, Headingley, Little London and Woodhouse have seen an increase in cases, particularly among younger people, Leeds City Council said. PCR tests are being offered at new pop-up testing centres from Tuesday, including at the University of Leeds. Council staff will go door-to-door offering some tests to residents, whether they have symptoms or not. Testing centres are opening at Cinder Moor in Woodhouse Lane, the Gryphon Centre at the University of Leeds and the Mandela Community Centre in Chapeltown Road. ""We need people living in Headingley and Hyde Park and Little London and Woodhouse to work with us, get a test and help us identify where these Covid cases are so together we can stop the spread and ensure Leeds can carry on enjoying a safe summer,"" said councillor Salma Arif. A family's experience of Covid-19 has inspired a college student's end-of-year course project. Ethan Deery's hand-drawn animation reflected his grandfather's battle with Covid-19 and was a tribute to the NHS staff who helped save his life. The 18-year-old, who studies in Londonderry, spent two months using a technique called rotoscoping, which involved him tracing over videos and pictures and then animating the stills together frame-by-frame.

"Walk-in vaccine clinics are opening in England, in a major push to offer coronavirus jabs to all remaining adults Queues have formed at pop-up vaccination centres at football grounds in London, including Chelsea and West Ham's stadiums More first doses of vaccines were given than second jabs on Thursday and Friday, reflecting the push to get the UK's younger adults vaccinated The UK records more than 10,000 daily cases for the third day in a row - after months of lower figures A new wave of infections is definitely under way in England, says Prof Adam Finn of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation But epidemiologist Dr Mike Tildesley says he is ""cautiously hopeful"" hospital admissions will not be on the same scale as in January Labour is calling for workers to have the right to work flexibly before coronavirus restrictions are fully lifted in England Some people on furlough are avoiding a return to work because it has been ""great"" for them, says Tory MP Andrea Leadsom The Palestinian Authority has cancelled a deal under which Israel was to give it one million Pfizer jabs because they were too close to expiry Edited by James Clarke That's all from the live page team, thanks for joining us today. Your updates were written by Jennifer Meierhans and Victoria Lindrea and edited by James Clarke. We will be back with more tomorrow, have a good evening. The London Stadium has opened as a walk-in vaccination centre We are going to be bringing our coronavirus updates to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's news: Pfizer BioNtech vaccines were given at the London Stadium About 3,000 Christians formed groups at one-mile intervals along a coastal path topray for those bereaved by the pandemic. Pastor Mark Pugh says: ""Some were individuals going to the mile spots, others were church groups so there was a real change of dynamics at each of those points."" The South West Coast Path runs from Minehead, Somerset, to Poole, Dorset. The footpath is 630 miles long (1,013km) and also takes in Devon and Cornwall. Churches have not been able to welcome congregations through the pandemic due to social-distancing restrictions. But pastor Pugh says: ""We believe the church is not the building, it's the people. ""Churches have been active running food banks, providing care for our communities just offering support and friendship to so many people."" From doodling families having their vaccines, to depicting intensive care staff trying to save patients, artists recorded some of the most significant moments in the coronavirus pandemic. Now they hope the touching moments their art has captured over the past 16 months will become part of history. Nathan Wyburn created a portrait of an NHS nurse made of 200 pictures of nurses. He says it ""just felt right"" to focus on key workers and ""realised it was kind of the perfect time for me to start creating work that meant something more to me, and focus on the everyday heroes"". Angie Stevens has been drawing for 10 years, documenting her family's experiences on her websitedoodlemum.com,external. Angie said drawing had helped her make sense of the pandemic and she wanted toportray how it was affecting her family. She says: ""We've got our data and graphs but history is about the personal, the everyday. I'm a normal person living my life and how it affects me is just as important."" Caerphilly Youth Forum has put together a time capsule to document how young people were living through the pandemic in 2020. It asked young people across the borough to send in photos, drawings, artwork, poems and small items that captured how life had changed.

A school with 1,200 pupils has closed its site to students as a ""precautionary measure"" over Covid concerns. Pupils at Greenhill School in Tenby, Pembrokeshire, will be taught online from Monday because of the number having to self-isolate and increasing case rates. Head Raymond McGovern says: ""Clearly, our locality and the school are part of this picture of increased rates."" It comes as Wales' first minister said Wales is at thestart of a third wave. Pembrokeshire has Wales' fifth highest rate of Covid cases for those aged under 25 - at 55.2 cases for every 100,000 of the population, according to Public Health Wales figures for this week. Greenhill School's year 10 age group is already isolating at homedue to a number of positive Covid cases. A woman in hospital for more than 10 weeks and unable to have visitors because of Covid rules says the loneliness is ""soul-destroying"". Margaret Evans, 86, from Nefyn in Gwynedd, says she felt ""torn away from the world"" with a ban on visitors at Ysbyty Alltwen, Tremadog. Margaret says it ""isn't fair"", because another nearby community hospital allowed garden visits. Elaine Beer from Minffordd said her 83-year-old mother has been at Ysbyty Gwynedd for two weeks and has also been unable to have visitors. ""Mum phones me in tears saying she's lonely,"" she says. ""It's not fair - either everyone can go [to visit] or nobody at all."" Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board says it appreciates visiting restrictions have been difficult for patients and their families, and is promising changes will be implemented across the board this week to allow visits by appointment.

Moderna vaccines arrive in Taiwan The US will ship 2.5 million Covid vaccine doses to Taiwan on Saturday - more than three times the previous number of shots allocated for the island by Washington, Reuters reports. The US administration had initially promised to donate 750,000 doses to Taiwan, but the huge increase follows President Joe Biden's pledge to send 80 million US-made shots around the world. Few people in Taiwan have yet received the vaccine, with the island struggling to access supplies - andunwilling to accept help from neighbouring China because the two sides are political foes. Taiwan's leaders favour more independence for the island, something China forcefully resists. Beijing believes Taiwan is part of its own territory, and wants it to unify with the mainland. Taipei has expressed concern about the safety of Chinese shots. The 2.5 million donated doses of the Moderna vaccine were flown out of Memphis early on Saturday. The US has denied it is seeking to exert any influence in Taiwan. ""We are not allocating these doses, or delivering these doses, based on political or economic conditions,"" a senior U.S. administration official says. ""We are donating these vaccines with the singular objective of savinglives. ""Our vaccines do not come with strings attached."" Covid infections remain comparatively low in Taiwan despite a spike in domestic cases. However, only about 6% of Taiwan's population of 23.5 million  have received at least one shot of a vaccine. The UK has recorded more than 10,000 new coronavirus infections for the third day in a row. Today the figure is 10,321, though that is down from 10,476 yesterday and 11,007 on Thursday,according to government data.,external The previous time the number was higher than 10,000 was on 22 February. And daily cases had stayed below 3,000 for 43 days between 13 April and 25 May. Damian GrammaticasPolitical correspondent People in England who have had both Covid jabs and come into contact with someone infected with the virus could be spared having to isolate for 10 days. Government sources have told the BBC trials are examining whether it might be possible to scrap the quarantine period and instead allow double-vaccinated people to take daily tests. If the test, done each morning, was negative the individual would not have to quarantine that day. The trials are not expected to be completed until later in the summer. And it's thought the system would only come into effect if Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty was satisfied the daily tests would be a reliable way to prevent the spread of the virus. Yesterday,218,636first doses were given and188,858 secondjabs. It was the second day in a row more first doses were administered than second, perhaps reflecting the push of the past few days to get younger adults vaccinated. Before Thursday, the previous time more than half the vaccines in a day were first doses was 4 April, Easter Sunday. The total number of coronavirus vaccinations now given in the UK is73,766,593. That's42,679,268first doses and31,087,325second doses. As well as a push to get over-18s vaccinated, people over 40 in England and Scotland are being invited to get their second dose after eight weeks instead of 12 weeks because of concerns over theDelta variant. Here's how you can move your second jab forward. The UK has recorded 10,321 new coronavirus infections,the government's daily figues show.,external There have been a further 14 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK, according to the data. That brings the total number of people to have died in the 28 days after a positive Covid-19 test to 127,970. As we've been reporting, there's a real push on Covid vaccines this weekend as walk-in centres open across England in a race to get people immunised before the peak of a third wave. Charlton Athletic opened its Valley stadium in south-east London as a walk-in centre focusing on getting second doses into the arms of the over-40s. One woman in the queue told us: ""I guess for me I think the most important thing was just to feel well and a bit free in society and to not be a danger to others either."" It's expected to be a bumper weekend of walk-in in the north west of England too. The region has the highest case rates in the country but extra doses of vaccine and enhanced testing is hoping to slow the spread.Surge testing has started in Cumbria after a spike in cases.
