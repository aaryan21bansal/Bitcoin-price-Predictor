"A rail timetable overhaul planned for December has been scaled back amid fears of a repeat of the chaos seen in May when a new schedule was introduced. Timetable changes for eight franchises, including Govia Thameslink Railway and Northern, whose operations descended into chaos in May, have been postponed. Other franchises will introduce only minor timetable changes in December. Industry bodyThe Rail Delivery Group sai,externald the ""more cautious approach"" took into account ""recent painful lessons"". Rail timetable chaos inquiry launched Rise in late trains since new timetables Rail firm changes time of every train Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, said: ""In parts of the country, many people have suffered unacceptable disruption following the introduction of the new timetable in May for which we are sincerely sorry. ""The industry is determined to learn the lessons from what went wrong."" He said train operators would focus on making sure passengers received a ""reliable service"" in December. The operators which will not make changes to their existing timetable in December are Cross Country, Govia, Thameslink Railway, Great Western Railway, London Overground, Northern, South Western Railway (SWR), TransPennine Express and West Midlands Trains. In May, the time of every Govia Thameslink was changed In May, what was billed as the biggest ever overhaul of rail timetables led towidespread rail disruption. The overhaul was aimed at improving punctuality and boosting capacity, but instead led to a huge number of train services being cancelled or severely delayed. The Transport Select Committee is investigating the reasons behind the disruption andis asking for evidence from passengers and as well as rail industry groups.,external The committee's chair, Lilian Greenwood, said May's timetable change caused ""upset and distress"". ""Before we look at steps taken to improve the situation and compensation, we want to hear the experiences of passengers themselves. I strongly encourage them to engage with us via the Committee's Twitter account or submit written evidence to our inquiry."" Train timetables are usually changed twice a year, in summer and winter, but normally on a much smaller scale. The Rail Delivery Group said December's changes would now be on a similar scale to ""the smaller changes of recent years"". South Western Railway said it was ""disappointed"" that it would not be going ahead with its ""major timetable change"" in December, which would have led to more capacity. The decision was taken ""at a national level that a period of stability is needed"", it added. Anthony Smith, chief executive of passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said the timetable announcement was a ""pragmatic step to help maintain a more dependable service"". But he warned that ""long-suffering passengers who have put up with much inconvenience... will be disappointed that promised improvements may be delivered more slowly"".

"Shane Williams' image was used on Neil Taylor's company van and website Former Wales rugby star Shane Williams says he is taking legal advice after a builder accused of substandard work used his image to promote his business. Neil Taylor, owner of TMW Roofline in Bryncethin in Bridgend county, used the star's face on his van and website. Mr Williams said Mr Taylor did some work on his house 10 years ago but he had nothing to do with the company. Mr Taylor said he had taken the star's name off his paperwork and does not mislead anyone on his website. TMW Roofline's paperwork used the rugby star's image and name The former Wales and Lions wing said: ""The agreement was [he would] do the work and I would give him a testimonial and a photograph.... and that's about as far as it goes. ""I don't work with the company, I'm not involved with the company and I certainly haven't received a penny."" An investigation by BBC Wales TV programme X-Ray found 47 photographs of building projects on Mr Taylor's company website appeared on at least one other company website and one appeared on 40 sites around the world. Lisa John and Neil Bartlett said they had to cover their ceiling with bin bags to keep out the wind A surveyor described the work Mr Taylor did for a couple in Aberkenfig as ""appalling"". Lisa John and Neil Bartlett hired him to build a new room in their garden and a small extension on the side of their house for Â£30,000. But days after making their final payment to his company, faults in the work began to show. Little Grogg version of Shane Williams worth Â£1,500 Wales legend to play for village side at Principality Stadium 'I was as nervous playing for Amman as Wales' ""We had water coming in through the ceilings and we were just constantly on the phone to him,"" said Ms John. ""He did come down and his solution - which was I think his favourite thing - was to put a big block of silicone back over the hole and tell us it was fixed."" Shane Williams says he met Neil Taylor when he did some work on his property 10 years ago The couple noticed patio tiles were loose and began having issues with their plumbing. Then in March, whenthe country was hit by days of heavy snowfall, they had snow coming in through the ceiling and had to cover it with bin bags to keep out the wind. A surveyor described the work on the roof as ""appalling"" ""He then admitted by text that he had put the wrong fittings on the side which is why we had water coming in,"" said Ms John. ""By this point we'd completely lost any faith in this man."" Surveyor Tim Davies assessed the work and said: ""I really can't find anything that is right with this roof. It's been so badly done. It's quite appalling to be honest. ""It is plain for all to see that this is an incredibly substandard work. This is lower than DIY standard."" Mr Taylor said bad weather meant work on the couple's home in Aberkenfig over-ran and he has been back on site and fixed the patio - the couple said they were still waiting for their roof to be fixed. He said he believed he worked on all the projects pictured on his company's website.

"The marathon cabinet meeting at Chequers lasted nearly 12 hours The cabinet has reached an agreement on the UK's future relationship with the EU after Brexit. Here are the key points fromthe three page deal published by the government.,external The UK will ""maintain a common rulebook for all goods"" with the EU, including agricultural products, after Brexit. A treaty will be signed committing the UK to ""continued harmonisation"" with EU rules - avoiding friction at the UK-EU border, including Northern Ireland. Parliament will oversee the UK's trade policy and have the ability to ""choose"" to diverge from the EU rules, ""recognising that this would have consequences"". ""Co-operative arrangements"" will be established between EU and UK competition regulators. ""Different arrangements"" will be organised for services ""where it is in our interests to have regulatory flexibility"". A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"". Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"". The borders between the UK and EU will be treated as a ""combined customs territory"". The UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge  EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. A post-Brexit UK would be able to ""control its own tariffs for trade with the rest of the world"" without causing border disruption. This avoids a hard Irish border, and removes the need for ""backstop"" arrangements to be put in place before the UK's withdrawal from the EU, the government says. The agreement says it will end free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". A ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. These proposals represent ""a precise and responsible approach to the final stage of the negotiations"", the government says. According to the government the plan: Gives the UK an independent trade policy, with the ability to set its own non-EU tariffs and to reach separate trade deals Ends the role of the ECJ in UK affairs Ends annual payments to the EU budget with ""appropriate contributions for joint action in specific areas"" The early reaction from Brexiteers has been that they need to see the full 100-plus page plan  to see whether or not they agree with the government's claims. Full details will be released in a white paper next week. This is not a final Brexit deal. This is an agreement on the UK's preferred way forward as negotiations with the European Union about the future relationship reach a crucial stage.

"Boris Johnson's job as foreign secretary was to convince the world that Brexit did not mean Britain's withdrawal from global affairs. It is a task that few historians will conclude Mr Johnson achieved. On Monday, he was supposed to be chairing a summit in London on the Western Balkans to show the UK's continuing commitment to European security. Instead, foreign ministers tweeted their frustration at the absence of their host as he agonised about his future. This week is a moment when Britain's voice is meant to be heard - at the Nato summit in Brussels and during President Trump's visit to the UK. There is diplomacy to be done after the death of a British national from what is suspected to be a Russian nerve agent attack, a shocking event that has been overshadowed by the latest dramas over Brexit. Instead, the departure of Mr Johnson will add to the uncertainty that diplomats and politicians from overseas feel about Britain's foreign policy. Boris Johnson surveying destruction in the British Virgin Islands in the wake of Hurricane Irma When Mr Johnson was appointed two years ago, there was hope that his charm and intelligence could turn into statesmanship. Diplomats warmed to this multilingual maverick - here at last was a foreign secretary with some political star quality, who could get Britain heard on the international stage. And certainly at early international meetings, I watched as Mr Johnson was mobbed by fellow ministers seeking selfies with a tousle-haired phenomenon tipped as a future prime minister. Boris Johnson quits amid Brexit crisis Profile: Boris Johnson Boris Johnson: A history of undiplomacy But soon hope turned to disappointment. The repeated gaffes and inappropriate remarks often undermined any progress Mr Johnson made with Britain's allies and opponents. There were thejokes about dead bodies in Libyaand therecitation of inappropriate verses by Rudyard Kipling in Myanmar. And there was hisinaccurate suggestion that the detained British Iranian national Nazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe had been in Iran training journalists, which her family and supporters said had damaged their campaign to secure her release. Boris Johnson during a press conference in Libya in 2017 Of course, some of the jokes worked and some politicians overseas warmed to the entertaining foreign minister from Britain. There were times when Mr Johnson was an effective minister for foreign affairs. I travelled with him to Libya last year and he met the right people, said the right things, caused no offence and placed the UK firmly in the mix as an international player in that part of north Africa. There were moments in other diplomatic forums, such as meetings with Burmese officials at the United Nations, where Mr Johnson's charm kept the show on the road by sheer force of personality. But there was often frustration at the lack of substance. Foreign envoys would sometimes tell me they couldn't fill their telegrams home simply with jokes written by Boris Johnson. On one occasion, President Sisi of Egypt simply walked out of a meeting with a rather bemused foreign secretary simply because the conversation did not get beyond the pleasantries. Boris Johnson with Russia's Sergei Lavrov in Moscow in December 2017 Above all, Mr Johnson struggled to set out clearly what the government's ""global Britain"" foreign policy actually meant. His focus on women's education and saving elephants rarely formed part of a bigger picture. What is Britain's response to the rise of countries such as China and India? What is Britain's thinking on the long term pressures of migration from sub-Saharan Africa, where a demographic explosion is expected in coming decades? What is the solution to the government's contradictory policy towards the conflict in Yemen, where Britain sells arms to one side, Saudi Arabia, while giving foreign aid to the other, the civilians left injured and hungry by the fighting? What is Britain's approach to issues such as Syria and North Korea? These are all questions that still require answers. And that is on top of the questions posed by Brexit and Britain's uncertain relationship with an increasingly independent-minded United States led by Donald Trump. The former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt tweeted on Monday that Britain ""used to be a nation providing leadership to the world - now, it can't even provide leadership to itself"". British diplomats would challenge such a sweeping assertion and cite the way the UK convinced 28 countries to expel 150 Russian diplomats after the Salisbury nerve agent attack as an example of global leadership. But the question remains: what is British foreign policy? And it is a question that Boris Johnson's successor will have to answer.

"Theresa May has launched a reshuffle of her top team after a string of resignations over her Brexit strategy plunged her government into crisis. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been named as the new foreign secretary after Boris Johnson quit, accusing Mrs May of pursuing a ""semi-Brexit"". His departure followed that of Brexit Secretary David Davis and several junior figures. Culture Secretary Matt Hancock replaces Mr Hunt as health secretary. Live: Reaction as Johnson and Davis quit Brexit dream dying, Johnson tells May The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU afterwards. There have been differences within the Conservative Party over what shape Brexit should take - although on Friday, at the prime minister's country retreat at Chequers, the cabinet reached  a ""collective"" agreement on proposals for the future relationship between the EU and UK. In his first comments as foreign secretary, Mr Hunt said he would be standing ""four square"" behind the prime minister ""so that we can get through an agreement with the European Union based on what was agreed by the Cabinet last week at Chequers. ""This is a time when the world is looking at us as a country, wondering what type of country we are going to be in a post-Brexit world. ""What I want to say to them is Britain is going to be a dependable ally, a country that stands up for the values that matter to the people of this country, and will be a strong confident voice in the world."" Mr Johnson said in his resignation letter that Mrs May's proposals for post-Brexit trade would leave Britain a ""colony"" of the EU. The Brexit ""dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt"", he said. Instead, ""we appear to be heading for a semi-Brexit, with large parts of the economy still locked in the EU system, but with no UK control over that system."" Mrs May said she was ""sorry - and a little surprised"" by Mr Johnson's move after his apparent support on Friday. She said the deal agreed by the cabinet after their ""productive discussions"" would ""honour the result of the referendum"" and allow the UK to ""take back control of our borders, our law and our money"". Boris Johnson's resignation letter and May's reply in full The prime minister earlier faced down backbench critics at a meeting of the 1922 committee, amid rumours they were close to getting the 48 signatures needed to trigger a no-confidence vote that could have removed her as prime minister. Jeremy Hunt, who has been health secretary for the past six years and recently secured a Â£20bn boost in funding for the NHS, was a Remain campaigner in the 2016 EU referendum. He has since said he is a convert to the Brexit cause. His appointment follows the promotion of staunch Leave supporter Dominic Raab to the cabinet as Brexit secretary - but the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said most of the top jobs in government were now held by ministers who had backed Remain. There are potentially dozens of Tory rebels who want to halt Mrs May's Chequers compromise but it is not clear how committed they are, added our correspondent, and Monday's resignations might have left her with a more pliable and supportive cabinet. Her future now depends on how Brussels reacts to her Brexit proposals - and what Mr Davis and Mr Johnson plan to do next, she added. This video can not be played David Davis explains why he resigned Both men had signed up on Friday to Mrs May's blueprint for Brexit - but 48 hours later, first Mr Davis and then Mr Johnson said they could not commit themselves to promoting the plans as they did not believe in them. Brexit minister Steve Baker and two ministerial aides also resigned.

"Brussels was not worried about David Davis (far right) leaving; the possibility Olly Robbins (far left) might depart was far more concerning David Davis's resignation was met with a collective shrug of the shoulders in Brussels on Monday. ""How can we miss a man who was never here?"", one EU source commented to me. The Brexit secretary made one visit to Brussels in the last four months. A far more familiar face here is Olly Robbins, the prime minister's Europe adviser. The EU is reassured that he's staying in his post - for now. But the mood in Brussels - especially after hearing this afternoon that Boris Johnson too was gone - is far from blasÃ©. The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said Europe was deeply troubled not by British cabinet resignations, but by Brexit itself. ""Politicians come and go,"" he said. ""But the problems they have created for the people remain. The mess caused by Brexit is the biggest problem in the history of EU-UK relations. And it is still very far from being solved."" A sense of unease hangs heavy. Is it really leaving? 'I don't think so,' says Davis Profile of the ex-foreign secretary Brexit: All you need to know ""Theresa May is respected in Europe,"" one contact told me. ""But so many times since this Brexit process began, we've had to ask ourselves: will she stay or will she go? And now here we are again."" Political uncertainty in Britain makes the possibility of a no-deal Brexit seem far more likely in the eyes of Brussels bureaucrats. Not because either side want it, but because time for EU-UK negotiations - as the European Commission never tires of repeating - is simply running out. Boris Johnson also stepped down, making the possibility of a no-deal Brexit seem a little closer And if the prime minister does indeed survive, what then? Most EU sources I spoke to believe she will. One compared the prime minister to Germany's Angela Merkel and said both women were consistently under-estimated. Listen to Theresa May's impassioned address to Parliament today - promising a return to UK sovereignty after Brexit, yet simultaneously keeping close ties to Europe (no country with an EU association agreement has so far avoided signing up to binding relations), with frictionless trade and a close customs relationship that is not a customs union (honest), while remaining free to strike the UK's own trade deals. The EU is holding fire for now on her plan. Brexit misconceptions - as seen from Brussels EU wonders if Theresa May has run out of 'Brexit fudge' Brexit: Why Brussels seems relaxed about the end game Leaders are mindful of not wanting to further weaken Theresa May at home by rushing forward with their manifold objections - but it's just a matter of time. The next Brexit negotiating round is pencilled in for a week today. Now, Downing Street believes that the hot water the prime minister is in today will shock EU leaders into realising they need to start compromising themselves - not just perpetually demanding capitulations on the UK's red lines. Privately, key EU figures admit there will be some give from Brussels - eventually. But how much? Certainly not what would be needed to make Theresa May's proposed third way for Brexit work as she currently presents it. Brussels is quietly confident Theresa May will survive this crisis ""On the one hand, it's true what Downing Street says,"" one EU source told me. ""The UK is bigger than Norway and strategically, politically and economically more important to us than Switzerland, yes. But EU countries benefit more from keeping their club - the single market and customs union - intact, than they would do by compromising everything just for the sake of better bilateral relations with the UK after Brexit. You can forget it."" The EU definitely expects more concessions from Theresa May in negotiations if she wants what she describes as a deep and special partnership post Brexit. But the bottom line in Brussels is: hard or soft, Brexit must be done in time. Whether Theresa May or another is at the helm in the UK, EU diplomats say they need a leader who has to power to make a deal in Brussels and see it through back home. Otherwise, they believe a disorderly no-deal Brexit beckons - with all the consequences they think that will have in the UK and across the EU.

"Dear Theresa It is more than two years since the British people voted to leave the European Union on an unambiguous and categorical promise that if they did so they would be taking back control of their democracy. They were told that they would be able to manage their own immigration policy, repatriate the sums of UK cash currently spent by the EU, and, above all, that they would be able to pass laws independently and in the interests of the people of this  country. Brexit should be about opportunity and hope. It should be a chance to do things differently, to be more nimble and dynamic, and to maximise the particular advantages of the UK as an open, outward-looking global economy. That dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt. We have postponed crucial decisions - including the preparations for no deal, as I argued in my letter to you of last November - with the result that we appear to be heading for a semi-Brexit, with large parts of the economy still locked in the EU system, but with no UK control over that system. It now seems that the opening bid of our negotiations involves accepting that we are not actually going to be able to make our own laws. Indeed we seem to have gone backwards since the last Chequers meeting in February, when I described my frustrations, as Mayor of London, in trying to protect cyclists from juggernauts. We had wanted to lower the cabin windows to improve visibility; and even though such designs were already on the market, and even though there had been a horriï¬c spate of deaths, mainly of female cyclists, we were told that we had to wait for the EU to legislate on the matter. Brexit dream dying, Johnson says as he resigns Raab replaces Davis as new Brexit secretary Brexit: All you need to know So at the previous Chequers session we thrashed out an elaborate procedure for divergence from EU rules. But even that now seems to have been taken off the table, and there is in fact no easy UK right of initiative. Yet if Brexit is to mean anything, it must surely give ministers and Parliament the chance to do things differently to protect the public. If a country cannot pass a law to save the lives of female cyclists - when that proposal is supported at every level of UK government - then I don't see how that country can truly be called independent. Conversely, the British government has spent decades arguing against this or that EU directive, on the grounds that it was too burdensome or ill-thought out. We are  now in the ludicrous position of asserting that we must accept huge amounts of precisely such EU law, without changing an iota, because it is essential for our economic health - and when we no longer have any ability to inï¬uence these laws as they are made. In that respect we are truly headed for the status of colony - and many will struggle to see the economic or political advantages of that particular arrangement. It is also clear that by surrendering control over our rulebook for goods and agrifoods (and much else besides) we will make it much more difï¬cult to do free trade deals.  And then there is the further impediment of having to argue for an impractical and undeliverable customs arrangement unlike any other in existence. What is even more disturbing is that this is our opening bid. This is already how we see the end state for the UK -  before the other side has made its counter-offer. It is as though we are sending our vanguard into battle with the white ï¬ags ï¬uttering above them. Indeed, I was concerned, looking at Friday's document, that there might be further concessions on immigration, or that we might end up effectively paying for access to the single market. On Friday I acknowledged that my side of the argument were too few to prevail, and congratulated you on at least reaching a cabinet decision on the way forward. As I said then, the government now has a song to sing. The trouble is that I have practised the words over the weekend and find that they stick in the throat. We must have collective responsibility. Since I cannot in all conscience champion these proposals, I have sadly concluded that I must go. I am proud to have served as Foreign Secretary in your government. As I step down, I would like ï¬rst to thank the patient ofï¬cers of the Metropolitan Police who have looked after me and my family, at times in demanding circumstances. I am proud too of the extraordinary men and women of our diplomatic service. Over the last few months they have shown how many friends this country has around the  world, as 28 governments expelled Russian spies in an unprecedented protest at the attempted assassination of the Skripals. They have organised a highly successful Commonwealth summit and secured record international support for this government's campaign for 12 years of quality education for every girl, and much more besides. As I leave ofï¬ce, the FCO now has the largest and by far the most  effective diplomatic network of any country in Europe â a continent which we will never leave. The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP Dear Boris, Thank you for your letter relinquishing the ofï¬ce of Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. I am sorry - and a little surprised - to receive it after the productive discussions we had at Chequers on Friday, and the comprehensive and detailed proposal which we agreed as a Cabinet. It is a proposal which will honour the result of the referendum and the commitments we made in our general election manifesto to leave the single market and the customs union. It will mean that we take back control of our borders, our laws, and our money - ending the freedom of movement, ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the United Kingdom, and ending the days of sending vast sums of taxpayers' money to the European Union. We will be able to spend that money on our priorities instead - such as the Â£20 billion increase we have announced for the NHS budget, which means that we will soon be spending an extra Â£394 million a week on our National Health Service. As I outlined at Chequers, the agreement we reached requires the full, collective support of Her Majesty's Government. During the EU referendum campaign, collective responsibility on EU policy was temporarily suspended. As we developed our policy on Brexit, I have allowed Cabinet colleagues considerable latitude to express their individual views. But the agreement we reached on Friday marks the point where that is no longer the case, and if you are not able to provide the support we need to secure this deal in the interests of the United Kingdom, it is right that you should step down. As you do so, I would like to place on record my appreciation of the service you have given to our country, and to the Conservative Party, as Mayor of London and as Foreign Secretary - not least for the passion that you have demonstrated in promoting a Global Britain to the world as we leave the European Union.

"Boris Johnson's job as foreign secretary was to convince the world that Brexit did not mean Britain's withdrawal from global affairs. It is a task that few historians will conclude Mr Johnson achieved. On Monday, he was supposed to be chairing a summit in London on the Western Balkans to show the UK's continuing commitment to European security. Instead, foreign ministers tweeted their frustration at the absence of their host as he agonised about his future. This week is a moment when Britain's voice is meant to be heard - at the Nato summit in Brussels and during President Trump's visit to the UK. There is diplomacy to be done after the death of a British national from what is suspected to be a Russian nerve agent attack, a shocking event that has been overshadowed by the latest dramas over Brexit. Instead, the departure of Mr Johnson will add to the uncertainty that diplomats and politicians from overseas feel about Britain's foreign policy. Boris Johnson surveying destruction in the British Virgin Islands in the wake of Hurricane Irma When Mr Johnson was appointed two years ago, there was hope that his charm and intelligence could turn into statesmanship. Diplomats warmed to this multilingual maverick - here at last was a foreign secretary with some political star quality, who could get Britain heard on the international stage. And certainly at early international meetings, I watched as Mr Johnson was mobbed by fellow ministers seeking selfies with a tousle-haired phenomenon tipped as a future prime minister. Boris Johnson quits amid Brexit crisis Profile: Boris Johnson Boris Johnson: A history of undiplomacy But soon hope turned to disappointment. The repeated gaffes and inappropriate remarks often undermined any progress Mr Johnson made with Britain's allies and opponents. There were thejokes about dead bodies in Libyaand therecitation of inappropriate verses by Rudyard Kipling in Myanmar. And there was hisinaccurate suggestion that the detained British Iranian national Nazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe had been in Iran training journalists, which her family and supporters said had damaged their campaign to secure her release. Boris Johnson during a press conference in Libya in 2017 Of course, some of the jokes worked and some politicians overseas warmed to the entertaining foreign minister from Britain. There were times when Mr Johnson was an effective minister for foreign affairs. I travelled with him to Libya last year and he met the right people, said the right things, caused no offence and placed the UK firmly in the mix as an international player in that part of north Africa. There were moments in other diplomatic forums, such as meetings with Burmese officials at the United Nations, where Mr Johnson's charm kept the show on the road by sheer force of personality. But there was often frustration at the lack of substance. Foreign envoys would sometimes tell me they couldn't fill their telegrams home simply with jokes written by Boris Johnson. On one occasion, President Sisi of Egypt simply walked out of a meeting with a rather bemused foreign secretary simply because the conversation did not get beyond the pleasantries. Boris Johnson with Russia's Sergei Lavrov in Moscow in December 2017 Above all, Mr Johnson struggled to set out clearly what the government's ""global Britain"" foreign policy actually meant. His focus on women's education and saving elephants rarely formed part of a bigger picture. What is Britain's response to the rise of countries such as China and India? What is Britain's thinking on the long term pressures of migration from sub-Saharan Africa, where a demographic explosion is expected in coming decades? What is the solution to the government's contradictory policy towards the conflict in Yemen, where Britain sells arms to one side, Saudi Arabia, while giving foreign aid to the other, the civilians left injured and hungry by the fighting? What is Britain's approach to issues such as Syria and North Korea? These are all questions that still require answers. And that is on top of the questions posed by Brexit and Britain's uncertain relationship with an increasingly independent-minded United States led by Donald Trump. The former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt tweeted on Monday that Britain ""used to be a nation providing leadership to the world - now, it can't even provide leadership to itself"". British diplomats would challenge such a sweeping assertion and cite the way the UK convinced 28 countries to expel 150 Russian diplomats after the Salisbury nerve agent attack as an example of global leadership. But the question remains: what is British foreign policy? And it is a question that Boris Johnson's successor will have to answer.

"Boris Johnson served as foreign secretary for nearly two years Boris Johnson's resignation as foreign secretary over Theresa May's Brexit policy will delight some Conservatives and dismay others - but does not come as too great a shock. The former London mayor and prominent Leave campaigner has been at odds with Mrs May's vision for Brexit for some time and has not been shy of saying so in public, leading many to wonder why he has not been sacked before now. In May, he called Mrs May's proposals for a post-Brexit customs partnership ""crazy"". Last month, he told Conservative donors the prime minister needed to show ""more guts"" in talks with Brussels and suggested US President Donald Trump could do a better job. Boris Johnson quits amid Brexit crisis Brexit plan 'best chance of proper exit' Raab replaces Davis as Brexit secretary More recently, he warned of a ""bog roll"" Brexit - which, rather than the clean break from the EU that many Tories want to see, would instead represent a departure that was ""soft, yielding and infinitely long"". Then, on Sunday, he was quoted as condemning Mrs May's Brexit proposals - agreed by her cabinet at a day-long meeting at Chequers - in colourful and crude terms. He claimed defending the plans was like ""polishing a turd"" - but nevertheless appeared to fall into line with the rest of her ministerial team, as they united behind her, with friends saying he was staying in the cabinet to fight for the kind of Brexit he wanted. He did not comment publicly, however, in contrast to fellow Brexiteer Michael Gove, who mounted a defence of the PM on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, saying her plans were the best option for a clean exit from the EU. Mr Johnson's hand may have been forced by the resignation of Brexit secretary David Davis, who said Mrs May's plans were a ""compromise too far"". As the figurehead of the Leave campaign, his political fortunes are seen as being inextricably linked to the government's ability to deliver a Brexit which satisfies the 17.4 million people who voted to leave in the 2016 referendum. Michael Gove and Boris Johnson - friends turned enemies turned allies? His frontline political career was widely assumed to be over when Theresa May surprised Westminster by appointing him as foreign secretary on taking office in July 2016. Known for his gaffes and love of the limelight, many wondered how he would cope with the diplomatic niceties of his new role. Boris Johnson: A history of undiplomacy He was not directly involved in the negotiations over the UK's exit from the EU. Instead, he has spent most of his time banging the drum for Britain abroad and dealing with crises such as Syria and Russia. However, he has still been a thorn in Mrs May's side. Boris Johnson has long hoped to follow David Cameron into Downing Street He has regularly popped up to issue warnings in Brexit-supporting newspapers about the risk of backsliding on key issues, such as the role of the European Court of Justice, the length of any transition period and the freedom to diverge from EU regulations and standards. In the run-up to Mrs May's key Florence speech last October, he seemed to set out his own ""red lines"" for the negotiations, prompting the first of many calls from pro-European Tories for him to be dismissed. As keeper of the Brexit flame, he has exploited the licence that cabinet divisions and uncertainty over UK policy have given him and others to speak out. He has been a frequent critic of the Treasury, claiming its fears about short-term economic disruption are blinding officials to the longer-term opportunities. And he has vigorously stuck by the idea of a Brexit dividend for the UK, repeating the controversial and disputed referendum claim there could be Â£350m a week in extra cash for the NHS. The prime minister has resisted calls from the opposition and some on her own side to sack Mr Johnson over his increasingly off-message comments. Her critics said this shows her weakness, as the leader of a deeply divided government without a Commons majority.  It may have reflected a nervousness about what Mr Johnson, who remains popular with many party members, might do on the backbenches. The 54-year Eton and Oxford-educated former political journalist has harboured ambitions of getting the top job for many years, but was beaten to No 10 by his contemporary David Cameron. When the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip - who was born in New York and until recently held dual US-UK citizenship - finally got his chance to succeed his friend and rival in the summer of 2016, the prize was snatched away from him in the most dramatic fashion. His campaign manager and fellow Leave supporter Michael Gove abandoned him at the eleventh-hour during the leadership contest, questioning his suitability for the job, and put himself forward instead. Mr Johnson duly withdrew from the leadership race, a move which angered some of his supporters who questioned whether he had the stomach for the fight. His critics say his ambition trumps his principles, most recently when he flew to Afghanistan rather than take part in a vote on the expansion of Heathrow airport, which he has vehemently opposed for many years. The question now is whether his resignation is a prelude to another leadership bid.

"The pound has fallen against the dollar and the euro after Boris Johnson resigned as Foreign Secretary. Sterling fell more than a cent against the dollar to trade at $1.3218. Against the euro, it fell back to â¬1.1253. The pound had been in positive territory after investors bet Brexit Secretary David Davis's departure meant a ""softer"" Brexit was more likely. But analysts warned sterling was likely to fall further if Mr Johnson launched a leadership challenge to Theresa May. Business Live: FTSE 100 jumps Boris Johnson quits amid Brexit crisis ""The pound can handle ministerial resignations if that's the extent of it... if it means Johnson leaving and not launching a leadership challenge,"" ING strategist Viraj Patel said. But he warned that a leadership bid by Mr Johnson would open up further uncertainty. Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, agreed that traders were now likely to be ""more cautious"". ""They are now going to start focusing far more on the potential political risks, they will focus on the possibility of a leader challenge, on broader risks in parliament,"" he said. Shares were less affected by the abrupt resignations of Mr Davis and Mr Johnson, with the FTSE 100 continuing to gain ground.  The blue-chip index - which is dominated by firms which make most of their sales overseas - closed almost 1% higher at 7,687.99. Shares often rise when sterling falls, as the weaker currency lifts the value of companies' overseas earnings when they are brought back to the UK and converted back into pounds. The resignation of two senior cabinet ministers has business leaders worried that a government which managed to settle over the weekend on a soft form of Brexit could topple. But markets aren't panicking. The pound had a bit of a wobble after Boris Johnson's announcement - and the stock market gained as the multinationals that make up the FTSE 100 see their foreign earnings increase in pound terms when sterling falls. But both moves were not sharp enough to suggest investors are expecting the government to fall. The resignations of the two heavyweight Cabinet ministers comes just days after Mrs May secured senior ministers' agreement at Chequers for a Brexit plan, which she said was the basis of a ""responsible and credible"" offer to restart renegotiations with the EU. But Mr Davis had warned that the plan meant that the UK was giving ""too much away, too easily"".

"The 12 boys were all rescued and taken to hospital On 23 June, 12 boys and their football coach walked into a cave after football practice in northern Thailand. The boys, who are part of the Moo Pa - or Wild Boars - football team, became trapped when heavy rains flooded the Tham Luang cave and cut off their escape route. All 12 boys and their coach have been freed from the cave. Few details about the group have been released. Here is what we know about the boys and their coach: Chanin Vibulrungruang (Nickname: Titan), 11 The youngest in the team, who played as a forward. Titan started playing football at age seven before joining his school's sports club. He was later invited to join the Wild Boars football club. Panumas Sangdee (Nickname: Mig), 13 According to Nopparat Kantawong, the head coach of the football team, Mig is bigger than other kids his age, but he is agile. He is a defender for the Wild Boars. Duganpet Promtep (Nickname: Dom), 13 Striker, and captain of the Wild Boars, Dom has reportedly been scouted by several professional clubs in Thailand. He is said to be a motivator and respected by his team for his football skills. ""Players on the field need a captain like this because sometimes the coach can't get in to solve their problems,"" Nopparat told the BBC. How risky is the Thai boys rescue? The cave rescue as it happened The Brits who helped find the boys Adul Sam-on, 14 Adul was born in Myanmar's self-governing Wa State and left his family behind to get a better education in Thailand, according to reports. The left defender speaks Thai, Burmese, Chinese and English, and was the only one able to communicate with the British divers when the group was first discovered. Boys and parents send letters of love While trapped in the cave, the boys and their relatives exchanged letters, carried by the rescue divers. Adul told his parents he missed them and not to worry. ""Mum and Dad want to see your face,"" his parents wrote. ""Mum and Dad pray for you and your friends, so we can see each other soon."" Adul is also a talented volleyball player - and part of a local team that came second in all of northern Thailand two years in a row, local teacher Bunjob Chai-arm told the BBC. Somepong Jaiwong (Nickname: Pong), 13 ""Pong is a cheerful boy, he likes football, and every sport. He dreams of becoming a footballer for the Thai national team,"" his teacher Manutsanun Kuntun told AFP. The left winger wrote to his parents from inside the cave, saying: ""I love Dad and Mum. Don't worry about me, I'm safe."" His parents replied: ""Take good care of yourself and be strong - Dad, Mum and everyone are waiting for you."" Mongkol Booneiam (Nickname: Mark), 12 or 13 Mark has been described by his teacher as a ""very respectful"" boy. ""He's cheerful, energetic, very friendly, and likes football and volleyball,"" Bunjob Chai-arm told the BBC. Mark and his mother had moved to Thailand from Myanmar, he added. He plays in the same volleyball team as Adul. His father Thinnakorn Boonpiem told AFP that his son is a ""good boy"" who loves to study - almost as much as football. Nattawut Takamrong (Nickname: Tern), 14 In a letter to his parents, Tern told them not to worry about him. The defender wrote that he missed his parents and grandparents, but ""Tern can take care of myself"". ""Dad and mum are not angry at you and do not blame you,"" his parents replied, adding that they were waiting for him ""in front of the cave."" Peerapat Sompiangjai (Nickname: Night), 17 Night plays as right winger on the team. He went missing on his birthday and his parents say they are still waiting to hold his party. According to reports, the boys went into the cave to celebrate Night's birthday. They were said to have brought treats and snacks along with them. These supplies probably helped sustain the group in the many days spent trapped inside the cave. Sittthisak Sawanrak, who goes to the same cycling club as Night, describes him as ""a great lad who just loves to cycle and play football"". ""He's a quiet boy - doesn't talk much, but a very good, polite boy,"" he told the BBC. In a letter to his parents from the cave, Night wrote: ""Night loves everyone"" and drew several hearts. Ekarat Wongsukchan (Nickname: Bew), 14 Bew is the goalkeeper of the team. In a letter to his mother, Bew promised to help her sell things at her shop once he was rescued. Prajak Sutham (Nickname: Note), 15 Note has been described by family friends as a ""smart, quiet guy who loves sport and supports Chiang Rai United"". Family friend Ponrawee Tachavandee told the BBC he was ""shocked"" when he learned Note was trapped. ""I didn't expect he would go inside the cave."" Rinlinee Sombat, who works in the same garage as Note's father, describes him as  a kind boy who takes care of his two-year-old sister, and enjoys playing with her young son. ""He's a smart kid - when you teach him how to fix something in the garage, he'll learn how to do it after just one go,"" she told the BBC. Pipat Pho (Nickname: Nick), 15 In his letter, Nick told his parents he wants to go for Mookatha, or Thai barbeque, when he comes out of the cave. ""Nick loves Mum, Dad and siblings,"" he wrote, alongside a drawing of a heart. Pornchai Kamluang (Nickname: Tee), 16 Tee is a defender for the Wild Boars. ""Don't worry, I'm very happy"", said Tee in a letter to his parents. This video can not be played The mood was tense as people waited for news of the high-risk operation Assistant coach Ekapol Chantawong (Nickname: Ake), 25 Ake was reportedly born in Myanmar and lost his parents at a young age. Before becoming a football coach, he spent several years as a Buddhist monk, and learnt how to conserve energy by restricting movements and meditating. According to local news reports, he taught these techniques to the boys in the cave. In his letter, Ake apologised to the parents for taking the boys into the cave network, but several replied to say they did not blame him. ""I promise I will take care of the kids as best as I can,"" Ake wrote. The group of boys and their coach were found after nine days Some media reports suggest that when the group was found Ake was the weakest, having refused to eat any of the food they had brought with them, giving it instead to the boys. His note also included a message to both his aunt and grandmother, informing them that he was ""fine"". ""Do not worry too much about me. Take good care of your health,"" he wrote, adding: ""Please prepare vegetable juice and pork rind for me. I'll have them when I can get out. Thanks.""

"Nigel Farage has been widely criticised for posting a photo of himself holding a protected species of shark. The UKIP MEP tweeted a picture of him on a boat with a tope shark, along with the caption: ""Depressed over Brexit. Went fishing."" TV presenter Ben Fogle, a UN wildlife patron, was one of hundreds to tweet criticism of Mr Farage for his actions. Mr Farage told the BBC the animal, caught in the English Channel, was ""returned alive"" to the water. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Theresa May pays tribute to the two ministers who resigned Boris Johnson has launched a scathing attack on Theresa May's Brexit strategy, saying the ""dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt"". In his letter resigning as foreign secretary, he said the prime minister was leading the UK into a ""semi-Brexit"" with the ""status of a colony"". His resignation came hours after Brexit Secretary David Davis quit the cabinet. Mrs May said she was ""sorry - and a little surprised"" by Mr Johnson's move after his apparent support on Friday. She said the deal agreed by the cabinet after their ""productive discussions"" at Chequers would ""honour the result of the referendum"" and allow the UK to ""take back control of our borders, our law and our money"". Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been named as Mr Johnson's replacement as foreign secretary, with Matt Hancock as the new health secretary.

She earlier faced her critics at a packed meeting of backbench Conservative MPs, many of whom share Mr Johnson's concerns about her Brexit stance. Loud applause could be heard at the end of the 1922 Committee meeting, which the PM attended for just over an hour. Leaving the gathering, leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said he did not think there would be a confidence vote over Mrs May. But ministerial aide Chris Green resigned his position as a parliamentary private secretary to the Department for Transport after the meeting, saying in a letter to Mrs May that she had confirmed his fears that ""we would not really leave the EU"" under her proposals. Mr Johnson's parliamentary private secretary Conor Burn has also stepped down. Brexit minister Steve Baker also left the government. Housing minister Dominic Raab has replaced Mr Davis as Brexit secretary. Mr Johnson does not pull any punches, saying Brexit ""should be about opportunity and hope"" and a ""chance to do things differently"", but ""that dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt"". He claims crucial decisions have been postponed, including preparations for a ""no-deal"" scenario, ""with the result that we appear to be heading for a semi-Brexit, with large parts of the economy still locked in the EU system, but with no UK control over that system"". Boris Johnson's resignation letter in full In her letter accepting his resignation, the prime minister said she had allowed cabinet ministers ""considerable latitude to express their individual views"" on Brexit. ""But the agreement we reached on Friday marks the point where that is no longer the case and if you are not able to provide the support we need to secure this deal in the interests of the United Kingdom, it is right that you should step down."" The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU afterwards. There have been differences within the Conservatives over how far the UK should prioritise the economy by compromising on issues such as leaving the remit of the European Court of Justice and ending free movement of people. Mrs May only has a majority in Parliament with the support of the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, so any split raises questions about whether her plan could survive a Commons vote. She took her entire cabinet to her country residence on Friday to try to get agreement on a UK vision for post-Brexit relations. An agreement was announcedafter the 12-hour meeting, but many Brexiteers have been unhappy with the deal which they think will lead to the ""worst of both worlds"". Read Laura's full blog on Boris Johnson resigning Profile: Boris Johnson This video can not be played David Davis explains why he resigned The man leading the UK's negotiating team, David Davis, resigned late on Sunday night, saying that he did not agree with the UK's proposals, so was the wrong person to be going into negotiations with them. He told the BBC that he thought the UK was giving away ""too much, too easily"" and predicted that the EU would be demanding more concessions in talks. Mr Davis, who had been Brexit secretary since Mrs May became prime minister in 2016, said he had made compromises since taking on the role, but this was ""one compromise too far"". Speaking in a boisterous House of Commons, Mrs May defended the Brexit plan agreed on Friday, which would see the UK agreeing a ""common rulebook"" with the EU for trading in goods, but not services, after Brexit. At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan She paid tribute to Mr Johnson's ""passion"" in championing a global Britain after Brexit and Mr Davis' work in steering through key Brexit legislation. But she told MPs: ""We do not agree on the best way to deliver our shared commitments to honour the result of the referendum."" This video can not be played PM: ""If the EU continues on this course, there is a serious risk it could lead to no deal"" Mrs May told MPs that the plan agreed by the cabinet at Chequers was the basis of a ""responsible and credible"" offer to restart renegotiations with the EU. But she warned that if the EU did not engage with her plan, there was a ""serious risk"" of the UK leaving in March 2019 without a deal in a ""disorderly"" manner. Under her proposal, a treaty would be signed committing the UK to ""continued harmonisation"" with EU rules - avoiding friction at the UK-EU border, including Northern Ireland. But Parliament would oversee the UK's trade policy and have the ability to ""choose"" to diverge from the EU rules. Freedom of movement would come to an end but a ""mobility framework"" would ensure UK and EU citizens can continue to study and work in each other's territories. Reality Check: What's the EU common rulebook? Brexit: All you need to know Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Johnson and Mr Davis had abandoned a ""sinking ship"", shattering the ""illusion of unity"" initially surrounding the Chequers plan. There was a crisis in government, he said, adding: ""It is clear this government cannot secure a good deal for Britain."" This video can not be played The PM's recent comments about restored ""cabinet responsibility"" drew laughs in the House of Commons. Mrs May came under pressure from prominent Tory Brexiteers on the backbenches, with ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith urging her to rule out further concessions during the talks. The European Commission declined to comment on the resignations but Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said he hoped a change in faces might lead to a change in policy.

Brussels fears UK turmoil may lead to no-deal Brexit The UK and the EU have been negotiating Brexit terms for more than a year now and have been hoping to agree broad aims for their future relationship in October. The aim of the Chequers away day had been to agree the UK position - after two years of discussion - but the resignations have put a question mark over that. The uncertainty in the UK comes before the plan is officially put to the EU, who may well be unhappy with aspects of it they have previously referred to as ""cherry picking"". One other element of Friday's agreement worth noting is that it pledged to speed up preparations for the UK to be ready to leave the EU without a Brexit deal in March next year. Nigel Farage has said he will consider standing for the UKIP leadership for a fourth time when it becomes vacant in March next year, if Brexit is not ""back on track"" and the Chequers agreement still stands. He backed Mr Johnson, saying the former foreign secretary had the chance to ""save Brexit"" by moving against the prime minister.

"Migrant families in McAllen, Texas wait to be processed A US judge has given the Trump administration more time to reunite migrant children aged five or younger with their parents. The decision came after a government lawyer said more than half of the 102 young children may be back with parents by the original deadline of Tuesday. They are among more than 2,300 children separated from parents prosecuted for illegally crossing the border. The adults say they have fled poverty and gang violence in Central America. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said that after viewing a list of the 102 children under the age of five in the government's care, ""it appears likely that less than half will be reunited"" by the 10 July deadline. However, during a hearing on Monday, Department of Justice lawyer Sarah Fabian said 54 of the children should be back with their parents by Tuesday. At the hearing in San Diego Judge Dana Sabraw agreed that some cases ""will necessitate additional time"" for reunification. Immigration authorities have offered little information about reunification or what comes next. Lawyers have described migrant toddlers clambering on court desks during hearings, forced to appear in court alone while their parents are detained. Meanwhile, a federal judge in Los Angeles has rejected the Trump administration's request to allow the long-term detention of illegal immigrant children. Under a 1997 agreement, child migrants can only be detained for 20 days. Judge Dolly Gee said the administration's request to extend that limit was "" a cynical attempt"" to shift immigration policymaking to the courts. Pamela Florian, a lawyer withThe Florence Project,external, an Arizona non-profit providing legal and social services to detained immigrant families, told the BBC the family separation policy led to ""a huge increase in the number of younger children"" coming through the system. ""Now we're seeing toddlers, we're seeing babies,"" she says. Last week, the government offered the following information: 16 children have not yet been matched to parents 19 parents have already been released into the US 46 parents are being held in custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Two parents have been judged unfit for release On Twitter, immigration lawyers have shared their experiences representing young children who cannot properly explain their situation, let alone navigate legal proceedings.

Fellow Florence Project attorney Maite Garcia currently represents four- and six-year-old siblings from Mexico whose mother is in custody, awaiting her asylum hearing. The six-year-old is blind, but has been working with Ms Garcia since her younger brother is nonverbal - ""in part because he's traumatised"", according to Ms Garcia. ""She's finally understanding after many, many meetings that she risks deportation and so now she's more frightened than ever of returning. ""She's been able to confide to me that she's fleeing violence in her home country and doesn't want to return because she's afraid of, as she puts it, 'bad things happening'"". Migrant families being moved to other immigration facilities in Texas Oregon lawyer Lisa LeSage from the nonprofit Immigration Counseling Service (ICS) firm says the children often do not even know what a lawyer is. ""Often times with the young children, they might be crawling around or playing with a pen,"" Ms LeSage told the BBC of her in-court experiences. ""Even a five year old who wasn't traumatised can't always tell you their address or what their parents look like or their last names. How do you expect a child to do all that?"" ICS currently has around five children they have confirmed were separated from their parents at the border, but the numbers keep changing. ""This is not something that the kids or their parents will ever get over,"" Ms LeSage says. ""I can say across the country, we know of cases where parents have already been deported."" ""It's a horrific situation right now, there's really no other word for it."" Much of the confusion around reunification stems from the fact that adults and children go through two separate immigration systems controlled by two different agencies. Adults must go through the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) while children classified as unaccompanied minors are in the care of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). This video can not be played Cisary Reynaud has not spoken to his daughter since they were separated Judge Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges (NAIJ), has volunteered with juvenile immigration cases in Los Angeles for years. She told the BBC the current migrant crisis has exacerbated the existing challenges of handling children's cases. ""It makes it even more difficult for the attorneys and for the court to ensure fundamental fairness because we need to ensure the proper adults are involved to fully protect the child's interests,"" she says. ""These are not unaccompanied children,"" Judge Tabaddor says. ""They are turned into an unaccompanied child when separated."" She added that now, many parents are ""agreeing to whatever the government is asking for, to get their children back"".

Press Secretary Sarah Sanders later echoed Mr Trump's comments. ""Just because you don't see a judge doesn't mean you aren't receiving due process,"" Ms Sanders said. Judge Tabaddor of the NAIJ said the organisation ""respectfully disagree[s]"". ""Due process and these situations require a person to present their case before an independent decision maker,"" she says. ""Once they're here and they express a fear of going back, they are entitled to come before an immigration judge."" An El Salvadorean migrant and his 10-year-old son were reunited last month after being separated while he was detained Ms Garcia called any rollback on due process protections ""a step in the wrong direction"". ""Reunification is absolutely important. We advocate for the release of these families together - not family detention,"" she says. ""However, all of that shouldn't be more important than returning them to their countries without due process and without access to counsel."" Since immigration cases are civil cases, legal counsel is not automatically provided. For migrants, finding legal representation can be next to impossible without help from non-profit organisations. A Honduran mother and her two-year-old daughter wait on the Mexico side of the border after being denied entry into the US Judge Tabaddor says if immigration cases for children are pushed through before reunification, parents could unintentionally lose legal rights to their child. ""If the child ends up having to go through official foster care guardianship through the special immigrant juvenile visa, one of the things that has to be demonstrated is abandonment, abuse or neglect. If the court finds that, then the parent-child relationship is severed, at least for immigration purposes."" But staff at the Florence Project told the BBC it's still too early to worry about court rulings. For now, ensuring migrant families have access to legal counsel and trauma care are the primary concerns.

"Nigel Farage has been widely criticised for posting a photo of himself holding a protected species of shark. The UKIP MEP tweeted a picture of him on a boat with a tope shark, along with the caption: ""Depressed over Brexit. Went fishing."" TV presenter Ben Fogle, a UN wildlife patron, was one of hundreds to tweet criticism of Mr Farage for his actions. Mr Farage told the BBC the animal, caught in the English Channel, was ""returned alive"" to the water. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tope sharks are listed as ""vulnerable"" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List. While it is legal for anglers in English, Scottish and Welsh waters to catch them, it is illegal for tope sharks to be kept or brought back to shore. Endangered sharks found mutilated in Northern Ireland Great white shark spotted off the coast of Majorca The Blue Planet Society said it was ""depressed"" that people were catching threatened species and ""using them to get attention on social media"". Conservative MP Ross Thomson said he ""really"" hoped Mr Farage had complied with the law. Meanwhile, conservationists the Shark Trust warned of the risks of handling sharks, which it said can be ""easily damaged"". A spokesman for the organisation said that when anglers catch and handle sharks it is the fish that ""faces the greater risk"" and that they should only be brought on board ""when absolutely necessary"".

"This video can not be played Coventry University is being urged to do more to tackle rubbish left by students End-of-term students leaving their homes have been accused of leaving behind piles of debris and rubbish. Residents in Birmingham, Coventry, Manchester and Leeds have complained about streets being turned into ""dumping grounds"" when students depart. Fire crews in Birmingham say the fly-tipping is a hazard - one resident in Selly Oak, a suburb popular with students, said it happened every year. A Coventry councillor said she wanted the city's university to do more. Jayne Innes said she would be pushing for the university ""to be the first point of contact when there's a problem"". ""They need to be making the first approach to the students that are causing these types of problems,"" the Labour councillor said. Midlands Live: More fish rescued as river dries out; Murder inquiry as man found with head injury The university said it received very few complaints about waste-related issues but if any arose, they should be taken to the city council and, where appropriate, the police. ""Depending on the outcome of the investigation by these bodies, students may be subject to the university's disciplinary proceedings,"" a spokesman said. The university has produced guidance to students on waste and recycling and has also linked up with the British Heart Foundation to provide clothing banks to encourage students to donate unwanted items. Councillor Neil Walshaw urged students to dispose of waste responsibly and asked people to alert councillors to problems In Leeds, the Labour councillor for Headingley and Hyde Park, Neil Walshaw, posted images of accumulating rubbish bags and urged students to dispose of their waste correctly. Headingley Greens also tweeted about the fly-tipping in the area, where many students live in term time, saying ""enough is enough"". Allow Twitter content?

"The boys who were rescued on Monday are said to be in reasonable health Divers have rescued four more boys from a vast cave system in northern Thailand on the second day of a complex operation. The Thai Navy Seals leading the rescue operation have confirmed that eight boys in total have been extracted. Four boys and their football coach remain inside the caves. Rescuers will try to free them on Tuesday. The group became trapped on 23 June after heavy rains caused flooding, and was found last week by divers. Four boys were brought out safely on Sunday, but the mission was paused overnight for air tanks to be replaced. On Monday, air ambulances were seen departing from the area around the cave system and ambulances were seen arriving at the hospital in the nearby town of Chiang Rai. The boys have not been seen in public, but have been pronounced to be in reasonable health. Who are the Thai boys trapped in a cave? How risky is the Thai boys rescue? The rescue operation is complicated by sections in the cave involving diving - sometimes in very confined spaces - and climbing. The BBC's Dan Johnson, at the scene, says it is a careful, delicate operation fraught with risk. But he adds that this daring, dangerous and complicated exercise is delivering success against difficult odds, and relief is starting to break the tension of the situation. The group of boys and their coach were found after nine days After Monday's operation had wound down for the day, rescue mission chief Narongsak Osottanakorn told reporters: ""All four boys have arrived at hospital, all are safe."" He said the second day of the operation had gone more smoothly than the first, taking two hours less as the procedure became more refined. Tuesday morning will see the start of attempts to rescue the remaining four boys and the football coach. A massive pumping operation is said to have helped lower the water level inside the cave system, making the journey in and out easier than it was. The Thai authorities say the rescued boys are able to eat rice porridge, although their request for a favourite pork dish has been turned down until their digestive systems recover from 10 days without food. The government is strictly controlling information about the rescue. The names of the boys who got out have not been released, and even their parents have not been allowed to see them - for health reasons, say Thai officials. By Martin Patience, Chiang Rai Outside the hospital where the boys were being received, there was a heavy police and media presence. Early in the afternoon, the sound of a helicopter thudded overhead. It was a sign that the rescue operation was going to plan. A few minutes later, a convoy with an ambulance swept through the streets and swung into the hospital entrance. It was carrying the first boy rescued on Monday. Then as dusk was falling, a small crowd of locals gathered outside the hospital. Word was filtering out that more boys had been rescued. People were straining to catch a glimpse of the unfolding drama. It came in the form of the flashing lights of three more ambulances - signifying the rescue of three more boys. The rescue operation will resume on Tuesday. It is not yet over and is still fraught with danger. But people here are daring to believe what seemed impossible a little over a week ago - that all the boys and their coach will come out of the cave alive. A team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - has been working in the cave system. They have been guiding the boys through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the Tham Luang cave system. This video can not be played Child psychiatrist: ""It will be a challenge for these children to go back to normal life"" Getting to and from where the boys are has been an exhausting round trip, even for the experienced divers. The operation in pictures 'I am dying to see him. I miss my son' Letters of love from trapped Thai boys The process includes a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes already in place. Wearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy is being accompanied by two divers, who also carry his air supply. The toughest part is about halfway out at a section named ""T-Junction"", which is so tight the divers have to take off their air tanks to get through. Beyond that a cavern - called Chamber 3 - has been turned into a forward base for the divers. There the boys can rest before making the last, easier walk out to the entrance. They are then taken to hospital in Chiang Rai. In an indication of how dangerous the journey can be,a former Thai navy diver diedin the caves on Friday. Saman Gunan was returning from a mission to provide the group with air tanks when he ran out of oxygen. He lost consciousness and could not be revived. His colleagues said they would ""not let the sacrifice of our friend go to waste"". This video can not be played Wife and father remember 'hero' Thai diver: ""He loved helping others"" Some details have emerged of members of the team and their coach. Captain Duganpet Promtep, 13, is described as a motivator and highly respected by his teammates. He had apparently been scouted by several Thai professional clubs.

It was 17-year-oldPeerapat Sompiangjai's birthday when the group became trapped in the cave.  The snacks the boys brought with them to celebrate are likely to have helped them survive their ordeal. Assistant coachEkapol Chantawong,25, was said to be the weakest of the group when they were found, as he reportedly refused to eat any of the food and gave it instead to the boys. Read more about the team The boys were found inside the cave by British rescue divers a week ago, about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth. Aged between 11 and 17, they belong to a football club called the Wild Boars, and became trapped during an excursion with their coach.

"This video can not be played Rescue diver in Thai cave: ""I was very scared"" Nineteen divers have entered the Tham Luang cave in northern Thailand on a gruelling, hazardous mission to rescue those people still trapped inside. They extracted a ninth boy on Tuesday, the Thai Navy said, with reports suggesting two more. If confirmed, one child and an adult remain to be rescued, bringing to a close an epic operation marred by one diver's death. Eight boys rescued earlier are said to be in good mental and physical health. The group, a football team, had got stuck deep inside on 23 June after heavy rains caused flooding. After they were found by divers last week, huddled in darkness on a ledge and cut off from the outside world for nine days, the race began to get them out before the weather deteriorated even further. The boys evacuated so far have undergone X-rays and blood tests. They will remain under observation in hospital for at least seven days. Latest on the cave rescue Who are the Thai boys trapped in a cave? How risky is the Thai boys rescue? A doctor and Thai Navy Seal divers have been looking after those still on the ledge, about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave's mouth. It kicked off just after 10:00 local time (03:00 GMT) when the 19 divers made their way into the cave. Rain was falling but rescuers say the water level inside the cave is similar to that on Sunday, the first day of the operation, an official said. Thai Navy SEALs confirmed a ninth child had been brought out at 16:06,external. Helicopter and ambulance activity in the cave area, from which the media have been barred, suggests that at least two more members of the Wild Boars football team were rescued and were being ferried to hospital.

By Michelle Roberts, BBC News After the boys had spent so long in the cold and dark with poor ventilation and relatively little to eat and drink, there were concerns that they would be in a far worse state. Now that they are dry, warm and in safe care, full medical assessments can be done. None of the first eight has a fever - a sign of a possible infection - although two have needed antibiotic treatment for suspected lung infections. Doctors will be checking for any infections, such as ""caver's disease"", a lung disease caused by a fungus that grows in bat droppings. They will also make sure any cuts and scrapes that the boys have on their skin are clean and healing nicely. The boys remain in quarantine, meaning their parents will not be allowed any physical contact. This is partly to protect the boys from unnecessary infections until they regain their strength, as well as to prevent them passing on anything they might have picked up in the wet cave. They will need to build up their muscles and their immunity, as well as get used to living in the outside world again. For now, they wear shades to protect their eyes from the bright light. The first group of four boys was rescued on Sunday, followed by four more on Monday. The boys, aged between 11 and 17, became trapped with their coach on 23 June Some of the boys had low temperatures, with one showing a low heart rate when they were first taken to hospital, but they have now recovered. ""All eight are in good health, no fever... everyone is in a good mental state,"" Jesada Chokedamrongsuk, permanent secretary of the public health ministry, said at a news conference. The boys are currently being treated at the Chiang Rai Prachanukroh hospital Health officials say they were at first given instant food and energy gels but are now eating easy-to-digest food. They also say some of the boys have now seen their parents - but only through glass. Further test results are expected in a few days and if all signs of infection have cleared, families will be allowed to visit. However, they must don protective clothing and cannot go closer than 2m (6ft). However, Thailand's Prime Minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, has been allowed to visit the boys. Allow Twitter content?

"Tory vice-chairs Ben Bradley and Maria Caulfield resign They are latest to go because of cabinet's Brexit plan President Trump refers to UK 'turmoil' ahead of visit Earlier PM Theresa May chaired her new-look cabinet Jeremy Hunt succeeded Boris Johnson as foreign secretary Matt Hancock succeeded Hunt as health secretary Andy McFarlane and Gavin Stamp We are drawing the curtains on the live page. It's been a busy day, so here's a recap on the main developments.  Angela Merkel welcomes the UK's Chequers agreement, saying it is a ""good thing we have proposals on the table"". The German Chancellor says the remaining 27 EU members will agree a ""common response"" once it has seen the detail of the official UK position. But she says progress is being made and repeats her stance that her country wants as close links as possible with the UK after Brexit. Theresa May is asked about Donald Trump's claims that the UK is in turmoil, ahead of his visit on Thursday, and whether the US President is a real fan of Boris Johnson. The PM does not comment directly but says she is looking forward to Mr Trump's visit, saying there is ""much to discuss"". She says the special relationship with the US is the UK's deepest and longest security and defence alliance. The two leaders, she adds, will talking about how to use this to benefit the UK and US but also enhance the wider good.  But who do these shoes belong to? The answer: British Prime Minister Theresa May, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama and Montenegro's Prime Minister Dusko Markovic. Theresa May is now speaking at the conclusion of the Western Balkans summit in central London. She says claims that, as a result of Brexit, the UK will be ""retreating"" from its role as a guarantor of peace in the region and on the continent as a whole are completely wrong. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is now speaking. Brexit is almost certain to crop up during questions.  In his letter resigning as a Tory vice-chair, Remain voter Ben Bradley writes that he was persuaded to back the Brexit vision because of the ""immense opportunities that are available from global trade, and for the ability
for Britain to be an outward looking nation in control of our own destiny once
again"". But he complains: ""I fear that this agreement at Chequers damages those opportunities; that being tied to EU regulations, and the EU tying our hands when seeking to make new trade agreements, will be the worst of all worlds if we do not deliver Brexit in spirit as well as in name. ""Then we are handing Jeremy Corbyn the keys to Number 10."" MPs have decisively rejected Liberal Democrat calls for a ""People's Vote"" on the final Brexit deal. A Commons motion put forward by Sir Vince Cable's party was defeated by 299 votes to 13 in Parliament. Aside from nine Lib Dem MPs, the other MPs to support it were Green Party leader Caroline Lucas and Plaid Cymru's three MPs. Conservative peer Lord Finkelstein, a close friend of David Cameron, takes issue with some of the arguments made by Ben Bradley or Maria Caulfield in their resignation letters. In short, he seems to be saying the UK has a choice between the Chequers compromise or no deal. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

One of Maria Caulfield's main objections had been to the backstop agreement for Northern Ireland - that's the customs arrangement designed to avoid a ""hard border"" - which she felt was ""neither necessary or
constructive for the future prosperity of the UK"". ""The policy may assuage vested interests but the voters will find out and their
representatives will be found out,"" she wrote in her resignation letter as Conservative vice-chair. ""This policy will be bad for our country and
bad for the party. The direct consequences of that will be Prime Minister
Corbyn."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, speaking in New York, added that many models of co-operation with Brussels were available to the UK, including a ""Norway"" deal, ""Norway plus"" or an ""ambitious"" version of the Canada deal, and that each deal had ""its own balance of rights and negotiations"". However, he said the UK's current red lines meant they were ""closing the door"" to many different types of co-operation. Michel Barnier, who's leading Brexit negotiations on behalf of Brussels, has said there is accord on 80% of the UK withdrawal
agreement and that the European Union was ready to start working on an ""ambitious free trade arrangement"" with the UK. Speaking
in New York, Mr Barnier said that negotiators still needed to find a solution
to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland. In
response to recent resignations in Westminster, Mr Barnier said he had a
""very cordial and frank relationship"" with David Davis and had met
""many people with different views"" during the course of the
negotiations. BBC political editor tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Paul Curran's campaign against Lindsey Goldrick Dean involved creating at least 10 websites about her, including offensive and private information A woman who was harassed for 12 years by a man she met through an online dating website is to receive damages. Paul Curran's campaign against Lindsey Goldrick Dean involved creating at least 10 websites about her containing offensive and private information. The High Court in London heard it had adversely affected her health, relationships and professional career. The court also heard Mr Curran had agreed to pay undisclosed damages to Ms Goldrick Dean and her legal costs. Ms Goldrick Dean, a former marketing consultant from Somerset, met Mr Curran, director of Curran Consulting Ltd, through a newspaper dating website in 2004. Counsel Gervase de Wilde told the court Mr Curran ""engaged in a course of conduct"" after their relationship ended in February 2005 which amounted to ""civil harassment"". Between March 2005 and August 2017 the company director created at least 10 websites, some of which were named after Ms Goldrick Dean. The sites' content caused Ms Goldrick Dean ""enormous anxiety, mental distress and embarrassment"", the court heard. In 2014, Mr Curran bought a Google banner advertisement which included a photo of Ms Goldrick Dean and a link to one of the websites. A year later, he created two Twitter accounts using her name which he used to post messages containing her photo and a website link. Mr de Wilde said the campaign - which included emails, telephone calls and posts sent to Ms Goldrick Dean, her family and friends - continued despite her complaining to police on several occasions. The police made plans to arrest Mr Curran but found that he was living outside the UK much of the time. In a statement Mr Curran, who was not in court, said he did not dispute ""the majority"" of allegations and apologised to Ms Goldrick Dean.

"Now he's gone and done it. For a long time it had been clear Boris Johnson was not happy with the prime minister's Brexit strategy. His dissatisfaction was more than just the odd off-colour remark, although goodness knows there were enough of those. His departure is a huge story and turns what might have been a couple of days of significant turmoil, into a significant crisis for Theresa May and the whole Brexit project. He was Brexit's main cheerleader, the politician most associated with making it happen, and one of the best known politicians in the country, for good or ill. Boris Johnson quits amid Brexit crisis Live: Reaction as Johnson and Davis resign It's enough of a mess on its own. But a well-connected source has just told me it could be more serious than that. They said it is a concerted push to force the prime minister to drop her Chequers compromise. ""If she doesn't drop Chequers there will be another,"" they said, ""then another, then another, then another."" But if she can't force a compromise through her party that itself took months to stitch together, the prime minister's authority would be significantly diminished. As Mr Johnson is hemmed in by paparazzi and camera crews outside his official residence that will soon be no longer his home, Theresa May is also a hostage with no obvious means of escape.

"Brussels was not worried about David Davis (far right) leaving; the possibility Olly Robbins (far left) might depart was far more concerning David Davis's resignation was met with a collective shrug of the shoulders in Brussels on Monday. ""How can we miss a man who was never here?"", one EU source commented to me. The Brexit secretary made one visit to Brussels in the last four months. A far more familiar face here is Olly Robbins, the prime minister's Europe adviser. The EU is reassured that he's staying in his post - for now. But the mood in Brussels - especially after hearing this afternoon that Boris Johnson too was gone - is far from blasÃ©. The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said Europe was deeply troubled not by British cabinet resignations, but by Brexit itself. ""Politicians come and go,"" he said. ""But the problems they have created for the people remain. The mess caused by Brexit is the biggest problem in the history of EU-UK relations. And it is still very far from being solved."" A sense of unease hangs heavy. Is it really leaving? 'I don't think so,' says Davis Profile of the ex-foreign secretary Brexit: All you need to know ""Theresa May is respected in Europe,"" one contact told me. ""But so many times since this Brexit process began, we've had to ask ourselves: will she stay or will she go? And now here we are again."" Political uncertainty in Britain makes the possibility of a no-deal Brexit seem far more likely in the eyes of Brussels bureaucrats. Not because either side want it, but because time for EU-UK negotiations - as the European Commission never tires of repeating - is simply running out. Boris Johnson also stepped down, making the possibility of a no-deal Brexit seem a little closer And if the prime minister does indeed survive, what then? Most EU sources I spoke to believe she will. One compared the prime minister to Germany's Angela Merkel and said both women were consistently under-estimated. Listen to Theresa May's impassioned address to Parliament today - promising a return to UK sovereignty after Brexit, yet simultaneously keeping close ties to Europe (no country with an EU association agreement has so far avoided signing up to binding relations), with frictionless trade and a close customs relationship that is not a customs union (honest), while remaining free to strike the UK's own trade deals. The EU is holding fire for now on her plan. Brexit misconceptions - as seen from Brussels EU wonders if Theresa May has run out of 'Brexit fudge' Brexit: Why Brussels seems relaxed about the end game Leaders are mindful of not wanting to further weaken Theresa May at home by rushing forward with their manifold objections - but it's just a matter of time. The next Brexit negotiating round is pencilled in for a week today. Now, Downing Street believes that the hot water the prime minister is in today will shock EU leaders into realising they need to start compromising themselves - not just perpetually demanding capitulations on the UK's red lines. Privately, key EU figures admit there will be some give from Brussels - eventually. But how much? Certainly not what would be needed to make Theresa May's proposed third way for Brexit work as she currently presents it. Brussels is quietly confident Theresa May will survive this crisis ""On the one hand, it's true what Downing Street says,"" one EU source told me. ""The UK is bigger than Norway and strategically, politically and economically more important to us than Switzerland, yes. But EU countries benefit more from keeping their club - the single market and customs union - intact, than they would do by compromising everything just for the sake of better bilateral relations with the UK after Brexit. You can forget it."" The EU definitely expects more concessions from Theresa May in negotiations if she wants what she describes as a deep and special partnership post Brexit. But the bottom line in Brussels is: hard or soft, Brexit must be done in time. Whether Theresa May or another is at the helm in the UK, EU diplomats say they need a leader who has to power to make a deal in Brussels and see it through back home. Otherwise, they believe a disorderly no-deal Brexit beckons - with all the consequences they think that will have in the UK and across the EU.

"Boris Johnson's job as foreign secretary was to convince the world that Brexit did not mean Britain's withdrawal from global affairs. It is a task that few historians will conclude Mr Johnson achieved. On Monday, he was supposed to be chairing a summit in London on the Western Balkans to show the UK's continuing commitment to European security. Instead, foreign ministers tweeted their frustration at the absence of their host as he agonised about his future. This week is a moment when Britain's voice is meant to be heard - at the Nato summit in Brussels and during President Trump's visit to the UK. There is diplomacy to be done after the death of a British national from what is suspected to be a Russian nerve agent attack, a shocking event that has been overshadowed by the latest dramas over Brexit. Instead, the departure of Mr Johnson will add to the uncertainty that diplomats and politicians from overseas feel about Britain's foreign policy. Boris Johnson surveying destruction in the British Virgin Islands in the wake of Hurricane Irma When Mr Johnson was appointed two years ago, there was hope that his charm and intelligence could turn into statesmanship. Diplomats warmed to this multilingual maverick - here at last was a foreign secretary with some political star quality, who could get Britain heard on the international stage. And certainly at early international meetings, I watched as Mr Johnson was mobbed by fellow ministers seeking selfies with a tousle-haired phenomenon tipped as a future prime minister. Boris Johnson quits amid Brexit crisis Profile: Boris Johnson Boris Johnson: A history of undiplomacy But soon hope turned to disappointment. The repeated gaffes and inappropriate remarks often undermined any progress Mr Johnson made with Britain's allies and opponents. There were thejokes about dead bodies in Libyaand therecitation of inappropriate verses by Rudyard Kipling in Myanmar. And there was hisinaccurate suggestion that the detained British Iranian national Nazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe had been in Iran training journalists, which her family and supporters said had damaged their campaign to secure her release. Boris Johnson during a press conference in Libya in 2017 Of course, some of the jokes worked and some politicians overseas warmed to the entertaining foreign minister from Britain. There were times when Mr Johnson was an effective minister for foreign affairs. I travelled with him to Libya last year and he met the right people, said the right things, caused no offence and placed the UK firmly in the mix as an international player in that part of north Africa. There were moments in other diplomatic forums, such as meetings with Burmese officials at the United Nations, where Mr Johnson's charm kept the show on the road by sheer force of personality. But there was often frustration at the lack of substance. Foreign envoys would sometimes tell me they couldn't fill their telegrams home simply with jokes written by Boris Johnson. On one occasion, President Sisi of Egypt simply walked out of a meeting with a rather bemused foreign secretary simply because the conversation did not get beyond the pleasantries. Boris Johnson with Russia's Sergei Lavrov in Moscow in December 2017 Above all, Mr Johnson struggled to set out clearly what the government's ""global Britain"" foreign policy actually meant. His focus on women's education and saving elephants rarely formed part of a bigger picture. What is Britain's response to the rise of countries such as China and India? What is Britain's thinking on the long term pressures of migration from sub-Saharan Africa, where a demographic explosion is expected in coming decades? What is the solution to the government's contradictory policy towards the conflict in Yemen, where Britain sells arms to one side, Saudi Arabia, while giving foreign aid to the other, the civilians left injured and hungry by the fighting? What is Britain's approach to issues such as Syria and North Korea? These are all questions that still require answers. And that is on top of the questions posed by Brexit and Britain's uncertain relationship with an increasingly independent-minded United States led by Donald Trump. The former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt tweeted on Monday that Britain ""used to be a nation providing leadership to the world - now, it can't even provide leadership to itself"". British diplomats would challenge such a sweeping assertion and cite the way the UK convinced 28 countries to expel 150 Russian diplomats after the Salisbury nerve agent attack as an example of global leadership. But the question remains: what is British foreign policy? And it is a question that Boris Johnson's successor will have to answer.

"This video can not be played 'New milk formula made my baby sick' French food giant Danone is looking into reports that its Aptamil baby milk formula is making some infants ill. Aptamil recently changed the recipe of three of its baby milk formulas. Hundreds of parents in the UK have complained on social media that the revised formula milk is making their babies sick. Danone said it had carried out extensive safety checks, but added that it was ""taking all feedback very seriously"". The food giant is now investigating the complaints and has set up a free helpline that parents can call for advice. Parents in the UK are advised to call 0800 996 1000, pressing option 0 followed by option 1. There have also been complaints that the size of the revised products has been reduced from 900g to 800g a tub, but the price remains about Â£11. The new version of the formula (left), next to the old version (right) Several mothers have told the BBC that their babies experienced upset stomachs after they started using the new version of Aptamil First Infant Milk powder (stage 1). The parents said they noticed that the milk powder did not dissolve in the bottles, leaving clumps of residue. ""It smelled different, like gone-off milk that had been left out for a day,"" Rosie Menzies, from Lymington, Hampshire, told the BBC. She said that her 11-week-old son Harry would be sick soon after feeds and began to refuse bottles, until she started using a different brand. Danone UK said: ""We would like to reassure parents that the quality and safety of our products is our number one priority.  We have recently introduced new Aptamil formulations and we recognise that some families have not found the transition to the new formula easy. ""We have undertaken extensive quality and safety checks, including clinical trials, product testing and product experience tests on these products.  The results have shown that babies take to this formula well and that it is safe. ""We have updated the mixing instructions on our packs as this new formula requires parents to mix it up slightly differently, compared to the previous formulation - specifically, shaking vigorously for 10 seconds to dissolve the powder."" Aptamil said it had changed the recipes of three products: Aptamil First Infant Milk powder (stage 1), Aptamil Follow On Milk powder (stage 2) and Aptamil Growing Up Milk powders (stages 3 & 4). When asked why the baby milk formula was changed, Danone did not immediately reply. Rebecca Heal in Larkfield, Kent, told the BBC that she complained to Aptamil about the new recipe and smaller packaging, and was told that the formula was changed because of ""scientific research and costs to cover that"". Rebecca Heal and her daughter Olivia Ms Heal, who has a three-month-old daughter Olivia, said that she tried to follow Danone's new mixing instructions, but the milk still wasn't right. ""It took a lot of effort and shaking to get it to mix properly,"" she said. ""Even after a minute or so of vigorous shaking, the milk still had gritty residue on the sides of the bottle, but just increased the amount of froth on the top as a result."" However, some parents using the revised formula posted on Aptamil's Facebook page that they had not experienced any problems. One mother, who did not want to be named, told the BBC that her four-month-old baby had successfully transitioned from breast milk to Aptamil First Infant Milk. ""There is some residue after mixing, but then I found this was was often the case with the old formula anyway,"" she said. ""Coming from a science background, I'd rather look at things analytically, than just jumping on hysteria."" Courtney Wheeldon and her son Jenson Courtney Wheeldon, based in Hull, said that her 17-week-old son Jenson, who was born prematurely, had benefited from being on the new revised formula. ""My son appears a lot more content and happy... he's putting on a lot more much-needed weight,"" she told the BBC. ""My only complaint about the new formula would be that there is 100g less in the tubs for the exact same price.""

"UKIP member Stephen Searle was elected to Suffolk County Council in 2013 A former UKIP councillor strangled his wife to death after she discovered he was having an affair with their son's partner, a court has heard. Stephen Searle, 64, denies murdering Anne Searle, who was found suffocated at their home in The Brickfields, Stowmarket, Suffolk, on 30 December. Andrew Jackson, prosecuting, said the discovery of the affair ""would have put considerable strain on the marriage"". Ipswich Crown Court jurors were told Mr Searle said he acted in self-defence. Anne Searle was found dead at home in Stowmarket minutes after police took a call from Mr Searle, the court heard Mr Jackson said Mr Searle, a former Royal Marine and Suffolk county councillor, had been working at a bowling alley with his son Gary. Gary Searle was in a relationship with his colleague Anastasia Pomiateeva and the couple ""had children but never married"", the court heard. Stephen Searle began an affair with Ms Pomiateeva in April last year and kept it hidden, but the rest of the family found out about it in June. Mr Jackson said: ""The prosecution case is that on that Saturday night [30 December] there had probably been yet another row between the two of them and in anger the defendant strangled his wife to death."" The court heard the defendant and his wife had been married for 45 years and had three sons. The prosecution said Mr Searle had trained in unarmed combat with the Royal Navy and knew how to perform a choke hold. ""It's that technique the prosecution say the defendant probably used to kill his wife,"" said Mr Jackson. He told the court the defendant had called police to say ""I've just killed my wife"" and that Mrs Searle had posted a message on Facebook which said ""Happy Christmas... I hope I will still be here in 2018. We will see"". The trial continues.

"Shane Williams' image was used on Neil Taylor's company van and website Former Wales rugby star Shane Williams says he is taking legal advice after a builder accused of substandard work used his image to promote his business. Neil Taylor, owner of TMW Roofline in Bryncethin in Bridgend county, used the star's face on his van and website. Mr Williams said Mr Taylor did some work on his house 10 years ago but he had nothing to do with the company. Mr Taylor said he had taken the star's name off his paperwork and does not mislead anyone on his website. TMW Roofline's paperwork used the rugby star's image and name The former Wales and Lions wing said: ""The agreement was [he would] do the work and I would give him a testimonial and a photograph.... and that's about as far as it goes. ""I don't work with the company, I'm not involved with the company and I certainly haven't received a penny."" An investigation by BBC Wales TV programme X-Ray found 47 photographs of building projects on Mr Taylor's company website appeared on at least one other company website and one appeared on 40 sites around the world. Lisa John and Neil Bartlett said they had to cover their ceiling with bin bags to keep out the wind A surveyor described the work Mr Taylor did for a couple in Aberkenfig as ""appalling"". Lisa John and Neil Bartlett hired him to build a new room in their garden and a small extension on the side of their house for Â£30,000. But days after making their final payment to his company, faults in the work began to show. Little Grogg version of Shane Williams worth Â£1,500 Wales legend to play for village side at Principality Stadium 'I was as nervous playing for Amman as Wales' ""We had water coming in through the ceilings and we were just constantly on the phone to him,"" said Ms John. ""He did come down and his solution - which was I think his favourite thing - was to put a big block of silicone back over the hole and tell us it was fixed."" Shane Williams says he met Neil Taylor when he did some work on his property 10 years ago The couple noticed patio tiles were loose and began having issues with their plumbing. Then in March, whenthe country was hit by days of heavy snowfall, they had snow coming in through the ceiling and had to cover it with bin bags to keep out the wind. A surveyor described the work on the roof as ""appalling"" ""He then admitted by text that he had put the wrong fittings on the side which is why we had water coming in,"" said Ms John. ""By this point we'd completely lost any faith in this man."" Surveyor Tim Davies assessed the work and said: ""I really can't find anything that is right with this roof. It's been so badly done. It's quite appalling to be honest. ""It is plain for all to see that this is an incredibly substandard work. This is lower than DIY standard."" Mr Taylor said bad weather meant work on the couple's home in Aberkenfig over-ran and he has been back on site and fixed the patio - the couple said they were still waiting for their roof to be fixed. He said he believed he worked on all the projects pictured on his company's website.

"This video can not be played Coventry University is being urged to do more to tackle rubbish left by students End-of-term students leaving their homes have been accused of leaving behind piles of debris and rubbish. Residents in Birmingham, Coventry, Manchester and Leeds have complained about streets being turned into ""dumping grounds"" when students depart. Fire crews in Birmingham say the fly-tipping is a hazard - one resident in Selly Oak, a suburb popular with students, said it happened every year. A Coventry councillor said she wanted the city's university to do more. Jayne Innes said she would be pushing for the university ""to be the first point of contact when there's a problem"". ""They need to be making the first approach to the students that are causing these types of problems,"" the Labour councillor said. Midlands Live: More fish rescued as river dries out; Murder inquiry as man found with head injury The university said it received very few complaints about waste-related issues but if any arose, they should be taken to the city council and, where appropriate, the police. ""Depending on the outcome of the investigation by these bodies, students may be subject to the university's disciplinary proceedings,"" a spokesman said. The university has produced guidance to students on waste and recycling and has also linked up with the British Heart Foundation to provide clothing banks to encourage students to donate unwanted items. Councillor Neil Walshaw urged students to dispose of waste responsibly and asked people to alert councillors to problems In Leeds, the Labour councillor for Headingley and Hyde Park, Neil Walshaw, posted images of accumulating rubbish bags and urged students to dispose of their waste correctly. Headingley Greens also tweeted about the fly-tipping in the area, where many students live in term time, saying ""enough is enough"". Allow Twitter content?

"Dear Theresa It is more than two years since the British people voted to leave the European Union on an unambiguous and categorical promise that if they did so they would be taking back control of their democracy. They were told that they would be able to manage their own immigration policy, repatriate the sums of UK cash currently spent by the EU, and, above all, that they would be able to pass laws independently and in the interests of the people of this  country. Brexit should be about opportunity and hope. It should be a chance to do things differently, to be more nimble and dynamic, and to maximise the particular advantages of the UK as an open, outward-looking global economy. That dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt. We have postponed crucial decisions - including the preparations for no deal, as I argued in my letter to you of last November - with the result that we appear to be heading for a semi-Brexit, with large parts of the economy still locked in the EU system, but with no UK control over that system. It now seems that the opening bid of our negotiations involves accepting that we are not actually going to be able to make our own laws. Indeed we seem to have gone backwards since the last Chequers meeting in February, when I described my frustrations, as Mayor of London, in trying to protect cyclists from juggernauts. We had wanted to lower the cabin windows to improve visibility; and even though such designs were already on the market, and even though there had been a horriï¬c spate of deaths, mainly of female cyclists, we were told that we had to wait for the EU to legislate on the matter. Brexit dream dying, Johnson says as he resigns Raab replaces Davis as new Brexit secretary Brexit: All you need to know So at the previous Chequers session we thrashed out an elaborate procedure for divergence from EU rules. But even that now seems to have been taken off the table, and there is in fact no easy UK right of initiative. Yet if Brexit is to mean anything, it must surely give ministers and Parliament the chance to do things differently to protect the public. If a country cannot pass a law to save the lives of female cyclists - when that proposal is supported at every level of UK government - then I don't see how that country can truly be called independent. Conversely, the British government has spent decades arguing against this or that EU directive, on the grounds that it was too burdensome or ill-thought out. We are  now in the ludicrous position of asserting that we must accept huge amounts of precisely such EU law, without changing an iota, because it is essential for our economic health - and when we no longer have any ability to inï¬uence these laws as they are made. In that respect we are truly headed for the status of colony - and many will struggle to see the economic or political advantages of that particular arrangement. It is also clear that by surrendering control over our rulebook for goods and agrifoods (and much else besides) we will make it much more difï¬cult to do free trade deals.  And then there is the further impediment of having to argue for an impractical and undeliverable customs arrangement unlike any other in existence. What is even more disturbing is that this is our opening bid. This is already how we see the end state for the UK -  before the other side has made its counter-offer. It is as though we are sending our vanguard into battle with the white ï¬ags ï¬uttering above them. Indeed, I was concerned, looking at Friday's document, that there might be further concessions on immigration, or that we might end up effectively paying for access to the single market. On Friday I acknowledged that my side of the argument were too few to prevail, and congratulated you on at least reaching a cabinet decision on the way forward. As I said then, the government now has a song to sing. The trouble is that I have practised the words over the weekend and find that they stick in the throat. We must have collective responsibility. Since I cannot in all conscience champion these proposals, I have sadly concluded that I must go. I am proud to have served as Foreign Secretary in your government. As I step down, I would like ï¬rst to thank the patient ofï¬cers of the Metropolitan Police who have looked after me and my family, at times in demanding circumstances. I am proud too of the extraordinary men and women of our diplomatic service. Over the last few months they have shown how many friends this country has around the  world, as 28 governments expelled Russian spies in an unprecedented protest at the attempted assassination of the Skripals. They have organised a highly successful Commonwealth summit and secured record international support for this government's campaign for 12 years of quality education for every girl, and much more besides. As I leave ofï¬ce, the FCO now has the largest and by far the most  effective diplomatic network of any country in Europe â a continent which we will never leave. The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP Dear Boris, Thank you for your letter relinquishing the ofï¬ce of Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. I am sorry - and a little surprised - to receive it after the productive discussions we had at Chequers on Friday, and the comprehensive and detailed proposal which we agreed as a Cabinet. It is a proposal which will honour the result of the referendum and the commitments we made in our general election manifesto to leave the single market and the customs union. It will mean that we take back control of our borders, our laws, and our money - ending the freedom of movement, ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the United Kingdom, and ending the days of sending vast sums of taxpayers' money to the European Union. We will be able to spend that money on our priorities instead - such as the Â£20 billion increase we have announced for the NHS budget, which means that we will soon be spending an extra Â£394 million a week on our National Health Service. As I outlined at Chequers, the agreement we reached requires the full, collective support of Her Majesty's Government. During the EU referendum campaign, collective responsibility on EU policy was temporarily suspended. As we developed our policy on Brexit, I have allowed Cabinet colleagues considerable latitude to express their individual views. But the agreement we reached on Friday marks the point where that is no longer the case, and if you are not able to provide the support we need to secure this deal in the interests of the United Kingdom, it is right that you should step down. As you do so, I would like to place on record my appreciation of the service you have given to our country, and to the Conservative Party, as Mayor of London and as Foreign Secretary - not least for the passion that you have demonstrated in promoting a Global Britain to the world as we leave the European Union.

"Dominic Raab is a former chief of staff to Mr Davis Dominic Raab has been appointed Brexit secretary by Theresa May after David Davis resigned from the government. Mr Raab, who is currently housing minister, was a prominent Leave campaigner during the 2016 referendum. Mr Davis quit late on Sunday night, saying Theresa May had ""given away too much too easily"". The 44-year old Mr Raab, a lawyer before becoming an MP in 2010, will now take over day-to-day negotiations with the EU's Michel Barnier. Live: Reaction to Davis exit Brexit Secretary David Davis resigns The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU afterwards. There have been differences within the Conservative Party over how far the UK should prioritise the economy by compromising on issues such as leaving the remit of the European Court of Justice and ending free movement of people. The simple question for Davis, by Laura Kuenssberg This video can not be played David Davis explains why he resigned What sticks out the most from my interview with David Davis this morning is a very simple question we asked. Is the prime minister's plan really leaving the EU? ""I don't think so,"" he said. That is the sentiment that's widely shared among the Tory party, and perhaps among many voters too. And guess what? It doesn't always matter which side of the referendum they were on either. Some former Remainers say ""look, this is a dodgy compromise, what's the point? If we are going to do this, then for goodness sake let's do it properly or just stay in"". From some Leavers, like Mr Davis, you also get ""look, this is a dodgy compromise, what's the point? If we are going to do it, then for goodness sake let's do it properly"". Read more from Laura's blog Mrs May's Conservative Party only has a majority in Parliament with the support in key votes of the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, so any split raises questions about whether her plan could survive a Commons vote - and has also led to renewed questions about whether she will face a challenge to her position. Mr Raab has served in government since after the 2015 election, initially working in the Ministry of Justice before moving to the communities department in January. The European Commission has declined to comment on the change of personnel, saying it would continue to negotiate with ""goodwill"" to try and secure an agreement on the terms of the UK's exit and future relations. Asked how much of a problem Mr Davis's resignation was for the future of the negotiations, a spokesman replied: ""It is not for us, we are here to work."" At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan Brexit: All you need to know Mr Davis said he could not remain in his post because he no longer believed in the plan for the UK's future relations with the EU which was backed by the cabinet on Friday. He said he hoped his resignation would make it easier for the UK to resist EU attempts to extract further concessions - but he insisted he was not seeking to undermine or challenge the prime minister. In an interview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Davis said Mr Raab would be ""very effective"" in the post. Reflecting on his resignation, he said he had lived with compromises in Brexit policy for two years but there came a point where these went ""too far"". ""I worry about the fine detail and that it will not work out as we hope,"" he said. Asked what he would say to colleagues who thought it was time to remove Theresa May, he replied it was ""not a good idea"" - insisting that she was a ""good prime minister"". Junior Brexit minister Steve Baker, who also resigned overnight, launched an attack on government policy. This video can not be played Ex-minister Steve Baker: ""We have all been blindsided by this policy"" He told the BBC's Daily Politics that he had been ""blindsided"" by the Brexit proposal agreed at Chequers. Mr Baker also said that he and his team had been preparing a white paper ""which did not accord with what has been put to the cabinet at Chequers"". The mood at Westminster, by Iain Watson The atmosphere is volatile. The long-standing Leave supporters of the European Research Group of Tory MPs will have two meetings today - either side of the PM's address to her own MPs - to discuss next steps. Views differ on whether the government's position is simply impractical - ""the worst of both worlds"" - or whether it actually breaches a manifesto commitment by offering a customs union in all but name. But there is agreement amongst many Brexiteers that the policy should change, and quickly. It is less clear how they will bring that about. If there is not a direct triggering of a leadership contest, what are the options? One is that Brexiteers go ""on strike"" and refuse to back government policy in parliament, weakening her premiership unless she changes course. Another is that backbench Brexiteers put more pressure on like-minded cabinet colleagues to follow David Davis out the door. Speaking to the BBC last week, Mr Raab said the process of negotiating Brexit was ""rocky"" but what mattered was getting there in the end, which would require ""flexibility and pragmatism"". He told the Political Thinking podcast that he was ""relaxed"" about the UK leaving without a deal and it was ""not something I would fear"". Conservative MPs welcomed the appointment of Mr Raab, who has a black belt in karate, one describing him as a ""highly capable"" figure with a clear attention to detail. But Labour said a new man fronting the negotiations ""changed nothing"". ""The deep division at the heart of the Conservative Party has broken out in public and plunged this government into crisis,"" said shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer. ""It is now clearer than ever that Theresa May does not have the authority to negotiate for Britain or deliver a Brexit deal that protects jobs and the economy."" David Davis - the maverick minister Resignation letter and May's reply in full Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon Asked whether Mr Raab would be in charge of the talks, No 10 said Mrs May had ""always been, from the outset, the lead negotiator"". But a spokesman said there was a ""huge body of work to be done, in terms of preparations for the UK leaving the EU and that obviously includes no-deal preparations as well"". Mrs May will address Parliament later on the plan agreed at Chequers on Friday as well as address Tory MPs as she seeks to keep her Brexit strategy on track. Ahead of Monday's statement, opposition MPs and peers - as well as Tory MPs - are being offered briefings by Downing Streeton the detail of the Chequers statement.,external A spokesman for the European Research Group of eurosceptic Tory MPs told the BBC that involving opposition MPs had caused considerable anger and was the government's ""stupidest mistake"". And Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the group, likened a PM relying on opposition MPs to the children's story in which the gingerbread man accepts the offer of a ride across a river from a fox, only to get eaten by it.

"This video can not be played In full: Davis interview with Kuenssberg Is it really leaving at all? ""I don't think so."" Forget the politicking and the crazy, bitter briefings. If the past few weeks has been like watching the Conservative Party have a nervous breakdown in front of our eyes, this morning they are truly losing the plot. Set aside the psychodrama about minicab cards, late night phone calls, toasts over dinner at Chequers, a foreign secretary no one can find. More of that later no doubt. What sticks out the most from my interview with David Davis this morning is a very simple question we asked. Is the prime minister's plan really leaving the EU? ""I don't think so"", he said. Live: Reaction as Davis and Johnson quit Kuenssberg: More Brexiteer resignations to come? Raab replaces Davis as Brexit secretary That is the sentiment that's widely shared among the Tory party, and perhaps among many voters too. And guess what? It doesn't always matter which side of the referendum they were on either. Some former Remainers say ""look, this is a dodgy compromise, what's the point? If we are going to do this, then for goodness sake let's do it properly or just stay in"". From some Leavers, like Mr Davis, you also get ""look, this is a dodgy compromise, what's the point? If we are going to do it, then for goodness sake let's do it properly"". Yes, I did mean to write the same line twice just then. We are a million miles from Tory unity, but weirdly there is some agreement at the fringes of the party that the current compromise is, as compromises so often are, something that pleases hardly anyone. And it would be better for No 10 just to go the ""full Norway"", a close relationship with the EU not a Viking experience, or the ""Canada plus"", a free trade agreement not a ten-day tour of the Rockies, or frankly, not leave at all. David Davis' resignation on its own - so far - is not going to bring down the government. It could well unleash a host of events that leads us to that place, but we're still a long way from that. But what it does do is take the lid off the boiling pot of frustration, angst, ambition and despair you find in pockets of the governing party and a sense on both sides that this kind of Brexit might not be worth it. That's not to say most Tory MPs are in the mood for a giant ruckus. Most of them in fact probably back the Chequers compromise, grateful at last that the Cabinet - well most of them - found agreement. And believing, quite possibly correctly, that the vast majority of the public aren't paying attention to much of the flouncing in any case, so can ministers please, please, please, please, get on with it and just shut up. For Number 10, the Chequers plan is a clever enough compromise they believe can get the EU on to the next phase of negotiations. Remember - all of this is happening in order that officials can get down to actually negotiating the nitty-gritty of the long term relationship. It is perfectly possible that within 72 hours or so it is situation normal, well normal-ish. But David Davis was an ""active backbencher"", who delighted in making waves on the issues he cares about for many years. If he thinks Theresa May's Brexit does not mean Brexit, expect plenty of trouble ahead even if today's particular storm passes before the heat wave breaks.

"Solid food at three months helped babies to sleep better Babies given solid food plus breast milk from three months sleep better than those who are solely breastfed, according to a new study. Official advice is to breastfeed exclusively for the first six months of life. Experts say women should still heed this recommendation, although it is under review. In the study, inJAMA Pediatrics,external, giving solids earlier than six months had benefits for mum and baby. The babies slept for longer and mothers reported improved quality of life. The study, by King's College, London, and St George's, University of London, surveyed 1,303 three-month-olds, and divided them into two groups. One group was solely breastfed for six months, the other group was given solid foods in addition to breast milk from the age of three months. Parents then filled in online questionnaires every month until their baby was 12 months old, and then every three months until they were three years old. The study showed that infants in the group who ate solids as well as breast milk: slept longer woke less frequently and had fewer sleep problems than those who were exclusively breastfed until about six months Although the findings were significant, the differences between the solids group and the control group were not huge. Babies on earlier solids slept for up to 16 minutes longer per night, potentially giving parents about two extra hours of sleep per week. Co-author of the study Dr Michael Perkin, from St George's, University of London, says small differences generated large benefits for parents. ""Given that infant sleep directly affects parental quality of life, even a small improvement can have important benefits."" More significantly, the group of babies on early solids reported half the rate of the type of sleep problems, such as crying and irritability, which make it less likely that parents are going to get back to sleep. Bottle feeding is a woman's right, midwives told Early weaning 'may aid breastfed' Q&A: Early weaning The NHS and World Health Organization currently advise to wait until around six months before introducing solid foods, but these guidelines are currently under review. Experts say babies should not have solid foods, at the earliest, before the end of four months. Despite the official advice, 75% of British mothers introduced solid food before five months, with a quarter (26%) citing infant night-time waking as the reason for their decision, according to the Infant Feeding Survey of 2010. Prof Gideon Lack from King's College, London, said: ""The results of this research support the widely held parental view that early introduction of solids improves sleep. ""While the official guidance is that starting solid foods won't make babies more likely to sleep through the night, this study suggests that this advice needs to be re-examined in light of the evidence we have gathered."" Solids halved the incidence of serious sleep problems Responding to the study, Prof Mary Fewtrell, nutrition lead at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, pointed out that guidelines for infant feeding are currently being reviewed. She said: ""These are interesting findings from a large randomised controlled trial. ""At the RCPCH, we recommend that mothers should be supported to breastfeed their healthy-term infant exclusively for up to six months, with solid foods not introduced before four months. ""However, the evidence base for the existing advice on exclusive breastfeeding is over 10 years old, and is currently being reviewed in the UK by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition. ""We expect to see updated recommendations on infant feeding in the not too distant future."" First foods can include mashed or soft cooked fruit and vegetables - such as parsnip, potato, yam, sweet potato, carrot, apple or pear. Soft fruits, like peach or melon, or baby rice or baby cereal mixed with your baby's usual milk. Some babies like to start with mashed foods. Other babies need a little longer to get used to new textures so may prefer smooth or blended foods on a spoon at first. Keep offering different foods. It can take lots of attempts before your baby will accept a new food or texture. Source: NHS Choices,external What to feed babies in the first six months of life can be controversial, with many mothers feeling judged if they are unable to breastfeed successfully, and guilty if they introduce bottles or solids. Last month, the Royal College of Midwives responded to the pressure felt by new mothers by publicly stating new guidelines for midwives to respect a woman's choice not to breastfeed. The study on solids was part-funded by the Food Standards Agency, which was also looking at how allergies develop in babies. An FSA spokesperson said: ""We are encouraging all women to stick to existing advice to exclusively breastfeed for around the first six months of age. ""If there is any doubt about what's best for your baby, please seek advice from your doctor or health professional.""

"Shane Williams' image was used on Neil Taylor's company van and website Former Wales rugby star Shane Williams says he is taking legal advice after a builder accused of substandard work used his image to promote his business. Neil Taylor, owner of TMW Roofline in Bryncethin in Bridgend county, used the star's face on his van and website. Mr Williams said Mr Taylor did some work on his house 10 years ago but he had nothing to do with the company. Mr Taylor said he had taken the star's name off his paperwork and does not mislead anyone on his website. TMW Roofline's paperwork used the rugby star's image and name The former Wales and Lions wing said: ""The agreement was [he would] do the work and I would give him a testimonial and a photograph.... and that's about as far as it goes. ""I don't work with the company, I'm not involved with the company and I certainly haven't received a penny."" An investigation by BBC Wales TV programme X-Ray found 47 photographs of building projects on Mr Taylor's company website appeared on at least one other company website and one appeared on 40 sites around the world. Lisa John and Neil Bartlett said they had to cover their ceiling with bin bags to keep out the wind A surveyor described the work Mr Taylor did for a couple in Aberkenfig as ""appalling"". Lisa John and Neil Bartlett hired him to build a new room in their garden and a small extension on the side of their house for Â£30,000. But days after making their final payment to his company, faults in the work began to show. Little Grogg version of Shane Williams worth Â£1,500 Wales legend to play for village side at Principality Stadium 'I was as nervous playing for Amman as Wales' ""We had water coming in through the ceilings and we were just constantly on the phone to him,"" said Ms John. ""He did come down and his solution - which was I think his favourite thing - was to put a big block of silicone back over the hole and tell us it was fixed."" Shane Williams says he met Neil Taylor when he did some work on his property 10 years ago The couple noticed patio tiles were loose and began having issues with their plumbing. Then in March, whenthe country was hit by days of heavy snowfall, they had snow coming in through the ceiling and had to cover it with bin bags to keep out the wind. A surveyor described the work on the roof as ""appalling"" ""He then admitted by text that he had put the wrong fittings on the side which is why we had water coming in,"" said Ms John. ""By this point we'd completely lost any faith in this man."" Surveyor Tim Davies assessed the work and said: ""I really can't find anything that is right with this roof. It's been so badly done. It's quite appalling to be honest. ""It is plain for all to see that this is an incredibly substandard work. This is lower than DIY standard."" Mr Taylor said bad weather meant work on the couple's home in Aberkenfig over-ran and he has been back on site and fixed the patio - the couple said they were still waiting for their roof to be fixed. He said he believed he worked on all the projects pictured on his company's website.

"Boris Johnson served as foreign secretary for nearly two years Boris Johnson's resignation as foreign secretary over Theresa May's Brexit policy will delight some Conservatives and dismay others - but does not come as too great a shock. The former London mayor and prominent Leave campaigner has been at odds with Mrs May's vision for Brexit for some time and has not been shy of saying so in public, leading many to wonder why he has not been sacked before now. In May, he called Mrs May's proposals for a post-Brexit customs partnership ""crazy"". Last month, he told Conservative donors the prime minister needed to show ""more guts"" in talks with Brussels and suggested US President Donald Trump could do a better job. Boris Johnson quits amid Brexit crisis Brexit plan 'best chance of proper exit' Raab replaces Davis as Brexit secretary More recently, he warned of a ""bog roll"" Brexit - which, rather than the clean break from the EU that many Tories want to see, would instead represent a departure that was ""soft, yielding and infinitely long"". Then, on Sunday, he was quoted as condemning Mrs May's Brexit proposals - agreed by her cabinet at a day-long meeting at Chequers - in colourful and crude terms. He claimed defending the plans was like ""polishing a turd"" - but nevertheless appeared to fall into line with the rest of her ministerial team, as they united behind her, with friends saying he was staying in the cabinet to fight for the kind of Brexit he wanted. He did not comment publicly, however, in contrast to fellow Brexiteer Michael Gove, who mounted a defence of the PM on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, saying her plans were the best option for a clean exit from the EU. Mr Johnson's hand may have been forced by the resignation of Brexit secretary David Davis, who said Mrs May's plans were a ""compromise too far"". As the figurehead of the Leave campaign, his political fortunes are seen as being inextricably linked to the government's ability to deliver a Brexit which satisfies the 17.4 million people who voted to leave in the 2016 referendum. Michael Gove and Boris Johnson - friends turned enemies turned allies? His frontline political career was widely assumed to be over when Theresa May surprised Westminster by appointing him as foreign secretary on taking office in July 2016. Known for his gaffes and love of the limelight, many wondered how he would cope with the diplomatic niceties of his new role. Boris Johnson: A history of undiplomacy He was not directly involved in the negotiations over the UK's exit from the EU. Instead, he has spent most of his time banging the drum for Britain abroad and dealing with crises such as Syria and Russia. However, he has still been a thorn in Mrs May's side. Boris Johnson has long hoped to follow David Cameron into Downing Street He has regularly popped up to issue warnings in Brexit-supporting newspapers about the risk of backsliding on key issues, such as the role of the European Court of Justice, the length of any transition period and the freedom to diverge from EU regulations and standards. In the run-up to Mrs May's key Florence speech last October, he seemed to set out his own ""red lines"" for the negotiations, prompting the first of many calls from pro-European Tories for him to be dismissed. As keeper of the Brexit flame, he has exploited the licence that cabinet divisions and uncertainty over UK policy have given him and others to speak out. He has been a frequent critic of the Treasury, claiming its fears about short-term economic disruption are blinding officials to the longer-term opportunities. And he has vigorously stuck by the idea of a Brexit dividend for the UK, repeating the controversial and disputed referendum claim there could be Â£350m a week in extra cash for the NHS. The prime minister has resisted calls from the opposition and some on her own side to sack Mr Johnson over his increasingly off-message comments. Her critics said this shows her weakness, as the leader of a deeply divided government without a Commons majority.  It may have reflected a nervousness about what Mr Johnson, who remains popular with many party members, might do on the backbenches. The 54-year Eton and Oxford-educated former political journalist has harboured ambitions of getting the top job for many years, but was beaten to No 10 by his contemporary David Cameron. When the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip - who was born in New York and until recently held dual US-UK citizenship - finally got his chance to succeed his friend and rival in the summer of 2016, the prize was snatched away from him in the most dramatic fashion. His campaign manager and fellow Leave supporter Michael Gove abandoned him at the eleventh-hour during the leadership contest, questioning his suitability for the job, and put himself forward instead. Mr Johnson duly withdrew from the leadership race, a move which angered some of his supporters who questioned whether he had the stomach for the fight. His critics say his ambition trumps his principles, most recently when he flew to Afghanistan rather than take part in a vote on the expansion of Heathrow airport, which he has vehemently opposed for many years. The question now is whether his resignation is a prelude to another leadership bid.

"Brussels was not worried about David Davis (far right) leaving; the possibility Olly Robbins (far left) might depart was far more concerning David Davis's resignation was met with a collective shrug of the shoulders in Brussels on Monday. ""How can we miss a man who was never here?"", one EU source commented to me. The Brexit secretary made one visit to Brussels in the last four months. A far more familiar face here is Olly Robbins, the prime minister's Europe adviser. The EU is reassured that he's staying in his post - for now. But the mood in Brussels - especially after hearing this afternoon that Boris Johnson too was gone - is far from blasÃ©. The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said Europe was deeply troubled not by British cabinet resignations, but by Brexit itself. ""Politicians come and go,"" he said. ""But the problems they have created for the people remain. The mess caused by Brexit is the biggest problem in the history of EU-UK relations. And it is still very far from being solved."" A sense of unease hangs heavy. Is it really leaving? 'I don't think so,' says Davis Profile of the ex-foreign secretary Brexit: All you need to know ""Theresa May is respected in Europe,"" one contact told me. ""But so many times since this Brexit process began, we've had to ask ourselves: will she stay or will she go? And now here we are again."" Political uncertainty in Britain makes the possibility of a no-deal Brexit seem far more likely in the eyes of Brussels bureaucrats. Not because either side want it, but because time for EU-UK negotiations - as the European Commission never tires of repeating - is simply running out. Boris Johnson also stepped down, making the possibility of a no-deal Brexit seem a little closer And if the prime minister does indeed survive, what then? Most EU sources I spoke to believe she will. One compared the prime minister to Germany's Angela Merkel and said both women were consistently under-estimated. Listen to Theresa May's impassioned address to Parliament today - promising a return to UK sovereignty after Brexit, yet simultaneously keeping close ties to Europe (no country with an EU association agreement has so far avoided signing up to binding relations), with frictionless trade and a close customs relationship that is not a customs union (honest), while remaining free to strike the UK's own trade deals. The EU is holding fire for now on her plan. Brexit misconceptions - as seen from Brussels EU wonders if Theresa May has run out of 'Brexit fudge' Brexit: Why Brussels seems relaxed about the end game Leaders are mindful of not wanting to further weaken Theresa May at home by rushing forward with their manifold objections - but it's just a matter of time. The next Brexit negotiating round is pencilled in for a week today. Now, Downing Street believes that the hot water the prime minister is in today will shock EU leaders into realising they need to start compromising themselves - not just perpetually demanding capitulations on the UK's red lines. Privately, key EU figures admit there will be some give from Brussels - eventually. But how much? Certainly not what would be needed to make Theresa May's proposed third way for Brexit work as she currently presents it. Brussels is quietly confident Theresa May will survive this crisis ""On the one hand, it's true what Downing Street says,"" one EU source told me. ""The UK is bigger than Norway and strategically, politically and economically more important to us than Switzerland, yes. But EU countries benefit more from keeping their club - the single market and customs union - intact, than they would do by compromising everything just for the sake of better bilateral relations with the UK after Brexit. You can forget it."" The EU definitely expects more concessions from Theresa May in negotiations if she wants what she describes as a deep and special partnership post Brexit. But the bottom line in Brussels is: hard or soft, Brexit must be done in time. Whether Theresa May or another is at the helm in the UK, EU diplomats say they need a leader who has to power to make a deal in Brussels and see it through back home. Otherwise, they believe a disorderly no-deal Brexit beckons - with all the consequences they think that will have in the UK and across the EU.

"An ambitious former lawyer, whose cabinet hopes have been repeatedly dashed by Theresa May, Dominic Raab has now been thrust into a key role in her government following the resignation of Brexit Secretary David Davis. A staunch Brexiteer, who was calling for Britain's exit from the EU long before the referendum, Mr Raab is said to be ""relaxed"" about a ""no deal"" Brexit scenario and last month called on the UK to display more ""economic self-confidence"" in talks with Brussels, urging Mrs May not to ""cower in a corner"" over Brexit. The 44-year-old, who has a black belt in karate, was tipped for high office from the moment he was elected to the safe Conservative seat of Esher and Walton in 2010. The son of a Czech-born Jewish refugee who fled the Nazis in 1938, Mr Raab was brought up in Buckinghamshire and took a law degree at Oxford University before switching to Cambridge for his Master's. Live: Boris Johnson quits Raab replaces Davis as Brexit secretary Raab dismisses allegations against aide He worked as a lawyer at the Foreign Office before entering politics in 2006 as an aide first to David Davis - the man he is now replacing - and then Dominic Grieve, the Remain-backing Tory MP. But his rise through the ministerial ranks has not been without controversy, with Mrs May taking particular offence at his description of some feminists as ""obnoxious bigots"" in a 2011 online article in which he attacked the ""equality bandwagon"" and said that men were getting ""a raw deal"". Mrs May, who was then minister for equalities as well as home secretary, accused him of fuelling ""gender warfare"". Date of birth:25 February 1974 (age 44) Job:Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, Conservative MP for Esher and Walton Education:Dr Challoner's Grammar School, Amersham, Oxford and Cambridge universities Family:Married to Erika Ray, a Brazilian marketing executive. Two children Before politics:Foreign office lawyer. He was the lead on a team focusing on bringing war criminals to justice at The Hague He was appointed civil liberties minister in the Ministry of Justice following David Cameron's general election victory in 2015. In 2017, he was branded ""offensive"" by then Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron after saying ""the typical user of a food bank is not someone that's languishing in poverty, it's someone who has a cash flow problem"". He played a prominent role in the Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, but was sacked from his junior ministerial role by Theresa May when she took over as prime minister following Mr Cameron's resignation. During her January 2018 reshuffle there were reports that Mr Raab had deliberately been sidelined as part of the ""new generation"" of Tory talent seen as a threat to the ""old guard"". Downing Street said his appointment as Brexit Secretary, an area the PM has made a personal priority, showed the ""high regard"" in which she held him. He proved a loyal pro-Brexit voice on the backbenches, and kept the Leave campaign flag flying as co-founder of the Change Britain campaign group. He was rewarded with a more senior role in the Ministry of Justice following last year's general election, and moved to the job of housing minister in January. There was further controversy when he suggested immigration was driving up house prices, with the Office for National Statistics demanding that he publish the study on which his claims were based. In May this year, his diary secretary was caught up in a Daily Mirror sting. He dismissed the paper's allegations that the 20-year-old had met men through a ""sugar daddy"" website as ""a storm in a teacup"". He said his first concern was for the welfare of the woman, who was suspended from her civil service job. The ""most salacious"" thing in the newspaper's story was an ""untrue"" claim that he ordered the same lunch every day, he told BBC News.

"New homes in suburban England would need to be fitted with electric car charging points under a government proposal to cut emissions. Ministers also want new street lights to come with charge points wherever there's on-street parking. Details ofa sales ban on new conventional petrol and diesel cars by 2040are also expected to be set out. The strategy comes at a timewhen the government is facing criticismfor failing to reduce carbon emissions. The government's target is to reduce the UK's greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% of 1990 levels by 2050. Why carmakers must adapt - or die Creme Eggs knock out car charging point UK's clean car goal 'not ambitious enough' The proposals, announced by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, aim to make it easier to recharge an electric car rather than refuel petrol or diesel vehicles. They include: The need to assess if new homes and offices should be required to install charging points as standard New street lighting columns with on-street parking to have charging points in appropriate locations More money being allocated to fund charging infrastructure. Mr Grayling said the proposed measures would mean the UK having ""one of the most comprehensive support packages for zero-emission vehicles in the world"". ""The prize is not just a cleaner and healthier environment but a UK economy fit for the future and the chance to win a substantial slice of a market estimated to be worth up to Â£7.6 trillion by 2050,"" he said. The government's Road to Zero strategy has been delayed by a dispute over what sort of cars should be allowed to be sold after 2040. The government's climate change advisers say carbon emissions from vehicles must be stopped by 2040 if the UK is to achieve its demanding long-term targets for protecting the climate. That implies that cars after that date should be fuelled by electricity or hydrogen. But car makers like Toyota, which have specialised in hybrid petrol/electric vehicles, have been arguing that as most journeys are fairly short it doesn't make sense to carry a battery big enough to make a 200-mile trip. It seems they have won their argument that hybrids should still be able to be sold - to the dismay of environmentalists who say the task of tackling carbon emissions from transport is going much too slowly anyway. The Campaign for Better Transport welcomed plans to increase charge points but said ""overall the strategy fails to match the urgency of the situation"". It said new petrol and diesel cars should be banned by 2030 - ten years earlier than the government's proposal - and criticised the ""confusion"" over the future of hybrids. The government has said it sees a role for hybrid technology in its new strategy. In the first six months of this year, electric vehicles made up only 5.5% of the UK's new car market, compared with 4.3% over the same period in 2017. The RAC Foundation, a motoring research charity, found that growth in the electric car industry was hampered by a lack of widespread, reliable and easy-to-use public charging points. Research by the AA showed eight out of 10 drivers see the lack of charging points as a stumbling block to buying an electric car. The motoring organisation said the proposals were ""a step in the right direction"", adding that ""there is still much to do to wean drivers off petrol and diesel cars"".

"CCTV images show the women lying on the footpath outside the restaurant An Australian restaurant has been fined after its staff  ""dumped"" two drunk, unconscious women on the street. The incident at the Korean BBQ diner in Sydney was one of the worst breaches of liquor laws in years, authorities said. The group of three women had each consumed eight shots of Korean soju liquor within 35 minutes, before two of them collapsed at their table. Waiters and other diners then carried the unconscious pair out of the venue, and left them on the footpath. One woman vomited while she was being removed, the Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (ILGA) said in its report. The women were carried out by the staff and other customers The women only received medical help when patrolling police noticed the group of people gathered outside the Gangnam Station restaurant. ""It's hard to imagine a worse case of a venue failing in its obligations to prevent misuse and abuse of alcohol,"" an ILGA representative said. Australians 'worry about binge drinking' Drunk tourists warned over insurance cover 'Idiots' put dampener on celebrations Staff continued to serve the women bottles of soju despite clear signs of intoxication. The report said the women were swaying and struggling to sit upright at their table. The restaurant has been fined A$2200 (Â£1,200; $1,650) and is facing restrictions around its opening hours amid other sanctions. In Australia, anyone serving alcohol as part of their job has to do a mandatory Responsible Service of Alcohol (RSA) training course. It specifically tackles how to deal with intoxicated customers and when to stop serving them.

"Nissan says it has uncovered falsified data from car exhaust emissions tests at most of its Japanese factories. The firm said emissions and fuel economy tests had ""deviated from the prescribed testing environment"". The carmaker added that inspection reports had been ""based on altered measurement values"". Nissan pledged there would be a ""full and comprehensive investigation"" and said ""appropriate measures"" would be taken to stop any future recurrence. Nissan said it was looking into whether whether the issue affected vehicles exported from Japan to other markets. The company said it had rechecked ""reliable"" data and confirmed that all vehicles except the GT-R sports car conformed to Japanese safety standards. The GT-R was not included because it had not been able to check enough vehicles as yet. by Jonty Bloom, BBC business correspondent This is a very embarrassing affair for Nissan and it will damage its reputation, but it does not seem at the highest levels to have been deliberately trying to beat the system. VW was caught cheating emissions testing by deliberately writing software that meant its cars met emissions standards only when they were being tested but not at any other time. Nissan on the other hand seems to have been running its testing system very badly, they did not meet legal requirements and measurements were altered. That does not sound as bad as what happened at VW but it is still very shocking. This was going on at all of Nissan's factories in Japan, bar one; that means it is hardly a one-off accident or down to a few rotten apples. Nissan is still investigating what went wrong. But, if this scandal ends here, Nissan will probably be able to say it made a sin of omission rather than VW's sin of commission. Nissan's shares fell more than 4.5% on Monday after the company alerted investors that a statement on exhaust emissions was imminent. Last year,Nissan recalled 1.2 million vehicles in Japanafter regulators said safety checks did not meet domestic requirements. A subsequent investigation into why its safety inspections did not meet government standards has now led to the latest revelations. The admission by Nissan comes after a huge scandal involving diesel emissions test cheating by Germany's Volkswagen. Last month,VW was fined â¬1bn (Â£880m) by German prosecutorsfor selling more than 10 million cars between mid-2007 and 2015 that had test-cheating software installed.

"This video can not be played World Cup 2018: How England v Sweden interrupted a nation England's World Cup run has got fans believing again and back in love with the national team, while attracting a whole new set of supporters. Generations of England fans have grown up only knowing disappointment, but Gareth Southgate's side have changed all that with their displays in Russia. They face Croatia on Wednesday in their first World Cup semi-final since 1990. We asked you to get in touch and tell us how you were won back - or converted - to the Three Lions by the class of 2018. ""My first memories of international football are of house parties filled with flags, finger food and football dreams,"" saidPaige Cooper.""Our hopes were always left as soggy as the leftover sandwiches. ""I never fell out of love with English football but my god have I fallen deeper in love with it. No matter what happens now, they have brought together a country."" Zeedan Hussainadded: ""This new generation, with 11 members of the squad from ethnic minorities, represents modern-day England a lot better."" James Bastinsaid: ""No matter where this crazy World Cup takes us, I am eternally thankful to the England team for the glimmer of hope they injected into all of our lives - at least home feels like home again."" ""My love for England has been rekindled,"" saidMatthew Buttree.""I've now well and truly jumped on to the hype train. Thank you Gareth Southgate for giving me back my greatest love."" John Skivingtonsaid the ""egotistical nature of the game"" made him stop following England 10 years ago, until now. He added: ""Gareth Southgate has created a team-first environment with a collective commitment to a shared vision. It's a refreshing change and, once again, enjoyable to experience as a fan."" ""Gareth has brought a discipline, hunger and drive to what was a tired, uninventive team no one really got excited about,"" saidElizabeth Money. Andy Lynamhas compared Southgate to Alf Ramsey, who managed England to World Cup victory in 1966, whileRussellcalls him a ""quintessential gentleman - a man who people can genuinely feel a connection with"". ""Young players, a heartfelt management style... and the 10-year-old boy [who dreamed of winning the World Cup] is alive again,"" saidPaul. While 68-year-oldMalcolm Achilleadded: ""Thanks Gareth and the boys, you've made an old man very happy,"" ""A well-spoken team of players and an exemplary manager who can speak openly and eloquently with the press,"" saidPhil Spence.""A true team of gentlemen and no bad press reports; what a refreshing change."" ""To see a close-knit group working so hard for each other and restoring the connection to the fans and the nation is so refreshing,"" saysRichard Brailsford. Nigel Howe:""The England team seem mostly like just ordinary guys, no huge ego or air of self-importance. No tantrums, sulks or bad behaviour on or off the field."" ""This team has changed everything,"" saidJack Levick,whileAlex Sinclairesays the players have ""brought the joy back"" andKevin Carrollsaid they ""make my hair stand on end"". ""We have a plan, an identity and a togetherness that seems water tight,"" saysMark Ratheram.""Every player working for each other, not as individuals like in the past. ""We seem to have the desire and mental strength to keep the ball and pass in the way football is supposed to be played. The love of England playing in the style we have shown in the World Cup has without doubt relit the fire to watch England with not only confidence but also with pride."" Adrian Tuttysaid the team were ""a breath of fresh air, youth without inhibitions who want to play for England"". ""These set of players have played with such passion, unity and determination they have not only put pride back in the shirt but inspired me to put one on,"" saidMartin Baily.""They have made their country proud."" Brian Norris added:""Whatever happens now, these players have restored a sense of pride in English football."" Nicholas Banks:""I am now hooked on the sheer excitement of this competition for the first time ever and love the team's can-do attitude. Win or lose on Wednesday, they have won me over already."" ""I only watch football because my husband loves it and had been put off by previous England performances,"" saidTeresa Ward.""Gareth Southgate and his men have awakened my interest enormously."" Danyal Orekadded: ""I am looking forward to a World Cup semi-final again, for the first time since I was 13, and am excited by a team who look so different to every England team I have watched since World Cup 1998, ""I am looking forward to enjoying a football match, because whatever happens I believe again."" Many English expats around the world will have to wake up early or stay up late to watch the semi-final. ""England are worth waking up for,"" saysAlexander Mitchel,who is based in Sydney. ""Getting up at 04:00 is a delight when it's to watch humility, excellence and great organisation on the football pitch. Truly restored my interest in England.""

"David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, said he was unhappy with the government's decision to maintain a ""common rulebook"" with the European Union, after the UK leaves the EU. He called it ""problematic"" and said it was one of the reasonshe has decided to resign. Mr Davis's resignation wasfollowed by that of the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson- also over the government's Brexit strategy. But what is the common rulebook and why are some Brexiteers unhappy with it? Currently, EUÂ member states have to follow the same standards and regulations. This is part of the single market rulebook on goods and services. Harmonised standards exist in all sorts of areas, such as chemicals, emissions, pharmaceuticals and food safety. The government wants to maintain parts of this rulebook to allow ""frictionless trade at the border"" after Brexit. Some of the detail was contained in thethree page government document,external, released after the Chequers summit. The document says a treaty would be signed to allow for ""ongoing harmonisation on goods"" including agriculture and food. It also said the UK ""would strike different arrangements for services"". That suggests the UK is not looking to follow the model of the EEA (European Economic Area) countries - like Norway and Iceland. They are not EU members but they follow the single market rulebook on both goods and services. Services are very important to UK businesses: In 2016the UK exported Â£106bn in servicesto the EU and the four European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries. That compares to Â£158bn in goods exports. The government also believes the proposals will allow it to negotiate its own free trade deals with other countries, such as the US - but that is disputed by some Brexiteers. The government published its proposals after the Cabinet held a summit at Chequers The UK will lose its place in the European Council, its representation at the European Commission and all of its 73 MEPs. The fear amongst some is that the UK will become a rule taker and no longer a rule maker. Brexit Secretary David Davis resigns Reality Check: Why services matter in any Brexit deal The new UK Brexit plan agreed at Chequers But the government says that if the EU decides to change the rulebook in the future, it will be the UK Parliament that decides whether to accept the changes. Others, like Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, believe the proposal strengthens parliamentary sovereignty: ""There's a world of difference between parliament being unlikely to vote down a new regulation and parliament being unable to vote down a regulation"", he said. ""Unable is where we are now."" But it's not clear what the consequences would be if the UK rejected any changes to the rulebook and standards consequently started to diverge, according to Jill Rutter from the Institute for Government think tank. ""Imagine the UK didn't like a change to regulations in the chemical industry"", she says. ""In order to maintain access we might have to set up our own regulatory body or set up new arrangements to check chemical goods at the border. ""That could mean big set-up costs."" The government document acknowledges that if Parliament voted to reject any changes to the rulebook, it would have to recognise ""that this would have consequences"". In her response to David Davis's resignation letter, Theresa May said not signing up to certain rules would lead to consequences for ""market access, security cooperation or the frictionless border."" Please upgrade your browser There's also the question of disputes and how to resolve them. The UK wants to set up a joint committee and independent arbitration in the event of a dispute over the rulebook. Cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom says the dispute mechanism would be ""equally presided over by UK courts and the European Court of Justice"". But the detail of how this would work in practice is still to be worked out. More detail is expected in the coming days when the government publishes its Brexit White Paper. Of course this is all predicated on the UK securing a Brexit deal with the EU. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"This video can not be played Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu says police will do everything to bring those responsible to justice A woman who died after being exposed to the nerve agent Novichok in Wiltshire is believed to have had a ""high dose"" of the substance, police have said. Mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess, 44, died on Sunday evening after falling ill in Amesbury on 30 June. Her partner, Charlie Rowley, 45, who was also exposed to the nerve agent, remains critically ill in hospital. Police are continuing to hunt for a contaminated container which they believe was handled by the pair. The BBC understands Mr Rowley's flat in Amesbury is regarded as the key location in the search. A team wearing hazmat suits is combing the small flat, working in 30-minute shifts because of the heat. Wiltshire Police said on Monday night that a car had been moved from Swindon in relation to the investigation - but stressed that ""the public should not be alarmed"". Allow Twitter content?

A murder inquiry has been launched into Ms Sturgess's death and a post-mortem examination is due to take place. Home Secretary Sajid Javid chaired a meeting of the government's emergency committee Cobra on Monday and later addressed MPs. He told them the death of Ms Sturgess ""strengthens our resolve to find out exactly what happened and who is behind it"". What are Novichok agents? Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far What happened to the Skripals? Mr Javid said scientists had not yet been able to determine if the nerve agent in the latest poisoning was from the same batch as that used earlier this year in Salisbury. Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yuliafell ill after being poisoned with Novichok in Salisbury.Ms Skripal was discharged from Salisbury District Hospital in April, and her father in May. A police officer, Det Sgt Nick Bailey, wasalso left seriously illafter responding to the attack on the Skripals and spent nearly three weeks in hospital. Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley touched an unknown contaminated item with their hands, police say Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the head UK counter-terrorism policing which is leading the investigation, said he was ""unable to say"" if the incident in Amesbury is linked to the poisoning of the Skripals on 3 March - but it is their ""main line of inquiry"". Mr Basu said: ""In the four months since the Skripals and Nick Bailey were poisoned, no other people besides Dawn and Charlie have presented with symptoms, but their reaction was so severe it resulted in Dawn's death and Charlie being critically ill. This video can not be played Footage shows Ms Sturgess in Salisbury days before her collapse ""This means they must have got a high dose and our hypothesis is that they must have handled a container that we are now seeking."" It is understood the couple each had nerve agent on one of their hands. Ms Sturgess, from Durrington, was rushed to hospital on Saturday 30 June after becoming ill at a house in Muggleton Road in Amesbury. She has two sons, aged 19 and 23, and an 11-year-old daughter. Theresa May said she was ""appalled and shocked"" by her death. Speaking to MPs in the House of Commons, she also paid tribute to the ""dedication of the staff"" at Salisbury District Hospital and thanked them for their ""tireless work"". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs: ""The simple reality is that Russia has committed an attack on British soil which has seen the death of a British citizen. ""That is something that I think the world will unite with us in actually condemning."" Tributes were left to Ms Sturgess, who has three children Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was ""deeply concerned"" about the incident in Amesbury - but said accusations that it was involved are ""absurd"". The UK government previously blamed Russia for the poisoning of the Skripals in March and say the nerve agent used was a type developed by Russia. Russian authorities denied any involvement in the poisoning. Mr Basu said detectives will continue with their ""painstaking and meticulous work to gather all the available evidence"". ByGordon Corera, BBC security correspondent A hundred detectives are already working round the clock to try to establish how Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley were contaminated by Novichok. Swabs taken from them in hospital revealed the highest level of contamination on their hands, leading to the theory they picked something up. It may well be that it was Dawn who came into first contact and Charlie received secondary contamination from her but that remains to be confirmed. The priority now is working out what that item was and where it is now. Read more here. Officers have found a red Ford Transit van which Mr Rowley travelled in with three other men before falling ill. The vehicle has been sent to the government's military research facility Porton Down. Three men who also travelled in the van have shown no sign of being exposed to Novichok. Meanwhile, the bus that Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley used the night before they collapsed has tested negative for Novichok. Public Health England said the risk to the general public ""remains low""but warned people,externalnot to pick up ""any strange items such as needles, syringes or unusual containers"". They have also offered advice for people who may have visited one of five areas identified by police. Those locations are Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy and the Baptist church in Amesbury, and John Baker House and Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury. Anyone who was there between 22:00 BST on 29 June and 18:30 on 30 Juneshould continue to follow advice,external, including washing their clothes in a washing machine, keeping other items double-bagged and securely fastened if they are dry-clean only. Wiltshire Police Chief Constable Kier Pritchard said the news of Ms Sturgess's death would ""send a huge shockwave across our communities"" but stressed that ""the risk to the wider public remains low"". He praised residents for their ""continual strength and resilience"" during ""these challenging times"". Friday 29 June 12:20 - Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley are together at John Baker House, Salisbury. They leave to visit Salisbury and later go to Queen Elizabeth Gardens. They return to John Baker House at 16:20. 22:00 - The couple catch a bus to Amesbury. Police believe they then spend the night at Mr Rowley's home on Muggleton Road. Saturday 30 June 10:15 - The South Western Ambulance Service is called to Mr Rowley's address as Ms Sturgess has been taken ill. Mr Rowley is also present at the address as Ms Sturgess is taken to hospital. 12:00 - Mr Rowley visits the Boots pharmacy on Stonehenge Walk in Amesbury, returning to his house half an hour later. 1:45 - He goes to the Amesbury Baptist Church on Butterfield Drive, returning home at 15:00. 18:20 - Mr Rowley is taken ill. The ambulance service is called to his address and he is taken to hospital. Sunday 8 July 20:26 - Ms Sturgess dies in hospital. What we know so far What are Novichok nerve agents?

"This video can not be played Royals arrive for Prince Louis' christening Prince Louis, the youngest son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, has been christened in a private ceremony. The 11-week-old was baptised by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace. Guests included newlyweds the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. But the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh did not attend, with the decision made ""some time ago"" and not on health grounds, Buckingham Palace said. The Queen, 92, was travelling back from Norfolk on Monday and has a busy week ahead, with celebrations marking the centenary of the RAF on Tuesday and US President Donald Trump's visit to Windsor on Friday. Prince Louis wore the christening gown that his siblings had also worn Prince Louis was sleeping as he arrived at the ceremony, held by his mother. His siblings, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, walked slightly in front, holding their father's hands. Charlotte's kiss for new baby prince Royal births past and present It is the first time the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their three children have been seen together as a family of five. She was heard describing her son as ""very relaxed and peaceful"", telling the archbishop with a smile: ""I hope he stays like this."" Princess Charlotte was holding an order of service as she left the chapel Prince Louis' six godparents are Nicholas van Cutsem, Guy Pelly, Harry Aubrey-Fletcher, Lady Laura Meade, Hannah Carter and Lucy Middleton. They are all friends or family of the Cambridges, who also picked friends and confidantes as Prince George's and Princess Charlotte's godparents. Miss Middleton and Mr Pelly each read a lesson during the service,Kensington Palace said,external. Kate said her son was 'relaxed and peaceful' before the ceremony Meghan, attending her first royal christening, wore an olive green Ralph Lauren outfit and a Stephen Jones hat. Kate wore a white McQueen outfit with a headdress by Jane Taylor. Louis's grandfather the Prince of Wales attended with the Duchess of Cornwall, with Kate's parents Carole and Michael Middleton also among the guests. Kate's pregnant sister Pippa Middletonand her brother James Middleton were also at the ceremony. This was the Duchess of Sussex's first royal christening The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose hymns O Jesus, I Have Promised and Lord of All Hopefulness for the ceremony. They also chose two anthems for the choir to sing - This is the Day which the Lord hath Made, written for their wedding in 2011 by John Rutter, and Suo Gan, a traditional Welsh lullaby. Prince Louis's christening gown is the same one that was used by his siblings. The cream lace and white satin robe is a replica of the robe made for Queen Victoria's eldest daughter in 1841, which is now too delicate to be worn. The new version was made by the Queen's dresser, Angela Kelly. According to tradition,water from the River Jordanwas used at the christening. Following the 40-minute traditional religious service, guests attended a private tea which included slices of christening cake, from a tier taken from the duke and duchess' wedding cake. Guy Pelly:The son of wealthy Kent landowners, Mr Pelly used to help run several London nightclubs. He is a close friend of both Prince William and Prince Harry - helping to organise the former's stag do - and was dubbed the pair's ""court jester"".

"Boris Johnson served as foreign secretary for nearly two years Boris Johnson's resignation as foreign secretary over Theresa May's Brexit policy will delight some Conservatives and dismay others - but does not come as too great a shock. The former London mayor and prominent Leave campaigner has been at odds with Mrs May's vision for Brexit for some time and has not been shy of saying so in public, leading many to wonder why he has not been sacked before now. In May, he called Mrs May's proposals for a post-Brexit customs partnership ""crazy"". Last month, he told Conservative donors the prime minister needed to show ""more guts"" in talks with Brussels and suggested US President Donald Trump could do a better job. Boris Johnson quits amid Brexit crisis Brexit plan 'best chance of proper exit' Raab replaces Davis as Brexit secretary More recently, he warned of a ""bog roll"" Brexit - which, rather than the clean break from the EU that many Tories want to see, would instead represent a departure that was ""soft, yielding and infinitely long"". Then, on Sunday, he was quoted as condemning Mrs May's Brexit proposals - agreed by her cabinet at a day-long meeting at Chequers - in colourful and crude terms. He claimed defending the plans was like ""polishing a turd"" - but nevertheless appeared to fall into line with the rest of her ministerial team, as they united behind her, with friends saying he was staying in the cabinet to fight for the kind of Brexit he wanted. He did not comment publicly, however, in contrast to fellow Brexiteer Michael Gove, who mounted a defence of the PM on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, saying her plans were the best option for a clean exit from the EU. Mr Johnson's hand may have been forced by the resignation of Brexit secretary David Davis, who said Mrs May's plans were a ""compromise too far"". As the figurehead of the Leave campaign, his political fortunes are seen as being inextricably linked to the government's ability to deliver a Brexit which satisfies the 17.4 million people who voted to leave in the 2016 referendum. Michael Gove and Boris Johnson - friends turned enemies turned allies? His frontline political career was widely assumed to be over when Theresa May surprised Westminster by appointing him as foreign secretary on taking office in July 2016. Known for his gaffes and love of the limelight, many wondered how he would cope with the diplomatic niceties of his new role. Boris Johnson: A history of undiplomacy He was not directly involved in the negotiations over the UK's exit from the EU. Instead, he has spent most of his time banging the drum for Britain abroad and dealing with crises such as Syria and Russia. However, he has still been a thorn in Mrs May's side. Boris Johnson has long hoped to follow David Cameron into Downing Street He has regularly popped up to issue warnings in Brexit-supporting newspapers about the risk of backsliding on key issues, such as the role of the European Court of Justice, the length of any transition period and the freedom to diverge from EU regulations and standards. In the run-up to Mrs May's key Florence speech last October, he seemed to set out his own ""red lines"" for the negotiations, prompting the first of many calls from pro-European Tories for him to be dismissed. As keeper of the Brexit flame, he has exploited the licence that cabinet divisions and uncertainty over UK policy have given him and others to speak out. He has been a frequent critic of the Treasury, claiming its fears about short-term economic disruption are blinding officials to the longer-term opportunities. And he has vigorously stuck by the idea of a Brexit dividend for the UK, repeating the controversial and disputed referendum claim there could be Â£350m a week in extra cash for the NHS. The prime minister has resisted calls from the opposition and some on her own side to sack Mr Johnson over his increasingly off-message comments. Her critics said this shows her weakness, as the leader of a deeply divided government without a Commons majority.  It may have reflected a nervousness about what Mr Johnson, who remains popular with many party members, might do on the backbenches. The 54-year Eton and Oxford-educated former political journalist has harboured ambitions of getting the top job for many years, but was beaten to No 10 by his contemporary David Cameron. When the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip - who was born in New York and until recently held dual US-UK citizenship - finally got his chance to succeed his friend and rival in the summer of 2016, the prize was snatched away from him in the most dramatic fashion. His campaign manager and fellow Leave supporter Michael Gove abandoned him at the eleventh-hour during the leadership contest, questioning his suitability for the job, and put himself forward instead. Mr Johnson duly withdrew from the leadership race, a move which angered some of his supporters who questioned whether he had the stomach for the fight. His critics say his ambition trumps his principles, most recently when he flew to Afghanistan rather than take part in a vote on the expansion of Heathrow airport, which he has vehemently opposed for many years. The question now is whether his resignation is a prelude to another leadership bid.

"Now he's gone and done it. For a long time it had been clear Boris Johnson was not happy with the prime minister's Brexit strategy. His dissatisfaction was more than just the odd off-colour remark, although goodness knows there were enough of those. His departure is a huge story and turns what might have been a couple of days of significant turmoil, into a significant crisis for Theresa May and the whole Brexit project. He was Brexit's main cheerleader, the politician most associated with making it happen, and one of the best known politicians in the country, for good or ill. Boris Johnson quits amid Brexit crisis Live: Reaction as Johnson and Davis resign It's enough of a mess on its own. But a well-connected source has just told me it could be more serious than that. They said it is a concerted push to force the prime minister to drop her Chequers compromise. ""If she doesn't drop Chequers there will be another,"" they said, ""then another, then another, then another."" But if she can't force a compromise through her party that itself took months to stitch together, the prime minister's authority would be significantly diminished. As Mr Johnson is hemmed in by paparazzi and camera crews outside his official residence that will soon be no longer his home, Theresa May is also a hostage with no obvious means of escape.

"An ambitious former lawyer, whose cabinet hopes have been repeatedly dashed by Theresa May, Dominic Raab has now been thrust into a key role in her government following the resignation of Brexit Secretary David Davis. A staunch Brexiteer, who was calling for Britain's exit from the EU long before the referendum, Mr Raab is said to be ""relaxed"" about a ""no deal"" Brexit scenario and last month called on the UK to display more ""economic self-confidence"" in talks with Brussels, urging Mrs May not to ""cower in a corner"" over Brexit. The 44-year-old, who has a black belt in karate, was tipped for high office from the moment he was elected to the safe Conservative seat of Esher and Walton in 2010. The son of a Czech-born Jewish refugee who fled the Nazis in 1938, Mr Raab was brought up in Buckinghamshire and took a law degree at Oxford University before switching to Cambridge for his Master's. Live: Boris Johnson quits Raab replaces Davis as Brexit secretary Raab dismisses allegations against aide He worked as a lawyer at the Foreign Office before entering politics in 2006 as an aide first to David Davis - the man he is now replacing - and then Dominic Grieve, the Remain-backing Tory MP. But his rise through the ministerial ranks has not been without controversy, with Mrs May taking particular offence at his description of some feminists as ""obnoxious bigots"" in a 2011 online article in which he attacked the ""equality bandwagon"" and said that men were getting ""a raw deal"". Mrs May, who was then minister for equalities as well as home secretary, accused him of fuelling ""gender warfare"". Date of birth:25 February 1974 (age 44) Job:Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, Conservative MP for Esher and Walton Education:Dr Challoner's Grammar School, Amersham, Oxford and Cambridge universities Family:Married to Erika Ray, a Brazilian marketing executive. Two children Before politics:Foreign office lawyer. He was the lead on a team focusing on bringing war criminals to justice at The Hague He was appointed civil liberties minister in the Ministry of Justice following David Cameron's general election victory in 2015. In 2017, he was branded ""offensive"" by then Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron after saying ""the typical user of a food bank is not someone that's languishing in poverty, it's someone who has a cash flow problem"". He played a prominent role in the Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, but was sacked from his junior ministerial role by Theresa May when she took over as prime minister following Mr Cameron's resignation. During her January 2018 reshuffle there were reports that Mr Raab had deliberately been sidelined as part of the ""new generation"" of Tory talent seen as a threat to the ""old guard"". Downing Street said his appointment as Brexit Secretary, an area the PM has made a personal priority, showed the ""high regard"" in which she held him. He proved a loyal pro-Brexit voice on the backbenches, and kept the Leave campaign flag flying as co-founder of the Change Britain campaign group. He was rewarded with a more senior role in the Ministry of Justice following last year's general election, and moved to the job of housing minister in January. There was further controversy when he suggested immigration was driving up house prices, with the Office for National Statistics demanding that he publish the study on which his claims were based. In May this year, his diary secretary was caught up in a Daily Mirror sting. He dismissed the paper's allegations that the 20-year-old had met men through a ""sugar daddy"" website as ""a storm in a teacup"". He said his first concern was for the welfare of the woman, who was suspended from her civil service job. The ""most salacious"" thing in the newspaper's story was an ""untrue"" claim that he ordered the same lunch every day, he told BBC News. The diary secretary was quoted as saying he ordered the same meal every day from Pret A Manger: ""He has the chicken Caesar and bacon baguette, SuperFruit pot and the Vitamin Volcano smoothie, every day. He is so weird. It's the Dom Raab Special.""

"David Davis, who has quit as Brexit secretary, had one of the toughest jobs in politics - negotiating Britain's exit from the EU - and he also has one of the most colourful CVs. A former SAS reservist, who grew up on a south London council estate, David Davis is a self-styled political maverick who had carved out a career as a champion of civil liberties before his unexpected return to front-line politics in July 2016 as secretary of state for exiting the EU. He took to the role of negotiating Brexit with characteristic swagger, brushing off accusations from critics that he was too lazy, or lacked the intellectual depth, for such an apparently complex and nuanced task. ""What's the requirement of my job? I don't have to be very clever. I don't have to know that much. I do just have to be calm,"" he told LBC radio. May meets Davis amid Brexit 'backstop' row Davis hits out at EU over Galileo Remain-backing MPs seize on Davis comment The Brexit secretary job might have been unexpected, but as a long-time opponent of Britain's EU membership it was an opportunity he grabbed with both hands. He proved more publicly loyal to Theresa May than fellow Brexiteer Boris Johnson, earning the trust of the prime minister as her representative in Brussels, in what have turned out to be fraught talks with his opposite number, Michel Barnier. His former reputation as someone who likes to be the centre of the media's attention - he once dramatically walked out of David Cameron's shadow cabinet and called a by-election - lingers on. His appearances before Hilary Benn's Brexit select committee have become box-office moments at Westminster. On one occasion, Mr Benn tried to pin him down about comments he had made in July 2016 - two days before Mrs May drafted him into the cabinet - when he said the UK would be able negotiate a free-trade area ""massively larger than the EU"" within two years of Brexit. A laughing Mr Davis said the comments had been made before he had become a minister, later adding: ""That was then, this is now."" Some of his former allies on the libertarian left struggled to come to terms with the new, ministerial Mr Davis. Mr Davis and David Cameron rarely saw eye to eye Journalist Henry Porter, who often shared a platform with him at debates and campaign events,wrote in the Observer,external:  ""I came to like him a lot and to admire his bounce and pugnacity. ""Among all the politicians I knew - with the possible exception of [Remain-supporting Tory MP] Dominic Grieve - David possessed the deepest instinct for liberty."" But Brexit clearly mattered far more to Mr Davis than protecting ancient Parliamentary liberties, said Porter, as he lamented the changes he had seen in his friend since taking on ministerial office. ""While I would be happy to be in the jungle or stuck in a lift with him, I would draw the line at being stranded in a planning room with him,"" he said. Mr Davis launched an unexpected leadership bid in 2001 Date of birth:21 December, 1948 (69) Most recent post:Secretary of state for exiting the EU, MP for Haltemprice and Howden since 1987 Education:Tooting Bec grammar school, Warwick University (Bsc molecular science and computer science), London Business School, Harvard University management school Family:Married Doreen in 1973. Three children Before politics:Senior executive at sugar giant Tate and Lyle Initially seen as an ultra-Thatcherite, David Davis was elected to Parliament in 1987, at the age of 38, after a career in management with sugar giant Tate and Lyle. But Mr Davis did not fit the traditional mould of a Tory MP. Despite being a passionate opponent of socialism in all its forms, his political hero is the late Tony Benn, father of Hilary and hero of the radical, Corbynista left. He had a troubled background. ""I was a wild kid,"" hetold an audience at the Royal Festival Hall in 2002, where he shared the stage with Mr Benn, something, he said, that would have made his Labour-voting parents very proud. The two bonded over their shared Euroscepticism - but little else - at that event. He got into Warwick University on an army scholarship and trained with the SAS as a reservist to help pay his way. His military background, and fearless attitude, endeared him to Tory grandees such as the late Alan Clark, another of his heroes, as he began his rise through the party ranks in the early 1990s. Over dinner hosted by Clark at his medieval Saltwood Castle, in Kent, Mr Davis agreed to walk along the crumbling ramparts overlooking the ruins of a chapel. ""[He] did the 'black' route without turning a hair, then retraced his footsteps, hands in pockets - first time that's ever been done!"" Clark wrote in his diary. ""He is an extraordinarily optimistic and self-confident person,"" Tory MP Andrew Mitchell - a long time friend and ally -told the BBC's Newsnight programme's Nick Watt last year. ""I remember one of the Cameroons saying to me in exasperation that he was the only person he knows who did not go to Eton but has the same level of self-confidence you get from an Eton education."" Despite his Eurosceptic views, Mr Davis served as a government whip under pro-EU Prime Minister John Major in the early 1990s, attempting to get rebel Tory MPs to support the Maastricht Treaty, which paved the way for closer European integration. Mr Davis later admitted the use of T-shirts emblazoned with his 2005 leadership campaign slogan, ""It's DD for me,"" had backfired He later served as Mr Major's Europe minister, helping to negotiate some of the agreements with Brussels he has since been charged with unpicking. His ""hard man"" image, working-class background and staunch right-wing credentials made him the frontrunner to replace Michael Howard as Conservative leader in 2005 (he had made an unexpected, and unsuccessful tilt at the job in 2001). He lost out to David Cameron, who made him shadow home secretary, where he carved out a distinctive niche for himself as a defender of traditional British freedoms, even though the two men had little time for each other. In 2008, he dramatically resigned his Haltemprice and Howden seat, and his frontbench role, to fight a by-election in protest at Labour's plans for identity cards and 42-day detention without charge. He won easily but rejected a job in the coalition government in 2010 to continue his civil liberties crusade from the backbenches, often in conflict with then Home Secretary Theresa May. He was involved in legal action against the government over Mrs May's data-retention plans - dubbed the ""snoopers' charter"" by critics - when he got the call to join her cabinet. Mr Davis will celebrate his 70th birthday in December, just over three months before Britain officially leaves the EU at the end of March 2019.

"Now he's gone and done it. For a long time it had been clear Boris Johnson was not happy with the prime minister's Brexit strategy. His dissatisfaction was more than just the odd off-colour remark, although goodness knows there were enough of those. His departure is a huge story and turns what might have been a couple of days of significant turmoil, into a significant crisis for Theresa May and the whole Brexit project. He was Brexit's main cheerleader, the politician most associated with making it happen, and one of the best known politicians in the country, for good or ill. Boris Johnson quits amid Brexit crisis Live: Reaction as Johnson and Davis resign It's enough of a mess on its own. But a well-connected source has just told me it could be more serious than that. They said it is a concerted push to force the prime minister to drop her Chequers compromise. ""If she doesn't drop Chequers there will be another,"" they said, ""then another, then another, then another."" But if she can't force a compromise through her party that itself took months to stitch together, the prime minister's authority would be significantly diminished. As Mr Johnson is hemmed in by paparazzi and camera crews outside his official residence that will soon be no longer his home, Theresa May is also a hostage with no obvious means of escape.

"Will was walking over Westminster Bridge in London when a car crashed into him from behind. He didn't know it, but he'd been caught up in a terror attack that killed five people and injured 50. In the chaos that followed a stranger looked after him. But then they were separated and he could only remember her face... Will is stressed. He's due to meet the team he'll be working with at his new job and he's running late. He's taken extra care with his outfit today, wearing smart jeans and his favourite brown suede shoes. As he rushes down the road he decides the quickest route will be to take the Jubilee Line from Westminster underground station. He walks on to Westminster Bridge and starts to cross the Thames towards Parliament. Cristina is in a pound shop picking up cleaning products. She's just come from a talk about the economies of developing nations - a topic she became interested in while volunteering in China and Myanmar. Placing her purchases in her bike basket, she decides to head home via Westminster Bridge. It's a little out of her way but Cristina considers it the prettiest bridge in London. She pushes off from the kerb and merges into the traffic. There are a lot of tourists on the north side of the bridge so Will crosses to the other side where he can walk faster. He sprays deodorant under his shirt as he goes. It's a miserable March day and he curses as it starts to rain. He suddenly hears a car accelerating loudly behind him. He has the sensation of being propelled forward, before everything goes dark. Cristina thinks nothing of the heavy traffic but then she hears screams. She sees people streaming off the bridge and a passer-by tells her to turn back as there has been a terrible accident. Instead she parks her bike and continues on foot. She has basic nursing training and thinks she can help. She reaches a young man in brown shoes lying on the wet road with another man hovering over him. She asks if there is anything she can do. ""Please can you take over? I need to leave,"" the man on his feet replies, clearly agitated. Emergency vehicles on Westminster Bridge following the terror attack Cristina agrees and kneels down. She takes the injured man's hand and asks his name. ""It's amazing how our friendship came out of something so horrific and terrible,"" Will says. ""We wouldn't ordinarily have crossed paths. We're different ages, have different professions and live and work in different areas."" It's a year later and he's sitting with Cristina at the back of a busy brasserie in Soho. The sun is streaming through the windows and on the street outside office workers are mingling and sipping their first post-work pints. Both have just come from work - Will, 25, from his job rejuvenating the area around Baker Street and Cristina, 34, from a meeting with an advertising firm. While Will grew up in London, Cristina moved to the city from Portugal 12 years ago. It was an act of terror by Khalid Masood that brought them to the same place at the same time. On 22 March 2017, he drove a hired car into dozens of pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and stabbed to death an unarmed police officer, before being shot and killed himself. Will told his story to Georgia Catt on BBC Radio 4'sThe Untold. Listen to it on theBBC iPlayer. Will believes he was the second person to be struck by Masood's car. He woke up to find himself lying in a wet gutter. ""I had a strong sensation of pain all over my body,"" he says. ""I could see the London Eye and County Hall from where I was and I could hear a lot of panic and distress but I wasn't really aware of what it was about."" Cristina came across Will just a few minutes later. ""Will didn't look badly injured but he was very confused. He was panicking because he had to go somewhere but he couldn't remember where,"" she says. ""I held him and hugged him and tried to keep him calm by asking him lots of questions. We were sitting on the kerb watching this awful scene, having a mundane conversation about his parents and his job."" Cristina reached Will a few minutes after he was struck by Masood's car They waited as the paramedics dealt with the most urgent cases. Will had scrapes down his back and a mass of bruises down his leg and was taken to hospital in the last ambulance that left the bridge. There was no room for Cristina. ""I terribly wanted to go with him, but I knew it wasn't my place as there was a young policeman, Special Constable Thomson, with him,"" she says. ""Due to the chaos, no-one had asked me for my details, so I simply walked off the bridge."" Cristina continued to believe it was an accident until she called her boyfriend. He told her it had been a terrorist attack and that she should head home. Cycling back to her empty flat, she called Will's firm to explain what had happened. ""I knew lots about him so I then tracked him down on Facebook and left a message saying, 'I hope you're OK, let me know.' ""I think I was in a state of shock. It was like going through a violent 3D movie. I didn't feel like going out again so I stayed at home that evening."" The first ambulance arrived six minutes after the emergency services were called Meanwhile, Will's condition began to worsen.  As a lower-priority case he was left to sit in A&E as medics rushed around him. Then he began to feel nauseous. ""My speech started to go strange. I was trying to say things and the wrong word would come out. They put me in a wheelchair and I started throwing up. Every time they tried to lay me down I'd be sick."" When police officers came to take away his clothes and bag, he tried to ask to keep his phone but struggled to express himself. The doctors began to seem concerned. Following X-rays and CT scans he was put in a head brace. ""The hospital staff had a sense of urgency and I thought, 'Oh God what if I don't come through this?'"" Due to the brace he could only see the ceiling. He remembers his parents arriving and having to peer over his trolley for him to see their faces. Will was diagnosed with a carotid artery dissection - a tear in one of the arteries in his neck had allowed blood to enter the artery wall and split its layers, forming a blood clot. He was given medication to thin his blood and reduce his risk of having a stroke. ""I just wanted to sleep so I could just pretend it hadn't happened, but I couldn't, mainly because of the pain,"" he says. Will's books, and teacakes, in hospital In the following days Cristina tried to put her experience behind her. She only told a few friends who asked her why she looked shaken. But she didn't tell her mother in Portugal because she didn't want to worry her. She also chose to keep it from her colleagues. ""There was nothing to tell,"" she says. ""I couldn't relate what had happened to me to this big national event."" In the weeks following the attack Cristina continued to cycle around London. However, she found that she felt on edge and anxious if a car passed close by. ""I went through a phase where I would do an assessment of whether the road might be suitable for an attack,"" she says. However, she felt strangely calm when she crossed Westminster Bridge again. ""I think it's because I thought an attack wouldn't happen in the same place twice."" Cristina hadn't heard from Will but assumed he would get back to her when he was ready. She didn't know that he was actively trying to find her. Will with his mother on top of the London hospital where he was treated In hospital Will slowly regained his ability to walk. He was aware that people were talking about Westminster Bridge in hushed voices. He asked the hospital psychologist for details and he suggested they go through a newspaper article with Will's father. ""My dad summarised it for me and said what the pictures showed. I didn't really think about the driver, I just felt very overwhelmed by the scale of it all,"" he says. Will's memory of the bridge was hazy. However, he remembered that a woman had looked after him and he wanted to track her down to thank her. ""I thought she might be Spanish and I knew she had good teeth because I remember her smiling a lot. ""So the police were going through the witness statements to find someone like that!"" After a week in hospital Will moved back in with his parents. He was given his sister's room as it had a ""nice double bed"", while she moved to his old box room. ""It was quite intense,"" he says. ""I'd moved away from home when I was 18 and was very independent. It was difficult to be looked after and have decisions made for me."" Will in the Soho brasserie Will wanted to get better as quickly as possible. He had several appointments most days, visiting the hospital and meeting with a counsellor, the Victim Support charity and police liaison officers. He needed to nap during the day due to the extreme exhaustion brought on by his head injuries. ""I felt dizzy a lot of the time, my eating was on and off and I wasn't sleeping much at night because my neck was so painful,"" he says. ""I had to take breaks from other people as well. People were obviously concerned and wanted to know what happened but I ended up repeating a sort of script."" Friends and neighbours left food at the door, which Will found touching but also overwhelming. ""I just don't like attention,"" he says, shifting in his chair. Prince Harry and Prince William also attended the Service of Hope in Westminster Abbey Soon after moving home Will was invited to a service at Westminster Abbey for everyone who had been involved in the attack. Afterwards he decided to walk across the bridge with his family. ""It was a normal day with lots of tourists everywhere and people going about their business. You couldn't really tell what had happened, although there were barriers up. ""It was strange as I didn't really feel like I had been there, as I couldn't remember very much."" A month after the attack, Will was disappointed to learn that the police hadn't found the woman who helped him. But the next day while checking Facebook, he spotted some messages from people not on his contacts list. ""I had one from a cousin and then I came across a message from Cristina that basically said, 'You won't remember me but I helped you on Westminster Bridge. Please let me know you're OK.' ""I ran - well I hobbled - down the stairs and I read it to my mum and dad but I couldn't finish it. They were both in tears."" Will responded straight away and they arranged to meet. ""It was so strange,"" Cristina says, in the brasserie where their reunion had taken place a year earlier. ""I felt very close to Will but he didn't really remember our conversation."" ""I recognised her straight away,"" Will says. ""And we hugged - Cristina is a real hugger."" Will and Cristina in the cafe where they met for the first time after the attack Will had brought a map so Cristina could point out where she found him and take him through what happened. He also gave her a card from his mother, thanking her for staying and looking after him on the bridge. ""It really helped my family to know that someone had looked after me when they couldn't,"" Will says. Over the following weeks they continued to meet for coffee. At first Will wanted to know some more details about the attack but slowly their chats turned to what was going on in their lives. ""How do you become friends with a person? I think we think about things in a similar way,"" Will says. ""It was very natural,"" agrees Cristina. ""We'd meet to check in with how he was and then we'd talk about how I was. We were both going through big things."" Cristina ended her long-term relationship with her boyfriend, while Will started his new job and moved back in with his flatmates. ""There isn't any manual for how to move on after a terrorist attack,"" Will says. ""I just went with my gut as I wanted to regain control of my life. I didn't want to sit at home feeling sad about what had happened and frustrated that I couldn't do any exercise."" However, the transition was more difficult than he had expected and he found he was less confident about making decisions. ""I felt very up and down. There were moments I felt terrible but then also moments when I felt really empowered,"" he says. Will and Cristina at Cristina's flat Through it all he knew he could talk to Cristina. ""It was really helpful during a time when I felt crap about what had happened to have someone who had seen me at my worst,"" he says. ""She wasn't cautious with me at all and was very honest. If I said something very melancholy she'd get me to consider other things."" Cristina adds: ""It also gave me a trusting space to talk."" As the months passed, Will's medication was reduced and his appointments became less frequent. He finished trauma therapy but continued to see an NHS counsellor once a month. ""I was thinking about it [the attack] less and it was becoming less significant,"" says Will. ""Until something happened that reminded me of it."" In November, he was in a taxi with a colleague just off Oxford Street when he saw panic-stricken people running past the car. They got out and sought shelter in an office reception. After half an hour and with little information to go on they decided to join their colleagues in a nearby hotel. ""We crossed Oxford Street and it was completely deserted. Everyone was locked in shops."" Armed police responding to the ""incident"" on Oxford Street on November 24, 2017 They reached the hotel where a back room had been set up with food for them and people evacuated from Selfridges. Will then realised he was experiencing a fight-or-flight response. ""I had difficulty breathing, my hands and arms went numb, I couldn't stand up as my legs were just jelly. Eventually my panic came down but it left me exhausted."" The panic had been caused by rumours of a gunman on the loose. This turned out to be a false alarm, but it still had an effect on Will. ""I took a week off work to recover,"" he says. ""You made yourself go back to Oxford Street,"" Cristina prompts. ""That's right. I went once during the day when it was a bit quieter,"" he agrees. Last month, Will received the upsetting news that he still can't return to swimming, jogging or cycling - all activities he enjoyed before the attack. Doctors say vigorous activity could damage his carotid artery, which is still healing. ""I do get angry, I have moments of frustration that I'm still not better,"" he says. ""But I do think I've done a lot of growing. I have a greater perspective on what's important in my life and I don't worry so much about what other people think."" Hospital staff leave flowers on Westminster Bridge on the anniversary of the attack Cristina says: ""I feel privileged to have been around him this year. ""Will's a really generous and sensitive person and very open to the world. Meeting him marked a new caring way of being in my life."" The two of them catch up in person every few weeks. ""Cristina is very strong and supportive. She's just a genuinely lovely person,"" Will says, meeting her gaze. ""A friend of my mum was talking to her recently about people have angels. She thinks you were an angel for me that day. ""I'm very happy you chose to walk on to the bridge.""

"Nissan says it has uncovered falsified data from car exhaust emissions tests at most of its Japanese factories. The firm said emissions and fuel economy tests had ""deviated from the prescribed testing environment"". The carmaker added that inspection reports had been ""based on altered measurement values"". Nissan pledged there would be a ""full and comprehensive investigation"" and said ""appropriate measures"" would be taken to stop any future recurrence. Nissan said it was looking into whether whether the issue affected vehicles exported from Japan to other markets. The company said it had rechecked ""reliable"" data and confirmed that all vehicles except the GT-R sports car conformed to Japanese safety standards. The GT-R was not included because it had not been able to check enough vehicles as yet. by Jonty Bloom, BBC business correspondent This is a very embarrassing affair for Nissan and it will damage its reputation, but it does not seem at the highest levels to have been deliberately trying to beat the system. VW was caught cheating emissions testing by deliberately writing software that meant its cars met emissions standards only when they were being tested but not at any other time. Nissan on the other hand seems to have been running its testing system very badly, they did not meet legal requirements and measurements were altered. That does not sound as bad as what happened at VW but it is still very shocking. This was going on at all of Nissan's factories in Japan, bar one; that means it is hardly a one-off accident or down to a few rotten apples. Nissan is still investigating what went wrong. But, if this scandal ends here, Nissan will probably be able to say it made a sin of omission rather than VW's sin of commission. Nissan's shares fell more than 4.5% on Monday after the company alerted investors that a statement on exhaust emissions was imminent. Last year,Nissan recalled 1.2 million vehicles in Japanafter regulators said safety checks did not meet domestic requirements. A subsequent investigation into why its safety inspections did not meet government standards has now led to the latest revelations. The admission by Nissan comes after a huge scandal involving diesel emissions test cheating by Germany's Volkswagen. Last month,VW was fined â¬1bn (Â£880m) by German prosecutorsfor selling more than 10 million cars between mid-2007 and 2015 that had test-cheating software installed.

"This video can not be played Theresa May pays tribute to the two ministers who resigned Boris Johnson has launched a scathing attack on Theresa May's Brexit strategy, saying the ""dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt"". In his letter resigning as foreign secretary, he said the prime minister was leading the UK into a ""semi-Brexit"" with the ""status of a colony"". His resignation came hours after Brexit Secretary David Davis quit the cabinet. Mrs May said she was ""sorry - and a little surprised"" by Mr Johnson's move after his apparent support on Friday. She said the deal agreed by the cabinet after their ""productive discussions"" at Chequers would ""honour the result of the referendum"" and allow the UK to ""take back control of our borders, our law and our money"".

She earlier faced her critics at a packed meeting of backbench Conservative MPs, many of whom share Mr Johnson's concerns about her Brexit stance. Loud applause could be heard at the end of the 1922 Committee meeting, which the PM attended for just over an hour. Leaving the gathering, leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said he did not think there would be a confidence vote over Mrs May. But ministerial aide Chris Green resigned his position as a parliamentary private secretary to the Department for Transport after the meeting, saying in a letter to Mrs May that she had confirmed his fears that ""we would not really leave the EU"" under her proposals. Mr Johnson's parliamentary private secretary Conor Burn has also stepped down. Brexit minister Steve Baker also left the government. Housing minister Dominic Raab has replaced Mr Davis as Brexit secretary. Mr Johnson does not pull any punches, saying Brexit ""should be about opportunity and hope"" and a ""chance to do things differently"", but ""that dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt"". He claims crucial decisions have been postponed, including preparations for a ""no-deal"" scenario, ""with the result that we appear to be heading for a semi-Brexit, with large parts of the economy still locked in the EU system, but with no UK control over that system"". Boris Johnson's resignation letter in full In her letter accepting his resignation, the prime minister said she had allowed cabinet ministers ""considerable latitude to express their individual views"" on Brexit. ""But the agreement we reached on Friday marks the point where that is no longer the case and if you are not able to provide the support we need to secure this deal in the interests of the United Kingdom, it is right that you should step down."" The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU afterwards. There have been differences within the Conservatives over how far the UK should prioritise the economy by compromising on issues such as leaving the remit of the European Court of Justice and ending free movement of people. Mrs May only has a majority in Parliament with the support of the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, so any split raises questions about whether her plan could survive a Commons vote. She took her entire cabinet to her country residence on Friday to try to get agreement on a UK vision for post-Brexit relations. An agreement was announcedafter the 12-hour meeting, but many Brexiteers have been unhappy with the deal which they think will lead to the ""worst of both worlds"". Read Laura's full blog on Boris Johnson resigning Profile: Boris Johnson This video can not be played David Davis explains why he resigned The man leading the UK's negotiating team, David Davis, resigned late on Sunday night, saying that he did not agree with the UK's proposals, so was the wrong person to be going into negotiations with them. He told the BBC that he thought the UK was giving away ""too much, too easily"" and predicted that the EU would be demanding more concessions in talks. Mr Davis, who had been Brexit secretary since Mrs May became prime minister in 2016, said he had made compromises since taking on the role, but this was ""one compromise too far"". Speaking in a boisterous House of Commons, Mrs May defended the Brexit plan agreed on Friday, which would see the UK agreeing a ""common rulebook"" with the EU for trading in goods, but not services, after Brexit. At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan She paid tribute to Mr Johnson's ""passion"" in championing a global Britain after Brexit and Mr Davis' work in steering through key Brexit legislation. But she told MPs: ""We do not agree on the best way to deliver our shared commitments to honour the result of the referendum."" This video can not be played PM: ""If the EU continues on this course, there is a serious risk it could lead to no deal"" Mrs May told MPs that the plan agreed by the cabinet at Chequers was the basis of a ""responsible and credible"" offer to restart renegotiations with the EU. But she warned that if the EU did not engage with her plan, there was a ""serious risk"" of the UK leaving in March 2019 without a deal in a ""disorderly"" manner. Under her proposal, a treaty would be signed committing the UK to ""continued harmonisation"" with EU rules - avoiding friction at the UK-EU border, including Northern Ireland. But Parliament would oversee the UK's trade policy and have the ability to ""choose"" to diverge from the EU rules. Freedom of movement would come to an end but a ""mobility framework"" would ensure UK and EU citizens can continue to study and work in each other's territories. Reality Check: What's the EU common rulebook? Brexit: All you need to know Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Johnson and Mr Davis had abandoned a ""sinking ship"", shattering the ""illusion of unity"" initially surrounding the Chequers plan. There was a crisis in government, he said, adding: ""It is clear this government cannot secure a good deal for Britain."" This video can not be played The PM's recent comments about restored ""cabinet responsibility"" drew laughs in the House of Commons. Mrs May came under pressure from prominent Tory Brexiteers on the backbenches, with ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith urging her to rule out further concessions during the talks. The European Commission declined to comment on the resignations but Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said he hoped a change in faces might lead to a change in policy.

Brussels fears UK turmoil may lead to no-deal Brexit The UK and the EU have been negotiating Brexit terms for more than a year now and have been hoping to agree broad aims for their future relationship in October. The aim of the Chequers away day had been to agree the UK position - after two years of discussion - but the resignations have put a question mark over that. The uncertainty in the UK comes before the plan is officially put to the EU, who may well be unhappy with aspects of it they have previously referred to as ""cherry picking"". One other element of Friday's agreement worth noting is that it pledged to speed up preparations for the UK to be ready to leave the EU without a Brexit deal in March next year. Nigel Farage has said he will consider standing for the UKIP leadership for a fourth time when it becomes vacant in March next year, if Brexit is not ""back on track"" and the Chequers agreement still stands. He backed Mr Johnson, saying the former foreign secretary had the chance to ""save Brexit"" by moving against the prime minister.

"This video can not be played David Davis explains why he resigned David Davis, who has been leading UK negotiations to leave the EU, has quit his role as Brexit Secretary He told the BBC that he was no longer the best person to deliver the PM's Brexit plan - agreed by the cabinet on Friday - as he did not ""believe"" in it. He said the ""career-ending"" decision was a personal one but he felt the UK was ""giving away too much and too easily"" to the EU in the negotiations. Mrs May said she did not agree but thanked him for his work. The resignation is a blow to Mrs May as she seeks to win over Eurosceptic MPs to her proposed Brexit vision, which would form the basis of the UK's position in on-going talks with the EU. Live: Reaction as David Davis resigns Raab replaces Davis as Brexit Secretary At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan Brexit: All you need to know Dominic Raab, who campaigned for Leave during the UK's 2016 EU referendum, has been promoted from housing minister to take over from Mr Davis. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU afterwards. There have been differences within the Conservative Party over how far the UK should prioritise the economy by compromising on issues such as leaving the remit of the European Court of Justice and ending free movement of people. Mrs May's Conservative Party only has a majority in Parliament with the support in key votes of the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, so any split raises questions about whether her plan could survive a Commons vote - and has also led to renewed questions about whether she will face a challenge to her position. Mr Davis said he told the PM at Chequers that he was the ""odd man out"" in objecting to the plans In a sign of how delicately positioned the numbers are on Brexit strategy it has emerged that the government has taken the unusual step of arranging a briefing for opposition Labour MPs on the detail of the Brexit plan agreed on Friday. In his resignation letter, Mr Davis told Mrs May that ""the current trend of policy and tactics"" was making it ""look less and less likely"" that the UK would leave the customs union and single market. He said he was ""unpersuaded"" that the government's negotiating approach ""will not just lead to further demands for concessions"" from Brussels. Mr Davis, who was appointed Brexit Secretary in 2016, said: ""The general direction of policy will leave us in at best a weak negotiating position, and possibly an inescapable one."" In her reply, Mrs May said: ""I do not agree with your characterisation of the policy we agreed at cabinet on Friday."" She said she was ""sorry"" he was leaving but would ""like to thank you warmly for everything you have done... to shape our departure from the EU"".

He said it was ""not tenable"" for him to stay in post and try to persuade Tory MPs to back the policy when he did not think it was ""workable"". ""The best person to do this is someone who really believes in it, not me."" He said he feared the EU would seek to further water down the UK's plans and his resignation would make it easier for the UK to resist attempts to extract further concessions. Brexit: Your guide to the jargon David Davis: The maverick minister Resignation letter and May's reply in full Mr Davis told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that he had been compromising for two years and that the latest plan was ""a compromise too far"". But Mr Davis insisted he continued to back Theresa May, saying that if he ""wanted to bring her down"", the time would have been after she failed to win last year's general election outright. A leadership contest now would be ""the wrong thing to do"", adding: ""I won't throw my hat into the ring."" Eurosceptic MP Steve Baker has also resigned. He played a leading role in the Brexit campaign in the run up to the 2016 referendum. He was promoted to the Department for Exiting the EU as a parliamentary under-secretary in June last year. Conservative MP Peter Bone hailed Mr Davis's resignation as a ""principled and brave decision"", adding: ""The PM's proposals for a Brexit in name only are not acceptable.""

By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg After many months of rumours that he would pull the plug, David Davis has actually quit as Brexit Secretary. His unhappiness in government has been no secret for some time, but after the prime minister's Chequers agreement with cabinet ministers to pursue closer ties with the EU than he desired, he found his position untenable. After a visit to Downing Street on Sunday he concluded that he had no choice but to walk. The move, while not completely surprising, throws doubt on to how secure the government's Brexit strategy is. Read Laura's full blog here Mrs May is due to address MPs on Monday afternoon and is expected to tell MPs that the strategy agreed by the cabinet at Chequers on Friday is the ""right Brexit"" for Britain. Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said it would be ""very difficult"" for Mrs May's plans to win the backing of MPs without Mr Davis. He told BBC 5 Live: ""These proposals will have to come to the House of Commons in legislation and the question is 'will they command support from Conservative MPs?' ""And I think without David Davis there, without his imprimatur, it will be very difficult for them to get the support of Conservative MPs and therefore the prime minister would be well advised to reconsider them."" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she understands Mr Davis was ""furious"" after a meeting at No 10 earlier on Sunday and ""concluded he could not stay in post"". The resignation came as people awaited the verdicts of senior figures from the Brexit side of the 2016 referendum.  There has yet been no on the record comment from Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, while Environment Secretary Michael Gove told the BBC on Sunday he was urging Tory MPs to support Mrs May. This video can not be played 'Be generous or we'll walk away' - Gove's warning to EU One of the leading pro-Remain Conservative MPs Anna Soubry did not refer directly to Mr Davis's resignation, buttweeted,externalit was ""not the time for egos, grandstanding and blind ideology"". The director-general of the CBI, Carolyn Fairbairn, said the resignation was ""a blow"", adding that business had welcomed the agreement of ministers on Friday. Meanwhile, some Remain-supporting politicians said the resignation was evidence of the need for a second referendum. Lord Adonis, a prominent backer of a second vote,tweeted,external: ""People's Vote to put Brexit out of its misery a big step closer after DD's resignation. Now the Brexiteers holding Mrs May hostage are falling out, there isn't a majority for any withdrawal treaty in Parliament."" The Liberal Democrats called on people to sign a petition for a vote on the proposed deal, adding: ""The resignation of David Davis is yet more evidence of the chaos of this Tory Brexit. You deserve the final say"". Nigel Farage congratulated Mr Davis for quitting and called for Mrs May to be replaced as prime minister, accusing her of being ""duplicitous"" and claiming her response ""shows she is controlled by the civil service"".

"This video can not be played In full: Davis interview with Kuenssberg Is it really leaving at all? ""I don't think so."" Forget the politicking and the crazy, bitter briefings. If the past few weeks has been like watching the Conservative Party have a nervous breakdown in front of our eyes, this morning they are truly losing the plot. Set aside the psychodrama about minicab cards, late night phone calls, toasts over dinner at Chequers, a foreign secretary no one can find. More of that later no doubt. What sticks out the most from my interview with David Davis this morning is a very simple question we asked. Is the prime minister's plan really leaving the EU? ""I don't think so"", he said. Live: Reaction as Davis and Johnson quit Kuenssberg: More Brexiteer resignations to come? Raab replaces Davis as Brexit secretary That is the sentiment that's widely shared among the Tory party, and perhaps among many voters too. And guess what? It doesn't always matter which side of the referendum they were on either. Some former Remainers say ""look, this is a dodgy compromise, what's the point? If we are going to do this, then for goodness sake let's do it properly or just stay in"". From some Leavers, like Mr Davis, you also get ""look, this is a dodgy compromise, what's the point? If we are going to do it, then for goodness sake let's do it properly"". Yes, I did mean to write the same line twice just then. We are a million miles from Tory unity, but weirdly there is some agreement at the fringes of the party that the current compromise is, as compromises so often are, something that pleases hardly anyone. And it would be better for No 10 just to go the ""full Norway"", a close relationship with the EU not a Viking experience, or the ""Canada plus"", a free trade agreement not a ten-day tour of the Rockies, or frankly, not leave at all. David Davis' resignation on its own - so far - is not going to bring down the government. It could well unleash a host of events that leads us to that place, but we're still a long way from that. But what it does do is take the lid off the boiling pot of frustration, angst, ambition and despair you find in pockets of the governing party and a sense on both sides that this kind of Brexit might not be worth it. That's not to say most Tory MPs are in the mood for a giant ruckus. Most of them in fact probably back the Chequers compromise, grateful at last that the Cabinet - well most of them - found agreement. And believing, quite possibly correctly, that the vast majority of the public aren't paying attention to much of the flouncing in any case, so can ministers please, please, please, please, get on with it and just shut up. For Number 10, the Chequers plan is a clever enough compromise they believe can get the EU on to the next phase of negotiations. Remember - all of this is happening in order that officials can get down to actually negotiating the nitty-gritty of the long term relationship. It is perfectly possible that within 72 hours or so it is situation normal, well normal-ish. But David Davis was an ""active backbencher"", who delighted in making waves on the issues he cares about for many years. If he thinks Theresa May's Brexit does not mean Brexit, expect plenty of trouble ahead even if today's particular storm passes before the heat wave breaks.

"David Davis, who has quit as Brexit secretary, had one of the toughest jobs in politics - negotiating Britain's exit from the EU - and he also has one of the most colourful CVs. A former SAS reservist, who grew up on a south London council estate, David Davis is a self-styled political maverick who had carved out a career as a champion of civil liberties before his unexpected return to front-line politics in July 2016 as secretary of state for exiting the EU. He took to the role of negotiating Brexit with characteristic swagger, brushing off accusations from critics that he was too lazy, or lacked the intellectual depth, for such an apparently complex and nuanced task. ""What's the requirement of my job? I don't have to be very clever. I don't have to know that much. I do just have to be calm,"" he told LBC radio. May meets Davis amid Brexit 'backstop' row Davis hits out at EU over Galileo Remain-backing MPs seize on Davis comment The Brexit secretary job might have been unexpected, but as a long-time opponent of Britain's EU membership it was an opportunity he grabbed with both hands. He proved more publicly loyal to Theresa May than fellow Brexiteer Boris Johnson, earning the trust of the prime minister as her representative in Brussels, in what have turned out to be fraught talks with his opposite number, Michel Barnier. His former reputation as someone who likes to be the centre of the media's attention - he once dramatically walked out of David Cameron's shadow cabinet and called a by-election - lingers on. His appearances before Hilary Benn's Brexit select committee have become box-office moments at Westminster. On one occasion, Mr Benn tried to pin him down about comments he had made in July 2016 - two days before Mrs May drafted him into the cabinet - when he said the UK would be able negotiate a free-trade area ""massively larger than the EU"" within two years of Brexit. A laughing Mr Davis said the comments had been made before he had become a minister, later adding: ""That was then, this is now."" Some of his former allies on the libertarian left struggled to come to terms with the new, ministerial Mr Davis. Mr Davis and David Cameron rarely saw eye to eye Journalist Henry Porter, who often shared a platform with him at debates and campaign events,wrote in the Observer,external:  ""I came to like him a lot and to admire his bounce and pugnacity. ""Among all the politicians I knew - with the possible exception of [Remain-supporting Tory MP] Dominic Grieve - David possessed the deepest instinct for liberty."" But Brexit clearly mattered far more to Mr Davis than protecting ancient Parliamentary liberties, said Porter, as he lamented the changes he had seen in his friend since taking on ministerial office. ""While I would be happy to be in the jungle or stuck in a lift with him, I would draw the line at being stranded in a planning room with him,"" he said. Mr Davis launched an unexpected leadership bid in 2001 Date of birth:21 December, 1948 (69) Most recent post:Secretary of state for exiting the EU, MP for Haltemprice and Howden since 1987 Education:Tooting Bec grammar school, Warwick University (Bsc molecular science and computer science), London Business School, Harvard University management school Family:Married Doreen in 1973. Three children Before politics:Senior executive at sugar giant Tate and Lyle Initially seen as an ultra-Thatcherite, David Davis was elected to Parliament in 1987, at the age of 38, after a career in management with sugar giant Tate and Lyle. But Mr Davis did not fit the traditional mould of a Tory MP. Despite being a passionate opponent of socialism in all its forms, his political hero is the late Tony Benn, father of Hilary and hero of the radical, Corbynista left. He had a troubled background. ""I was a wild kid,"" hetold an audience at the Royal Festival Hall in 2002, where he shared the stage with Mr Benn, something, he said, that would have made his Labour-voting parents very proud. The two bonded over their shared Euroscepticism - but little else - at that event. He got into Warwick University on an army scholarship and trained with the SAS as a reservist to help pay his way. His military background, and fearless attitude, endeared him to Tory grandees such as the late Alan Clark, another of his heroes, as he began his rise through the party ranks in the early 1990s. Over dinner hosted by Clark at his medieval Saltwood Castle, in Kent, Mr Davis agreed to walk along the crumbling ramparts overlooking the ruins of a chapel. ""[He] did the 'black' route without turning a hair, then retraced his footsteps, hands in pockets - first time that's ever been done!"" Clark wrote in his diary. ""He is an extraordinarily optimistic and self-confident person,"" Tory MP Andrew Mitchell - a long time friend and ally -told the BBC's Newsnight programme's Nick Watt last year. ""I remember one of the Cameroons saying to me in exasperation that he was the only person he knows who did not go to Eton but has the same level of self-confidence you get from an Eton education."" Despite his Eurosceptic views, Mr Davis served as a government whip under pro-EU Prime Minister John Major in the early 1990s, attempting to get rebel Tory MPs to support the Maastricht Treaty, which paved the way for closer European integration. Mr Davis later admitted the use of T-shirts emblazoned with his 2005 leadership campaign slogan, ""It's DD for me,"" had backfired He later served as Mr Major's Europe minister, helping to negotiate some of the agreements with Brussels he has since been charged with unpicking. His ""hard man"" image, working-class background and staunch right-wing credentials made him the frontrunner to replace Michael Howard as Conservative leader in 2005 (he had made an unexpected, and unsuccessful tilt at the job in 2001). He lost out to David Cameron, who made him shadow home secretary, where he carved out a distinctive niche for himself as a defender of traditional British freedoms, even though the two men had little time for each other. In 2008, he dramatically resigned his Haltemprice and Howden seat, and his frontbench role, to fight a by-election in protest at Labour's plans for identity cards and 42-day detention without charge. He won easily but rejected a job in the coalition government in 2010 to continue his civil liberties crusade from the backbenches, often in conflict with then Home Secretary Theresa May. He was involved in legal action against the government over Mrs May's data-retention plans - dubbed the ""snoopers' charter"" by critics - when he got the call to join her cabinet. Mr Davis will celebrate his 70th birthday in December, just over three months before Britain officially leaves the EU at the end of March 2019.

"David Davis' unhappiness has been not secret for some time After many months of rumours that he would pull the plug, David Davis has actually quit as Brexit Secretary. His unhappiness in government has been no secret for some time, but after the prime minister's Chequers agreement with cabinet ministers to pursue closer ties with the EU than he desired, he found his position untenable. After a visit to Downing Street on Sunday he concluded that he had no choice but to walk. Junior ministerial colleague Steve Baker has also quit alongside him from the Brexit department. David Davis' move, while not completely surprising, throws doubt on to how secure the government's Brexit strategy is. Some of Theresa May's colleagues had urged her to face down her Brexiteer ministers but Number 10 had hoped to keep them all on side, and a carefully designed strategy to move them to her position brokered an agreement in cabinet at the end of their day-long meeting at Chequers on Friday . Theresa May secured her cabinet's support at a meeting at Chequers on Friday But Mr Davis, who was meant to be responsible for Brexit policy, felt,  according to colleagues, that he was ""wondering if he really had a proper job"" after Number 10 chose to follow a very different path to the now former Brexit secretary's intention. Mr Davis has been frustrated for some time after the most senior official at the Department for Exiting the EU - Olly Robbins - was moved into Number 10 to work directly for Theresa May. To some former Remainers, Mr Davis' departure could even be considered a temporary relief. One of his fellow ministers remarked, ""it's just a personal outburst"", adding: ""He is not exactly the cleverest, he has always struggled to muscle into any of the complicated arguments."" But conditions in the Tory party are febrile. Theresa May had carefully constructed her cabinet with a balance of Brexiteers and former Remainers. With no majority, and unhappiness on the back benches, it adds instability at a time when the prime minister was pursuing calm. And when she was hoping to project an image to Brussels of authority and stability, it is a headache she could well do without. He could provide a rallying point from outside government for those forces in the Tory party who believe the Brexit plan the prime minister is pursuing is not the Brexit that a clear but narrow majority of the public chose. Michael Gove was tipped as a replacement for David Davis Westminster being Westminster, eyes will immediately turn to who will replace him. The most likely candidate it seems at this stage is Michael Gove who has pitched himself as the Brexiteer that ""remainers can do business with"". His public appearances defending the Brexit policy over the weekend make him certainly near the top of the list for one of the most important jobs in government.

"The boys who were rescued on Monday are said to be in reasonable health Divers have rescued four more boys from a vast cave system in northern Thailand on the second day of a complex operation. The Thai Navy Seals leading the rescue operation have confirmed that eight boys in total have been extracted. Four boys and their football coach remain inside the caves. Rescuers will try to free them on Tuesday. The group became trapped on 23 June after heavy rains caused flooding, and was found last week by divers. Four boys were brought out safely on Sunday, but the mission was paused overnight for air tanks to be replaced. On Monday, air ambulances were seen departing from the area around the cave system and ambulances were seen arriving at the hospital in the nearby town of Chiang Rai. The boys have not been seen in public, but have been pronounced to be in reasonable health. Who are the Thai boys trapped in a cave? How risky is the Thai boys rescue? The rescue operation is complicated by sections in the cave involving diving - sometimes in very confined spaces - and climbing. The BBC's Dan Johnson, at the scene, says it is a careful, delicate operation fraught with risk. But he adds that this daring, dangerous and complicated exercise is delivering success against difficult odds, and relief is starting to break the tension of the situation. The group of boys and their coach were found after nine days After Monday's operation had wound down for the day, rescue mission chief Narongsak Osottanakorn told reporters: ""All four boys have arrived at hospital, all are safe."" He said the second day of the operation had gone more smoothly than the first, taking two hours less as the procedure became more refined. Tuesday morning will see the start of attempts to rescue the remaining four boys and the football coach. A massive pumping operation is said to have helped lower the water level inside the cave system, making the journey in and out easier than it was. The Thai authorities say the rescued boys are able to eat rice porridge, although their request for a favourite pork dish has been turned down until their digestive systems recover from 10 days without food. The government is strictly controlling information about the rescue. The names of the boys who got out have not been released, and even their parents have not been allowed to see them - for health reasons, say Thai officials. By Martin Patience, Chiang Rai Outside the hospital where the boys were being received, there was a heavy police and media presence. Early in the afternoon, the sound of a helicopter thudded overhead. It was a sign that the rescue operation was going to plan. A few minutes later, a convoy with an ambulance swept through the streets and swung into the hospital entrance. It was carrying the first boy rescued on Monday. Then as dusk was falling, a small crowd of locals gathered outside the hospital. Word was filtering out that more boys had been rescued. People were straining to catch a glimpse of the unfolding drama. It came in the form of the flashing lights of three more ambulances - signifying the rescue of three more boys. The rescue operation will resume on Tuesday. It is not yet over and is still fraught with danger. But people here are daring to believe what seemed impossible a little over a week ago - that all the boys and their coach will come out of the cave alive. A team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - has been working in the cave system. They have been guiding the boys through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the Tham Luang cave system.

The operation in pictures 'I am dying to see him. I miss my son' Letters of love from trapped Thai boys The process includes a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes already in place. Wearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy is being accompanied by two divers, who also carry his air supply. The toughest part is about halfway out at a section named ""T-Junction"", which is so tight the divers have to take off their air tanks to get through. Beyond that a cavern - called Chamber 3 - has been turned into a forward base for the divers. There the boys can rest before making the last, easier walk out to the entrance. They are then taken to hospital in Chiang Rai. In an indication of how dangerous the journey can be,a former Thai navy diver diedin the caves on Friday. Saman Gunan was returning from a mission to provide the group with air tanks when he ran out of oxygen. He lost consciousness and could not be revived. His colleagues said they would ""not let the sacrifice of our friend go to waste"". This video can not be played Wife and father remember 'hero' Thai diver: ""He loved helping others"" Some details have emerged of members of the team and their coach. Captain Duganpet Promtep, 13, is described as a motivator and highly respected by his teammates. He had apparently been scouted by several Thai professional clubs. Myanmar-bornAdul Sam-on, 14, speaks several languages, and was the only team member to be able to communicate with British divers when they were first discovered. It was 17-year-oldPeerapat Sompiangjai's birthday when the group became trapped in the cave.  The snacks the boys brought with them to celebrate are likely to have helped them survive their ordeal. Assistant coachEkapol Chantawong,25, was said to be the weakest of the group when they were found, as he reportedly refused to eat any of the food and gave it instead to the boys. Read more about the team The boys were found inside the cave by British rescue divers a week ago, about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth. Aged between 11 and 17, they belong to a football club called the Wild Boars, and became trapped during an excursion with their coach. This video can not be played Thailand cave rescue: Meet the volunteer helpers It took nine days to find them in the underground network's dark depths.

But the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh did not attend, with the decision made ""some time ago"" and not on health grounds, Buckingham Palace said. The Queen, 92, was travelling back from Norfolk on Monday and has a busy week ahead, with celebrations marking the centenary of the RAF on Tuesday and US President Donald Trump's visit to Windsor on Friday. Prince Louis wore the christening gown that his siblings had also worn Prince Louis was sleeping as he arrived at the ceremony, held by his mother.

They also chose two anthems for the choir to sing - This is the Day which the Lord hath Made, written for their wedding in 2011 by John Rutter, and Suo Gan, a traditional Welsh lullaby. Prince Louis's christening gown is the same one that was used by his siblings. The cream lace and white satin robe is a replica of the robe made for Queen Victoria's eldest daughter in 1841, which is now too delicate to be worn. The new version was made by the Queen's dresser, Angela Kelly. According to tradition,water from the River Jordanwas used at the christening.

"This video can not be played Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu says police will do everything to bring those responsible to justice A woman who died after being exposed to the nerve agent Novichok in Wiltshire is believed to have had a ""high dose"" of the substance, police have said. Mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess, 44, died on Sunday evening after falling ill in Amesbury on 30 June. Her partner, Charlie Rowley, 45, who was also exposed to the nerve agent, remains critically ill in hospital. Police are continuing to hunt for a contaminated container which they believe was handled by the pair. The BBC understands Mr Rowley's flat in Amesbury is regarded as the key location in the search. A team wearing hazmat suits is combing the small flat, working in 30-minute shifts because of the heat. Wiltshire Police said on Monday night that a car had been moved from Swindon in relation to the investigation - but stressed that ""the public should not be alarmed"". Allow Twitter content?

A murder inquiry has been launched into Ms Sturgess's death and a post-mortem examination is due to take place. Home Secretary Sajid Javid chaired a meeting of the government's emergency committee Cobra on Monday and later addressed MPs. He told them the death of Ms Sturgess ""strengthens our resolve to find out exactly what happened and who is behind it"". What are Novichok agents? Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far What happened to the Skripals? Mr Javid said scientists had not yet been able to determine if the nerve agent in the latest poisoning was from the same batch as that used earlier this year in Salisbury. Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yuliafell ill after being poisoned with Novichok in Salisbury.Ms Skripal was discharged from Salisbury District Hospital in April, and her father in May. A police officer, Det Sgt Nick Bailey, wasalso left seriously illafter responding to the attack on the Skripals and spent nearly three weeks in hospital. Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley touched an unknown contaminated item with their hands, police say Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the head UK counter-terrorism policing which is leading the investigation, said he was ""unable to say"" if the incident in Amesbury is linked to the poisoning of the Skripals on 3 March - but it is their ""main line of inquiry"". Mr Basu said: ""In the four months since the Skripals and Nick Bailey were poisoned, no other people besides Dawn and Charlie have presented with symptoms, but their reaction was so severe it resulted in Dawn's death and Charlie being critically ill. This video can not be played Footage shows Ms Sturgess in Salisbury days before her collapse ""This means they must have got a high dose and our hypothesis is that they must have handled a container that we are now seeking."" It is understood the couple each had nerve agent on one of their hands. Ms Sturgess, from Durrington, was rushed to hospital on Saturday 30 June after becoming ill at a house in Muggleton Road in Amesbury. She has two sons, aged 19 and 23, and an 11-year-old daughter. Theresa May said she was ""appalled and shocked"" by her death. Speaking to MPs in the House of Commons, she also paid tribute to the ""dedication of the staff"" at Salisbury District Hospital and thanked them for their ""tireless work"". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs: ""The simple reality is that Russia has committed an attack on British soil which has seen the death of a British citizen. ""That is something that I think the world will unite with us in actually condemning."" Tributes were left to Ms Sturgess, who has three children Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was ""deeply concerned"" about the incident in Amesbury - but said accusations that it was involved are ""absurd"". The UK government previously blamed Russia for the poisoning of the Skripals in March and say the nerve agent used was a type developed by Russia. Russian authorities denied any involvement in the poisoning. Mr Basu said detectives will continue with their ""painstaking and meticulous work to gather all the available evidence"". ByGordon Corera, BBC security correspondent A hundred detectives are already working round the clock to try to establish how Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley were contaminated by Novichok. Swabs taken from them in hospital revealed the highest level of contamination on their hands, leading to the theory they picked something up. It may well be that it was Dawn who came into first contact and Charlie received secondary contamination from her but that remains to be confirmed. The priority now is working out what that item was and where it is now. Read more here. Officers have found a red Ford Transit van which Mr Rowley travelled in with three other men before falling ill. The vehicle has been sent to the government's military research facility Porton Down. Three men who also travelled in the van have shown no sign of being exposed to Novichok. Meanwhile, the bus that Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley used the night before they collapsed has tested negative for Novichok. Public Health England said the risk to the general public ""remains low""but warned people,externalnot to pick up ""any strange items such as needles, syringes or unusual containers"". They have also offered advice for people who may have visited one of five areas identified by police. Those locations are Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy and the Baptist church in Amesbury, and John Baker House and Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury. Anyone who was there between 22:00 BST on 29 June and 18:30 on 30 Juneshould continue to follow advice,external, including washing their clothes in a washing machine, keeping other items double-bagged and securely fastened if they are dry-clean only. Wiltshire Police Chief Constable Kier Pritchard said the news of Ms Sturgess's death would ""send a huge shockwave across our communities"" but stressed that ""the risk to the wider public remains low"". He praised residents for their ""continual strength and resilience"" during ""these challenging times"". Friday 29 June 12:20 - Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley are together at John Baker House, Salisbury. They leave to visit Salisbury and later go to Queen Elizabeth Gardens. They return to John Baker House at 16:20. 22:00 - The couple catch a bus to Amesbury. Police believe they then spend the night at Mr Rowley's home on Muggleton Road. Saturday 30 June 10:15 - The South Western Ambulance Service is called to Mr Rowley's address as Ms Sturgess has been taken ill. Mr Rowley is also present at the address as Ms Sturgess is taken to hospital. 12:00 - Mr Rowley visits the Boots pharmacy on Stonehenge Walk in Amesbury, returning to his house half an hour later. 1:45 - He goes to the Amesbury Baptist Church on Butterfield Drive, returning home at 15:00. 18:20 - Mr Rowley is taken ill.

"Will was walking over Westminster Bridge in London when a car crashed into him from behind. He didn't know it, but he'd been caught up in a terror attack that killed five people and injured 50. In the chaos that followed a stranger looked after him. But then they were separated and he could only remember her face... Will is stressed. He's due to meet the team he'll be working with at his new job and he's running late. He's taken extra care with his outfit today, wearing smart jeans and his favourite brown suede shoes. As he rushes down the road he decides the quickest route will be to take the Jubilee Line from Westminster underground station. He walks on to Westminster Bridge and starts to cross the Thames towards Parliament. Cristina is in a pound shop picking up cleaning products. She's just come from a talk about the economies of developing nations - a topic she became interested in while volunteering in China and Myanmar. Placing her purchases in her bike basket, she decides to head home via Westminster Bridge. It's a little out of her way but Cristina considers it the prettiest bridge in London. She pushes off from the kerb and merges into the traffic. There are a lot of tourists on the north side of the bridge so Will crosses to the other side where he can walk faster. He sprays deodorant under his shirt as he goes. It's a miserable March day and he curses as it starts to rain. He suddenly hears a car accelerating loudly behind him. He has the sensation of being propelled forward, before everything goes dark. Cristina thinks nothing of the heavy traffic but then she hears screams. She sees people streaming off the bridge and a passer-by tells her to turn back as there has been a terrible accident. Instead she parks her bike and continues on foot. She has basic nursing training and thinks she can help. She reaches a young man in brown shoes lying on the wet road with another man hovering over him. She asks if there is anything she can do. ""Please can you take over? I need to leave,"" the man on his feet replies, clearly agitated. Emergency vehicles on Westminster Bridge following the terror attack Cristina agrees and kneels down. She takes the injured man's hand and asks his name. ""It's amazing how our friendship came out of something so horrific and terrible,"" Will says. ""We wouldn't ordinarily have crossed paths. We're different ages, have different professions and live and work in different areas."" It's a year later and he's sitting with Cristina at the back of a busy brasserie in Soho. The sun is streaming through the windows and on the street outside office workers are mingling and sipping their first post-work pints. Both have just come from work - Will, 25, from his job rejuvenating the area around Baker Street and Cristina, 34, from a meeting with an advertising firm. While Will grew up in London, Cristina moved to the city from Portugal 12 years ago. It was an act of terror by Khalid Masood that brought them to the same place at the same time. On 22 March 2017, he drove a hired car into dozens of pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and stabbed to death an unarmed police officer, before being shot and killed himself. Will told his story to Georgia Catt on BBC Radio 4'sThe Untold. Listen to it on theBBC iPlayer. Will believes he was the second person to be struck by Masood's car. He woke up to find himself lying in a wet gutter. ""I had a strong sensation of pain all over my body,"" he says. ""I could see the London Eye and County Hall from where I was and I could hear a lot of panic and distress but I wasn't really aware of what it was about."" Cristina came across Will just a few minutes later. ""Will didn't look badly injured but he was very confused. He was panicking because he had to go somewhere but he couldn't remember where,"" she says. ""I held him and hugged him and tried to keep him calm by asking him lots of questions. We were sitting on the kerb watching this awful scene, having a mundane conversation about his parents and his job."" Cristina reached Will a few minutes after he was struck by Masood's car They waited as the paramedics dealt with the most urgent cases. Will had scrapes down his back and a mass of bruises down his leg and was taken to hospital in the last ambulance that left the bridge. There was no room for Cristina. ""I terribly wanted to go with him, but I knew it wasn't my place as there was a young policeman, Special Constable Thomson, with him,"" she says. ""Due to the chaos, no-one had asked me for my details, so I simply walked off the bridge."" Cristina continued to believe it was an accident until she called her boyfriend. He told her it had been a terrorist attack and that she should head home. Cycling back to her empty flat, she called Will's firm to explain what had happened. ""I knew lots about him so I then tracked him down on Facebook and left a message saying, 'I hope you're OK, let me know.' ""I think I was in a state of shock. It was like going through a violent 3D movie. I didn't feel like going out again so I stayed at home that evening."" The first ambulance arrived six minutes after the emergency services were called Meanwhile, Will's condition began to worsen.  As a lower-priority case he was left to sit in A&E as medics rushed around him. Then he began to feel nauseous. ""My speech started to go strange. I was trying to say things and the wrong word would come out. They put me in a wheelchair and I started throwing up. Every time they tried to lay me down I'd be sick."" When police officers came to take away his clothes and bag, he tried to ask to keep his phone but struggled to express himself. The doctors began to seem concerned. Following X-rays and CT scans he was put in a head brace. ""The hospital staff had a sense of urgency and I thought, 'Oh God what if I don't come through this?'"" Due to the brace he could only see the ceiling. He remembers his parents arriving and having to peer over his trolley for him to see their faces. Will was diagnosed with a carotid artery dissection - a tear in one of the arteries in his neck had allowed blood to enter the artery wall and split its layers, forming a blood clot. He was given medication to thin his blood and reduce his risk of having a stroke. ""I just wanted to sleep so I could just pretend it hadn't happened, but I couldn't, mainly because of the pain,"" he says. Will's books, and teacakes, in hospital In the following days Cristina tried to put her experience behind her. She only told a few friends who asked her why she looked shaken. But she didn't tell her mother in Portugal because she didn't want to worry her. She also chose to keep it from her colleagues. ""There was nothing to tell,"" she says. ""I couldn't relate what had happened to me to this big national event."" In the weeks following the attack Cristina continued to cycle around London. However, she found that she felt on edge and anxious if a car passed close by. ""I went through a phase where I would do an assessment of whether the road might be suitable for an attack,"" she says. However, she felt strangely calm when she crossed Westminster Bridge again. ""I think it's because I thought an attack wouldn't happen in the same place twice."" Cristina hadn't heard from Will but assumed he would get back to her when he was ready. She didn't know that he was actively trying to find her. Will with his mother on top of the London hospital where he was treated In hospital Will slowly regained his ability to walk. He was aware that people were talking about Westminster Bridge in hushed voices. He asked the hospital psychologist for details and he suggested they go through a newspaper article with Will's father. ""My dad summarised it for me and said what the pictures showed. I didn't really think about the driver, I just felt very overwhelmed by the scale of it all,"" he says. Will's memory of the bridge was hazy. However, he remembered that a woman had looked after him and he wanted to track her down to thank her. ""I thought she might be Spanish and I knew she had good teeth because I remember her smiling a lot. ""So the police were going through the witness statements to find someone like that!"" After a week in hospital Will moved back in with his parents. He was given his sister's room as it had a ""nice double bed"", while she moved to his old box room. ""It was quite intense,"" he says. ""I'd moved away from home when I was 18 and was very independent. It was difficult to be looked after and have decisions made for me."" Will in the Soho brasserie Will wanted to get better as quickly as possible. He had several appointments most days, visiting the hospital and meeting with a counsellor, the Victim Support charity and police liaison officers. He needed to nap during the day due to the extreme exhaustion brought on by his head injuries. ""I felt dizzy a lot of the time, my eating was on and off and I wasn't sleeping much at night because my neck was so painful,"" he says. ""I had to take breaks from other people as well. People were obviously concerned and wanted to know what happened but I ended up repeating a sort of script."" Friends and neighbours left food at the door, which Will found touching but also overwhelming. ""I just don't like attention,"" he says, shifting in his chair. Prince Harry and Prince William also attended the Service of Hope in Westminster Abbey Soon after moving home Will was invited to a service at Westminster Abbey for everyone who had been involved in the attack. Afterwards he decided to walk across the bridge with his family. ""It was a normal day with lots of tourists everywhere and people going about their business. You couldn't really tell what had happened, although there were barriers up. ""It was strange as I didn't really feel like I had been there, as I couldn't remember very much."" A month after the attack, Will was disappointed to learn that the police hadn't found the woman who helped him. But the next day while checking Facebook, he spotted some messages from people not on his contacts list. ""I had one from a cousin and then I came across a message from Cristina that basically said, 'You won't remember me but I helped you on Westminster Bridge. Please let me know you're OK.' ""I ran - well I hobbled - down the stairs and I read it to my mum and dad but I couldn't finish it. They were both in tears."" Will responded straight away and they arranged to meet. ""It was so strange,"" Cristina says, in the brasserie where their reunion had taken place a year earlier. ""I felt very close to Will but he didn't really remember our conversation."" ""I recognised her straight away,"" Will says. ""And we hugged - Cristina is a real hugger."" Will and Cristina in the cafe where they met for the first time after the attack Will had brought a map so Cristina could point out where she found him and take him through what happened. He also gave her a card from his mother, thanking her for staying and looking after him on the bridge. ""It really helped my family to know that someone had looked after me when they couldn't,"" Will says. Over the following weeks they continued to meet for coffee. At first Will wanted to know some more details about the attack but slowly their chats turned to what was going on in their lives. ""How do you become friends with a person? I think we think about things in a similar way,"" Will says. ""It was very natural,"" agrees Cristina. ""We'd meet to check in with how he was and then we'd talk about how I was. We were both going through big things."" Cristina ended her long-term relationship with her boyfriend, while Will started his new job and moved back in with his flatmates. ""There isn't any manual for how to move on after a terrorist attack,"" Will says. ""I just went with my gut as I wanted to regain control of my life. I didn't want to sit at home feeling sad about what had happened and frustrated that I couldn't do any exercise."" However, the transition was more difficult than he had expected and he found he was less confident about making decisions. ""I felt very up and down. There were moments I felt terrible but then also moments when I felt really empowered,"" he says. Will and Cristina at Cristina's flat Through it all he knew he could talk to Cristina. ""It was really helpful during a time when I felt crap about what had happened to have someone who had seen me at my worst,"" he says. ""She wasn't cautious with me at all and was very honest. If I said something very melancholy she'd get me to consider other things."" Cristina adds: ""It also gave me a trusting space to talk."" As the months passed, Will's medication was reduced and his appointments became less frequent. He finished trauma therapy but continued to see an NHS counsellor once a month. ""I was thinking about it [the attack] less and it was becoming less significant,"" says Will. ""Until something happened that reminded me of it."" In November, he was in a taxi with a colleague just off Oxford Street when he saw panic-stricken people running past the car. They got out and sought shelter in an office reception. After half an hour and with little information to go on they decided to join their colleagues in a nearby hotel. ""We crossed Oxford Street and it was completely deserted. Everyone was locked in shops."" Armed police responding to the ""incident"" on Oxford Street on November 24, 2017 They reached the hotel where a back room had been set up with food for them and people evacuated from Selfridges. Will then realised he was experiencing a fight-or-flight response. ""I had difficulty breathing, my hands and arms went numb, I couldn't stand up as my legs were just jelly. Eventually my panic came down but it left me exhausted."" The panic had been caused by rumours of a gunman on the loose. This turned out to be a false alarm, but it still had an effect on Will. ""I took a week off work to recover,"" he says. ""You made yourself go back to Oxford Street,"" Cristina prompts. ""That's right. I went once during the day when it was a bit quieter,"" he agrees. Last month, Will received the upsetting news that he still can't return to swimming, jogging or cycling - all activities he enjoyed before the attack. Doctors say vigorous activity could damage his carotid artery, which is still healing. ""I do get angry, I have moments of frustration that I'm still not better,"" he says. ""But I do think I've done a lot of growing. I have a greater perspective on what's important in my life and I don't worry so much about what other people think."" Hospital staff leave flowers on Westminster Bridge on the anniversary of the attack Cristina says: ""I feel privileged to have been around him this year. ""Will's a really generous and sensitive person and very open to the world. Meeting him marked a new caring way of being in my life."" The two of them catch up in person every few weeks. ""Cristina is very strong and supportive. She's just a genuinely lovely person,"" Will says, meeting her gaze. ""A friend of my mum was talking to her recently about people have angels. She thinks you were an angel for me that day. ""I'm very happy you chose to walk on to the bridge.""

"The ozone hole over Antarctica in the year 2000 Cut-price Chinese home insulation is being blamed for a massive rise in emissions of a gas, highly damaging to the Earth's protective ozone layer. The Environmental Investigations Agency (EIA) found widespread use of CFC-11 in China, even though the chemical was fully banned back in 2010. Scientists have been extremely puzzled by the mysterious rise in emissions. Butthis report,externalsuggests the key source is China's home construction industry. Just two months ago, researcherspublished a studyshowing that the expected decline in the use of CFC-11 after it was completely banned eight years ago had slowed to a crawl. There were suspicions among researchers that new supplies were being made somewhere in East Asia. Rumours were rife as to the source. There was a concern among some experts that the chemical was being used to secretly enrich uranium for use in nuclear weapons. The reality it seems is more about insulation than proliferation. Electric car points in all new homes planned Exoskeletons promise superhuman powers Can we save the Lord of the Rings toad? CFC-11 makes a very efficient ""blowing agent"" for polyurethane foam, helping it to expand into rigid thermal insulation that's used in houses to cut energy bills and reduce carbon emissions. Researchers from the EIA, a green campaign group, contacted foam manufacturing factories in 10 different provinces across China. From their detailed discussions with executives in 18 companies, the investigators concluded that the chemical is used in the majority of the polyurethane insulation the firms produce. One seller of CFC-11 estimated that 70% of China's domestic sales used the illegal gas. The reason is quite simple - CFC-11 is better quality and much cheaper than the alternatives. Barrels of chemicals seen by investigators in China which contain CFC-11 The authorities have banned CFC-11 but enforcement of the regulation is poor. ""We were absolutely gobsmacked to find that companies very openly confirmed using CFC-11 while acknowledging it was illegal,"" Avipsa Mahapatra from EIA told BBC News. ""The fact that they were so blasÃ© about it, the fact that they told us very openly how pervasive it is in the market, these were shocking findings for us."" The EIA says that its estimates of the amount of the gas being used in China are in the middle of the emissions range calculated by scientists in their report in May. The scientist who first highlighted the problem with CFC-11 said the EIA findings seemed plausible, although it was difficult to be definitive. Dr Stephen Montzka from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) told BBC News: ""The pervasiveness of the use of CFC-11 that seems apparent in China based on their survey is quite amazing, although it is hard for me to assess the accuracy of the emission estimate they make to know if it is indeed likely that this activity can explain all or most of what we are observing in the global atmosphere."" This is a big deal because of the amount of the dodgy chemical being used and its potential to reverse the healing that's starting to take place in the ozone layer. China's polyurethane foam makes up about one-third of global production, so if they are predominantly using an ozone-depleting substance it will set back the closing of the ozone hole by a decade or more. As well as the ozone layer, CFC-11 has a warming impact. Researchers estimate that if the use of the chemical continues, it would be the equivalent of COâ from 16 coal-fired power stations every year! As China is a signatory of theMontreal Protocol,externalthat governs the use of ozone-depleting substances, it should be possible to put trade sanctions in place. However, since the protocol was signed in 1987, this weapon of last resort has never been used and it's not expected in this case. A factory in China that told EIA that 99% of its products contained CFC-11 What's more likely is that China will be encouraged to crack down on the production of CFC-11s and to launch a full-scale investigation with the support of the Montreal Protocol secretariat. ""It is critical for the government of China not to treat these as isolated incidents,"" said Avipsa Mahapatra from the EIA. ""We want them to clamp down but it's supremely important for them to carry out a comprehensive investigation into the sector. It has to result in seizures, it has to result in arrests so that people know there are harsh penalties for the production of CFC-11."" Delegates to the Montreal Protocol are meeting this week in Vienna and they will try to come up with a plan to tackle the issue. Ozone is formed in the stratosphere some 15 to 30km above the surface of the Earth by the interaction of solar ultraviolet radiation with oxygen in the air. In this location, the newly formed ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation, preventing most of it from reaching the ground. This is important because ultraviolet radiation can lead to skin cancer and eye damage in humans, can damage crops and marine life. Scientists discovered in 1985, much to their surprise, that there was a 30% drop in ozone levels over Antarctica in October of that year. By 1992, the hole was as large as North America. Researcher capturing air samples from the ozone layer above the Arctic What was happening was that chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons contained in refrigeration, air conditioning, packaging, insulation, solvents, and aerosol propellants were releasing chlorine or bromine molecules when they were exposed to intense UV light in the stratosphere. When chlorine and bromine atoms come into contact with ozone, they destroy the molecules. One chlorine atom can destroy over 100,000 ozone molecules before it is removed from the stratosphere. Ozone can be destroyed more quickly than it is naturally created. For once, the world acted speedily and to good effect. Most nations, including the chemical industry, signed up to the Montreal Protocol which quickly banned most of the worst-offending chemicals. Developing countries were given much longer to replace the gases. So while most of the richer countries got rid of CFC-11 in the mid-1990s, China and others were expected to completely get rid of it in 2010. That obviously hasn't happened just yet. Back in 2014 researchers reportedthe first signsof a thickening in the ozone layer. At that point they said it would take a decade for the hole to start to shrink but by September 2015scientists foundthat the hole was approximately 4 million sq km smaller than it was in the year 2000 - that's an area the size of India. All this was due to the global phase out of CFCs. So it was a major surprise to ozone experts to find that the expected decline in these elements in the air had stalled. And now, according to the EIA, the reason behind the slowdown has been discovered  - and it's mainly down to Chinese builders!

However, she felt strangely calm when she crossed Westminster Bridge again. ""I think it's because I thought an attack wouldn't happen in the same place twice."" Cristina hadn't heard from Will but assumed he would get back to her when he was ready. She didn't know that he was actively trying to find her. Will with his mother on top of the London hospital where he was treated In hospital Will slowly regained his ability to walk. He was aware that people were talking about Westminster Bridge in hushed voices. He asked the hospital psychologist for details and he suggested they go through a newspaper article with Will's father. ""My dad summarised it for me and said what the pictures showed. I didn't really think about the driver, I just felt very overwhelmed by the scale of it all,"" he says. Will's memory of the bridge was hazy. However, he remembered that a woman had looked after him and he wanted to track her down to thank her. ""I thought she might be Spanish and I knew she had good teeth because I remember her smiling a lot. ""So the police were going through the witness statements to find someone like that!"" After a week in hospital Will moved back in with his parents. He was given his sister's room as it had a ""nice double bed"", while she moved to his old box room. ""It was quite intense,"" he says. ""I'd moved away from home when I was 18 and was very independent. It was difficult to be looked after and have decisions made for me."" Will in the Soho brasserie Will wanted to get better as quickly as possible. He had several appointments most days, visiting the hospital and meeting with a counsellor, the Victim Support charity and police liaison officers. He needed to nap during the day due to the extreme exhaustion brought on by his head injuries. ""I felt dizzy a lot of the time, my eating was on and off and I wasn't sleeping much at night because my neck was so painful,"" he says. ""I had to take breaks from other people as well. People were obviously concerned and wanted to know what happened but I ended up repeating a sort of script."" Friends and neighbours left food at the door, which Will found touching but also overwhelming. ""I just don't like attention,"" he says, shifting in his chair. Prince Harry and Prince William also attended the Service of Hope in Westminster Abbey Soon after moving home Will was invited to a service at Westminster Abbey for everyone who had been involved in the attack. Afterwards he decided to walk across the bridge with his family. ""It was a normal day with lots of tourists everywhere and people going about their business. You couldn't really tell what had happened, although there were barriers up. ""It was strange as I didn't really feel like I had been there, as I couldn't remember very much."" A month after the attack, Will was disappointed to learn that the police hadn't found the woman who helped him. But the next day while checking Facebook, he spotted some messages from people not on his contacts list. ""I had one from a cousin and then I came across a message from Cristina that basically said, 'You won't remember me but I helped you on Westminster Bridge. Please let me know you're OK.' ""I ran - well I hobbled - down the stairs and I read it to my mum and dad but I couldn't finish it. They were both in tears."" Will responded straight away and they arranged to meet. ""It was so strange,"" Cristina says, in the brasserie where their reunion had taken place a year earlier. ""I felt very close to Will but he didn't really remember our conversation."" ""I recognised her straight away,"" Will says. ""And we hugged - Cristina is a real hugger."" Will and Cristina in the cafe where they met for the first time after the attack Will had brought a map so Cristina could point out where she found him and take him through what happened. He also gave her a card from his mother, thanking her for staying and looking after him on the bridge. ""It really helped my family to know that someone had looked after me when they couldn't,"" Will says. Over the following weeks they continued to meet for coffee. At first Will wanted to know some more details about the attack but slowly their chats turned to what was going on in their lives. ""How do you become friends with a person? I think we think about things in a similar way,"" Will says. ""It was very natural,"" agrees Cristina. ""We'd meet to check in with how he was and then we'd talk about how I was. We were both going through big things."" Cristina ended her long-term relationship with her boyfriend, while Will started his new job and moved back in with his flatmates. ""There isn't any manual for how to move on after a terrorist attack,"" Will says. ""I just went with my gut as I wanted to regain control of my life. I didn't want to sit at home feeling sad about what had happened and frustrated that I couldn't do any exercise."" However, the transition was more difficult than he had expected and he found he was less confident about making decisions. ""I felt very up and down. There were moments I felt terrible but then also moments when I felt really empowered,"" he says. Will and Cristina at Cristina's flat Through it all he knew he could talk to Cristina. ""It was really helpful during a time when I felt crap about what had happened to have someone who had seen me at my worst,"" he says. ""She wasn't cautious with me at all and was very honest. If I said something very melancholy she'd get me to consider other things."" Cristina adds: ""It also gave me a trusting space to talk."" As the months passed, Will's medication was reduced and his appointments became less frequent. He finished trauma therapy but continued to see an NHS counsellor once a month. ""I was thinking about it [the attack] less and it was becoming less significant,"" says Will. ""Until something happened that reminded me of it."" In November, he was in a taxi with a colleague just off Oxford Street when he saw panic-stricken people running past the car. They got out and sought shelter in an office reception. After half an hour and with little information to go on they decided to join their colleagues in a nearby hotel. ""We crossed Oxford Street and it was completely deserted. Everyone was locked in shops."" Armed police responding to the ""incident"" on Oxford Street on November 24, 2017 They reached the hotel where a back room had been set up with food for them and people evacuated from Selfridges. Will then realised he was experiencing a fight-or-flight response. ""I had difficulty breathing, my hands and arms went numb, I couldn't stand up as my legs were just jelly. Eventually my panic came down but it left me exhausted."" The panic had been caused by rumours of a gunman on the loose. This turned out to be a false alarm, but it still had an effect on Will. ""I took a week off work to recover,"" he says. ""You made yourself go back to Oxford Street,"" Cristina prompts. ""That's right. I went once during the day when it was a bit quieter,"" he agrees. Last month, Will received the upsetting news that he still can't return to swimming, jogging or cycling - all activities he enjoyed before the attack. Doctors say vigorous activity could damage his carotid artery, which is still healing. ""I do get angry, I have moments of frustration that I'm still not better,"" he says. ""But I do think I've done a lot of growing. I have a greater perspective on what's important in my life and I don't worry so much about what other people think."" Hospital staff leave flowers on Westminster Bridge on the anniversary of the attack Cristina says: ""I feel privileged to have been around him this year. ""Will's a really generous and sensitive person and very open to the world. Meeting him marked a new caring way of being in my life."" The two of them catch up in person every few weeks. ""Cristina is very strong and supportive. She's just a genuinely lovely person,"" Will says, meeting her gaze. ""A friend of my mum was talking to her recently about people have angels. She thinks you were an angel for me that day. ""I'm very happy you chose to walk on to the bridge.""

"Tory vice-chairs Ben Bradley and Maria Caulfield resign They are latest to go because of cabinet's Brexit plan President Trump refers to UK 'turmoil' ahead of visit Earlier PM Theresa May chaired her new-look cabinet Jeremy Hunt succeeded Boris Johnson as foreign secretary Matt Hancock succeeded Hunt as health secretary Andy McFarlane and Gavin Stamp We are drawing the curtains on the live page. It's been a busy day, so here's a recap on the main developments.  Angela Merkel welcomes the UK's Chequers agreement, saying it is a ""good thing we have proposals on the table"". The German Chancellor says the remaining 27 EU members will agree a ""common response"" once it has seen the detail of the official UK position. But she says progress is being made and repeats her stance that her country wants as close links as possible with the UK after Brexit. Theresa May is asked about Donald Trump's claims that the UK is in turmoil, ahead of his visit on Thursday, and whether the US President is a real fan of Boris Johnson. The PM does not comment directly but says she is looking forward to Mr Trump's visit, saying there is ""much to discuss"". She says the special relationship with the US is the UK's deepest and longest security and defence alliance. The two leaders, she adds, will talking about how to use this to benefit the UK and US but also enhance the wider good.  But who do these shoes belong to? The answer: British Prime Minister Theresa May, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama and Montenegro's Prime Minister Dusko Markovic. Theresa May is now speaking at the conclusion of the Western Balkans summit in central London. She says claims that, as a result of Brexit, the UK will be ""retreating"" from its role as a guarantor of peace in the region and on the continent as a whole are completely wrong. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is now speaking. Brexit is almost certain to crop up during questions.  In his letter resigning as a Tory vice-chair, Remain voter Ben Bradley writes that he was persuaded to back the Brexit vision because of the ""immense opportunities that are available from global trade, and for the ability
for Britain to be an outward looking nation in control of our own destiny once
again"". But he complains: ""I fear that this agreement at Chequers damages those opportunities; that being tied to EU regulations, and the EU tying our hands when seeking to make new trade agreements, will be the worst of all worlds if we do not deliver Brexit in spirit as well as in name. ""Then we are handing Jeremy Corbyn the keys to Number 10."" MPs have decisively rejected Liberal Democrat calls for a ""People's Vote"" on the final Brexit deal. A Commons motion put forward by Sir Vince Cable's party was defeated by 299 votes to 13 in Parliament. Aside from nine Lib Dem MPs, the other MPs to support it were Green Party leader Caroline Lucas and Plaid Cymru's three MPs. Conservative peer Lord Finkelstein, a close friend of David Cameron, takes issue with some of the arguments made by Ben Bradley or Maria Caulfield in their resignation letters. In short, he seems to be saying the UK has a choice between the Chequers compromise or no deal. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

representatives will be found out,"" she wrote in her resignation letter as Conservative vice-chair. ""This policy will be bad for our country and

The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, speaking in New York, added that many models of co-operation with Brussels were available to the UK, including a ""Norway"" deal, ""Norway plus"" or an ""ambitious"" version of the Canada deal, and that each deal had ""its own balance of rights and negotiations"". However, he said the UK's current red lines meant they were ""closing the door"" to many different types of co-operation. Michel Barnier, who's leading Brexit negotiations on behalf of Brussels, has said there is accord on 80% of the UK withdrawal
agreement and that the European Union was ready to start working on an ""ambitious free trade arrangement"" with the UK. Speaking
in New York, Mr Barnier said that negotiators still needed to find a solution
to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland. In
response to recent resignations in Westminster, Mr Barnier said he had a
""very cordial and frank relationship"" with David Davis and had met
""many people with different views"" during the course of the
negotiations. BBC political editor tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"David Davis' unhappiness has been not secret for some time After many months of rumours that he would pull the plug, David Davis has actually quit as Brexit Secretary. His unhappiness in government has been no secret for some time, but after the prime minister's Chequers agreement with cabinet ministers to pursue closer ties with the EU than he desired, he found his position untenable. After a visit to Downing Street on Sunday he concluded that he had no choice but to walk. Junior ministerial colleague Steve Baker has also quit alongside him from the Brexit department. David Davis' move, while not completely surprising, throws doubt on to how secure the government's Brexit strategy is. Some of Theresa May's colleagues had urged her to face down her Brexiteer ministers but Number 10 had hoped to keep them all on side, and a carefully designed strategy to move them to her position brokered an agreement in cabinet at the end of their day-long meeting at Chequers on Friday . Theresa May secured her cabinet's support at a meeting at Chequers on Friday But Mr Davis, who was meant to be responsible for Brexit policy, felt,  according to colleagues, that he was ""wondering if he really had a proper job"" after Number 10 chose to follow a very different path to the now former Brexit secretary's intention. Mr Davis has been frustrated for some time after the most senior official at the Department for Exiting the EU - Olly Robbins - was moved into Number 10 to work directly for Theresa May. To some former Remainers, Mr Davis' departure could even be considered a temporary relief. One of his fellow ministers remarked, ""it's just a personal outburst"", adding: ""He is not exactly the cleverest, he has always struggled to muscle into any of the complicated arguments."" But conditions in the Tory party are febrile. Theresa May had carefully constructed her cabinet with a balance of Brexiteers and former Remainers. With no majority, and unhappiness on the back benches, it adds instability at a time when the prime minister was pursuing calm. And when she was hoping to project an image to Brussels of authority and stability, it is a headache she could well do without. He could provide a rallying point from outside government for those forces in the Tory party who believe the Brexit plan the prime minister is pursuing is not the Brexit that a clear but narrow majority of the public chose. Michael Gove was tipped as a replacement for David Davis Westminster being Westminster, eyes will immediately turn to who will replace him. The most likely candidate it seems at this stage is Michael Gove who has pitched himself as the Brexiteer that ""remainers can do business with"". His public appearances defending the Brexit policy over the weekend make him certainly near the top of the list for one of the most important jobs in government.

"Dear Prime Minister, As you know there have been a significant number of occasions in the last year or so on which I have disagreed with the Number 10 policy line, ranging from accepting the Commission's sequencing of negotiations through to the language on Northern Ireland in the December Joint Report. At each stage I have accepted collective responsibility because it is part of my task to find workable compromises, and because I considered it was still possible to deliver on the mandate of the referendum, and on our manifesto commitment to leave the Customs Union and the Single Market. I am afraid that I think the current trend of policy and tactics is making that look less and less likely. Whether it is the progressive dilution of what I thought was a firm Chequers agreement in February on right to diverge, or the unnecessary delays of the start of the White Paper, or the presentation of a backstop proposal that omitted the strict conditions that I requested and believed that we had agreed, the general direction of policy will leave us in at best a weak negotiating position, and possibly an inescapable one. The Cabinet decision on Friday crystallised this problem. In my view the inevitable consequence of the proposed policies will be to make the supposed control by Parliament illusory rather than real. As I said at Cabinet, the ""common rule book"" policy hands control of large swathes of our economy to the EU and is certainly not returning control of our laws in any real sense. I am also unpersuaded that our negotiating approach will not just lead to further demands for concessions. Of course this is a complex area of judgement and it is possible that you are right and I am wrong. However, even in that event it seems to me that the national interest requires a Secretary of State in my Department that is an enthusiastic believer in your approach, and not merely a reluctant conscript. While I have been grateful to you for the opportunity to serve, it is with great regret that I tender my resignation from the Cabinet with immediate effect. Yours ever, David Davis. Dear David, Thank you for your letter explaining your decision to resign as secretary of state for exiting the European Union. I am sorry that you have chosen to leave the government when we have already made so much progress towards delivering a smooth and successful Brexit, and when we are only eight months from the date set in law when the United Kingdom will leave the European Union. At Chequers on Friday, we as the cabinet agreed a comprehensive and detailed proposal which provides a precise, responsible and credible basis for progressing our negotiations towards a new relationship between the UK and the EU after we leave in March. We set out how we will deliver on the result of the referendum and the commitments we made in our manifesto for the 2017 general election: Leaving the EU on 29 March 2019 Ending free movement and taking back control of our borders No more sending vast sums of money each year to the EU A new business-friendly customs model with freedom to strike new trade deals around the world A UK-EU free trade area with a common rulebook for industrial goods and agricultural products which will be good for jobs A commitment to maintain high standards on consumer and employment rights and the environment A parliamentary lock on all new rules and regulations Leaving the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy Restoring the supremacy of British courts by ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of justice in the UK No hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, or between Northern Ireland and Great Britain Continued close co-operation on security to keep our people safe An independent foreign and defence policy, working closely with the EU and other allies. This is consistent with the mandate of the referendum and with the commitments we laid out in our general election manifesto: leaving the single market and the customs union but seeking a deep and special partnership including a comprehensive free trade and customs agreement; ending the vast annual contributions to the EU; and pursuing fair, orderly negotiations, minimising disruption and giving as much certainty as possible so both sides beneï¬t. As we said in our manifesto, we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside our withdrawal, reaching agreement on both within the two years allowed by Article 50. I have always agreed with you that these two must go alongside one another, but if we are to get sufficient detail about our future partnership, we need to act now. We have made a signiï¬cant move: it is for the EU now to respond in the same spirit. I do not agree with your characterisation of the policy we agreed at Cabinet on Friday. Parliament will decide whether or not to back the deal the government negotiates, but that deal will undoubtedly mean the returning of powers from Brussels to the United Kingdom. The direct effect of EU law will end when we leave the EU. Where the UK chooses to apply a common rulebook, each rule will have to be agreed by Parliament. Choosing not to sign up to certain rules would lead to consequences for market access, security co-operation or the frictionless border, but that decision will rest with our sovereign Parliament, which will have a lock on whether to incorporate those rules into the UK legal order. I am sorry that the government will not have the beneï¬t of your continued expertise and counsel as we secure this deal and complete the process of leaving the EU, but I would like to thank you warmly for everything you have done over the past two years as Secretary of State to shape our departure from the EU, and the new role the UK will forge on the world stage as an independent, self-governing nation once again. You returned to government after nineteen years to lead an entirely new department responsible for a vital, complex, and unprecedented task. You have helped to steer through Parliament some of the most important legislation for generations, including the European Union (Notiï¬cation of Withdrawal) Act 2017 and the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, which received Royal Assent last week. These landmark Acts, and what they will do, stand as testament to your work and our commitment to honouring the result of the referendum. Yours sincerely, Theresa May.

"The couple touched a contaminated item with their hands but police have not identified the source Police have launched a murder inquiry after a woman exposed to the nerve agent Novichok in Wiltshire died. Dawn Sturgess, 44, died in hospital on Sunday evening after falling ill on 30 June. Charlie Rowley, 45, who was also exposed to the nerve agent in Amesbury, remains critically ill in hospital. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was ""deeply concerned"" about the incident - but said accusations that it was involved are ""absurd"". The UK government previously blamed Russia for the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with Novichok in Salisbury in March. Russian authorities denied any involvement in the poisoning. Investigators say the possibility that the two cases are linked is a ""clear line of inquiry"". Theresa May said she was ""appalled and shocked"" by the death of mother of three Ms Sturgess, from Durrington. Home Secretary Sajid Javid will chair a meeting of the government's emergency committee Cobra later today. A post-mortem examination of Ms Sturgess is due to take place and her family has been informed, police said. What are Novichok agents? Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far What happened to the Skripals? The investigation is being led by detectives from the Counter-Terrorism Policing Network and about 100 detectives are working on the case alongside Wiltshire Police. Officers are still trying to work out how Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley were exposed to the nerve agent - although tests have confirmed they touched a contaminated item with their hands. Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the head of UK Counter-Terrorism policing, said: ""This is shocking and tragic news. Dawn leaves behind her family, including three children, and our thoughts and prayers are with them at this extremely difficult time. ""The 45-year-old man who fell ill with Dawn remains critically ill in hospital and our thoughts are with him and his family as well."" Mr Basu said the death ""has only served to strengthen our resolve to identify and bring to justice the person or persons responsible for what I can only describe as an outrageous, reckless and barbaric act"". He said: ""Detectives will continue with their painstaking and meticulous work to gather all the available evidence so that we can understand how two citizens came to be exposed with such a deadly substance that tragically cost Dawn her life."" This video can not be played Footage shows Ms Sturgess in Salisbury days before her collapse Dr Christine Blanshard, medical director at Salisbury District Hospital, where Ms Sturgess died, said it was ""desperately sad"" and she expressed condolences to her family. She said: ""The staff here at Salisbury District Hospital worked tirelessly to save Dawn. Our staff are talented, dedicated and professional and I know today they will be hurting too. ""They did everything they could."" Mr Rowley is also being treated at the hospital. A police officer who was tested for Novichok poisoning wasgiven the all clear. Mrs May sent her ""thoughts and condolences"" and said officials were ""working urgently to establish the facts"". She said: ""The government is committed to providing full support to the local community as it deals with this tragedy."" British diplomat Julian King, the European Commissioner responsible for the EU's security union, said: ""Those behind this are murderers."" Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""This desperately sad news only strengthens our resolve to find out exactly what has happened."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was ""shocked"", adding: ""A full and thorough police investigation must now establish the facts, provide support to the local community and bring those responsible to justice."" The couple collapsed at a flat on Muggleton Road in Amesbury on 30 June Public Health England said the risk to the general public ""remains low"". Professor Paul Cosford said: ""As a precaution we still advise the public not to pick up any strange items such as needles, syringes or unusual containers."" He also said people in five locations between 22:00 BST on 29 June and 18:30 on 30 June should continue to follow advice, namely: ""Wash your clothes in a washing machine and to keep your items double-bagged and securely fastened, if they are dry-clean only."" Those locations are Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy and the Baptist church in Amesbury, and John Baker House and Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury. Baroness Scott, the leader of Wiltshire Council, said the residents of John Baker House - the hostel where Ms Sturgess lives - have been rehoused and are being given support. Angus Macpherson, Wiltshire police and crime commissioner, said he was ""horrified and appalled"". He said: ""Ms Sturgess was an innocent member of the public who should have been able to go about her daily life without becoming an unwilling victim in such an unprecedented, international, incident."" By BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner The working hypothesis is that the pair became contaminated after touching a poison container left over from the March attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal. The death of Dawn Sturgess, a British citizen on British soil, now changes the investigation to a murder inquiry, with all the diplomatic and security ramifications that carries. Britain has been blaming Moscow for the original attack in March, saying there is no plausible alternative to the Kremlin having ordered the assassination attempt. Russia has denied any involvement, suggesting instead this was the action of a weak British government looking to undermine the success of the current World Cup being hosted by Russia. The next few days are likely to see further accusations and counter-accusations. The poisoning of the Skripals, both of whom spent weeks in hospital before being discharged, was blamed by the UK government on Russia. Russian authorities denied any involvement. Mr Skripal, 66,is a Russian former double agent.He was accused by Russia of spying for Britain's MI6 and jailed in 2006. He was later pardoned and allowed to settle in the UK. After the hospitalisation of Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley, Mr Javid accused the Russian state of using Britain as a ""dumping ground for poison"". The Russian Embassy hit back, accusing the government of trying to ""muddy the waters"" and ""frighten its own citizens"". Yulia Skripal and her father Sergei were exposed to Novichok in Salisbury in March Russian media has suggested alternative explanations of what happened in Amesbury, including claims the UK government staged it because it is finding the World Cup ""hard to swallow"" or to disrupt the Russia-US summit on 16 July. According to BBC Monitoring, other theories in the media include the claim that Porton Down or a former employee of the research lab are to blame, or the Amesbury couple poisoned themselves. In a statement, the Met Police said the possibility the poisoning of the Skripals and Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley are linked is a ""clear line of inquiry"". A spokesman said the investigators are ""not in a position to say whether the nerve agent was from the same batch that the Skripals were exposed to"". He also said: ""There is no evidence that (Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley) visited any of the sites that were decontaminated following the attempted murders of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in March.""

"This video can not be played Royals arrive for Prince Louis' christening Prince Louis, the youngest son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, has been christened in a private ceremony. The 11-week-old was baptised by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace. Guests included newlyweds the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. But the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh did not attend, with the decision made ""some time ago"" and not on health grounds, Buckingham Palace said. The Queen, 92, was travelling back from Norfolk on Monday and has a busy week ahead, with celebrations marking the centenary of the RAF on Tuesday and US President Donald Trump's visit to Windsor on Friday. Prince Louis wore the christening gown that his siblings had also worn Prince Louis was sleeping as he arrived at the ceremony, held by his mother. His siblings, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, walked slightly in front, holding their father's hands. Charlotte's kiss for new baby prince Royal births past and present It is the first time the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their three children have been seen together as a family of five. She was heard describing her son as ""very relaxed and peaceful"", telling the archbishop with a smile: ""I hope he stays like this."" Princess Charlotte was holding an order of service as she left the chapel Prince Louis' six godparents are Nicholas van Cutsem, Guy Pelly, Harry Aubrey-Fletcher, Lady Laura Meade, Hannah Carter and Lucy Middleton. They are all friends or family of the Cambridges, who also picked friends and confidantes as Prince George's and Princess Charlotte's godparents. Miss Middleton and Mr Pelly each read a lesson during the service,Kensington Palace said,external. Kate said her son was 'relaxed and peaceful' before the ceremony Meghan, attending her first royal christening, wore an olive green Ralph Lauren outfit and a Stephen Jones hat. Kate wore a white McQueen outfit with a headdress by Jane Taylor. Louis's grandfather the Prince of Wales attended with the Duchess of Cornwall, with Kate's parents Carole and Michael Middleton also among the guests. Kate's pregnant sister Pippa Middletonand her brother James Middleton were also at the ceremony. This was the Duchess of Sussex's first royal christening The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose hymns O Jesus, I Have Promised and Lord of All Hopefulness for the ceremony. They also chose two anthems for the choir to sing - This is the Day which the Lord hath Made, written for their wedding in 2011 by John Rutter, and Suo Gan, a traditional Welsh lullaby. Prince Louis's christening gown is the same one that was used by his siblings. The cream lace and white satin robe is a replica of the robe made for Queen Victoria's eldest daughter in 1841, which is now too delicate to be worn. The new version was made by the Queen's dresser, Angela Kelly. According to tradition,water from the River Jordanwas used at the christening. Following the 40-minute traditional religious service, guests attended a private tea which included slices of christening cake, from a tier taken from the duke and duchess' wedding cake. Guy Pelly:The son of wealthy Kent landowners, Mr Pelly used to help run several London nightclubs. He is a close friend of both Prince William and Prince Harry - helping to organise the former's stag do - and was dubbed the pair's ""court jester"". He has been banned from driving three times, including twice for drink-driving and once for speeding. Nicholas van Cutsem:He is a British Army major and a close friend of both Prince William and Harry. His daughter, Florence, was a bridesmaid at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's royal wedding in May. Lady Laura Meade:Also one of Princess Charlotte's godparents, Lady Laura is the wife of Prince William's close friend and fellow Etonian James Meade, known as ""Meadey"". She is the daughter of the 8th Earl of Romney. Hannah Carter:Formerly Hannah Gillingham, she went to school with Kate at Marlborough College. She is the wife of Robert Carter, who belongs to a family of wealthy landowners. Lucy Middleton:She is the Duchess of Cambridge's cousin and a solicitor.

"Struggling mother and baby products retailer Mothercare says it will shut 60 stores by June 2019, instead of the 50 previously earmarked for closure. The closures will put 900 jobs at risk, up from the 800 previously stated. The company has not yet given details about which stores will close as it is talking to the staff affected. Mothercare also confirmed that it would be raising another Â£32.5m from its existing shareholders by issuing new shares. The chain's chief executive, Mark Newton-Jones, told the BBC's Today programme that its UK business had suffered from a lack of investment and ""hadn't had a lick of paint"" in recent years. However, its rescue plan would now allow it to modernise as a retailer. He said: ""We will really be able to speed up the transformation, and by God we need to speed up the transformation, because the retail landscape is pretty brutal at the moment."" Mr Newton-Jones added that Mothercare had ""grown prolifically"" outside the UK, with two-thirds of the retailer's turnover now coming from overseas. What's gone wrong at Mothercare? Five things to do with empty retail stores Town centres could become ghost towns Six shops defying the High Street downturn The extra Mothercare store closures mainly come from its Childrens World division, which will go into administration. Mothercare bought the Childrens World chain in 1996, and rebranded the stores - which were mainly in out-of-town locations - as Mothercare. Although the Childrens World division is being wound up, 13 of its 22 stores will transfer to other Mothercare group companies and stay open. The restructuring of Mothercare comes after creditors backed a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), which allows companies to shut loss-making shops and reduce rents. However, the plans for Childrens World were not approved by the necessary 75% majority, prompting the decision to close the division down. Mothercare said it would have 77 UK stores by June 2019 and 73 stores by the end of the 2021-22 financial year. Retailers on UK High Streets have been hit by weak sales, online competition and rising costs,affecting 22,000 jobs this year. High-profile failures include Maplin and Toys R Us, while other High Street chains announcing store closures include Marks & Spencer, House of Fraser, Carphone Warehouse, New Look and Carpetright.

"This video can not be played Rescue teams are searching for dozens of people who are unaccounted for At least 100 people are thought to have died after record rainfall caused flooding and landslides in western Japan, a government spokesman says. Dozens more are reported to be missing and electricity supplies have been hit. Since Thursday, parts of western Japan have received three times the usual rainfall for the whole of July. Two million people have been ordered to evacuate as rivers burst their banks. ""We've never experienced this kind of rain before,"" a weather official said. Rescuers restarted their search through the mud for any survivors or the bodies of those killed on Monday morning. An official in Okayama prefecture told AFP news agency that water levels were gradually receding and that emergency teams may be able to access the worst-hit areas on foot. Tens of thousands of rescuers, including police and soldiers, are taking part in search operations The heavy rains began with a typhoon last week that was followed by days of record-breaking torrential rain. In the town of Motoyama, on Shikoku island, 583mm (23in) of rain fell between Friday morning and Saturday morning. Many buildings have collapsed and vast areas have been covered in debris and thick mud. Kosuke Kiyohara, 38, told AFP news agency that some of his family members, including his sister, are missing. His house in the town of Kumano was destroyed by a huge landslide. ""I have asked my family to prepare for the worst,"" he said. ""I haven't been able to reach her phone since Friday night. I wish she could have fled sooner."" Officials say water levels in some areas have receded Kumano is in the Hiroshima prefecture where most of the deaths have occurred. One resident, 69-year-old Naoaki Ogawa, described how a mudslide left him trapped in his car as he tried to escape. ""I turned the car to the right, and saw another wave of mud... sweep away three cars that were in front of me,"" he said. ""I have lived here for more than 20 years, but there has never been something like this. I was so scared."" Residents in Okayama prefecture rescue dogs from a flooded area Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has cancelled a trip to Belgium, France, Saudi Arabia and Egypt following the floods. He said on Sunday that rescuers were ""working against time"" and increased the number of personnel deployed to help with the response to more than 70,000. ""There are still many people missing and others in need of help,"" he told reporters. Flood warnings are still in effect for some of the worst hit areas, including in Okayama prefecture. But more settled weather is expected over the next few days which is likely to help with the rescue effort. Japan flood crisis 'unprecedented' Japan towns engulfed by landslides.

"The ozone hole over Antarctica in the year 2000 Cut-price Chinese home insulation is being blamed for a massive rise in emissions of a gas, highly damaging to the Earth's protective ozone layer. The Environmental Investigations Agency (EIA) found widespread use of CFC-11 in China, even though the chemical was fully banned back in 2010. Scientists have been extremely puzzled by the mysterious rise in emissions. Butthis report,externalsuggests the key source is China's home construction industry. Just two months ago, researcherspublished a studyshowing that the expected decline in the use of CFC-11 after it was completely banned eight years ago had slowed to a crawl. There were suspicions among researchers that new supplies were being made somewhere in East Asia. Rumours were rife as to the source. There was a concern among some experts that the chemical was being used to secretly enrich uranium for use in nuclear weapons. The reality it seems is more about insulation than proliferation. Electric car points in all new homes planned Exoskeletons promise superhuman powers Can we save the Lord of the Rings toad? CFC-11 makes a very efficient ""blowing agent"" for polyurethane foam, helping it to expand into rigid thermal insulation that's used in houses to cut energy bills and reduce carbon emissions. Researchers from the EIA, a green campaign group, contacted foam manufacturing factories in 10 different provinces across China. From their detailed discussions with executives in 18 companies, the investigators concluded that the chemical is used in the majority of the polyurethane insulation the firms produce. One seller of CFC-11 estimated that 70% of China's domestic sales used the illegal gas. The reason is quite simple - CFC-11 is better quality and much cheaper than the alternatives. Barrels of chemicals seen by investigators in China which contain CFC-11 The authorities have banned CFC-11 but enforcement of the regulation is poor. ""We were absolutely gobsmacked to find that companies very openly confirmed using CFC-11 while acknowledging it was illegal,"" Avipsa Mahapatra from EIA told BBC News. ""The fact that they were so blasÃ© about it, the fact that they told us very openly how pervasive it is in the market, these were shocking findings for us."" The EIA says that its estimates of the amount of the gas being used in China are in the middle of the emissions range calculated by scientists in their report in May. The scientist who first highlighted the problem with CFC-11 said the EIA findings seemed plausible, although it was difficult to be definitive. Dr Stephen Montzka from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) told BBC News: ""The pervasiveness of the use of CFC-11 that seems apparent in China based on their survey is quite amazing, although it is hard for me to assess the accuracy of the emission estimate they make to know if it is indeed likely that this activity can explain all or most of what we are observing in the global atmosphere."" This is a big deal because of the amount of the dodgy chemical being used and its potential to reverse the healing that's starting to take place in the ozone layer. China's polyurethane foam makes up about one-third of global production, so if they are predominantly using an ozone-depleting substance it will set back the closing of the ozone hole by a decade or more. As well as the ozone layer, CFC-11 has a warming impact. Researchers estimate that if the use of the chemical continues, it would be the equivalent of COâ from 16 coal-fired power stations every year! As China is a signatory of theMontreal Protocol,externalthat governs the use of ozone-depleting substances, it should be possible to put trade sanctions in place. However, since the protocol was signed in 1987, this weapon of last resort has never been used and it's not expected in this case. A factory in China that told EIA that 99% of its products contained CFC-11 What's more likely is that China will be encouraged to crack down on the production of CFC-11s and to launch a full-scale investigation with the support of the Montreal Protocol secretariat. ""It is critical for the government of China not to treat these as isolated incidents,"" said Avipsa Mahapatra from the EIA. ""We want them to clamp down but it's supremely important for them to carry out a comprehensive investigation into the sector. It has to result in seizures, it has to result in arrests so that people know there are harsh penalties for the production of CFC-11."" Delegates to the Montreal Protocol are meeting this week in Vienna and they will try to come up with a plan to tackle the issue. Ozone is formed in the stratosphere some 15 to 30km above the surface of the Earth by the interaction of solar ultraviolet radiation with oxygen in the air. In this location, the newly formed ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation, preventing most of it from reaching the ground. This is important because ultraviolet radiation can lead to skin cancer and eye damage in humans, can damage crops and marine life. Scientists discovered in 1985, much to their surprise, that there was a 30% drop in ozone levels over Antarctica in October of that year. By 1992, the hole was as large as North America. Researcher capturing air samples from the ozone layer above the Arctic What was happening was that chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons contained in refrigeration, air conditioning, packaging, insulation, solvents, and aerosol propellants were releasing chlorine or bromine molecules when they were exposed to intense UV light in the stratosphere. When chlorine and bromine atoms come into contact with ozone, they destroy the molecules. One chlorine atom can destroy over 100,000 ozone molecules before it is removed from the stratosphere. Ozone can be destroyed more quickly than it is naturally created. For once, the world acted speedily and to good effect. Most nations, including the chemical industry, signed up to the Montreal Protocol which quickly banned most of the worst-offending chemicals. Developing countries were given much longer to replace the gases. So while most of the richer countries got rid of CFC-11 in the mid-1990s, China and others were expected to completely get rid of it in 2010. That obviously hasn't happened just yet. Back in 2014 researchers reportedthe first signsof a thickening in the ozone layer. At that point they said it would take a decade for the hole to start to shrink but by September 2015scientists foundthat the hole was approximately 4 million sq km smaller than it was in the year 2000 - that's an area the size of India. All this was due to the global phase out of CFCs. So it was a major surprise to ozone experts to find that the expected decline in these elements in the air had stalled. And now, according to the EIA, the reason behind the slowdown has been discovered  - and it's mainly down to Chinese builders!

"The boys who were rescued on Monday are said to be in reasonable health Divers have rescued four more boys from a vast cave system in northern Thailand on the second day of a complex operation. The Thai Navy Seals leading the rescue operation have confirmed that eight boys in total have been extracted. Four boys and their football coach remain inside the caves. Rescuers will try to free them on Tuesday. The group became trapped on 23 June after heavy rains caused flooding, and was found last week by divers. Four boys were brought out safely on Sunday, but the mission was paused overnight for air tanks to be replaced. On Monday, air ambulances were seen departing from the area around the cave system and ambulances were seen arriving at the hospital in the nearby town of Chiang Rai. The boys have not been seen in public, but have been pronounced to be in reasonable health. Who are the Thai boys trapped in a cave? How risky is the Thai boys rescue? The rescue operation is complicated by sections in the cave involving diving - sometimes in very confined spaces - and climbing. The BBC's Dan Johnson, at the scene, says it is a careful, delicate operation fraught with risk. But he adds that this daring, dangerous and complicated exercise is delivering success against difficult odds, and relief is starting to break the tension of the situation. The group of boys and their coach were found after nine days After Monday's operation had wound down for the day, rescue mission chief Narongsak Osottanakorn told reporters: ""All four boys have arrived at hospital, all are safe."" He said the second day of the operation had gone more smoothly than the first, taking two hours less as the procedure became more refined. Tuesday morning will see the start of attempts to rescue the remaining four boys and the football coach. A massive pumping operation is said to have helped lower the water level inside the cave system, making the journey in and out easier than it was. The Thai authorities say the rescued boys are able to eat rice porridge, although their request for a favourite pork dish has been turned down until their digestive systems recover from 10 days without food. The government is strictly controlling information about the rescue. The names of the boys who got out have not been released, and even their parents have not been allowed to see them - for health reasons, say Thai officials. By Martin Patience, Chiang Rai Outside the hospital where the boys were being received, there was a heavy police and media presence. Early in the afternoon, the sound of a helicopter thudded overhead. It was a sign that the rescue operation was going to plan. A few minutes later, a convoy with an ambulance swept through the streets and swung into the hospital entrance. It was carrying the first boy rescued on Monday. Then as dusk was falling, a small crowd of locals gathered outside the hospital. Word was filtering out that more boys had been rescued. People were straining to catch a glimpse of the unfolding drama. It came in the form of the flashing lights of three more ambulances - signifying the rescue of three more boys. The rescue operation will resume on Tuesday. It is not yet over and is still fraught with danger. But people here are daring to believe what seemed impossible a little over a week ago - that all the boys and their coach will come out of the cave alive. A team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - has been working in the cave system. They have been guiding the boys through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the Tham Luang cave system.

The operation in pictures 'I am dying to see him. I miss my son' Letters of love from trapped Thai boys The process includes a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes already in place. Wearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy is being accompanied by two divers, who also carry his air supply. The toughest part is about halfway out at a section named ""T-Junction"", which is so tight the divers have to take off their air tanks to get through. Beyond that a cavern - called Chamber 3 - has been turned into a forward base for the divers. There the boys can rest before making the last, easier walk out to the entrance. They are then taken to hospital in Chiang Rai. In an indication of how dangerous the journey can be,a former Thai navy diver diedin the caves on Friday. Saman Gunan was returning from a mission to provide the group with air tanks when he ran out of oxygen. He lost consciousness and could not be revived. His colleagues said they would ""not let the sacrifice of our friend go to waste"". This video can not be played Wife and father remember 'hero' Thai diver: ""He loved helping others"" Some details have emerged of members of the team and their coach. Captain Duganpet Promtep, 13, is described as a motivator and highly respected by his teammates. He had apparently been scouted by several Thai professional clubs. Myanmar-bornAdul Sam-on, 14, speaks several languages, and was the only team member to be able to communicate with British divers when they were first discovered. It was 17-year-oldPeerapat Sompiangjai's birthday when the group became trapped in the cave.  The snacks the boys brought with them to celebrate are likely to have helped them survive their ordeal. Assistant coachEkapol Chantawong,25, was said to be the weakest of the group when they were found, as he reportedly refused to eat any of the food and gave it instead to the boys. Read more about the team The boys were found inside the cave by British rescue divers a week ago, about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth. Aged between 11 and 17, they belong to a football club called the Wild Boars, and became trapped during an excursion with their coach. This video can not be played Thailand cave rescue: Meet the volunteer helpers It took nine days to find them in the underground network's dark depths. The world football body Fifa has promised the boys seats at the World Cup final in Moscow on Sunday, but it remains to be seen if they will be well enough to take up the offer.

"This video can not be played ""He was laughing"": Three women share their experience of upskirting Misogyny and offences targeting women are still ""highly prevalent"" two years after a police force started treating them as hate crime, academics say. The ""misogyny hate crime policy"" has been piloted by Nottinghamshire Police. The force records misogynistic behaviour as either hate crime or hate incidents, depending on whether or not the behaviour is criminal. But university researchers were ""shocked"" by the volume and nature of the incidents among people surveyed. However, they found the policy is already ""shifting attitudes"". A new law to target upskirting culprits was introduced by the government last month Dr Loretta Trickett said: ""Much of this behaviour on this spectrum is criminal behaviour, there's no doubt about that. People could have gone to the police about it before. ""But because of the culture we have it's just acceptable to intimidate women on the street, to go up to a woman and touch her backside, or to comment on her body and put her in fear of an assault."" Professor Louise Mullany said: ""There's a spectrum of crime here, and it goes up to rape and sexual assault, and we were really shocked at how high the figures were in terms of people reporting the more serious end of crime, and that becoming part of a regular occurrence."" New law to target upskirting Could catcalling be a hate crime? 'Upskirting': It happened to me The Misogyny Hate Crime Evaluation report was put together jointly by the University of Nottingham and Nottingham Trent University. It recommends rolling the policy out nationally to increase publicity and the reporting of incidents. This view is shared by Paddy Tipping, Nottinghamshire's police and crime commissioner, who said: ""A handful of other forces have come forward and later on this week all the chief constables in the country are going to discuss the issue. ""We all need to be pushing together to say we are not going to tolerate this kind of behaviour. ""The report has come out at a really good time, a couple of days before all the chief constables have this discussion, and I think there's a lot of support for it."" Intimidating behaviour and unwanted sexual advances are also seen as misogyny hate crime Misogyny hate crime is defined as ""incidents against women that are motivated by the attitude of men towards women and includes behaviour targeted at women by men simply because they are women"". Examples include sexual assault, which had been experienced by 24.7% of survey respondents, indecent exposure (25.9%), groping (46.2%), taking unwanted photographs on mobiles (17.3%), upskirting (6.8%), online abuse (21.7%), being followed home (25.2%), whistling (62.9%), sexually explicit language (54.3%), threatening/aggressive/intimidating behaviour (51.8%), and unwanted sexual advances (48.9%). However, not all hate crimes are criminal offences according to the legal definition. Police have spoken to building site managers after women complained of being harassed by builders No. The research showed the policy had been misinterpreted and ""trivialised"" in media reports, which had focused on wolf whistling and suggested this was now illegal. However, the policy does not criminalise anything that was previously legal, and anything criminal is covered by existing legislation. For example, a sexual assault against a woman is still a sexual assault but is now recorded as a hate crime too. Wolf whistling would be recorded as a hate incident. There were 174 reports by women between April 2016 and March 2018. Of these, 73 were classified as crimes and 101 were classified as incidents. Police will start an investigation and women will be offered support whether or not the behaviour is criminal. For example, police have spoken to building site managers after women complained of being harassed by builders. Three quarters of all victims (74.9%) who responded to a survey said there had been a long term impact. The researchers also interviewed four of the women who had reported misogyny hate crime. One woman experienced two men in a van pulling over and shouting at her to get in while she was walking to work through an industrial estate. She said: ""It was leery, yeah, it wasn't explicit sexual language used but the whole experience was really intimidating."" Another woman had her bottom grabbed while she was running down the street and said it had frightened her, stopped her from going out at certain times and made her ""nervy"". The third woman was shouted at four or five times while out running, including something sexual by a workman in a van, which she found ""demeaning"". The fourth woman was called ""a slut"" and told she ""wanted it"" by a man on the tram, which had made her ""definitely more cautious"".

"New homes in suburban England would need to be fitted with electric car charging points under a government proposal to cut emissions. Ministers also want new street lights to come with charge points wherever there's on-street parking. Details ofa sales ban on new conventional petrol and diesel cars by 2040are also expected to be set out. The strategy comes at a timewhen the government is facing criticismfor failing to reduce carbon emissions. The government's target is to reduce the UK's greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% of 1990 levels by 2050. Why carmakers must adapt - or die Creme Eggs knock out car charging point UK's clean car goal 'not ambitious enough' The proposals, announced by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, aim to make it easier to recharge an electric car rather than refuel petrol or diesel vehicles. They include: The need to assess if new homes and offices should be required to install charging points as standard New street lighting columns with on-street parking to have charging points in appropriate locations More money being allocated to fund charging infrastructure. Mr Grayling said the proposed measures would mean the UK having ""one of the most comprehensive support packages for zero-emission vehicles in the world"". ""The prize is not just a cleaner and healthier environment but a UK economy fit for the future and the chance to win a substantial slice of a market estimated to be worth up to Â£7.6 trillion by 2050,"" he said. The government's Road to Zero strategy has been delayed by a dispute over what sort of cars should be allowed to be sold after 2040. The government's climate change advisers say carbon emissions from vehicles must be stopped by 2040 if the UK is to achieve its demanding long-term targets for protecting the climate. That implies that cars after that date should be fuelled by electricity or hydrogen. But car makers like Toyota, which have specialised in hybrid petrol/electric vehicles, have been arguing that as most journeys are fairly short it doesn't make sense to carry a battery big enough to make a 200-mile trip. It seems they have won their argument that hybrids should still be able to be sold - to the dismay of environmentalists who say the task of tackling carbon emissions from transport is going much too slowly anyway. The Campaign for Better Transport welcomed plans to increase charge points but said ""overall the strategy fails to match the urgency of the situation"". It said new petrol and diesel cars should be banned by 2030 - ten years earlier than the government's proposal - and criticised the ""confusion"" over the future of hybrids. The government has said it sees a role for hybrid technology in its new strategy. In the first six months of this year, electric vehicles made up only 5.5% of the UK's new car market, compared with 4.3% over the same period in 2017. The RAC Foundation, a motoring research charity, found that growth in the electric car industry was hampered by a lack of widespread, reliable and easy-to-use public charging points. Research by the AA showed eight out of 10 drivers see the lack of charging points as a stumbling block to buying an electric car. The motoring organisation said the proposals were ""a step in the right direction"", adding that ""there is still much to do to wean drivers off petrol and diesel cars"".

"Carseview Centre is already the focus of an independent inquiry Patients at a mental health unit have told the BBC they were pinned to the floor in agony and bullied on wards where illegal drugs were rife. Former patients at the Carseview Centre in Dundee claimed staff had used face-down restraint violently and repeatedly over the past five years. They said the practice was used for prolonged periods and patients were also mocked and shouted at by staff. NHS Tayside said it would investigate the claims in full and ""will act"". The allegations have led to calls for the unit to be closed down. Carseview is the biggest mental health unit in Tayside, with about 80 beds over five wards. Hundreds of patients a year are treated there. The unit is already the subject of an independent inquiry into mental health services, after families of suicide victims campaigned for change. AFatal Accident Inquiry,externalpublished last week into the death of Dale Thomson said there were ""serious systemic failures in the care"" he received at Carseview. The latest allegations against Carseview centre feature in aBBC Scotland documentary, Breaking Point, which will be broadcast on Monday. The BBC has spoken to 24 people who have been in the Carseview in the past five years. Sixteen of them said they saw that illegal drugs were available at the unit. Eleven patients said they had been unreasonably restrained face-down. A further seven said they had seen this happening to other patients. Guidelines say face-down restraint, which can restrict a patient's breathing, should last no longer than 10 minutes and should only be used as an absolute last resort. There have been calls for it to be banned because of the risk it can physically harm patients, as well as re-traumatise people who have been victims of violence and abuse. Adele said the way she was held down caused bruising and swelling to her knee Former youth worker Adele Douglas, from Forfar, was admitted to Carseview last year, after experiencing depression and anorexia. She was on 24-hour suicide watch, and, after a serious attempt to take her own life, staff pinned her to the ground. Adele said she shouted about being in pain and one member of staff reacted badly. She said: ""At this point I was going absolutely mad, then he'd lifted his hand and slapped me really hard on my thigh. ""When he slapped me he said, 'That's enough of that'. ""The guy was really rough with me. It was like he was taking his frustration out on me."" Adele, who is asthmatic, said she was struggling to breathe and that her knee was badly bruised by the way she was restrained. She said a nurse later told her she had been held down for 45 minutes to an hour. She said some of the staff were very professional but that she was pinned down in this way three times during her time in Carseview. Marnie Stirling said she saw patients selling drugs to other patients Adele was one of the 16 patients who told the BBC that drugs were available inside the unit. Marnie Stirling, who had two stays in Carseview, with anxiety and depression, also said she saw illegal drugs on the ward ""all the time"". ""It was rife,"" she said. ""Everyone was offered them. Cannabis was the easiest one to get."" David Fong says this photo, taken in 2013, was a result of being restrained in Carseview David Fong spent a month in the unit after experiencing psychosis in 2013. He claimed staff used restraint violently and repeatedly during his time there. David said: ""The restraints in Carseview definitely did feel like punishments. I think it was also the nurses wanted to maintain their authority above the patients."" ""It does cause trauma,"" he added. ""Things you'll never forget."" Joy Duxbury said restraint should be used as a last resort to prevent patients getting more agitated or violent The programme showed the testimony gathered by the BBC to two independent experts. These individuals have never worked at Carseview and are not witnesses to conditions there but they described the allegations made by the patients as abusive. Joy Duxbury, professor of mental health at Manchester Metropolitan University, is an expert on how the rules on restraint should be carried out in practice in the wards. She said patients should not end up with burn marks like David's if restraint was carried out properly. ""Rubbing of a face in to a carpet is certainly not an acceptable approach and would never be taught as part of prevention and management of violence and aggression,"" she said. Professor Peter Tyrer chaired the group which wrote the guidelines on how to handle mental health patients Professor Peter Tyrer, who co-wrote the guidelines on how to handle mental health patients, said he was concerned the culture at Carseview had become so toxic it should be closed. ""I know that there are various changes going on there but I think once you get a culture like that which has been there for a long time, it's very difficult to move it,"" he said. ""What really concerns me is that if this unit persisted, it would represent a continuing scandal in mental health care."" NHS Tayside said it was very concerned by the nature of the allegations. It did not respond to the call for Carseview to be closed down. It said it could not discuss ""individual cases due to patient confidentiality"" and would not be interviewed. The health board said it would like to include the allegations in an ongoing independent inquiry into mental health services in Tayside. Chairman John Brown said: ""We take any concerns raised with us very seriously and we want to be able to investigate people's experiences in detail and take any appropriate action. ""That is why I would encourage patients to come forward and share their own stories with us. We will listen and we will act."" Breaking Point will be broadcast on BBC One Scotland at 20:30 on Monday 9 July, and afterwards on the BBC iPlayer.

"Tory vice-chairs Ben Bradley and Maria Caulfield resign They are latest to go because of cabinet's Brexit plan President Trump refers to UK 'turmoil' ahead of visit Earlier PM Theresa May chaired her new-look cabinet Jeremy Hunt succeeded Boris Johnson as foreign secretary Matt Hancock succeeded Hunt as health secretary Andy McFarlane and Gavin Stamp We are drawing the curtains on the live page. It's been a busy day, so here's a recap on the main developments.  Angela Merkel welcomes the UK's Chequers agreement, saying it is a ""good thing we have proposals on the table"". The German Chancellor says the remaining 27 EU members will agree a ""common response"" once it has seen the detail of the official UK position. But she says progress is being made and repeats her stance that her country wants as close links as possible with the UK after Brexit. Theresa May is asked about Donald Trump's claims that the UK is in turmoil, ahead of his visit on Thursday, and whether the US President is a real fan of Boris Johnson. The PM does not comment directly but says she is looking forward to Mr Trump's visit, saying there is ""much to discuss"". She says the special relationship with the US is the UK's deepest and longest security and defence alliance. The two leaders, she adds, will talking about how to use this to benefit the UK and US but also enhance the wider good.  But who do these shoes belong to? The answer: British Prime Minister Theresa May, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama and Montenegro's Prime Minister Dusko Markovic. Theresa May is now speaking at the conclusion of the Western Balkans summit in central London. She says claims that, as a result of Brexit, the UK will be ""retreating"" from its role as a guarantor of peace in the region and on the continent as a whole are completely wrong. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is now speaking. Brexit is almost certain to crop up during questions.  In his letter resigning as a Tory vice-chair, Remain voter Ben Bradley writes that he was persuaded to back the Brexit vision because of the ""immense opportunities that are available from global trade, and for the ability
for Britain to be an outward looking nation in control of our own destiny once
again"". But he complains: ""I fear that this agreement at Chequers damages those opportunities; that being tied to EU regulations, and the EU tying our hands when seeking to make new trade agreements, will be the worst of all worlds if we do not deliver Brexit in spirit as well as in name. ""Then we are handing Jeremy Corbyn the keys to Number 10."" MPs have decisively rejected Liberal Democrat calls for a ""People's Vote"" on the final Brexit deal. A Commons motion put forward by Sir Vince Cable's party was defeated by 299 votes to 13 in Parliament. Aside from nine Lib Dem MPs, the other MPs to support it were Green Party leader Caroline Lucas and Plaid Cymru's three MPs. Conservative peer Lord Finkelstein, a close friend of David Cameron, takes issue with some of the arguments made by Ben Bradley or Maria Caulfield in their resignation letters.

The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, speaking in New York, added that many models of co-operation with Brussels were available to the UK, including a ""Norway"" deal, ""Norway plus"" or an ""ambitious"" version of the Canada deal, and that each deal had ""its own balance of rights and negotiations"". However, he said the UK's current red lines meant they were ""closing the door"" to many different types of co-operation. Michel Barnier, who's leading Brexit negotiations on behalf of Brussels, has said there is accord on 80% of the UK withdrawal
agreement and that the European Union was ready to start working on an ""ambitious free trade arrangement"" with the UK. Speaking
in New York, Mr Barnier said that negotiators still needed to find a solution
to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland. In
response to recent resignations in Westminster, Mr Barnier said he had a

""many people with different views"" during the course of the

"This video can not be played ""He was laughing"": Three women share their experience of upskirting Misogyny and offences targeting women are still ""highly prevalent"" two years after a police force started treating them as hate crime, academics say. The ""misogyny hate crime policy"" has been piloted by Nottinghamshire Police. The force records misogynistic behaviour as either hate crime or hate incidents, depending on whether or not the behaviour is criminal. But university researchers were ""shocked"" by the volume and nature of the incidents among people surveyed. However, they found the policy is already ""shifting attitudes"". A new law to target upskirting culprits was introduced by the government last month Dr Loretta Trickett said: ""Much of this behaviour on this spectrum is criminal behaviour, there's no doubt about that. People could have gone to the police about it before. ""But because of the culture we have it's just acceptable to intimidate women on the street, to go up to a woman and touch her backside, or to comment on her body and put her in fear of an assault."" Professor Louise Mullany said: ""There's a spectrum of crime here, and it goes up to rape and sexual assault, and we were really shocked at how high the figures were in terms of people reporting the more serious end of crime, and that becoming part of a regular occurrence."" New law to target upskirting Could catcalling be a hate crime? 'Upskirting': It happened to me The Misogyny Hate Crime Evaluation report was put together jointly by the University of Nottingham and Nottingham Trent University. It recommends rolling the policy out nationally to increase publicity and the reporting of incidents. This view is shared by Paddy Tipping, Nottinghamshire's police and crime commissioner, who said: ""A handful of other forces have come forward and later on this week all the chief constables in the country are going to discuss the issue. ""We all need to be pushing together to say we are not going to tolerate this kind of behaviour. ""The report has come out at a really good time, a couple of days before all the chief constables have this discussion, and I think there's a lot of support for it."" Intimidating behaviour and unwanted sexual advances are also seen as misogyny hate crime Misogyny hate crime is defined as ""incidents against women that are motivated by the attitude of men towards women and includes behaviour targeted at women by men simply because they are women"". Examples include sexual assault, which had been experienced by 24.7% of survey respondents, indecent exposure (25.9%), groping (46.2%), taking unwanted photographs on mobiles (17.3%), upskirting (6.8%), online abuse (21.7%), being followed home (25.2%), whistling (62.9%), sexually explicit language (54.3%), threatening/aggressive/intimidating behaviour (51.8%), and unwanted sexual advances (48.9%). However, not all hate crimes are criminal offences according to the legal definition. Police have spoken to building site managers after women complained of being harassed by builders No. The research showed the policy had been misinterpreted and ""trivialised"" in media reports, which had focused on wolf whistling and suggested this was now illegal. However, the policy does not criminalise anything that was previously legal, and anything criminal is covered by existing legislation. For example, a sexual assault against a woman is still a sexual assault but is now recorded as a hate crime too. Wolf whistling would be recorded as a hate incident. There were 174 reports by women between April 2016 and March 2018. Of these, 73 were classified as crimes and 101 were classified as incidents. Police will start an investigation and women will be offered support whether or not the behaviour is criminal. For example, police have spoken to building site managers after women complained of being harassed by builders. Three quarters of all victims (74.9%) who responded to a survey said there had been a long term impact. The researchers also interviewed four of the women who had reported misogyny hate crime. One woman experienced two men in a van pulling over and shouting at her to get in while she was walking to work through an industrial estate. She said: ""It was leery, yeah, it wasn't explicit sexual language used but the whole experience was really intimidating."" Another woman had her bottom grabbed while she was running down the street and said it had frightened her, stopped her from going out at certain times and made her ""nervy"". The third woman was shouted at four or five times while out running, including something sexual by a workman in a van, which she found ""demeaning"". The fourth woman was called ""a slut"" and told she ""wanted it"" by a man on the tram, which had made her ""definitely more cautious"".

"Carseview Centre is already the focus of an independent inquiry Patients at a mental health unit have told the BBC they were pinned to the floor in agony and bullied on wards where illegal drugs were rife. Former patients at the Carseview Centre in Dundee claimed staff had used face-down restraint violently and repeatedly over the past five years. They said the practice was used for prolonged periods and patients were also mocked and shouted at by staff. NHS Tayside said it would investigate the claims in full and ""will act"". The allegations have led to calls for the unit to be closed down. Carseview is the biggest mental health unit in Tayside, with about 80 beds over five wards. Hundreds of patients a year are treated there. The unit is already the subject of an independent inquiry into mental health services, after families of suicide victims campaigned for change. AFatal Accident Inquiry,externalpublished last week into the death of Dale Thomson said there were ""serious systemic failures in the care"" he received at Carseview. The latest allegations against Carseview centre feature in aBBC Scotland documentary, Breaking Point, which will be broadcast on Monday. The BBC has spoken to 24 people who have been in the Carseview in the past five years. Sixteen of them said they saw that illegal drugs were available at the unit. Eleven patients said they had been unreasonably restrained face-down. A further seven said they had seen this happening to other patients. Guidelines say face-down restraint, which can restrict a patient's breathing, should last no longer than 10 minutes and should only be used as an absolute last resort. There have been calls for it to be banned because of the risk it can physically harm patients, as well as re-traumatise people who have been victims of violence and abuse. Adele said the way she was held down caused bruising and swelling to her knee Former youth worker Adele Douglas, from Forfar, was admitted to Carseview last year, after experiencing depression and anorexia. She was on 24-hour suicide watch, and, after a serious attempt to take her own life, staff pinned her to the ground. Adele said she shouted about being in pain and one member of staff reacted badly. She said: ""At this point I was going absolutely mad, then he'd lifted his hand and slapped me really hard on my thigh. ""When he slapped me he said, 'That's enough of that'. ""The guy was really rough with me. It was like he was taking his frustration out on me."" Adele, who is asthmatic, said she was struggling to breathe and that her knee was badly bruised by the way she was restrained. She said a nurse later told her she had been held down for 45 minutes to an hour. She said some of the staff were very professional but that she was pinned down in this way three times during her time in Carseview. Marnie Stirling said she saw patients selling drugs to other patients Adele was one of the 16 patients who told the BBC that drugs were available inside the unit. Marnie Stirling, who had two stays in Carseview, with anxiety and depression, also said she saw illegal drugs on the ward ""all the time"". ""It was rife,"" she said. ""Everyone was offered them. Cannabis was the easiest one to get."" David Fong says this photo, taken in 2013, was a result of being restrained in Carseview David Fong spent a month in the unit after experiencing psychosis in 2013. He claimed staff used restraint violently and repeatedly during his time there. David said: ""The restraints in Carseview definitely did feel like punishments. I think it was also the nurses wanted to maintain their authority above the patients."" ""It does cause trauma,"" he added. ""Things you'll never forget."" Joy Duxbury said restraint should be used as a last resort to prevent patients getting more agitated or violent The programme showed the testimony gathered by the BBC to two independent experts. These individuals have never worked at Carseview and are not witnesses to conditions there but they described the allegations made by the patients as abusive. Joy Duxbury, professor of mental health at Manchester Metropolitan University, is an expert on how the rules on restraint should be carried out in practice in the wards. She said patients should not end up with burn marks like David's if restraint was carried out properly. ""Rubbing of a face in to a carpet is certainly not an acceptable approach and would never be taught as part of prevention and management of violence and aggression,"" she said. Professor Peter Tyrer chaired the group which wrote the guidelines on how to handle mental health patients Professor Peter Tyrer, who co-wrote the guidelines on how to handle mental health patients, said he was concerned the culture at Carseview had become so toxic it should be closed. ""I know that there are various changes going on there but I think once you get a culture like that which has been there for a long time, it's very difficult to move it,"" he said. ""What really concerns me is that if this unit persisted, it would represent a continuing scandal in mental health care."" NHS Tayside said it was very concerned by the nature of the allegations. It did not respond to the call for Carseview to be closed down. It said it could not discuss ""individual cases due to patient confidentiality"" and would not be interviewed. The health board said it would like to include the allegations in an ongoing independent inquiry into mental health services in Tayside. Chairman John Brown said: ""We take any concerns raised with us very seriously and we want to be able to investigate people's experiences in detail and take any appropriate action. ""That is why I would encourage patients to come forward and share their own stories with us. We will listen and we will act."" Breaking Point will be broadcast on BBC One Scotland at 20:30 on Monday 9 July, and afterwards on the BBC iPlayer.

"The government is prioritising cost over quality when outsourcing public sector contracts, leading to worse services, a committee of MPs says. The collapse of construction giant Carillion had exposed ""fundamental flaws"" in the outsourcing process, the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee said. When Carillion failed in January, it had 420 UK public sector contracts. MPs said its collapse had ""badly shaken public confidence in outsourcing"". But it said the government's approach of ""spending as little money as possible"" meant that contractors were being forced to ""take unacceptable levels of financial risk"". ""Ultimately, this has led to worse public services as companies have been sent a clear signal that cost, rather than quality of services, is the government's consistent priority,"" the committee's report said. Carillion: Six charts that explain what happened Carillion collapse to cost taxpayers Â£148m According to the committee's calculations, the government has had to renegotiate more than Â£120m of contracts since the beginning of 2016 to make sure that the public services provided continued. The report also found that the government was unable to provide ""significant evidence"" for its key claim for outsourcing, that it provides ""better services for less public money"". It said this was particularly true for private finance initiative (PFI) deals which are used to fund many public services such as new schools or hospitals. The committee said that the government had admitted that the ""entire (PFI) structure is to keep the debt off the balance sheet"". The MPs are urging the government to be more transparent about how it decides to outsource and award contracts. It also wants ministers to commit to ""realistic assessments of cost"" when it outsources contracts. Committee chairman Sir Bernard Jenkin said it was ""staggering"" that the government had misunderstood the costs of contracts. ""It has accepted bids below what it costs to provide the service, so that the contract has had to be renegotiated."" He warned that a crisis like Carillion could happen again unless the government acted. A Cabinet Office spokesman said the government would respond formally to the report in ""due course"". ""The government is committed to ensuring a healthy and diverse marketplace of companies bidding for government contracts, and we have recently announced a wide package of new measures to further improve how we work with our vendors,"" he added.

"The parade started off from Portland Place in central London on Saturday Pride in London organisers have apologised after anti-trans protesters ""forced their way to the front of the parade"". Members of lesbian and feminist group Get The L Out demanded to march behind the rainbow flag, which marks the start of the event, organisers said. The group argues the trans movement is attacking lesbian rights and said it protested to protect those rights. Pride said their behaviour on Saturday was ""shocking and disgusting"". It said they could not forcibly remove the small group because their protest was not a criminal offence, adding ""we are sorry"" but the ""actions of eight people did not stop the joy and love"". Its statement said: ""The protest group showed a level of bigotry, ignorance and hate that is unacceptable.,externalWe reject what this group stands for. They do not share our values, which are about inclusion and respect and support for the most marginalised parts of our community. ""We are proud of our trans volunteers, proud of the trans groups that are in our parade, proud of our trans speakers at events and proud of the trans people who take part in our campaigns and proud of those who cheered even louder for them yesterday."" Pride values are about inclusion and respect, organisers said The parade, which coincided with England's World Cup quarter-final in Russia,included about 30,000 people from 472 organisations. Up to one million other people are thought to have lined the streets to watch the event. The activists stole the place of the NHS, TransPALS said Patricia Curtis, of TransPals said: ""It's disappointing that anti-trans activists decided to hijack the front of a parade, an insult to all the hardworking staff in the NHS whose place they stole. ""But their vile stunt failed. London is a place that doesn't tolerate hate."" Pride said this year's parade was the most diverse A Get The L Out spokeswoman said: ""We protested to protect our rights and on behalf of all the lesbians intimidated, threatened and silenced by the GBT community everywhere. ""The GBT community today, by supporting the rights of males who ""identify as lesbians"" (also called ""transwomen"") over the rights of lesbians to choose their sexual partners (on the basis of their sex, not how they ""identify"") is in fact enforcing heterosexuality on lesbians.

"Local people on the Isle of Bute have held a candlelit vigil for Alesha MacPhail. The six-year-old was staying with her father and grandparents in Ardbeg when she was reported missing last Monday morning. Less than three hours later her body was discovered in woods nearby. Locals met in Rothesay's Guildford Square at 20:00 to light candles to remember the schoolgirl who teachers described as ""smiley and happy"". A 16-year-old boyappeared in court in Greenock on Fridaycharged with the rape and murder of the six-year-old. He made no plea or declaration and was remanded in custody. The head teacher at the primary school Alesha attended in Airdrie described her as a ""happy, smiley"" girl Islander Rachel Perry was among those attending the vigil. She told BBC Scotland: ""This island comes together when tragedy strikes and we are all here for her family."" The hashtag #lightforalesha has been set up for those who could not be there to post pictures online of candles they have lit in Alesha's memory. A fundraising page has also been set up to raise money for the family of the six-year-old.

"New homes in suburban England would need to be fitted with electric car charging points under a government proposal to cut emissions. Ministers also want new street lights to come with charge points wherever there's on-street parking. Details ofa sales ban on new conventional petrol and diesel cars by 2040are also expected to be set out. The strategy comes at a timewhen the government is facing criticismfor failing to reduce carbon emissions. The government's target is to reduce the UK's greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% of 1990 levels by 2050. Why carmakers must adapt - or die Creme Eggs knock out car charging point UK's clean car goal 'not ambitious enough' The proposals, announced by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, aim to make it easier to recharge an electric car rather than refuel petrol or diesel vehicles. They include: The need to assess if new homes and offices should be required to install charging points as standard New street lighting columns with on-street parking to have charging points in appropriate locations More money being allocated to fund charging infrastructure. Mr Grayling said the proposed measures would mean the UK having ""one of the most comprehensive support packages for zero-emission vehicles in the world"". ""The prize is not just a cleaner and healthier environment but a UK economy fit for the future and the chance to win a substantial slice of a market estimated to be worth up to Â£7.6 trillion by 2050,"" he said. The government's Road to Zero strategy has been delayed by a dispute over what sort of cars should be allowed to be sold after 2040. The government's climate change advisers say carbon emissions from vehicles must be stopped by 2040 if the UK is to achieve its demanding long-term targets for protecting the climate. That implies that cars after that date should be fuelled by electricity or hydrogen. But car makers like Toyota, which have specialised in hybrid petrol/electric vehicles, have been arguing that as most journeys are fairly short it doesn't make sense to carry a battery big enough to make a 200-mile trip. It seems they have won their argument that hybrids should still be able to be sold - to the dismay of environmentalists who say the task of tackling carbon emissions from transport is going much too slowly anyway. The Campaign for Better Transport welcomed plans to increase charge points but said ""overall the strategy fails to match the urgency of the situation"". It said new petrol and diesel cars should be banned by 2030 - ten years earlier than the government's proposal - and criticised the ""confusion"" over the future of hybrids. The government has said it sees a role for hybrid technology in its new strategy. In the first six months of this year, electric vehicles made up only 5.5% of the UK's new car market, compared with 4.3% over the same period in 2017. The RAC Foundation, a motoring research charity, found that growth in the electric car industry was hampered by a lack of widespread, reliable and easy-to-use public charging points. Research by the AA showed eight out of 10 drivers see the lack of charging points as a stumbling block to buying an electric car. The motoring organisation said the proposals were ""a step in the right direction"", adding that ""there is still much to do to wean drivers off petrol and diesel cars"".

"The boys who were rescued on Monday are said to be in reasonable health Divers have rescued four more boys from a vast cave system in northern Thailand on the second day of a complex operation. The Thai Navy Seals leading the rescue operation have confirmed that eight boys in total have been extracted. Four boys and their football coach remain inside the caves. Rescuers will try to free them on Tuesday. The group became trapped on 23 June after heavy rains caused flooding, and was found last week by divers. Four boys were brought out safely on Sunday, but the mission was paused overnight for air tanks to be replaced. On Monday, air ambulances were seen departing from the area around the cave system and ambulances were seen arriving at the hospital in the nearby town of Chiang Rai. The boys have not been seen in public, but have been pronounced to be in reasonable health. Who are the Thai boys trapped in a cave? How risky is the Thai boys rescue? The rescue operation is complicated by sections in the cave involving diving - sometimes in very confined spaces - and climbing. The BBC's Dan Johnson, at the scene, says it is a careful, delicate operation fraught with risk. But he adds that this daring, dangerous and complicated exercise is delivering success against difficult odds, and relief is starting to break the tension of the situation. The group of boys and their coach were found after nine days After Monday's operation had wound down for the day, rescue mission chief Narongsak Osottanakorn told reporters: ""All four boys have arrived at hospital, all are safe."" He said the second day of the operation had gone more smoothly than the first, taking two hours less as the procedure became more refined. Tuesday morning will see the start of attempts to rescue the remaining four boys and the football coach. A massive pumping operation is said to have helped lower the water level inside the cave system, making the journey in and out easier than it was. The Thai authorities say the rescued boys are able to eat rice porridge, although their request for a favourite pork dish has been turned down until their digestive systems recover from 10 days without food. The government is strictly controlling information about the rescue. The names of the boys who got out have not been released, and even their parents have not been allowed to see them - for health reasons, say Thai officials. By Martin Patience, Chiang Rai Outside the hospital where the boys were being received, there was a heavy police and media presence. Early in the afternoon, the sound of a helicopter thudded overhead. It was a sign that the rescue operation was going to plan. A few minutes later, a convoy with an ambulance swept through the streets and swung into the hospital entrance. It was carrying the first boy rescued on Monday. Then as dusk was falling, a small crowd of locals gathered outside the hospital. Word was filtering out that more boys had been rescued. People were straining to catch a glimpse of the unfolding drama. It came in the form of the flashing lights of three more ambulances - signifying the rescue of three more boys. The rescue operation will resume on Tuesday. It is not yet over and is still fraught with danger. But people here are daring to believe what seemed impossible a little over a week ago - that all the boys and their coach will come out of the cave alive. A team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - has been working in the cave system. They have been guiding the boys through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the Tham Luang cave system. This video can not be played Child psychiatrist: ""It will be a challenge for these children to go back to normal life"" Getting to and from where the boys are has been an exhausting round trip, even for the experienced divers. The operation in pictures 'I am dying to see him. I miss my son' Letters of love from trapped Thai boys The process includes a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes already in place. Wearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy is being accompanied by two divers, who also carry his air supply. The toughest part is about halfway out at a section named ""T-Junction"", which is so tight the divers have to take off their air tanks to get through. Beyond that a cavern - called Chamber 3 - has been turned into a forward base for the divers. There the boys can rest before making the last, easier walk out to the entrance. They are then taken to hospital in Chiang Rai. In an indication of how dangerous the journey can be,a former Thai navy diver diedin the caves on Friday. Saman Gunan was returning from a mission to provide the group with air tanks when he ran out of oxygen. He lost consciousness and could not be revived. His colleagues said they would ""not let the sacrifice of our friend go to waste"". This video can not be played Wife and father remember 'hero' Thai diver: ""He loved helping others"" Some details have emerged of members of the team and their coach. Captain Duganpet Promtep, 13, is described as a motivator and highly respected by his teammates. He had apparently been scouted by several Thai professional clubs. Myanmar-bornAdul Sam-on, 14, speaks several languages, and was the only team member to be able to communicate with British divers when they were first discovered. It was 17-year-oldPeerapat Sompiangjai's birthday when the group became trapped in the cave.  The snacks the boys brought with them to celebrate are likely to have helped them survive their ordeal. Assistant coachEkapol Chantawong,25, was said to be the weakest of the group when they were found, as he reportedly refused to eat any of the food and gave it instead to the boys. Read more about the team The boys were found inside the cave by British rescue divers a week ago, about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth. Aged between 11 and 17, they belong to a football club called the Wild Boars, and became trapped during an excursion with their coach. This video can not be played Thailand cave rescue: Meet the volunteer helpers It took nine days to find them in the underground network's dark depths. The world football body Fifa has promised the boys seats at the World Cup final in Moscow on Sunday, but it remains to be seen if they will be well enough to take up the offer.
