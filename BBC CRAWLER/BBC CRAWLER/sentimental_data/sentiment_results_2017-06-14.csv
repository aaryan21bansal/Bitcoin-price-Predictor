"This video can not be played Witnesses describe their night of horror Twelve people have died in a west London tower block fire and the number of deaths is expected to rise, police have said. Firefighters rescued 65 people from Grenfell Tower in north Kensington, after they were called at 00:54 BST. Witnesses said people were trapped in the tower block, and that some jumped from windows in an effort to escape. Theresa May said there would be a full investigation and ""if there are any lessons to be learned they will be"". Latest updates: Death toll expected to rise What we know so far Baby caught after being 'dropped to safety from tower' It is understood that ""several hundred"" people would have been in the block when the fire broke out, most of them sleeping. The tower had around 120 flats. The cause of the fire remains unknown. BBC reporter Sarah Corker said firefighters were working through the night to dampen the fire - with flames still visible, more than 24 hours after the blaze began. She said crews using an aerial platform were going ""floor by floor"" shining lights into the building. Jessica Urbano Ramirez, 12, is believed to have become separated from her family The ambulance service said 68 patients were taken to six hospitals across London, with 18 in critical care. A further 10 patients made their own way to hospital. But manymore people are unaccounted for, and loved ones have appealed on social media for information. Among them is 12-year-old Jessica Urbano Ramirez, 66-year-old retired lorry driver Tony Disson, and security guard Mo Tuccu, a British national from Eritrea. Eyewitnesses said they saw lights - thought to be mobile phones or torches - flashing at the top of the block of flats. Trapped residents came to their windows - some holding children. One witness said a baby was caught by a member of the public after being dropped from the tower block. An emergency number -0800 0961 233- has been set up for anyone concerned about friends or family. This video can not be played A local nurse ran towards the burning building to try to help victims Commander Stuart Cundy, of the Metropolitan Police, said: ""Sadly I can confirm that there are now 12 people that have died that we know of. ""I do anticipate that the number of fatalities will sadly increase beyond those 12."" Pictures from the scene Residents raised fire risk fears The questions facing investigators London Fire Brigade Assistant Commissioner, Steve Apter, said there were ""still pockets of fire yet to be extinguished in places particularly difficult to reach"" but ""almost all"" of the building had been searched. Checks have been carried out on the building and it is not in danger of collapsing, London Fire Brigade said. Firefighters rescued 65 people from Grenfell Tower in north Kensington Paul Munakr, who lives on the seventh floor, managed to escape. ""As I was going down the stairs, there were firefighters, truly amazing firefighters, that were actually going upstairs, to the fire, trying to get as many people out the building as possible,"" he told the BBC. He said he was alerted to the fire not by fire alarms but by people on the street below, shouting ""don't jump, don't jump"". Labour demands answers over Grenfell Tower fire tragedy 'I saw people jumping out of windows' Evening Standard photographer describes 'war zone' conditions Eyewitness Jody Martin said: ""I watched one person falling out, I watched another woman holding her baby out the window... hearing screams. ""I was yelling at everyone to get down and they were saying 'We can't leave our apartments, the smoke is too bad on the corridors'."" Michael Paramasivan, who lives on the seventh floor with his girlfriend and young daughter, said he ignored official advice to stay in your home. ""If we had stayed in that flat, we would've perished. My gut instinct told me just to get the girls out. I wrapped the little one up because of the smoke and I just got them out."" Another resident, Zoe, who lives on the fourth floor, said she was woken by a neighbour banging on her door. ""The whole landing was thick with smoke. The smoke alarms weren't going off but the way it spread so quickly from the fourth floor, all the way up to the 23rd floor was scary."" The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea council said it had placed 44 households so far in emergency accommodation. For those unable to return to their homes, a rest centre has been set up at Westway Sports Centre, a statement said, and residents affected should call 020 7361 3008. It is understood that 'several hundred' people would have been in the block when the fire broke out Grenfell Tower underwent an Â£8.6m refurbishment as part of a wider transformation of the estate, that was completed in May last year. Work included new exterior cladding and a communal heating system. The 24-storey tower is managed by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation on behalf of the council. Before and during the refurbishment, the localGrenfell Action Group,externalclaimed that the block constituted a fire risk andresidents warnedthat site access for emergency vehicles was ""severely restricted"". Policing and fire minister Nick Hurd said checks were now planned on tower blocks that have gone through similar refurbishment. He said authorities discussed ""a process whereby we seek to identify towers that might be in a similar process of refurbishment (and) run a system of checks and inspections"". More than 250 firefighters tackled the blaze Construction firm Rydon, which carried out the refurbishment, said it was ""shocked to hear of the devastating fire"". It originally stated that the work ""met all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards"". It later issued a new statement, removing the previous mention of the building meeting fire regulation standards, instead saying the project met ""all required building regulations"". In a statement,external, Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, said it was ""too early to speculate what caused the fire and contributed to its spread"". Council leader Nick Paget-Brown said the buildings were regularly inspected, but a ""thorough investigation"" was needed. The prime ministerhas promiseda ""proper investigation"" into the fire. But Labour politicians arecalling for answersfrom the government. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""We need to know what reports were available, what information was given and what actions were taken."" A review of building regulations covering fire safety was promised by Prime Minister Theresa May's chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, last year, when he was a government minister, but has not been published. Responding to earlier reports, the Department for Communities and Local Government said it was ""simply not true"" that a report has been ""sat on"". Following theLakanal House fire in south Londonin 2009, in which six people died, the coroner recommended the guidance relating to fire safety within the Building Regulations was simplified. The government said this work was ""ongoing"". The government also wrote to councils encouraging them to consider retro-fitting sprinklers, as recommended by the coroner, a statement said. Southwark Council was finedÂ£270,000 for breaching fire safety regulationsafter the Lakanal House blaze.

"The former soccer star is now a Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer was given negligent financial advice, the High Court in London has been told. The 46-year-old former England and Newcastle star, now a Match of the Day pundit, is suing for Â£9m in damages. He claims financial advisor Kevin Neal was ""careless"" and ""dishonest"", while pension specialist Suffolk Life had breached its regulatory duties. Both Suffolk Life and Mr Neal dispute the claims, with Mr Neal describing them as driven by ""pure greed and ego"". Mr Shearer is also suing two defunct companies - Kevin Neal Associates and Kevin Neal Associates Wealth Management. The barrister leading Mr Shearer's legal team, Gerard McMeel, said the claims centred on pension investments. In a written case outline, he said his client had ""limited knowledge or experience"" of making investments and he and his wife Lainya relied on professional advisers and ""those with responsibility to look after their interests"". Javan Herberg, representing Suffolk Life, said Mr Shearer and his advisers were responsible for their investment decisions. He said Mr Shearer's claims that Mr Neal had ""effectively swindled"" the couple required some investigation. Mr Neal, who is defending himself, said the Shearers had made ""serious money"" out of one investment fund. He said it was for the judge, Mr Justice Leggatt, to decide whether the Shearers were ""naive"" or ""sophisticated"" investors. Mr Neal said the Shearers had ""pushed"" him to put more money into one fund, and he had not been ""gung-ho"", but had ""acted in good faith at all times"". He added: ""This claim is just driven by pure greed and ego."" In his 18-year playing career Shearer made more than 600 appearances for clubs including Newcastle, Southampton and Blackburn, and won more than 60 England caps. The trial continues.

"This video can not be played Tim Farron: Living as a Christian and being a political leader 'has felt impossible' Tim Farron has said he is to step down as leader of the Liberal Democrats, less than a week after the election. In a statement, he said he was ""torn between living as a faithful Christian and serving as a political leader"". He said he should have dealt ""more wisely"" with questions relating to his faith during the election campaign, including his views on gay sex. Possible successors include former ministers Sir Vince Cable, Jo Swinson, Sir Ed Davey and Norman Lamb. Church leaders praised Mr Farron. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said he was ""honourable and decent"". The acting Bishop of London, Pete Broadbent, said ""no-one should have to choose between their faith and politics"" and it was ""deeply regrettable"" he felt the need to quit. Farron quits: Reaction and live updates Paddick quits Lib Dem frontbench role The Tim Farron story In a hastily arranged statement, and surrounded by his close colleagues, Mr Farron insisted his decision to step down was voluntary and that he retained the support of his party, which he had been proud to lead for nearly two years. But he said he could no longer reconcile his strong Christian faith with his responsibilities as leader of a liberal party. ""The consequences of the focus on my faith is that I have found myself torn between living as a faithful Christian and serving as a political leader,"" he said. ""A better, wiser person may have been able to deal with this more successfully, to remain faithful to Christ while leading a political party in the current environment. ""To be a leader, particularly of a progressive liberal party in 2017 and to live as a committed Christian and to hold faithful to the Bible's teaching has felt impossible for me."" He said he was passionate about defending the rights and liberties of people who believed differently to him, but said he had been the ""subject of suspicion"" because of his own beliefs. While questions about his faith were legitimate, he said they ""distracted"" from the party's election campaign. During the campaign, he was asked repeatedly in media interviews to clarify his views on gay sex but did not, to begin with, answer directly. He later insisted that he did not believe it was a sin and that, while he believed political leaders should not ""pontificate on theological matters"", it was right to address the subject as it had become ""an issue"". Earlier on Wednesday, shadow home affairs spokesman Lord Paddick himself quit, citing concerns about Mr Farron's ""views on various issues"". As the party does not currently have a deputy leader, Mr Farron will remain in place while an election is held to choose his successor. Mr Farron succeeded Nick Clegg in 2015 after the party's disastrous election result, in which it lost nearly 50 seats. Having not served in the coalition government, he positioned himself to the left of Mr Clegg and sought to rebuild the party at grassroots level. The party increased its tally of seats from nine to 12 at last week's election, but its vote share fell from 7.9% to 7.4%. Former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg lost his seat in 2017 They were hoping to make significant headway on the back of a pledge to hold a second EU referendum. Despite winning back seats in the south of England lost in 2015, and making gains in Scotland, the party's national performance was patchy. It lost its last remaining seat in Wales, Mr Clegg was defeated in Sheffield, and 375 of the party's candidates lost their deposits after getting less than 5% of the vote. Senior party figures and Church leaders praised their outgoing leader. Mr Clegg said it must have been an ""agonising"" decision for him to make. He tweeted:,external""I'm sure I was not alone in being moved by the way Tim spoke about the struggle he found in balancing his faith and his politics."" Willie Rennie, the leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said Mr Farron had been a ""dynamic and inspirational"" leader who helped the party bounce back from the ""dark days"" after the 2015 election. ""I believe he still has a big role to play in British politics,"" Mr Rennie added. But former Lib Dem official Miranda Green criticised Mr Farron for making his statement on the same day as the Grenfell Tower fire tragedy in London, in which at least 12 people have died. She said the timing showed the Lib Dem leader was ""myopic and self-obsessed"".

"Clockwise from left: David Thomas and son Stephen, Katie Taylor, Jack Slater and Nigel Hooker died in the incident The crew of a whale-watching boat tried and failed to avoid a large breaking wave that sank the vessel, killing six off the Canadian coast. Five Britons were among those who died when the the Leviathan II capsized near Tofino, British Columbia, in 2015. The Transportation Safety Board (TSB) has released a report with guidance on how to prevent such accidents. They include having tour boat operators do more to manage hazards like the breaking wave that led to the tragedy. Clinton Rebeiro, who headed the investigation, said the vessel's crew checked weather conditions before departing in October 2015 and found them ""acceptable"". Passengers were also given a safety briefing. Canada boat tragedy: The victims The submerged Leviathan II Once on the south-east side of the Plover Reefs, Leviathan II was operating in an area where the conditions were favourable for the formation of breaking waves. At about 15:00 local time (22:00 GMT) ""the master and the deckhand heard a noise. The master reached for the throttles to turn the vessel and minimise the impact but the wave struck Leviathan II's starboard quarter before his actions could be effective"", Mr Rebeiro said. ""It rose up, pivoting uncontrollably on the wave, leaving it beam on, or sideways, to the wave and thus vulnerable to capsizing."" Capsizing took only an instant. Most of the passengers were thrown into the frigid sea water, skidding down the deck and striking objects along the way. Some became trapped underneath the vessel. No one was wearing life-jackets. ""There's no doubt in this case that had the passengers been wearing life jackets or some sort of personal floatation device, it would definitely have helped many who struggled to stay afloat in the water and it might have prevented some of the fatalities,"" said TSB chair Kathy Fox. This video can not be played Amateur video shows the stricken whale-watching boat in the sea By chance, crew members found a rocket flare and fired it, catching the attention of a nearby First Nations fishing vessel. But search-and-rescue officials only became aware of the accident about 45 minutes after the vessel capsized. Many of those rescued suffered from shock, seasickness and hypothermia. Mr Rebeiro said the factors that create breaking waves are complex ""and almost impossible to predict"" and the TSB report said more than one factor caused the accident. ""We know the conditions there can be challenging even for experienced mariners, "" said Ms Fox. A Transportation Safety Board investigator examines the damaged whale watching vessel Investigators issued three recommendations: That tour vessel operators on the west coast of Vancouver Island take steps to identify when and where hazardous waves form and how to avoid them. That all commercial passenger vessels - about 4,000 nationwide - adopt explicit risk management processes, and that Transport Canada develop guidelines to better implement and oversee them. The mandatory carriage of emergency beacons so authorities are automatically alerted when vessels are in distress. Transport Canada, the federal transportation department, has 90 days to respond to the report. In 2016, two German passengers who survived the accident filed a class action lawsuit in British Columbia against the company operating the 20m (65ft) boat, Jamie's Whaling Station and Adventure Centres. The civil claim alleges the family-owned company was negligent in its operation of the vessel, and that although passengers were told where to find life jackets on the boat, they were never advised to wear them. On Wednesday, the owner of the company, Jamie Bray, said he will take the TSB recommendations seriously, and has already worked to improve safety on company vessels. That includes adding more personal flotation devices to vessels and incorporating crew recommendations into established safety drills. In a video statement, Mr Bray said: ""That day reminded all of us just how unpredictable the ocean can be, and the tragedy of October 25 will never fade from our memories"".

"Mr Corbyn and Mr Smith fought a bitter leadership battle last year Owen Smith, who challenged Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership last year, has returned to the shadow cabinet in a mini reshuffle. Mr Smith, who becomes shadow Northern Ireland secretary, is the only senior figure who quit the frontbench in 2016 to return following Labour's better-than-expected election result. John McDonnell, Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry all keep their current jobs. And campaign managers Andrew Gwynne and Ian Lavery are rewarded with new roles. Mr Lavery will now chair the Labour Party while Mr Gwynne has been named shadow communities secretary. Both remain as co-national campaign co-ordinators in anticipation of what Labour believes could be another general election within months. Election fallout: live updates In other moves, the newly elected MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, Lesley Laird, becomes shadow Scottish secretary. There had been speculation that the likes of Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn might return to the shadow cabinet but they are likely to focus on securing re-election as chairs of the influential home affairs and Brexit select committees respectively. Mr Corbyn said on Tuesday that his party should be in ""permanent campaign mode"" in light of Theresa May's attempts to form a minority government with the backing of the Democratic Unionists. ""I look forward to working with the strengthened shadow cabinet as we prepare a government in waiting to carry out our manifesto for the many not the few,"" Mr Corbyn said.

"Some of the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire Police believe at least 80 people died when fire engulfed Grenfell Tower, in North Kensington, London in the early hours of 14 June. Eighteen people have been formally identified by the coroner, but not all names have been released. Police say the final death toll may not be known until at least the end of the year, when the search and recovery operation is over. Other people, while not yet formally identified, have been confirmed as among the dead or missing by family or friends. In an attempt to identify those who might have died, police say they have spoken to at least one person from 106 of the 129 flats in the tower block. Det Ch Supt Fiona MacCormack said there remained 23 flats where ""despite huge investigative efforts, we have been unable to trace anyone"". ""We presume no-one survived,"" she said. Six-month-old Leena was found dead in her mother's arms. She died alongside her father, Omar Belkadi, and mother, Farah Hamdan, in a stairwell outside their flat on the 20th floor. Malak Belkadi, eight, died in hospital after she was recovered by firefighters in the building. The family are survived by six-year-old Tazmin who was found alive in hospital. Farah's cousin Adel Chaoui told the BBC that Farah called her sister while the fire was raging to ask for advice. ""When we told them to get out, Farah said she was told to stay put, not to go anywhere. That was the last we heard"" he said. Anthony Disson, described as the ""heart and soul"" of his family, was a 65-year-old retired lorry driver who lived on the 22nd floor of Grenfell Tower. Mr Disson, who had lived in the property for eight years, phoned his son at 03:30 and said he was being told to stay in his flat.

"Prince Charles paid tribute to his ""very special godmother"" Prince Philip's cousin, the Countess Mountbatten of Burma, has died aged 93. Patricia Mountbatten married celebrated film producer Lord Brabourne in 1946, and the pair had seven children. The couple were among a seven-strong boat party blown up by the IRA at County Sligo, Republic of Ireland, in 1979. Their son Nicholas, 14, was killed in the attack, as was Lord Brabourne's mother, Dowager Lady Brabourne, and her father Lord Mountbatten. The Countess, then known as Lady Brabourne, was badly injured but her husband survived as did Nicholas's twin, Timothy. Paul Maxwell, a 15-year-old local boy, was also killed. For more than 30 years she used her experience of her loss to help other bereaved parents, through her support of the charities Child Bereavement UK and Compassionate Friends. A spokeswoman for the family said the countess died peacefully on Tuesday at her home in Mersham, Kent, surrounded by her children. Lord Brabourne passed away 12 years ago. She was godmother to the Prince of Wales who paid tribute to her in a statement. It reads: ""I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of my very special godmother, Lady Mountbatten, whom I have known and loved ever since I can first remember. ""She played an extremely important part in my life and I shall miss her presence most dreadfully."" A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: ""The Queen and the Duke are aware and have privately passed on their condolences."" When the Countess married in 1946 the then Princess Elizabeth, her third cousin, was one of her bridesmaids. The family lived at Broadlands in Romsey, Hampshire, near Southampton, which has a hospice named after Countess Mountbatten. The arrangements for a funeral in London followed by a burial service in Mersham, are to be announced at a later date.

"This video can not be played The TV moment was one of the most talked-about of 2016 The BBC has denied claims award-winning series Planet Earth II faked a nail-biting scene showing a baby iguana being chased by racer snakes. Reports on Wednesday suggested more than one iguana was actually filmed, with scenes then stitched together. But the BBC has said only one animal was chased by the snakes - with other iguanas only filmed for close-ups. The scene quickly went viral when it was aired last year and laterwon a Baftafor must-see moment. The iguana hatchling, filmed in the Galapagos, eventually got away - much to viewers' relief. The Daily Mail claimed,externalthe episode was embroiled in a ""fakery row"" after producer Elizabeth White told the Media Production Show: ""It wasn't the same iguana, no, and often we have to augment it with other clips. ""Unfortunately lizards, snakes and iguanas aren't good at 'takes'."" But the BBC defended the Sir David Attenborough-fronted programme, with a spokeswoman saying: ""The BBC strongly refutes any suggestion that the award-winning iguana v snakes sequence was 'faked'. ""The final iguana chase in which one iguana escapes the snakes was - unusually for natural history filming - shot using two cameras, allowing us to follow both the individual iguana and the snakes' point of view. ""What was captured in the field was extraordinary animal behaviour which had never been witnessed or filmed before."" People rooted for the iguana as it tried to escape the snakes in the tense clip She added: ""As is common in natural history film-making, pick-up shots were filmed separately - for example close-ups of iguana eyes - to make the story of the sequence as clear as possible for the audience. ""This is absolutely in keeping with the norms of natural history film-making - and absolutely in line with the BBC's editorial policy guidelines, and was a true representation of animal behaviour."" Other BBC nature documentaries have previously been accused of faking footage. Frozen Planet, also fronted by Sir David, showed footage ofnewborn polar bear cubsin a den with their mother in 2011 - but it was filmed in an animal park, rather than in the wild. The BBC denied misleading viewers, with Sir David saying it would have spoiled the atmosphere to point out where the filming had taken place adding: ""It's not a falsehood and we don't keep it secret either"". And then there was the Blue Planet footageshot in a lobster tank,external- but the BBC said this was done to protect the environment.

"This video can not be played Watch as baseball gunman opens fire A gunman who sprayed bullets at Republican lawmakers during baseball practice in a Washington DC suburb has died, US President Donald Trump said. House of Representatives Majority Whip Steve Scalise was one of five injured in the early morning ambush at a park in Alexandria, Virginia. The attacker, identified as Illinois native James T Hodgkinson, 66, was killed after a firefight with police. The injured included two officers with non-life-threatening wounds. Hodgkinson was self-employed until recently and worked as a home inspector. Shooting prompts familiar accusations He had campaigned for former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. A Facebook account that appears to belong to Hodgkinson is filled with anti-Republican and anti-Trump posts. This video can not be played Bernie Sanders: 'I'm sickened by this despicable act' Mr Sanders, a Vermont senator, said he was ""sickened by this despicable act"" and condemned Hodgkinson's actions. Reaction to the attack Virginia shooting: What we know A Washington baseball tradition in peril President Trump described the attack as a ""very, very brutal assault"". ""We may have our differences, but we do well in times like these to remember that everyone who serves in our nation's capital is here because, above all, they love our country,"" he added. The president visited Mr Scalise - who was shot in the left hip and is in a critical condition after surgery - at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center on Wednesday evening, describing him as a ""patriot and a fighter"". The hospital said Mr Scalise had suffered fractured bones, internal organ injuries and severe bleeding and would require further operations. James T Hodgkinson was a resident of Bellville, Illinois, a suburb of St Louis James T Hodgkinson is a 66-year-old man from Belleville, Illinois His wife told ABC News he moved to Virginia two months ago His Facebook account shows anti-Republican and anti-Trump rhetoric He volunteered on the campaign of Bernie Sanders He had a string of criminal convictions, including traffic violations and allegations of violence What we know about James T Hodgkinson The lawmakers were practising for the annual congressional ballgame that organisers vowed would go ahead as planned on Thursday at Nationals Park, home of Major League Baseball team the Washington Nationals. Alexandria police said the FBI was taking over the investigation into the shooting, which began shortly after 07:00 (11:00 GMT) on Wednesday morning at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park. This video can not be played Congressman shot: 'He laid out there for 10 minutes alone' As well as Mr Scalise, two police officers who protect him, Krystal Griner and David Bailey, lobbyist Matt Mika and Zack Barth, a congressional aide for Texas lawmaker Roger Williams, were injured. Mr Barth, a former staffer for two Republican congressmen, was shot in the chest, according to witness Arizona Senator Jeff Flake. Mr Flake told reporters he was at bat during the shooting and the victims were ""sitting ducks"". This video can not be played Texas congressman fights back tears as he recounts shooting Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, said someone at the baseball field had used a belt as a tourniquet on Mr Scalise, who is the number three House Republican. South Carolina congressman Jeff Duncan said the suspect hadasked him whether Republicans or Democrats were practising, before shots rang out. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul told Fox News: ""I do believe without the Capitol Hill police it would have been a massacre. ""We had no defence at all. The field was basically a killing field."" He said they were lucky that Mr Scalise was present because he has a security detail owing to his congressional seniority. US lawmakers receive police protection while they are at the Capitol building, but only certain high-ranking House and Senate figures - believed to number about 10 in total - have a round-the-clock security detail wherever they are. Just a handful of top congressional leaders used to have that privilege, but it was broadened after 9/11 to include the whips,according to The Hill,external. However, other members can get protection too if, for example, threats have been made. Some of those not eligible for constant protection carry guns in their home districts if the state laws allow it, and lawmakers can also organise local police protection for their events. When Democrat representative Gabrielle Giffords was shot in January 2011 in Arizona while speaking to constituents, no police were providing security. The latest shooting has triggered a fresh debate around the issue. Mo Brooks, an Alabama Republican, told CNN he was on third base during the baseball game when he saw Mr Scalise, who was on second base, shot. He said Mr Scalise had a bullet hole in his leg, but was saying: ""I'm OK, I'm OK."" Mr Brooks said everyone on the field scattered as 50 to 100 shots were fired. This video can not be played Congress 'united' over Virginia shooting He said a gunfight had ensued between the shooter and the congressmen's police security detail, who were armed with pistols. Mr Brooks, who took refuge behind a batting cage, said the gunman was armed with a rifle and was ""blasting away"" from behind the dugout. Mr Brooks said congressmen Chuck Fleischmann, of Tennessee, Ron DeSantis, of Florida, and Jeff Duncan, of South Carolina, were among 15-25 other lawmakers at the game. Asked by a CNN host if the attack was deliberate, Mr Brooks replied: ""Well, it sure as heck wasn't an accident! This video can not be played Eyewitness: 'I cried and laid flat on the ground' ""He was going after elected officials, congressmen."" Mr Brooks continued: ""The only weapon I had was a baseball bat and that's not the kind of fight you want to engage in."" Ohio congressman Brad Wenstrup, who served in Iraq as a combat surgeon from 2005-06, provided medical care at the scene.

"This video can not be played Watch as baseball gunman opens fire A gunman who sprayed bullets at Republican lawmakers during baseball practice in a Washington DC suburb has died, US President Donald Trump said. House of Representatives Majority Whip Steve Scalise was one of five injured in the early morning ambush at a park in Alexandria, Virginia. The attacker, identified as Illinois native James T Hodgkinson, 66, was killed after a firefight with police. The injured included two officers with non-life-threatening wounds. Hodgkinson was self-employed until recently and worked as a home inspector. Shooting prompts familiar accusations He had campaigned for former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. A Facebook account that appears to belong to Hodgkinson is filled with anti-Republican and anti-Trump posts. This video can not be played Bernie Sanders: 'I'm sickened by this despicable act' Mr Sanders, a Vermont senator, said he was ""sickened by this despicable act"" and condemned Hodgkinson's actions. Reaction to the attack Virginia shooting: What we know A Washington baseball tradition in peril President Trump described the attack as a ""very, very brutal assault"". ""We may have our differences, but we do well in times like these to remember that everyone who serves in our nation's capital is here because, above all, they love our country,"" he added. The president visited Mr Scalise - who was shot in the left hip and is in a critical condition after surgery - at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center on Wednesday evening, describing him as a ""patriot and a fighter"". The hospital said Mr Scalise had suffered fractured bones, internal organ injuries and severe bleeding and would require further operations. James T Hodgkinson was a resident of Bellville, Illinois, a suburb of St Louis James T Hodgkinson is a 66-year-old man from Belleville, Illinois His wife told ABC News he moved to Virginia two months ago His Facebook account shows anti-Republican and anti-Trump rhetoric He volunteered on the campaign of Bernie Sanders He had a string of criminal convictions, including traffic violations and allegations of violence What we know about James T Hodgkinson The lawmakers were practising for the annual congressional ballgame that organisers vowed would go ahead as planned on Thursday at Nationals Park, home of Major League Baseball team the Washington Nationals. Alexandria police said the FBI was taking over the investigation into the shooting, which began shortly after 07:00 (11:00 GMT) on Wednesday morning at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park. This video can not be played Congressman shot: 'He laid out there for 10 minutes alone' As well as Mr Scalise, two police officers who protect him, Krystal Griner and David Bailey, lobbyist Matt Mika and Zack Barth, a congressional aide for Texas lawmaker Roger Williams, were injured. Mr Barth, a former staffer for two Republican congressmen, was shot in the chest, according to witness Arizona Senator Jeff Flake. Mr Flake told reporters he was at bat during the shooting and the victims were ""sitting ducks"". This video can not be played Texas congressman fights back tears as he recounts shooting Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, said someone at the baseball field had used a belt as a tourniquet on Mr Scalise, who is the number three House Republican. South Carolina congressman Jeff Duncan said the suspect hadasked him whether Republicans or Democrats were practising, before shots rang out. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul told Fox News: ""I do believe without the Capitol Hill police it would have been a massacre. ""We had no defence at all. The field was basically a killing field."" He said they were lucky that Mr Scalise was present because he has a security detail owing to his congressional seniority. US lawmakers receive police protection while they are at the Capitol building, but only certain high-ranking House and Senate figures - believed to number about 10 in total - have a round-the-clock security detail wherever they are. Just a handful of top congressional leaders used to have that privilege, but it was broadened after 9/11 to include the whips,according to The Hill,external. However, other members can get protection too if, for example, threats have been made. Some of those not eligible for constant protection carry guns in their home districts if the state laws allow it, and lawmakers can also organise local police protection for their events. When Democrat representative Gabrielle Giffords was shot in January 2011 in Arizona while speaking to constituents, no police were providing security. The latest shooting has triggered a fresh debate around the issue. Mo Brooks, an Alabama Republican, told CNN he was on third base during the baseball game when he saw Mr Scalise, who was on second base, shot. He said Mr Scalise had a bullet hole in his leg, but was saying: ""I'm OK, I'm OK."" Mr Brooks said everyone on the field scattered as 50 to 100 shots were fired. This video can not be played Congress 'united' over Virginia shooting He said a gunfight had ensued between the shooter and the congressmen's police security detail, who were armed with pistols. Mr Brooks, who took refuge behind a batting cage, said the gunman was armed with a rifle and was ""blasting away"" from behind the dugout. Mr Brooks said congressmen Chuck Fleischmann, of Tennessee, Ron DeSantis, of Florida, and Jeff Duncan, of South Carolina, were among 15-25 other lawmakers at the game. Asked by a CNN host if the attack was deliberate, Mr Brooks replied: ""Well, it sure as heck wasn't an accident! This video can not be played Eyewitness: 'I cried and laid flat on the ground' ""He was going after elected officials, congressmen."" Mr Brooks continued: ""The only weapon I had was a baseball bat and that's not the kind of fight you want to engage in."" Ohio congressman Brad Wenstrup, who served in Iraq as a combat surgeon from 2005-06, provided medical care at the scene. He said the attack had lasted for at least 10 minutes, adding: ""He had a lot of ammo.""

"Theresa May announces judge-led public inquiry into Grenfell Tower tragedy MPs now quizzing minister about response to the tragedy Queen's Speech to take place on Wednesday 21 June Tim Farron is to step down as Lib Dem leader MPs being sworn in to the House of Commons Deal between Tories and DUP delayed because of the tragedy Emma Griffiths Theresa May reshuffles her cabinet after the departures of Priti Patel and Sir Michael Fallon. What is the difference between a free trade area, a single market and a customs union? Theresa May has done a deal with the DUP which means she stays as UK prime minister. Here's a guide to what's going on. Empty properties owned by the rich should be used for the homeless of Grenfell Tower, Labour's leader says. The prime minister has released a statement after meeting Northern Ireland's main parties saying agreement can be reached to restore a power-sharing executive at Stormont ""if there is good will on all sides"". ""But time is running short and the parties must come together by the 29 June for the return of a strong voice at Stormont and for a brighter future for everyone in Northern Ireland."" She said Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire would keep talking to the parties ""and if no resolution is reached then we will need to consider what steps we need to take, to ensure Northern Ireland has the political stability it needs"".

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the Grenfell Tower disaster was an emergency of such gravity that it had already become a significant issue for the government, at a very volatile time. The priority was to focus on getting help to where it was needed - with the announcement that a scheme to provide extra cash for the council - before getting on with a full public inquiry, which would get going ""pretty soon"". But the handling of such an awful situation was very risky for politicians and uncomfortable truths could emerge from the public inquiry. ""Potentially, some people expect, it may well show that not just this government but previous governments have simply not done enough to make sure this kind of housing is safe,"" she said.     The Grenfell Tower block disaster has again been dominating the news agenda. Here's a round-up of the latest developments on this and other political stories today: The Lib Dems have warned the Conservatives they ""cannot go from weak and wobbly to business as usual"" after the government announced formal Brexit negotiations will begin on Monday. Lib Dem MP Alistair

Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams says his party will oppose any pact between the UK government and the DUP ""that undermines the Good Friday Agreement"". He said all parties in Northern Ireland ""need to be consulted on all of this"". ""A little side bargain to keep Theresa May in power - a temporary little arrangement - won't have any integrity and certainly isn't as important as the needs of the people who live in Ireland and particularly in the north of Ireland,"" he said. Simon Coveney is the new Irish minister for foreign affairs, with special responsibility for Brexit. Mark DevenportBBC News NI Political Editor The DUP Deputy Leader Nigel
Dodds says the setting of a date for the Queen's Speech is separate and not
relevant to his party's discussions over a deal with the Conservatives. Questioned about whether a deal
would be announced before the Queen's speech next Wednesday, Mr Dodds said
there's no deadline for the discussions. Mr Dodds reiterated that the DUP
wants to strengthen the UK, deliver Brexit in a proper and sensible manner for
Northern Ireland and spread prosperity around the UK. Asked if the Treasury was ""nitpicking"" over the
financial details, Mr Dodds said he'd seen the reports in the newspapers but
wouldn't comment on speculation. More on the Brexit talks. Formal negotiationswill begin on Monday, the UK and EU say. The announcement by Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU negotiator Michel Barnier follows preliminary talks in Brussels between officials. The formal negotiations were already due to start on Monday but doubt was cast by the general election result and ongoing talks between the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionists. The UK is due to leave by the end of March 2019. Labour MP Harriet Harman has been speaking to the BBC after the Westminster Hall session earlier. The former party deputy leader is an MP in the London borough of Southwark, where the 2009 Lakanal House fire killed six people. She said tower blocks needed to be fitted with sprinklers and questions needed to be asked about whether refurbishing blocks could compromise fire safety - and whether the official ""stay put"" advice for people in burning buildings should be changed. Of the public inquiry, she said: There doesn't have to be a delay. It's wrong if there is a delay because people are living in thousands of tower blocks all around the country and they need to know the lessons are going to be learned quickly.""  She also said it was up to opposition parties to make sure the government ""doesn't slip off the hook"" in terms of providing resources to make sure buildings are safe. BBC political editor tweets...

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn calls for details of Tory-DUP deal Jeremy Corbyn is demanding details of the deal the Tories are striking with the DUP to form a minority government, calling it a ""nonsense situation"". The Labour leader also called for a date for the Queen's Speech, saying it ""was the very least we need to know"". He said Labour was ""united"" and ""ready"" to form an alternative government. DUP sources have told the BBC an announcement on a deal with the Conservatives has been delayed because of the Grenfell Tower blaze. They said the two parties were now finalising the ""terms and conditions"" of an agreement after Mrs May and DUP leader Arlene Foster met on Tuesday. But they added that the London tower block fire made an announcement on Wednesday ""inappropriate"" and diary commitments meant a final deal could be delayed until next week. Election Live - rolling text and video updates Quick guide to what's going on Who are the DUP's 10 MPs? If a deal was to be delayed it would mean the Queen's Speech, which had originally been planned for next Monday, could be delayed by at least a week. It could also delay the start of Brexit talks. The Conservatives are having to rely on the support of 10 DUP MPs after they fell eight seats short of winning an overall majority at the general election. It means that Mrs May will remain as prime minister and the DUP MPs will be central to the survival of a Conservative Party administration. Mrs May is to meet the leaders of Northern Ireland's other main political parties on Thursday in a bid to allay fears a deal with the Democratic Unionists will undermine the peace process. Arlene Foster and Theresa May have been holding talks Sinn Fein, the SDLP and Alliance have all said Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire cannot chair the ongoing process to restore power-sharing at Stormont due to their perception he has a conflict of interest. Sinn Fein's Stormont leader Michelle O'Neill said: ""I will be making it very clear that any deal between the Tories and the DUP cannot be allowed to undermine the Good Friday and subsequent agreements."" In addition to Sinn Fein, whose seven MPs will not take up their seats at Westminster, Mrs May will meet representatives from three Northern Irish parties who did not win any seats at the general election - the Ulster Unionists, the SDLP and Alliance Party -  in separate meetings at Downing Street. Labour has joined former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major in expressing concern that deal with the DUP will undermined the ""rigorous impartiality"" the UK government is meant to demonstrate under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. Mr Corbyn is also calling on the government to end the ""nonsense situation"" of the public not knowing what kind of deal was on the table. He said: ""We want to know what is in the deal they are offering to the DUP and we want to know when it is going to be put before Parliament. We still haven't been given a date for the Queen's Speech."" He said Parliament ""could not function until it is formally opened and I think the very least we need to know is when that is going to happen"". He added that Labour was ""ready as a strong, united party with a clear programme of what we want to offer to the British people to improve their lives and end this miserable period of austerity"". Arlene Foster and the 10 MPs Theresa May hopes will keep them in power The DUP have been playing their cards close to their chest, but we know the areas they're talking about because of a DUPplan drawn up in 2015 in anticipation of a hung Parliament,external. Things have moved on a bit since then with Brexit, but we do know they're looking at trying to lower the cost to the Northern Ireland executive of any move on corporation tax. They've been of the view that leaving the EU should lessen some of the stipulations in relation to state aid that were being applied by the Treasury to Northern Ireland, and that might take down the bill that the Treasury would put on the executive if corporation tax was lowered. We know other matters, such as cutting air passenger duty and increased infrastructure spending, have been discussed, but we haven't got any sense of the exact details of the deal. I suspect it will be top loaded with economic rather than political matters. Some political issues, such as altering the definition of a Troubles victim or doing away with allowances for MPs who don't take up their seats, might be included. Other legacy matters, such as protecting former soldiers or police officers from prosecution, may feature at a later stage. The DUP will offer support for key votes, such as backing the Queen's Speech and the Budget and opposing any votes of no confidence. The DUP campaigned for Brexit but is also conscious that 56% of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU. They are thought to be advocating a Brexit that does not disrupt the ""frictionless border"" with the Republic of Ireland. They are also opposed to Conservative polices such as means-testing the winter fuel allowance and have campaigned for a higher National Living Wage and to restore the spare room subsidy. Prime Minister Theresa May said on Tuesday that talks with the DUP had been productive and that Brexit negotiations would begin as planned next week. ""I think there is a unity of purpose among people in the United Kingdom,"" Mrs May said, following a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris. On Tuesday, ex-Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major said he was ""dubious"" about the idea of a deal and its potential impact on the peace process. This video can not be played I am ""concerned"" about a deal with the DUP, says former prime minister Sir John Major Sir John told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme there was a danger the government would no longer be seen as an ""impartial honest broker"" in restoring the power-sharing arrangements and upholding Northern Ireland institutions. Asked about Sir John's comments, Mrs May said she was ""absolutely steadfast"" in her support for the 1998 Good Friday agreement - which created the Northern Ireland Assembly - and efforts to revive the power-sharing executive.

"The US Federal Reserve has raised its key interest rate by 0.25%, the second increase this year. The central bank voted to raise its key rate target to a range of 1% to 1.25%. That's the highest level since 2008, when policymakers cut rates to encourage borrowing and spending after the financial crisis. The bank also said it would begin cutting its bond holdings and other securities this year. It cited continued US economic growth and job market strength as reasons for raising its benchmark interest rate. ""Our decision ... reflects the progress the economy has made and is expected to make,"" said Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. The rise was widely anticipated after a low unemployment rate, but other economic indicators, including inflation, have been weaker. Data on Wednesday showed US consumer prices unexpectedly fell in May and retail sales recorded their biggest drop in 16 months. This has raised questions about the bank's future course. US stock markets the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq edged down at the close. But the rate increase was already priced into most stocks. Analysis: BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker Should the Fed have done it? The case against is inflation. The Fed's statement noted that price rises have slowed recently. Inflation is below the target of 2%. But then Fed Chair Janet Yellen thinks a large part of that is down to falls in specific prices. She mentioned cell-phone plans and prescription drug prices. Over time their impact will drop out, and she and the committee expect inflation to get to the target in time. The rate rise continues the Fed's slow return to normality after the financial crisis. The journey is not over. The Fed's policy makers think about 3% is the new normal. There's also the legacy of quantitative easing and the $4.2trn portfolio of financial assets. Really normal will mean running that down - though perhaps not to pre-crisis levels. It will take a long time and it hasn't begun yet, but the Fed does expect to make a start later this year. Federal Reserve policymakers have been grappling with when and how to alter the policies put in place after the 2008 financial crisis to boost economic activity. At the time, they slashed interest rates and bought up US treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to keep rates low. The Fed has a $4.2trn portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, most of which were purchased in the wake of the financial crisis and recession. In 2014 the bank stopped its bond purchase program, known as quantitative easing, but it has continued to reinvest the assets on its books. On Wednesday, policymakers said they aim to reduce that balance sheet, by reinvesting payments from those securities only above certain caps, totalling $10bn. The cap would escalate in three month intervals. It would start implementing those policies this year, assuming economic growth continues. Ms Yellen said she's not sure how far the committee will want to reduce the holdings over the long run, but she said they would be levels ""appreciably below"" those seen in recent years though larger than before the financial crisis. The Fed raised interest rates for the first time since the crisis in December 2015. Policymakers acted in December 2016 and again in March. Wednesday's decision was made with an 8-1 vote, with Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, dissenting. Mr Kashkari also voted against the March rise. Interest rates remain low by historic standards. The board expects to raise rates at least three times this year. The moves depend on the strength of the economy, which has been mixed. On Wednesday, the US Labor Department reported that prices for goods excluding food and energy increased by 1.7% from May 2016, slowing steadily from earlier in the year. That fell short of the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. Ms Yellen said the bank is aware of the shortfall and it was ""essential"" to move back to the target. But she said this year's data may be skewed by one-off factors, such as lower prices on cell phone plans. ""It's important not to overreact to a few readings,"" Ms Yellen said. ""Data on inflation can be noisy."" For US consumers, interest rate increases tend to lead to increased borrowing costs. Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com, said the cumulative effect of recent rate increases on consumers is ""mounting"". ""The combination of rising debt burdens and rising interest rates is straining some households, with delinquencies picking up from recent lows,"" he said. In broader terms, the economic impact includes a stronger dollar and higher bank profits.

"After the horrendous fire that swept Grenfell Tower in west London, it has emerged that notices in the block instructed people to ""stay put"". Why is that advice given? Fire action notices in the tower advised that unless the fire was in or affecting their flat, they should remain in their homes. Guidance issued to tenants in a newsletter said: ""Our longstanding 'stay put policy' stays in force unless you are told otherwise. This means that (unless there is a fire in your flat or in the hallway outside your flat) you should stay inside your flat."" This is fairly standard advice for people living in purpose-built blocks of flats. Fire action sign displayed in a block near Grenfell Tower and also run by KCTMO In their general advice, the London Fire Brigade says if a fire breaks out in a block of flats, people living in the block - whose flats are not affected by the smoke or fire - are ""usually safer"" staying in their homes. Elfyn Edwards, a fire safety expert and former firefighter, says the stay put policy is designed to stop residents in flats unaffected by fire from unnecessarily evacuating the building and blocking the stairways. The key factor is how a fire spreads. The principles of fire safety in the UK are based on a fire being able to be contained. Usually the way tower blocks are designed means a fire breaking out in one flat should not spread throughout the rest of a building. Each flat is designed to be separate and able to contain a fire. Latest updates as fire rips through tower block London tower block fire: In pictures What we know so far Residents raised fire risk fears But, Mr Edwards said, the Grenfell Tower blaze - because of the speed at which the fire had engulfed the block - was unprecedented. Geoff Wilkinson, a fire and building inspector, told the BBC that one of his ""major concerns"" would be that smoke seems to have spread into escape routes. He also said the system of fire alarms in tower blocks was not exactly as might be assumed. ""The way these buildings work isn't for everyone to escape. With a single staircase, the intention is that the fire is contained within the individual apartment. ""So you don't have to have everyone escaping all at one point. What will happen is the fire service will arrive, they'll take command of it, and they will make a decision as to which floors should evacuate."" Fire safety expert Graham Fieldhouse said a ""stay put policy"" did not mean residents must remain in all situations. ""There are questions about the stay put policy and people's understanding of the policy,"" he said. ""If you're affected by fire or smoke, get out."" As an example, guidance issued by Harlow council, in Essex, says: ""If you are in doubt - get out."" 2009: Fire damage at Lakanal House, south London The Local Government Association, which represents councils, reiterates that message in its 2012 guidance, which says a stay put policy does not imply those who wish to leave a building should be prevented from doing so if they feel ""threatened"". One resident of Grenfell Tower, Michael Paramasivan, said that he had been told in the case of fire he must stay in his flat - advice he ignored. ""If we had stayed in that flat, we would have perished,"" he said. This is not the first time the advice to stay put has been called into question. In 2009, six people died after a fire broke out in Lakanal House, a tower block in Camberwell, south-east London. But, in a report following the 2009 tragedy, the chief fire and rescue adviser, Sir Ken Knight, said the spread of that fire had been unusual. He said a full understanding of how it had spread was needed to make sure the ""stay put"" principle was still sound. Along with many others, that question may now be asked again.

"Labour politicians are calling for answers from the government over the deadly fire that has ripped through a West London tower block. Twelve people have died in the Grenfell Tower blaze, with the Met Police saying that figure was ""likely to rise"". The prime minister said she was ""deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life"". Jeremy Corbyn said it was ""everyone's worst nightmare"" and praised the emergency services but added that questions needed to be answered. A review of building regulations covering fire safety was promised by Prime Minister Theresa May's chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, last year, when he was a government minister, but has not been published. Latest updates on tower block fire Tower residents raised fire risk fears Council fined over flats fire deaths The Labour leader told the BBC: ""At this stage, let's save life, let's bring safety to people at Grenfell Tower. ""I think tomorrow is a day for searching questions - the searching questions on the provision of fire safety equipment, the provision of sprinklers and the support the emergency services need and must have in all circumstances. ""You can never compromise on safety where fire is concerned."" The questions ""may well be difficult"" for the government, he added, saying: ""The reports that were made in the past have to be acted on."" There have been reports that cladding - added in a recent refurbishment - may have helped the fire spread externally. Checks are to be carried out on tower blocks going through similar refurbishment to Grenfell Tower, policing and fire minister Nick Hurd has said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said questions needed to be answered about the safety of tower blocks after some residents said they had been advised they should stay in their flats in the event of a fire. A local residents' association had previously warned it was worried about the risk of a serious fire in the block. ""What we can't have is a situation where people's safety is put at risk because of bad advice being given or if it is the case, as has been alleged, of tower blocks not being properly serviced or maintained,"" said the mayor. The government is not able to make a Commons statement on the tragedy as Parliament is not sitting following the general election. But Commons Speaker John Bercow has said MPs will be allowed to question a minister on the subject on Thursday at a special meeting in the Palace of Westminster. Labour MP Harriet Harman said she feared lessons had not been learned from a similar fire six years ago at the Lakanal House tower block in her Camberwell and Peckham constituency, which claimed six lives. She told BBC Radio 4's the World At One programme: ""Councils want to fit sprinklers in their tower blocks, but it comes down to money. ""The government has been cutting the money to councils. If you cut money to councils, you can't put in sprinklers."" Former chief fire officer Ronnie King, honorary secretary of the all-party parliamentary group on fire safety and rescue, said fire regulations ""badly need updating"" and ""three successive ministers have not done it"". He suggested a government drive to cut red tape - by insisting that three regulations are removed for every new one created - should be reconsidered ""where fire safety is concerned"". The all-party parliamentary group had recommended fitting sprinklers to buildings to save lives. Six died in a 2009 fire at Lakanal House in Camberwell Judge Frances Kirkham, who presided over the inquest into the Lakanal House fire deaths, recommended the government should ""encourage providers of housing in high-rise residential buildings"" to ""consider the retrofitting of sprinkler systems"". Kensington and Chelsea council, which owns the block, said it was focusing on supporting the rescue and relief operation but the causes of the fire would be fully investigated. Cabinet minister David Gauke said: ""I think it is far too early to jump to any conclusions. ""But of course we are going to need to look very closely at precisely what has happened to see whether there are measures to ensure that nothing like this should happen again. ""But today I think our focus has to be on providing support to those who have been injured.""

"This video can not be played The assault was caught on CCTV A kebab shop owner has been jailed for two years for flinging a pan of boiling water over a chef. Djamel Benrejdal told Chouaib Boussera he was incapable of boiling an egg and then grabbed the pan and threw its contents at his employee. Mr Boussera, 30, was refused time off to get treatment by his ranting boss, even though his arm was badly scalded. Benrejdal's attack on his employee at the fast food outlet in Scarborough was caught on CCTV. The chef howled in agony as he was ""enveloped in a cloud of steam"" and his boss stormed out, York Crown Court heard. Benrejdal, 49, later applied a makeshift poultice of takeaway leftovers to Mr Boussera's wounded arm but he refused permission for him to go to hospital, forcing Mr Boussera to work with his arm in a sling. The scarring suffered by Chouaib Boussera was was described by the judge as ""awful"" and ""long-lasting"" Benrejdal, from Scalby, near Scarborough, had told his employee to boil an egg, but spotted a crack on the shell as it simmered. CCTV footage of the attack, at the Eat Mediterranean kebab and pizza shop, shows Benrejdal waving his arms about before hurling the pan at Mr Boussera, who screamed in pain. Andrew Espley, prosecuting, said Benrejdal applied yoghurt, onions and honey to his victim's ""appalling"" injuries in a ""derisory attempt"" to treat the injury. Chouaib Boussera has since given up the takeaway business He refused to take the chef to Scarborough Hospital until the next day and tampered with the takeaway's CCTV to hide evidence of the attack, after the chef went to the police. Mr Espley said at the time of the attack, on 22 March 2016, Benrejdal had been on bail for assaulting his wife. He was charged with inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and pleaded not guilty at a trial held last month. The jury found Benrejdal guilty of an alternative count of inflicting grievous bodily harm without intent, having failed to reach a verdict on the principal charge. In mitigation Stephen Grattage said his client had been suffering ""stresses and pressures"" from the business. Judge Andrew Stubbs QC said Benrejdal had deliberately used the boiling water as a weapon, causing ""awful, long-lasting"" scarring.

"GrÃ©gory Villemin was found drowned in a river a few kilometres from his home A couple in their 70s and a woman have been detained for questioning by police, 32 years after a crime that horrified France. GrÃ©gory Villemin was four when his body was found in the Vologne river. His killer has never been found. All three held by police were described as relatives of the boy's father. The murder has continued to haunt France ever since, but advances in DNA technology have helped police shed further light on the case. It was on 16 October 1984 that GrÃ©gory Villemin's body was found and a magistrate opened what became one of the biggest mysteries in French criminal history. Hours before the boy was discovered, his hands and feet tied, his uncle said he had received a phone call from someone claiming to have kidnapped him. The following day, the child's parents received a letter that said: ""Your son is dead, I have been avenged."" Christine Villemin (third from left) was for years wrongly blamed for the murder The next month, a cousin of the boy's father, Bernard Laroche, was arrested when his sister-in-law, Muriel Bolle, testified against him. He was released in 1985 when she retracted her statement, but shot dead by Jean-Marie Villemin, the boy's father, weeks later. The father went to jail for Laroche's murder for several years. The boy's mother, Christine Villemin, was also jailed for her son's murder but later cleared. Both were later given compensation by the state for miscarriage of justice. The anonymous phone-calls and poison-pen letters continued over the years, and the case was reopened first in 2000 and then again in 2008 in an attempt to identify the DNA on the letters. Three separate traces of DNA were found but not identified. Both of the boy's parents spent years in jail and later received compensation for a miscarriage of justice Little news has been heard in the ""GrÃ©gory affair"" since police said in 2013 that DNA tests had brought the investigation no further. That was until about 08:00 (06:00 GMT) on Wednesday, when investigators from Dijon detained a couple in their 70s in the village of Aumontzey, in the Vologne river valley. Sources told French media that they were the father's uncle and aunt. They were placed in police custody on suspicion of complicity in the murder, failing to report a crime or helping a person at risk,according to L'Est RÃ©publicain website,external. A third person reported to be the father's half-sister was also being held. A fourth, said to be the victim's grandmother, was taken in as a witness. Her husband was also questioned. Prosecutor Jean-Jacques Bosc said investigators had targeted ""people very close to the heart of this case"" and hoped to provide answers to the questions they had. Local reporters covering the case pointed out that none of those held on Wednesday was suspected of the boy's murder. They also said that Muriel Bolle, who as a teenager had initially blamed the killing on Bernard Laroche, had been asked to provide a DNA sample on Wednesday before later being released.

"This video can not be played One eyewitness said he saw people blinking lights within the building At least six people have died after a huge fire raged through the night at a west London 24-storey tower block, and police expect that number to rise. Eyewitnesses described people trapped in the burning Grenfell Tower, in north Kensington, screaming for help and yelling for their children to be saved. Firefighters, who rescued many people, were called at 00:54 BST and are still trying to put out the fire. Police say there may still be people in the building who are unaccounted for. The ambulance service said 68 patients had been taken to six hospitals across London, with 18 in critical care. A further 10 patients made their own way to hospital. During the night, eyewitnesses said they saw lights - thought to be mobile phones or torches - flashing at the top of the block of flats, and trapped residents coming to their windows - some holding children. It is understood that ""several hundred"" people would have been in the block when the fire broke out shortly after midnight, most of them sleeping. This video can not be played Mickey, a resident of Grenfell Tower: 'It was like a horror movie' Commander Stuart Cundy, of the Metropolitan Police, said the recovery operation would be ""complex and lengthy"", and the number of fatalities was expected to rise. He declined to give any details of the number of people who may be missing. He said it was likely to be some time before police could identify the victims, adding that it was too early to speculate on the cause of the fire. An emergency number - 0800 0961 233 - has been set up for anyone concerned about friends or family. At 13:00 BST, Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton said firefighters expected to be on the scene for at least another 24 hours. She said there were concerns that people were still inside the tower and she urged all residents to make sure they had reported themselves to police so that the authorities know they are safe. Prime Minister Theresa May is ""deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life"", said Downing Street. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt praised the ""heroic"" response from the emergency services and the NHS hospital staff ""working tirelessly to help"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to demand a government statement in Parliament on Thursday on the tragedy, the BBC understands. There must be a ""full inquiry"" into the fire, newly-elected Kensington MP Emma Dent Coad told the BBC. Speaking outside the Rugby Portobello Trust emergency centre, the Labour MP said the fire was ""absolutely appalling"". ""The ferocity of that fire was extraordinary and terrifying,"" she said. ""This must never happen again."" Police and fire minister Nick Hurd was due to chair a cross-party meeting to look at how the government can assist the emergency services and local authorities. This video can not be played David Benjamin says he was woken by a neighbour banging on the door Paul Munakr, who lives on the seventh floor, managed to escape. ""As I was going down the stairs, there were firefighters, truly amazing firefighters that were actually going upstairs, to the fire, trying to get as many people out the building as possible,"" he told the BBC. He said he was alerted to the fire not by fire alarms but by people on the street below, shouting ""don't jump, don't jump"". Eyewitness Jody Martin said: ""I watched one person falling out, I watched another woman holding her baby out the window... hearing screams. ""I was yelling at everyone to get down and they were saying 'We can't leave our apartments, the smoke is too bad on the corridors.'"" What we know so far Baby caught after being 'dropped to safety from tower' Latest updates as crews work on building Pictures from the scene Residents raised fire risk fears Michael Paramasivan, who lives on the seventh floor with his girlfriend and young daughter, said he ignored official advice to stay in your home. ""If we had stayed in that flat, we would've perished.  My gut instinct told me just to get the girls out. I wrapped the little one up because of the smoke and I just got them out."" Another resident, Zoe, who lives on the fourth floor, said she was woken by a neighbour banging on her door. ""The whole landing was thick with smoke. The smoke alarms weren't going off but the way it spread so quickly from the fourth floor, all the way up to the 23rd floor was scary."" Mirna, Fatima and Zainnb are among those missing By Lucy Manning, BBC News They have lost their homes and for some, tragically their relatives. At times there is the sound of sobbing as the word goes round that someone is missing, someone is feared dead. I've spent the day inside the community centre where survivors have gathered. Downstairs in the hall families sit at tables and wait for news. One family told me they hadn't heard from their brother, sister and three children - Mirna, Fatima and Zainnb. Other relatives were out searching hospitals. There was still no news. Outside the centre, Sawsan was with a group of women. For one it was too much, she was on the floor crying. Sawsan hasn't heard from her mum, sister, brother-in-law and nieces. She spoke to them when the fire started but nothing since. Inside the centre, families are being helped with food, housing and medical treatment. It's busy and everyone is helping. Just not with the one thing they need - information about whether their relatives are safe. Christabel told me how lucky her father had been. He tried to fight the fire but made it out alive. Ed was saved when a friend called him to tell him to get out the building. ""I'm lucky"" he says. But they have lost everything. Grenfell Tower, built in 1974, is part of the Lancaster West Estate, a sprawling inner-city social housing complex of almost 1,000 homes. Robert Black, chief executive of the tower's management company, the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, said: ""The fire at Grenfell Tower is devastating and the reports of injury and losses of life absolutely heartbreaking. ""Along with my colleagues, I have been supporting residents since the early hours, working with the emergency services and the community."" The BBC's Andy Moore, who was at the scene through the night, described watching debris falling from the building, and hearing explosions and breaking glass. London fire crews said it was a ""large and very serious incident"" There are 120 flats in the residential block The London Fire Brigade said a structural engineer had checked the building and determined it was not in danger of collapse and that rescue teams were safe to be inside. Initially, it was feared that the building, which appears to be gutted, could collapse. Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was devastated by the horrific scenes, attended by more than 250 firefighters and 100 ambulance medics. Questions will need to be answered over the safety of tower blocks, he told BBC Radio. ""We can't have a situation where people's safety is put at risk because of bad advice being given or if it is the case, as has been alleged, of tower blocks not being properly serviced or maintained,"" he said. Matt Wrack, of the Fire Brigades Union said something had clearly gone badly wrong with fire prevention procedures at the building. Firefighters would normally fight a fire in a tower block from the inside, going up the fire escape, and fighting using the internal dry-rising mains, he said, but that's not been possible in this case. Construction firm Rydon said recent building work which it carried out on the block ""met all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards"". Refurbishment work completed in 2016 included more residential areas in the four lower 'podium' levels Appeals are being made on social media for news of missing friends and relatives, who might have been caught in the blaze. Emergency rest centres have opened for those now homeless at Latymer Community Centre, St Clement's Church, Harrow Club and Rugby Portobello Trust. There are also local collections under way for spare clothes, toys, blankets and toiletries. People are being advised by police to stay away from the area, where roads remain closed and nearby residents have been evacuated as a precaution. The London Fire Brigade said a structural engineer had checked the building More than 70 people have received treatment in hospital Smoke could be seen from miles away Grenfell Tower underwent a two-year Â£10m refurbishment as part of a wider transformation of the estate, that was completed last year. Work included new exterior cladding and a communal heating system. The 24-storey tower, containing about 120 flats, is managed by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO) on behalf of the council. Before and during the refurbishment, the localGrenfell Action Group,externalclaimed that the block constituted a fire risk and residents warned that site access for emergency vehicles was ""severely restricted"". Construction firm Rydon, which carried out the refurbishment, said it was ""shocked to hear of the devastating fire"" and added that the work ""met all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards"". Council leader Nick Paget-Brown said the buildings were regularly inspected, but a ""thorough investigation"" was needed. Read more onsafety concerns here.

"A series of attacks in Europe over the summer months has raised the number of people killed in the West by jihadists during the past three years to more than 420, writes Dr Lorenzo Vidino. The deaths of 16 people in Barcelona and Cambrils earlier this month highlighted the continued threat posed by Islamist militants. The summer months have also seen new attacks inBelgium,France,Austria,external,Germanyandthe UK, as well as the first inFinlandand one inthe US. Although the vastmajority of Islamist attacks are elsewhere in the world, an unprecedented number have taken place in Europe and North America since thedeclaration of a ""caliphate"" by the so-called Islamic State, in June 2014. Thefirst look at the data behind the attacks,external- everything from the age of the perpetrators, to immigration status - offers an insight into those responsible and how they might be tackled. We identified 63 attacks between September 2014 and late August 2017 that we considered to be acts of jihadist terrorism. A relatively limited number of countries were affected: nine in Europe - those named above, plusDenmarkandSweden- along with the US and Canada. Flowers and a flag left near the Orlando nightclub where an Islamist gunman killed 49 people in June 2016 Regardless of country, most attacks were in large towns and cities - including Barcelona, London, Manchester, Paris, Nice, Berlin, Brussels, Stockholm and Orlando. A few attacks hit iconic targets, such as theChamps-Elyseesand theLouvre museumin Paris,Westminster in LondonandLas Ramblas in Barcelona. Many others targeted crowded spaces such as busy pedestrian areas, entertainment venues or transport hubs. But some terrorist attacks have hit more unusual places, including anoffice Christmas partyand aservice at a church. We looked at attacks motivated by jihadist ideology, that involved deliberate acts of violence against other people and were intended to intimidate or convey a message to a larger group. Other organisations use different definitions. Researchers used open-source material and interviews with officials It is possible that some attacks did not come to our attention, or that full details are not available The research covers the US, Canada and the 28 member states of the EU, plus Norway and Switzerland Attacks motivated by other ideologies - such asthe murder of Jo Cox- are not included in this study In total, the 63 attacks caused 424 deaths and left almost 1,800 people injured. The perpetrators are not included in these figures. TheParis attack of November 2015was the deadliest, with 130 people killed, including90 at the Bataclan theatre. France also saw theNice lorry attack, which left 86 people dead. 14 July 2016: A lorry ploughed into a crowd in the French Riviera town of Nice There were many other attacks that left many people dead and others injured. InOrlando, 49 people were killedin an attack on a gay nightclub Bombings atBrussels airport and at a metro stationleft 32 people dead 14 people were killed at aChristmas party in San Bernardino, California 12 people died when a lorry was driven into a crowdedChristmas market in Berlin 12 people died when the Paris offices ofCharlie Hebdowere attacked in January 2015 Five people were killed in theWestminster attackin April TheManchester Arena bombingin May led to 22 deaths TheLondon Bridge attackin June left eight people dead The attacks inBarcelona and Cambrilsleft 16 people dead In total, these 11 attacks were responsible for 386 deaths. However, most of the attacks did not cause casualties, with the exclusion of the perpetrators. Although thenumber of young people being radicalised has caused concern, the average age of the attackers - 27.5 - is not unusually young. The two youngest were 15 - an unnamed boywho attacked a Jewish teacher with a machetein Marseille, and Safia S,a girl who stabbed a police officerat a Hannover train station. Of the five who were under the age of 18 at the time, four were in Germany. The vast majority of the attackers were in their 20s, with about one in four attackers above the age of 30 and six aged 40 or older. The oldest suspect, Mohamed H Khalid, was 54 when he was accused of stabbing to death anelderly couple in the Austrian city of Linz,external. In the UK,Khalid Masood, was 52 when he drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and stabbed to death a police officer at the Houses of Parliament. Despitewomen becoming increasingly active in jihadist networks, only two out of 85 individual perpetrators were female. Fewer than one in five perpetrators was a convert to Islam, with a significantly higher percentage in North America than in Europe. However, the converts were significantly more likely to have a criminal background and to have served time in prison. Overall, half of the attackers had a prior criminal background. How can police stop terror suspects travelling? Is terror more of a threat to Europe than before? Terror deaths in Western Europe at highest level since 2004 Can you monitor every suspect? The relationship between terrorism and migration is a complex one and has been at the centre of extremely polarising debates, particularly during theEuropean migrant crisis. However, the number of attackers who were illegally in a country or who arrived as refugees is small. Two-thirds were citizens of the country they attacked, with others either legal residents, or legal visitors from neighbouring countries. However, individuals who were in the West illegally also carried out deadly attacks. November 2015: Tributes left in Paris following attacks that left 130 people dead At least two of those involved in the November 2015 Paris attacks arethought to have posed as refugeesto enter Europe through Greece. Three other individuals were refugees or asylum seekers at the time of attack, while seven were in the country illegally or awaiting deportation. The latter group includes Uzbek nationalRakhmat Akilov, who killed four people with a hijacked lorry in Stockholm in April 2017, and Tunisian citizenAnis Amri, who also used a lorry to commit his attack at the Berlin Christmas market. Wreckage from an attack on a Berlin Christmas market, December 2016 There is also one case of ""terrorist tourism"", involving Egyptian citizenAbdullah Hamamy, who lived in the United Arab Emirates and attacked soldiers at the Louvre in February 2017. Two of the four most lethal attacks - those in Paris in November 2015 and in Brussels in 2016 - are believed to bewell orchestrated multiple attacks directed by IS,external. 22 March 2016: A security guard helps a wounded woman after the attack on the Brussels metro system They were also executed in part by former foreign fighters. However, the two other most deadly attacks - those in Orlando in June 2016 and in Nice in July 2016 - were carried out independently by individuals without operational connection to a jihadist group. These episodes demonstrate that terrorist sympathisers who never travelled to conflict areas and who act independently can be as dangerous as a team of highly trained militants. Overall, links between attackers and jihadist groups operating overseas are not always easy to determine. Of the attacks that have hit the West since June 2014, fewer than one in 10 was carried out under direct orders from the leadership of IS. In some cases it can be difficult to tell, for example IS said it was behind both the Las Ramblas and Cambrils attacks, but it did not provide any evidence. Nevertheless, the influence of IS can be clearly seen. During or before the attack, six out of 10 perpetrators pledged allegiance to a jihadist group, almost always IS - which frequently claims responsibility. Unsurprisingly, given the frequency of attacks and the number of deaths and injuries, jihadist terrorism has come to the fore of political debates in the West and receives widespread news coverage. The threat is not expected to wane in the near future, with policymakers, counter-terrorism officials and the public all being asked to take action. 22 March 2017: Westminster Bridge following a terror attack There are huge implications for domestic and foreign policy throughout Western countries. It is hoped that knowing more about the attacks and the people who carried them out will help us all have a more informed debate about what action is needed.

"Michael Menafee (centre) meets the whole Slade family Statistically speaking, they were an unlikely pair. But after Michael Menafee donated his marrow to baby Jaxson Slade, the two became bonded by more than blood and bone. When Menafee landed at the St John's airport on the Canadian island of Newfoundland in April, he didn't know what to expect. The 32-year-old Chicago native had travelled almost 4,000km (2,485 miles) to spend Easter with a family he had never met. But while he was greeted at the airport by strangers, he quickly realised he was already part of the Slade family. ""It was like we knew each other for years... that's how comfortable I felt,"" he told the BBC from his home in Guatemala, where he is working in the US Peace Corps. Three years ago, Menafee donated some of his bone marrow to Jaxson Slade, who was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia when he was just 13 months old. Although the donation procedure can be painful, Menafee said it was ""doable"", and he was fully recovered in about two weeks. He donated at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, DC, and Jaxson was given the transplant at Sick Kids Hospital in Toronto. The two didn't even know each other's names. Michael Menafee (left) with Jaxson Slade, after meeting for the first time. It wasn't until Jaxson's mother Melissa Slade asked the donor programmeDKMS,externalfor his contact info in 2016 that Menafee even knew Jaxson had survived. According to donor rules, participants must wait two years before their identities are revealed, and only if the donor agrees. Thanking the man who gave Jaxson life was as much a part of the healing process as the transplant itself, Slade says. ""I gave birth to him, but I really couldn't give him life. It was Michael who gave him the gift of life,"" she says. ""How do you even begin to thank someone for that?"" When Jaxson was diagnosed in the autumn of 2013, doctors said the only thing that could cure him was a bone marrow transplant. But with no good matches in his family, Jaxson became one of the 50,000 people each year who look for a marrow donor from a list of strangers. About half of the people on the donor list will never find a match, but luck was on Jaxson's side. Menafee had seen a sign for a donor drive run by DKMS at Indiana State University, where he was attending graduate school for public health. Having lost his own mother to leukaemia in 2006, Menafee knew how important it was for people to volunteer. But most people who donate a sample to the registry never get called to actually donate bone marrow, DKMS says. Jaxson while undergoing cancer treatment So when Menafee learned there was a one-year-old boy in Canada who needed his bone marrow, he was excited. Their match was especially surprising to doctors because Menafee is African-American, while Jaxson is white. Doctors match bone marrow according to proteins, called human leukocyte antigen (HLA). With many different HLA markers, it can be difficult to find someone who is a close match and people with different races will have an especially hard time. ""Patients have the highest likelihood of finding a match with a donor who may share their ethnic background,"" says DKMS director of medical logistics David Means. It's one of the reasons why donor programmes are always looking for diverse volunteers. Why don't more African-Americans become organ donors? Finding out Jaxson was alive and well was a huge relief, Menafee says. His own mother died from complications from a stem cell transplant, and he was nervous that his donation would not help Jaxson heal. But in the end the two were a ""perfect match"", Means told the BBC. ""I was amazed and thankful to find out I was a 10/10 match, which is extremely rare especially from different races,"" Menafee says. After communicating regularly through email, Slade and her grandparents invited Menafee to visit the family in Newfoundland for Easter. Once there, the family had an open house to welcome him. He toured the picturesque seaside towns near St John's, saw icebergs and enjoyed a traditional Jiggs dinner, a Sunday boiled feast common in Atlantic Canada. ""He really felt like part of the family, it was an immediate connection,"" Slade says. And Jaxson - who is now almost five years old - enjoyed meeting the man who saved his life, even if he didn't really understand how. Carrying a white teddy bear, Jaxson gave Menafee a big hug and a smile, especially when he saw that Menafee had brought him a Mario Brothers bag as a present. Meet the woman who caused a spike in bone marrow donors WATCH: Inside the world's biggest blood bank His cancer is in remission and there's only a very small chance that it will come back, Slade says. ""You'd never know it to look at him now, he's a big ball of energy that doesn't stop."" While Menafee and the Slades didn't know of each other's existence until last year, now they speak every week. When Menafee left Newfoundland after the holiday, he promised to return. ""This is not goodbye, it's see you later,"" he said.

"Women are wearing white and discarding headscarves in protest against Iran's dress code A new social media campaign against a law which forces women to wear a headscarf is gaining momentum in Iran. Using the hashtag #whitewednesdays, citizens have been posting pictures and videos of themselves wearing white headscarves or pieces of white clothing as symbols of protest. The idea is the brainchild of Masih Alinejad, founder ofMy Stealthy Freedom,external, an online movement opposed to the mandatory dress code. Before the 1979 Islamic revolution many Iranian women wore Western-style outfits, including miniskirts and short-sleeved tops, but this all changed when the late Ayatollah Khomeini came to power. Women were not only forced to cover their hair in line with a strict interpretation of Islamic law on modesty, but also to stop using make-up and to start wearing knee-length manteaus. More than 100,000 women and men took to the streets to protest against the law in 1979, and opposition to it has never gone away. Conservatives want the Iranian authorities to enforce the dress code In the three years that it has been running, My Stealthy Freedom has received more than 3,000 photos and videos showing women without their heads covered. While pictures posted on My Stealthy Freedom sites are usually taken in secret to avoid being caught by the authorities, #whitewednesdays gives women a platform to demonstrate in public. Now in its fifth week, #whitewednesdays has already attracted a considerable following - more than 200 videos were sent to Ms Alinejad in the first two weeks, some of which have already had 500,000 views. ""I'm so pumped up to be in this campaign,"" one contributorsays in a video,externalas she walks down a main road. ""I want to talk to you of my imprisonment... they imposed hijab on me since I was seven,"" she says, shaking her headscarf loose, ""while I never felt committed to it and won't be."" Some women have been brazen in their show of support for #whitewednesdays Ms Alinejad says she is amazed by the demonstrations of courage - some women have sent in videos of themselves walking the streets without headscarves altogether. ""When I expressed my concern about [one contributor's] safety, she replied that she would rather jeopardise her job than continue living under this oppression that the Iranian women have endured for the last 38 years."" The campaign has cut across generational boundaries For Ms Alinejad, the project is a labour of love. She runs the campaign herself, with occasional help from a small number of volunteers, and sometimes stays up all night getting the videos up online. Most of the pictures and videos come from inside Iran, but Ms Alinejad has also had contributions from Saudi Arabia (where the headscarf is also compulsory) and further afield, including Europe and the US. Women around the world, including non-Muslims, have shown their support One woman in Afghanistan wrote about her admiration for the campaign and its participants, even though she herself was too frightened to post a photo without a hijab. Headscarves are not mandatory by law in Afghanistan, but many girls and women are forced by their families to wear them. Ms Alinejad says she is emancipating Iranian women, as well as the men who support them. One participant said it was important because ""even if this leads me to jail and sleeping with cockroaches, it would be worth it to help the next generation"". Ms Alinejad sees herself as helping, rather than heading, the campaign. Iranian women, she says, ""are taking the lead themselves, they don't need me, they just needed a platform... and I provided them with that"". Masih Alinejad says the women who are posting are courageous Her actions have come at a cost though. Ms Alinejad, who lives in self-imposed exile in the US, has not been to Iran since 2009 and at the moment cannot go back to her home country for fear of arrest. Following this latest campaign, the chief editor of Iran's Tasnim news agency published a photo of Ms Alinejad with her husband, calling her a prostitute. Mashregh News, a website said to be affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), carried an old family photo of her with her mother, who wears a head-to-toe black chador, and her father. The caption says in bold: ""Death to you Masih."" Ms Alinejad is defiant, saying none of the backlash will stop her from fighting to win women back their freedom. Her sights are now set on turning the campaign into a concerted global movement, where more women around the world identify with #whitewednesdays and make a simple fashion statement as a powerful show of support.

"Five Guys' Paul Reynish says burgers should be part of a balanced diet, but he eats one a day when he's working in stores Burgers used to be fast and cheap - the epitome of fast food. But now a different type of patty exported from the US is rapidly expanding across the globe. What's driving the rise of the so called ""better burger""? ""What's fascinating"", observes Paul Reynish, chief executive of US burger chain Five Guys International, is ""the complete fundamental change"" that has taken place with people prepared to pay more and wait longer for a more upmarket burger. We're speaking via phone whilst he's in the firm's Belfast restaurant, doing what he calls ""product calibration"" - where the firm tries to match US ingredients not available or allowed under EU laws with local alternatives. Making sure its overseas burgers taste the same as those in the US is important, he says. ""Unless you have consistency there is no brand... you've got to have some confidence that the burger you have in Dubai and Paris is the same as the one you have in California and Miami,"" he says. Shake Shack has adapted its offering to local tastes, offering a red bean shake in Korea and veal bacon in countries where pork isn't eaten This is still a fairly new experience for the firm, whichopened its first restaurant outside the USjust four years ago. The family controlled firm, started by husband and wife team Jerry and Janie Murrell and their five sons in 1986, is one of the biggest operators in the so called ""better burger"" market. This is where the cheap fast food staple morphs into the world of cooked-to-order, brioche buns, grass fed cattle and triple cooked chips. A level up from the fast food chains such as McDonald's and Burger King and two to three times more expensive, these types of burger bars still tend to be cheaper and more relaxed than a restaurant meal. In a world where prices are rising faster than pay, it's an affordable indulgence. Yes it's a treat but not one that'll put too much of a dent in your bank balance. So called millennials, the generation that came of age after the 2008 financial crisis, are their core customers. The trend of diners wanting to know where their food comes from, how it was prepared, and the ""story"" behind it has also helped drive the better burger's rapid expansion. Currently just 150 of Five Guys' 1,450 restaurants are outside the US Five Guys, for example, boasts of 120-day grain-finished beef from family-owned farms in Ireland. Less than 1% of all UK beef qualifies, it says. ""Burgers, fries, shakes and Coke it's a pretty simple model,"" says Mr Reynish. Nonetheless, it's a profitable market, worth some Â£3.3bn in the UK last year, according to market research firm Mintel. The US and the UK aren't the only ones with an appetite for a more upmarket burger. Five Guys is currently in nine countries, but expects to expand to 28 over the next five years. It's not to everyone's taste. ""Overpriced, overrated and over here,"" is one disgruntled Trip Advisor reviewer's verdict on the explosion of higher end US burger places in the UK. Yet Mr Reynish says it was demands from visitors to the US desperate to experience the burgers in their home countries that drove their decision to expand. Shake Shack's Michael Kark says the firm's rapid expansion wasn't planned In contrast to Five Guys, US rival Shake Shack wasn't even a chain when it decided to take its concept overseas. ""Quite honestly it's serendipitous we're even talking now...Shake Shack was totally an accident,"" laughs Michael Kark. As vice president of Shake Shack's licensed business, he is the man in charge of the firm's international expansion. The firm's taken an unusual approach to expansion, opening restaurants overseas before it was an established presence in its home country. Less than a decade ago the firm was a temporary stand in a New York park with queues so long that one fan set up a webcam so people could see at a glance just how long they'd have to wait. It was after the firm, founded by restaurateur Danny Meyer, opened its second restaurant, that Kuwaiti firm Alshaya approached them about opening a franchise. ""Kuwait isn't top of most brands' lists"", admits Mr Kark. But for the firm which was then ""really really tiny"", it turned out to be a massive opportunity. Shake Shack now has 133 locations globally, with 83 of these in the US They agreed a licensing deal whereby Shake Shack took a one-off fee plus a percentage of sales. It's a model the firm has stuck to for all its overseas restaurants. The experience helped its success: ""As a company we were really great at creating one off concepts but we had no experience about duplication,"" says Mr Kark. But why on earth did Alshaya choose Shake Shack? Mr Kark says when he asked him, the group's founder said it was the really long queues. ""We'd gained this enormous cult following and that's how he found us."" Scott Collins (left) and Yianni Papoutsis say they deliberately make their restaurants hard to find Burger bars often inspire a cult-like following. UK burger firm Meat Liquor began as irregular gatherings called #Meateasy advertised on Twitter. At that stage there was no restaurant, website or permanent venue, but just a hashtag and a burger van dubbed the ""meatwagon"". Nonetheless, people would trek to south London and queue for two hours just to get a taste of their particular take on classic American diner food. It wasn't just the food, but the atmosphere that lured customers. With violently loud music and dark graffiti-adorned walls, the venues are more like a nightclub than a restaurant. This video can not be played CEO Secrets: Burger boss says reach out to your heroes The first meatwagon was vandalised and the second was stolen. Founder Yianni Papoutsis, who was juggling the ad hoc stall with his job as a technician for the English National Ballet, eventually teamed up with pub owner Scott Collins to find a restaurant in 2010. Now the pair have 13 sites and expect to make Â£17m in sales this year. ""It's more like luck than judgement,"" says Mr Collins.

But one thing hasn't changed. They still make customers seek them out. Their restaurants are often in sites other restaurants reject, tucked away in alleyways, or unusual places such as an ice rink or a box park made of shipping containers. ""Part of our USP is that we're hidden away,"" says Scott Collins. But for people fed up with queuing it now lets customers reserve tables. He says there's really nothing new about the gourmet burger craze which has long been a pub menu staple. Meat Liquor's restaurants have a nightclub-like atmosphere It's this very popularity which could eventually slow the sector's growing success. Mintel says the fact that there is so much competition, often in the exact same locations, means it's becoming harder for firms to attract customers. Five Guys Mr Reynish isn't worried. ""We're just not seeing any reduction in demand or frequency. Our annual sales per store are going up not down,"" he says.

"Cheick Tiote, who was 30, collapsed and died during training The recent death of Ivorian footballer Cheick Tiote on the pitch brought an outpouring of sadness in the world of football. This left us asking if there is any evidence to suggest that African players are more likely to die on the pitch than other players, writes Jordan Dunbar. In the past few years there have been a number of players who have died while playing football. Perhaps the most high profile incidents involved two African players; Cameroonian Marc Vivien Foe, who died during a game, and Congolese Fabrice Muamba, who had  a cardiac arrest on the pitch but survived. There is no official register of people who have died playing football. So instead we have used alist from Wikipedia,externalas, though not ideal, it is the most complete we could find. And we are looking at people who died playing the game, that is either in training or during a match. Robert Mastrodomenico from Global Sports Statistics has done some calculations to give us a rough estimate. Restricting himself to the last 10 years he found that 64 footballers had died during that period, but said it was not easy to figure out what all their nationalities were. This means this list certainly has its limitations, and yet, he persevered to crunch the numbers and we think it still shows something interesting. Fans at Beijing Enterprise, the football club he Tiote was playing for when he died, paid tribute to the footballer The analysis suggests that 26 of the 64 players who have died in the last 10 years are from African countries. That is nearly 40%. Fifa, football's world governing body, estimates that there are about 265 million people playing in recognised teams around the world. Around 17% of those are playing in Africa. That is not an ideal measure as many African players are in leagues in other continents. But it is a useful benchmark. Therefore, while Africans make up 17% of the world's footballers they account for nearly 40% of the known deaths. Overall, the biggest cause of death of footballers on the pitch was sudden cardiac death and this was particularly true for African players, as 25 of the 26 died from this cause. Could African players really be more susceptible to sudden cardiac death? Professor of cardiology Sanjay Sharma told the BBC that evidence from the US shows that sudden cardiac death  amongst black basketball players is around three times more common than for white players. Cameroon players remembered Marc Vivien Foe after he died after collapsing during an international game in 2003 But, he added, that is not the only place he has seen that pattern. ""There is data from the National Collegiate Athletic Association in the US that shows that the overall risk of sudden cardiac death during sport is around one in 48,000. ""But when someone actually examines this more closely that risk is considerably higher in black athletes; one in 18,000 in black males."" Professor Sharma said that in the UK the Football Association has done research on young players. The death rate for white footballers in that sample is one in 25,000 but it is one in 4,000 for black players. In other words, a black player is about six times more likely to die than a white player, though the chances are still very small. African footballers who died on the pitch Former Gabon internationalMoise Brou Apanga diedin training for Libreville 105 this April, aged 35 Cameroon internationalPatrick Ekeng diedwhile playing for Dinamo Bucharest in Romania in May 2016, aged 26 Zambia's Chaswe Nsofwa died during a club match in Israel in 2007, aged 28 Nigeria's Samuel Okwaraji died playing a World Cup qualifier against Angola in 1989, aged 25 Read more:Africa's growing on-field casualty list ""The precise reasons aren't clear,"" said Prof Sharma. But he thinks that the evidence he looked at suggests black sports players are more likely to suffer from cardiac arrest because the wall of the left side of the heart seems to thicken more than players of other ethnicities. ""Which may be a situation that causes abnormal electrical disturbances that can cause a sudden death."" Professor Sharma said this can be made worse by higher blood pressure during exercise. Fabrice Muamba survived after collapsing on the pitch while playing for Bolton Wanders in 2012 Most of Prof Sharma's research has looked at black players in the US and UK. But it turns out the picture is more complicated. ""There is going to be some genetic variation amongst the black population. Our information in the UK and from the US is based predominately among black athletes who have originated in West Africa."" Prof Sharma added that while we do not have much data on East Africa, what we do have seems to indicate players from there do not suffer as badly as their West African counterparts. Heart screening is rarer in poorer African countries so problems in players do not always get picked up. ""Overall the risk of sudden death is one in 48,000 to one in 50,000."" The answer to the question ""are more African football players dying?"" is ""perhaps"". The lack of good data, the national and ethnic differences, as well as not enough monitoring means it is too difficult to give a definitive answer. But the medical research seems to suggest that there are good reasons to think that this is a serious issue.

"Afghanistan's education system has had to endure decades of conflict The idea of drafting a nation's brightest new graduates to become teachers in the most deprived areas has been used in both the United States and the UK, where the approach was pioneered by Teach for America and Teach First respectively. But how would this model fare in a country where the education system had been pulverised by four decades of constant war and conflict - Afghanistan? The answer to this question is unfolding in Nangarhar province in eastern Afghanistan, where 80 graduates from Afghan universities are teaching 23,000 girls and boys in 21 schools under the Teach for Afghanistan scheme launched at the beginning of this academic year. The scheme is the realisation of the dream of its founder and chief executive, Rahmatullah Arman, who at 26 has taken on a challenge which might deter the most courageous social reformer. Mr Arman returned to Afghanistan in 2011 after studying at the University of Pune in India, where he also volunteered for the Teach for India scheme. Impressed by the transformation he had witnessed in Indian schools, he decided to attempt something similar back home. But first he had to educate himself about what remained of the Afghan education system and the country's social fabric. He was both shocked and inspired. After 14 years of US-backed reconstruction, Afghanistan was still a country where 3.6 million children were not in school, where half of the teachers were unqualified, where 75% of pupils dropped out by the age of 15, and where the adult illiteracy rate hovered around 60%. Rahmatullah Arman is getting talented young graduates to teach in Afghanistan's schools ""For me, the biggest inspiration was when I went into schools where there were no chairs, no desks, often not even teachers, but the schools were still crowded with pupils,"" said Mr Arman, speaking in Kabul. ""I saw families taking their children to school, even where a blast could happen at any time, with all the security problems of which we are all aware, and yet still there are nine million children at school. ""I saw the hope that the people have, the spirit of not giving up. They have lost their futures, but their children might have a future."" He was convinced that he could give these children ""Not only an education but a very good education, not by others but by Afghans themselves."" Global education Rubbish collector builds library from discarded books Education aid 'stagnates' despite pledges Canadian researchers develop roadkill rescue University of Birmingham to open campus in Dubai Apple expands its European academy to tackle digital skills gap Get in touch with theGlobal education series. So in 2013 he started to create what would become Teach for Afghanistan with help from the global educational partnership organisation, Teach for All (which was created jointly by Teach for America and Teach First in 2007). Mr Arman set high criteria for his recruitment drive. To join, applicants needed ""not just a degree but at least 75% marks"" as well as leadership experience and communication skills. ""Something really wonderful happened,"" Mr Arman said. ""For 80 positions we received 3,000 applications, all meeting the criteria, and 99% were from Afghan universities."" It was important that many of these ""fellows"" were female, to show by example that a girl could become fully educated, get a good job, and still get married and have children. More than 150 died in a suicide bomb attack in Kabul last month In traditional Afghan communities, to be able to read and write was regarded as enough education for a girl. Teach for Afghanistan has a different view. ""It is about changing mindsets, and that is a very long-term process"", Mr Arman said. In one example, a female teacher, Manzoora, heard that the parents of two girls in her class of 14 to 15 year olds wanted to take them out of school. She begged the parents to come and see her; the mother came, observed lessons, talked to the teacher, went back home. And after much discussion, they decided to let the girls stay in school. A classroom without walls or desks. Outdoor school near Jalalabad, Nangarhar Given the continuing violence within Afghanistan, did Arman fear for his own safety? ""Actually, no, because the approach we take is very local, we are building good relationships with community leaders and religious leaders as well."" ""Since we started, we have not witnessed a single attack on any of our fellows, on any of the schools or pupils."" And if, at first, some incumbent teachers and officials saw Teach for Afghanistan's fellows as competitors, they quickly learned to welcome them as partners, he added. The fellows receive the same salary - about 9,000 Afghanis - as state teachers. It's not a good salary, Mr Arman agreed: ""But we convince them they can have a better future, which is much more than just a salary."" Female education has been attacked, with claims schoolgirls were poisoned last month in Ghazni Throughout their two-year commitment, fellows receive leadership training and support that will open up many different opportunities for them, he added. Mr Arman is convinced that Afghanistan's future depends on releasing the potential of its youth: ""Afghanistan has the youngest population in the world and I believe it could be our greatest asset."" He also believed education was the most effective way of countering the appeal of extremism and terrorism. He quotes Pakistani education activist Malala Yousufzai: ""I don't want to kill terrorists, I want to educate the children of terrorists"". ""That is the true way to eradicate extremism in my country"". With help from the Malala Fund, Teach for Afghanistan has just recruited a further 30 fellows - 20 female, 10 male - to begin teaching in schools in Parwan province this month. Ultimately he hopes to be able to supply teachers to all 34 provinces: ""The need is to go national, the need is huge, and we will go for it.""

"The deadly blaze at the 24-storey Grenfell tower block in west London has shocked the UK. Fire services around the world have to deal with blazes in high-rise blocks, so what lessons have been learned? Firefighters arriving at the scene of a high-rise fire would normally set up a base about two floors below the actual fire, says Bob Parkin, an ex-firefighter turned safety consultant. This allows them to set up entry control points, so firefighters going to fight the blaze can be recorded, and crucially, have their breathing apparatus checked so it's clear how much time they can spend in a dangerous, smoke-filled area. The amount of time each person can spend fighting the fire is limited by the amount of air available - so any minutes spent climbing up into a building with equipment is precious fire-fighting time wasted. ""You're going to use a considerable amount of air going up the 10 floors, so because of that and various other things, they will set up the control point two floors below the fire,"" Mr Parkin says. Once they are able to go in, the immediate focus, if people are reported to be trapped in the building, would be on rescuing them, rather than firefighting, and the firefighters would carry minimum levels of equipment for that reason, he adds. ""They will have to fight their way in, in some instances, but they will take chances when people's lives are at risk, without a doubt."" Cladding is believed to have caused the spread of a fire at Dubai's Torch Tower in 2015 But the situation faced at Grenfell Tower in London would have been extremely difficult, Mr Parkin says, because the fire was able to spread so rapidly, and appeared to engulf nearly the entire building. Having to get 20 storeys up to rescue people in that situation ""is just unbelievable"", he says. Without extra air supply for the person rescued, the journey back out of the building would be extremely dangerous. The fire brigade would also have had to operate from a very low level in the building because of how far the blaze had spread, and there were concerns that the building might collapse. Still, London's firefighters ""didn't waver"", London Fire Brigade commissioner Dany Cotton said. ""They were going through there time and time again battling through the floors looking for people."" Roy Wilsher, chair of the National Fire Chiefs Council and a firefighter of 35 years' standing, said fire crews were confronted by terrible scenes. ""You turn the last corner and see something like that in front of you... it makes you go into almost automatic pilot,"" he told BBC Radio 4. Pictures from Grenfell Grenfell residents raised fire risk fears Fire safety experts say the cladding used on Grenfell Tower is the likely reason why the blaze spread so quickly - making it impossible for the fire to be contained floor-by-floor. According to Mr Wilsher, firefighters did eventually reach the top floor ""but it took them hours to get there"". In Dubai, recent high-rise building fires, including at the 79-storey Torch Skyscraper in 2015, spread because of cladding, according to fire engineering consultancy Tenable Dubai. But these fires caused no fatalities because the design and construction of the buildings allowed firefighters to battle the blaze and residents to evacuate via smoke-free, fire-free safety zones, it says. ""All the fires here lasted for six or seven hours but occupants managed to evacuate successfully and all fires were extinguished with no loss of life,"" says Sam Alcock, the firm's director. ""In my opinion, design and construction is what saved lives."" Residents in Grenfell Tower had previously been advised to stay inside their flats in the event of a fire, and Ikhwan Razali, a fire engineer with Tenable understands why. ""You can advise people to stay in place if you have good fire suppression between levels, but in this case [in London] the advice appears to be wrong."" Recent large blazes around the world Plasco building, Iran, January 2017:A fire at a 17-storey commercial building in the Iranian capital led to multiple deaths, including 18 firefighters. The building collapsed - it had been deemed unsafe prior to the incident. Baku, Azerbaijan, May 2015:16 people died in a fire in a residential building, including five children - cladding on the outside of the building was blamed for the way the fire spread. The Torch, Dubai, February 2015:Fire swept through one of the tallest residential buildings in the world. Hundreds of people had to be evacuated from the 79-storey skyscraper. Krasnoyarsk, Russia, September 2014:A 25-storey tower block was destroyed by fire. All 115 residents fled the building and there were no reported casualties. Shanghai, China, November 2010:A fire in a 28-storey tower block killed 53 people and injured at least 90. Chinese state media reported that unlicensed welders were blamed for the accident. Tower cladding 'linked to other fires' In high-rise building fires, aerial platforms can be used to allow firefighters to operate from outside the building. But the London Fire Brigade's aerial platform vehicles can only reach heights of about 32m - limiting how high up the blaze can be fought. In Dubai, where skyscrapers like the Burj Khalifa reach more than 160-storeys, they have higher aerial platforms of up to 80m, Mr Alcock says. But building in access for firefighters to safely get high up in tall buildings, including via special lifts, is crucial. Why are people told to 'stay put'? Six questions for the investigation Residents of UK tower blocks like Grenfell Tower whose flats are not affected by fire or smoke are usually advised to stay in place because both firefighters and evacuating residents share a single stairwell, fire and building safety experts say. Safety standards are meant to contain fires to the individual apartment affected, and keep stairwells and hallways free of smoke for some time, says Graham Fieldhouse, allowing the fire to be fought and evacuations carefully managed. ""[Firefighters] don't need hundreds of people coming down the stairs when they are trying to fight the fire,"" the fire safety expert told the BBC. But at Grenfell Tower, it's clear that things did not work as they should have. This video can not be played Design plays an important role in containing fire Flames engulfed tower block.

"This video can not be played 'We reported concerns... they weren't investigated' The residents of Grenfell Tower had reportedly raised fire safety concerns for several years before the blaze that engulfed the block of flats in west London on Wednesday,according to a community action group,external. The claim comes as London Fire Brigade said there had been a""number of fatalities""at the tower block. Grenfell Tower in north Kensington was completed in 1974 in the brutalist style of the era, comprising 120 flats over 24 storeys. It received a Â£10m refurbishment in 2015-16 with the work being carried out byRydon Construction,externalas part of a Â£67m borough wide regeneration project. The firm said it was ""shocked to hear of the devastating fire"", adding the work ""met all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards"". The tower is managed byKensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation,externalon behalf of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The regeneration of the tower block included extensive remodelling of the bottom four floors, creating nine additional homes. Improvements were also made to communal facilities for the residents and improved spaces for two local businesses. The exterior was modernised with rain screen cladding, believed to have included thermal insulation, and replacement windows, while curtain wall facades, a new heating system and smoke extract and ventilation system were also installed. The residents of Grenfell Towerhad raised fire safety concerns four years,externalprior to the tower block fire. In February 2013, Grenfell Action Group warned fire safety equipment had not been tested for 12 months. The group published an extract from a 2012 fire risk assessment which found that fire extinguishers in the basement boiler room, lift motor room and ground floor electrical room were more than 12 months out of test date. Others located in roof level areas had ""condemned"" written on them in large black writing and had not been tested since 2009. The tower block was given a medium fire risk rating - defined as a normal fire risk -  in 2016 by the London Fire Brigade (LFB) and Kensington and Chelsea Borough Council following the refurbishment. But residents warned the tower block remained a fire risk.  In a further blog posting in November 2016, the action group stated it believed ""only a catastrophic event""would bring an end to the dangerous living conditions at the tower block.,external The group association further alleged residents were given scant information about what to do in the event of a fire. They claimed ""a temporary notice stuck in the lift and one announcement in a recent regeneration newsletter"" informed them they should remain in their flats in the event of fire. ""There are not and never have been any instructions posted in the Grenfell Tower notice board or on individual floor as to how residents should act in event of a fire,"" the blog posting added. The leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Nick Paget-Brown, told BBC News: ""It's truly horrifying - it's a terrible day in Kensington's history. It's an awful tragedy. ""When I arrived the flames were covering several storeys and it was moving very quickly, so there needs to be a thorough investigation into why this fire started and why it spread so quickly. Nick Paget-Brown said the tower had been refurbished to make it more energy efficient ""There was a refurbishment [at Grenfell], we are refurbishing many of our 1960s and 1970s estates, the idea being to improve the heating and hot water systems, to install better windows, improve the insulation, make them more energy efficient, new cladding on the outside. ""We will clearly need to examine that and look and what was done and what standards were applied, and if they were followed and met. ""I think there are issues about towers and residential towers, and how they are refurbished and what measures are in place to evacuate the building. We will need to have a look at all of that.""

"This video can not be played Watch as baseball gunman opens fire A gunman who sprayed bullets at Republican lawmakers during baseball practice in a Washington DC suburb has died, US President Donald Trump said. House of Representatives Majority Whip Steve Scalise was one of five injured in the early morning ambush at a park in Alexandria, Virginia. The attacker, identified as Illinois native James T Hodgkinson, 66, was killed after a firefight with police. The injured included two officers with non-life-threatening wounds. Hodgkinson was self-employed until recently and worked as a home inspector. Shooting prompts familiar accusations He had campaigned for former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. A Facebook account that appears to belong to Hodgkinson is filled with anti-Republican and anti-Trump posts. This video can not be played Bernie Sanders: 'I'm sickened by this despicable act' Mr Sanders, a Vermont senator, said he was ""sickened by this despicable act"" and condemned Hodgkinson's actions. Reaction to the attack Virginia shooting: What we know A Washington baseball tradition in peril President Trump described the attack as a ""very, very brutal assault"". ""We may have our differences, but we do well in times like these to remember that everyone who serves in our nation's capital is here because, above all, they love our country,"" he added. The president visited Mr Scalise - who was shot in the left hip and is in a critical condition after surgery - at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center on Wednesday evening, describing him as a ""patriot and a fighter"". The hospital said Mr Scalise had suffered fractured bones, internal organ injuries and severe bleeding and would require further operations. James T Hodgkinson was a resident of Bellville, Illinois, a suburb of St Louis James T Hodgkinson is a 66-year-old man from Belleville, Illinois His wife told ABC News he moved to Virginia two months ago His Facebook account shows anti-Republican and anti-Trump rhetoric He volunteered on the campaign of Bernie Sanders He had a string of criminal convictions, including traffic violations and allegations of violence What we know about James T Hodgkinson The lawmakers were practising for the annual congressional ballgame that organisers vowed would go ahead as planned on Thursday at Nationals Park, home of Major League Baseball team the Washington Nationals. Alexandria police said the FBI was taking over the investigation into the shooting, which began shortly after 07:00 (11:00 GMT) on Wednesday morning at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park. This video can not be played Congressman shot: 'He laid out there for 10 minutes alone' As well as Mr Scalise, two police officers who protect him, Krystal Griner and David Bailey, lobbyist Matt Mika and Zack Barth, a congressional aide for Texas lawmaker Roger Williams, were injured. Mr Barth, a former staffer for two Republican congressmen, was shot in the chest, according to witness Arizona Senator Jeff Flake. Mr Flake told reporters he was at bat during the shooting and the victims were ""sitting ducks"". This video can not be played Texas congressman fights back tears as he recounts shooting Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, said someone at the baseball field had used a belt as a tourniquet on Mr Scalise, who is the number three House Republican. South Carolina congressman Jeff Duncan said the suspect hadasked him whether Republicans or Democrats were practising, before shots rang out. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul told Fox News: ""I do believe without the Capitol Hill police it would have been a massacre. ""We had no defence at all. The field was basically a killing field."" He said they were lucky that Mr Scalise was present because he has a security detail owing to his congressional seniority. US lawmakers receive police protection while they are at the Capitol building, but only certain high-ranking House and Senate figures - believed to number about 10 in total - have a round-the-clock security detail wherever they are. Just a handful of top congressional leaders used to have that privilege, but it was broadened after 9/11 to include the whips,according to The Hill,external. However, other members can get protection too if, for example, threats have been made. Some of those not eligible for constant protection carry guns in their home districts if the state laws allow it, and lawmakers can also organise local police protection for their events. When Democrat representative Gabrielle Giffords was shot in January 2011 in Arizona while speaking to constituents, no police were providing security. The latest shooting has triggered a fresh debate around the issue. Mo Brooks, an Alabama Republican, told CNN he was on third base during the baseball game when he saw Mr Scalise, who was on second base, shot. He said Mr Scalise had a bullet hole in his leg, but was saying: ""I'm OK, I'm OK."" Mr Brooks said everyone on the field scattered as 50 to 100 shots were fired. This video can not be played Congress 'united' over Virginia shooting He said a gunfight had ensued between the shooter and the congressmen's police security detail, who were armed with pistols. Mr Brooks, who took refuge behind a batting cage, said the gunman was armed with a rifle and was ""blasting away"" from behind the dugout. Mr Brooks said congressmen Chuck Fleischmann, of Tennessee, Ron DeSantis, of Florida, and Jeff Duncan, of South Carolina, were among 15-25 other lawmakers at the game. Asked by a CNN host if the attack was deliberate, Mr Brooks replied: ""Well, it sure as heck wasn't an accident! This video can not be played Eyewitness: 'I cried and laid flat on the ground' ""He was going after elected officials, congressmen."" Mr Brooks continued: ""The only weapon I had was a baseball bat and that's not the kind of fight you want to engage in."" Ohio congressman Brad Wenstrup, who served in Iraq as a combat surgeon from 2005-06, provided medical care at the scene. He said the attack had lasted for at least 10 minutes, adding: ""He had a lot of ammo.""

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn calls for details of Tory-DUP deal Jeremy Corbyn is demanding details of the deal the Tories are striking with the DUP to form a minority government, calling it a ""nonsense situation"". The Labour leader also called for a date for the Queen's Speech, saying it ""was the very least we need to know"". He said Labour was ""united"" and ""ready"" to form an alternative government. DUP sources have told the BBC an announcement on a deal with the Conservatives has been delayed because of the Grenfell Tower blaze. They said the two parties were now finalising the ""terms and conditions"" of an agreement after Mrs May and DUP leader Arlene Foster met on Tuesday. But they added that the London tower block fire made an announcement on Wednesday ""inappropriate"" and diary commitments meant a final deal could be delayed until next week. Election Live - rolling text and video updates Quick guide to what's going on Who are the DUP's 10 MPs? If a deal was to be delayed it would mean the Queen's Speech, which had originally been planned for next Monday, could be delayed by at least a week. It could also delay the start of Brexit talks. The Conservatives are having to rely on the support of 10 DUP MPs after they fell eight seats short of winning an overall majority at the general election. It means that Mrs May will remain as prime minister and the DUP MPs will be central to the survival of a Conservative Party administration. Mrs May is to meet the leaders of Northern Ireland's other main political parties on Thursday in a bid to allay fears a deal with the Democratic Unionists will undermine the peace process. Arlene Foster and Theresa May have been holding talks Sinn Fein, the SDLP and Alliance have all said Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire cannot chair the ongoing process to restore power-sharing at Stormont due to their perception he has a conflict of interest. Sinn Fein's Stormont leader Michelle O'Neill said: ""I will be making it very clear that any deal between the Tories and the DUP cannot be allowed to undermine the Good Friday and subsequent agreements."" In addition to Sinn Fein, whose seven MPs will not take up their seats at Westminster, Mrs May will meet representatives from three Northern Irish parties who did not win any seats at the general election - the Ulster Unionists, the SDLP and Alliance Party -  in separate meetings at Downing Street. Labour has joined former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major in expressing concern that deal with the DUP will undermined the ""rigorous impartiality"" the UK government is meant to demonstrate under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. Mr Corbyn is also calling on the government to end the ""nonsense situation"" of the public not knowing what kind of deal was on the table. He said: ""We want to know what is in the deal they are offering to the DUP and we want to know when it is going to be put before Parliament. We still haven't been given a date for the Queen's Speech."" He said Parliament ""could not function until it is formally opened and I think the very least we need to know is when that is going to happen"". He added that Labour was ""ready as a strong, united party with a clear programme of what we want to offer to the British people to improve their lives and end this miserable period of austerity"". Arlene Foster and the 10 MPs Theresa May hopes will keep them in power The DUP have been playing their cards close to their chest, but we know the areas they're talking about because of a DUPplan drawn up in 2015 in anticipation of a hung Parliament,external. Things have moved on a bit since then with Brexit, but we do know they're looking at trying to lower the cost to the Northern Ireland executive of any move on corporation tax. They've been of the view that leaving the EU should lessen some of the stipulations in relation to state aid that were being applied by the Treasury to Northern Ireland, and that might take down the bill that the Treasury would put on the executive if corporation tax was lowered. We know other matters, such as cutting air passenger duty and increased infrastructure spending, have been discussed, but we haven't got any sense of the exact details of the deal. I suspect it will be top loaded with economic rather than political matters. Some political issues, such as altering the definition of a Troubles victim or doing away with allowances for MPs who don't take up their seats, might be included. Other legacy matters, such as protecting former soldiers or police officers from prosecution, may feature at a later stage. The DUP will offer support for key votes, such as backing the Queen's Speech and the Budget and opposing any votes of no confidence. The DUP campaigned for Brexit but is also conscious that 56% of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU. They are thought to be advocating a Brexit that does not disrupt the ""frictionless border"" with the Republic of Ireland. They are also opposed to Conservative polices such as means-testing the winter fuel allowance and have campaigned for a higher National Living Wage and to restore the spare room subsidy. Prime Minister Theresa May said on Tuesday that talks with the DUP had been productive and that Brexit negotiations would begin as planned next week. ""I think there is a unity of purpose among people in the United Kingdom,"" Mrs May said, following a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris. On Tuesday, ex-Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major said he was ""dubious"" about the idea of a deal and its potential impact on the peace process. This video can not be played I am ""concerned"" about a deal with the DUP, says former prime minister Sir John Major Sir John told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme there was a danger the government would no longer be seen as an ""impartial honest broker"" in restoring the power-sharing arrangements and upholding Northern Ireland institutions. Asked about Sir John's comments, Mrs May said she was ""absolutely steadfast"" in her support for the 1998 Good Friday agreement - which created the Northern Ireland Assembly - and efforts to revive the power-sharing executive.

"This video can not be played The assault was caught on CCTV A kebab shop owner has been jailed for two years for flinging a pan of boiling water over a chef. Djamel Benrejdal told Chouaib Boussera he was incapable of boiling an egg and then grabbed the pan and threw its contents at his employee. Mr Boussera, 30, was refused time off to get treatment by his ranting boss, even though his arm was badly scalded. Benrejdal's attack on his employee at the fast food outlet in Scarborough was caught on CCTV. The chef howled in agony as he was ""enveloped in a cloud of steam"" and his boss stormed out, York Crown Court heard. Benrejdal, 49, later applied a makeshift poultice of takeaway leftovers to Mr Boussera's wounded arm but he refused permission for him to go to hospital, forcing Mr Boussera to work with his arm in a sling. The scarring suffered by Chouaib Boussera was was described by the judge as ""awful"" and ""long-lasting"" Benrejdal, from Scalby, near Scarborough, had told his employee to boil an egg, but spotted a crack on the shell as it simmered. CCTV footage of the attack, at the Eat Mediterranean kebab and pizza shop, shows Benrejdal waving his arms about before hurling the pan at Mr Boussera, who screamed in pain. Andrew Espley, prosecuting, said Benrejdal applied yoghurt, onions and honey to his victim's ""appalling"" injuries in a ""derisory attempt"" to treat the injury. Chouaib Boussera has since given up the takeaway business He refused to take the chef to Scarborough Hospital until the next day and tampered with the takeaway's CCTV to hide evidence of the attack, after the chef went to the police. Mr Espley said at the time of the attack, on 22 March 2016, Benrejdal had been on bail for assaulting his wife. He was charged with inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and pleaded not guilty at a trial held last month. The jury found Benrejdal guilty of an alternative count of inflicting grievous bodily harm without intent, having failed to reach a verdict on the principal charge. In mitigation Stephen Grattage said his client had been suffering ""stresses and pressures"" from the business. Judge Andrew Stubbs QC said Benrejdal had deliberately used the boiling water as a weapon, causing ""awful, long-lasting"" scarring.

House of Representatives Majority Whip Steve Scalise was one of five injured in the early morning ambush at a park in Alexandria, Virginia. The attacker, identified as Illinois native James T Hodgkinson, 66, was killed after a firefight with police. The injured included two officers with non-life-threatening wounds.

""We may have our differences, but we do well in times like these to remember that everyone who serves in our nation's capital is here because, above all, they love our country,"" he added. The president visited Mr Scalise - who was shot in the left hip and is in a critical condition after surgery - at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center on Wednesday evening, describing him as a ""patriot and a fighter"".

When Democrat representative Gabrielle Giffords was shot in January 2011 in Arizona while speaking to constituents, no police were providing security. The latest shooting has triggered a fresh debate around the issue. Mo Brooks, an Alabama Republican, told CNN he was on third base during the baseball game when he saw Mr Scalise, who was on second base, shot.

Mr Brooks said congressmen Chuck Fleischmann, of Tennessee, Ron DeSantis, of Florida, and Jeff Duncan, of South Carolina, were among 15-25 other lawmakers at the game.

"Locals in Cincinnati turned out to welcome Otto Warmbier home The parents of Otto Warmbier, the US student who is in a coma after being freed this week by North Korea, say he was ""brutalised"" by a ""pariah regime"". The 22-year-old is now being treated in hospital after the flight carrying him landed in Ohio on Tuesday. Mr Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years of hard labour for attempting to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel. He was given a sleeping pill after becoming ill after his trial last year and did not wake up, North Korea said. This video can not be played US student Otto Warmbier said he was ""a poor scapegoat"" before he was jailed in 2016 He is now being treated at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. How harsh is prison in North Korea? ""We want the world to know how we and our son have been brutalised and terrorised by the pariah regime,"" his parents, Fred and Cindy, said. Former US ambassador and New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, who has previously served as special envoy to North Korea and in 2016 attempted to negotiate the release of the student, said the Warmbiers had updated him on their son's condition. ""In no uncertain terms, North Korea must explain the causes of his coma,"" Mr Richardson said. Medical personnel were seen transferring a person believed to be Mr Warmbier to an ambulance at an airport in Cincinnati on Tuesday night The BBC's Stephen Evans in Seoul says it remains to be seen if Mr Warmbier's illness is the direct result of brutality in prison. If it were, there might be pressure on President Trump to take action against Kim Jong-un's regime, he says. Otto Warmbier is an economics student from the University of Virginia, originally from Cincinnati, Ohio. He was in North Korea as a tourist with Young Pioneer Tours when he was arrested on 2 January 2016. He appeared emotional at a news conference a month later, in which he tearfully confessed to trying to take the sign as a ""trophy"" for a US church, adding: ""The aim of my task was to harm the motivation and work ethic of the Korean people."" Foreign detainees in North Korea have previously recanted confessions, saying they were made under pressure. Otto Warmbier's parents feared for his safety as tensions rose between the US and North Korea Aftera short trial on 16 March, Mr Warmbier was given a 15-year prison sentence for crimes against the state. His parentstold CNN in early May,externalthat they had had no contact with their son for more than a year. In a statement on Tuesday, Mr and Mrs Warmbier said: ""Sadly, he is in a coma and we have been told he has been in that condition since March 2016. We learned of this only one week ago."" The sign Mr Warmbier is alleged to have tried to steal, reportedly says: ""Let's arm ourselves strongly with patriotism"" They werequoted by the Washington Post,externalas saying they had been told Otto had contracted botulism, a rare illness that causes paralysis, soon after his trial in March 2016. He was given a sleeping pill and had been in a coma ever since, the newspaper said. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made no mention of Mr Warmbier's conditionin a statement,,externalsaying only that he was on his way home to be reunited with his family and would not make any further comment, out of respect for the privacy of the family. There are reported to be three other US citizens in custody in North Korea. They are: Kim Dong-chul, a 62-year-old naturalised US citizen born in South Korea, who wassentenced to 10 years hard labourin April 2016 for spying Korean-American professor Kim Sang-duk (or Tony Kim) who was detained in April 2017. The reasons for his arrest are not yet clear Kim Hak-song, like Kim Sang-duk, worked at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) and wasdetained in May 2017on suspicion of ""hostile acts"" against the state The US has in the past accused North Korea of detaining its citizens to use them as pawns in negotiations over its nuclear weapons programme. Kim Dong-chul appeared on North Korea television a month after Otto Warmbier, also giving a tearful confession The arrests have come at a time of heightened tension between North Korea and the US and its regional neighbours. Mr Warmbier's release comes hours after US basketball star Dennis Rodman arrived in North Korea. Mr Rodman is a friend of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and has made several visits to the country in recent years. Dennis Rodman was mobbed by the press at Beijing airport en route to Pyongyang There was some speculation that he might plead the case for the American detainees, buten route to North Koreahe told reporters ""my purpose is to actually see if I can keep bringing sports to North Korea"".

"The Trump International Hotel in Washington DC is pitched to foreign diplomats as a place to stay Nearly 200 Democrats in the US Congress are joining forces to file a legal case against President Donald Trump over receipt of payments from foreign governments via his businesses. The plaintiffs accuse Mr Trump of violating the constitution's emoluments clause, prohibiting receipt of gifts without congressional approval. They say this is the largest number of legislators ever to sue a US president. State officials and private businesses are suing Mr Trump in similar cases. The attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia announced their lawsuit on Monday. The White House has denied their allegations. Spokesman Sean Spicer blamed ""partisan politics"" for the attorneys general lawsuit. Senator Blumenthal says the president is interfering with the constitutional duty of Congress The justice department declined to comment on the latest suit by legislators, but has said previously it is unconstitutional to sue the president in his private capacity. At least 30 senators and 166 representatives are involved. They say Mr Trump has not sought congressional approval for any payments received by his businesses from foreign governments since he took office. Protest message projected on Trump hotel What could be conflicts of interest for Trump? ""President Trump has conflicts of interest in at least 25 countries, and it appears he's using his presidency to maximise his profits,"" said Representative John Conyers, quoted by Reuters news agency. ""We do this not out of any sense of pleasure or partisanship, but because President Trump has left us with no other option."" Sen Richard Blumenthal said: ""The president's failure to tell us about these emoluments... mean that we cannot do our job. We cannot consent to what we don't know. He's interfering with our constitutional duty."" This video can not be played Who is behind the projections on the Trump Hotel? Mr Trump's worldwide organisation includes more than 500 business entities, including hotels, golf courses and apartment buildings, many of which have done business with foreign governments. Since taking office in January, Mr Trump has turned day-to-day control of his real estate empire and other assets over to a trust managed by his adult sons. But he has not sold them off as critics said he should do in order to avoid conflicts of interest. A non-governmental organisation, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew),lodged a similar legal action in January. The president's lawyers have argued the emoluments clause is intended only to stop federal officials from accepting a special consideration or gift from a foreign power and does not apply to payments such as a bill for a hotel room. A section of the US constitution known as the emoluments clause restricts what US presidents can accept from foreign governments The clause says ""no person holding any office of profit or trust"" may accept ""any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state"" America's founding fathers included this to prevent US leaders from being beholden to foreign governments Legal analysts say that if the Trump organisation accepts special deals, such as tax breaks or land rights overseas, it could fall foul of the clause.

"Tens of thousands of civilians have been displaced by the fighting for Raqqa UN war crimes investigators say US-led coalition air strikes on Islamic State militants in the Syrian city of Raqqa are causing ""staggering loss of life"". Hundreds of civilians are reported to have been killed since March, as coalition warplanes support an offensive by a Kurdish-led alliance. In the past week, Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighters have pushed into the west, east and north of Raqqa. The battle for the city has also led to 160,000 civilians fleeing their homes.

Up to 4,000 militants are believed to be holed up inside Raqqa, including foreign fighters and various senior figures. It is unclear how many civilians are trapped there with them, but UN officials estimated that there are between 50,000 and 100,000. In an address to the UN Human Rights Council on Wednesday, the chairman of the independent commission of inquiry for Syria noted that IS had been losing territory at a rapid pace in the north and centre of the country over the past few months. If successful, Paolo Pinheiro said, the SDF offensive on Raqqa ""could liberate the city's civilian population from the group's oppressive clutches, including Yazidi women and girls, whom the group has kept sexually enslaved for almost three years as part of an ongoing and unaddressed genocide"".

"The UK's highest court has rejected an appeal by a mother and daughter in their legal battle for women from Northern Ireland to receive free abortions on the NHS in England. The Supreme Court challenge centred on the case of a Northern Ireland woman who became pregnant when she was 15. She went to England with her mother for an abortion in a private clinic in 2012, at a cost of about Â£900. Northern Ireland's abortion law is much stricter than the rest of the UK. Women lose abortion ruling appeal Why are Northern Ireland's abortion laws different to the rest of the UK? New Northern Ireland abortion guidelines Terminations are only permitted if a woman's life is at risk, or there is a permanent or serious risk to her mental or physical health. Rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities are not circumstances in which abortions can be performed legally in Northern Ireland. The mother and daughter took the case against UK Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who conceded that he had the power to make provisions for Northern Ireland residents to access free NHS abortions in England. Supreme Court judges dismissed the mother and daughter's appeal by a narrow majority of three to two They claimed that it was ""unlawful"" that he had not done so. However, Supreme Court judges dismissed the mother and daughter's appeal by a narrow majority of three to two. Delivering the ruling, Lord Wilson said it was not for the court to ""address the ethical considerations which underlie the difference"" in the law regarding abortion in Northern Ireland and England. However, he said the five judges had been ""sharply divided"" on the case. He expressed sympathy for women facing unwanted pregnancies in Northern Ireland and said the law put many of them in a ""deeply unenviable position"". He said they faced ""embarrassment, difficulty, and uncertainty"" in their ""urgent need to raise the necessary funds"" to travel to Great Britain for private abortions. Supreme Court judge Lord Wilson expressed sympathy for the women but did not allow their appeal Lord Wilson conceded that the financial burden had added to their ""emotional strain"". But he did not rule in favour of the women's case, and dismissed their appeal, a decision with which his fellow judges Lord Reed and Lord Hughes agreed. Their judgement acknowledged that under devolution, separate authorities in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are responsible for providing free health services to those usually resident there. It stated that the health secretary was entitled to restrict access to NHS abortions ""in line with this scheme for local decision-making"". The judgement added that Mr Hunt was ""entitled to afford respect to the democratic decision of the people of Northern Ireland not to fund abortion services"". Lord Wilson added that Lady Hale and Lord Kerr gave dissenting judgments and would have allowed the appeal. The mother and daughter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said they will now take their case to the European Court of Human Rights. In a joint statement, they said they were ""really encouraged that two of the judges found in our favour"" and that all of the judges had been ""sympathetic"" to their situation. ""We have come this far and fought hard because the issues are so important for women in Northern Ireland. For this reason, we will do all that we can to take the fight further. ""We have instructed our legal team to file an application with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, to protect the human rights of the many other women who make the lonely journey to England every week because they are denied access to basic healthcare services in their own country."" Last year, more than 700 women from Northern Ireland travelled to England for an abortion last year,according to UK Department of Health figures. The number was 100 fewer than the year before. The mother and daughter initially took their case to theHigh Court in London in 2014, when the court heard they had struggled to part-raise the funds for a private abortion in England. High Court judge, Mr Justice King, ruled at the time that the health secretary duty's to promote a comprehensive health service in England ""is a duty in relation to the physical and mental health of the people of England"". He said that duty did not extend ""to persons who are ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland"". His 2014 ruling also said that devolutionary powers had to be taken into consideration. The following year, the womentook their case to the Court of Appeal but again, they lost the argument. The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal in the UK for civil cases. However, the mother and daughter's lawyer, Angela Jackman, said on Wednesday her clients had made ""significant strides"" since the original High Court ruling. She added that the split decision of the Supreme Court judges provided them with a ""firm basis"" for taking their case forward to the European Court of Human Rights. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), which was among organisations that participated in the legal challenge, said it was disappointed with the overall verdict of the Supreme Court. BPAS's chief executive Ann Furedi said: ""NHS-funded abortion care may not have been declared a legal right for Northern Irish women today, but it is morally right to provide it."" She added: ""They deserve the same care and compassion as all other UK citizens."" However, the Iona Institute, which is anti-abortion, said Northern Ireland ""should be proud of its life-saving abortion law"". The Christian organisation added: ""At a time when scientific advances have given us an amazing 'window' into babies in the womb we are right to continue to reject the permissive British abortion model."" 700 NI women go to England for abortions Why are Northern Ireland's abortion laws different?

"Theresa May awaiting her constituency result in the early hours of Friday The post mortem on how Theresa May managed to lose her majority in Thursday's general election after expecting to secure a landslide victory is well under way. Here are 10 theories. Yes. The Conservatives came first in this election with 318 seats, with Labour the next biggest party on 262 seats. The Conservatives got more votes that anyone else - 42.4% to Labour's 40% - and Theresa May's party got more votes than anyone since the record-breaking total John Major received in 1992. And yes, that means she got more votes than Tony Blair's New Labour landslide in 1997. So, you ask, in what sense did she blow it? Well, she had 331 MPs - more than the 326 needed to have a Commons majority - when she decided to call the election with the aim of increasing her majority. She also began the campaign with an undisputed opinion-poll lead in double figures and a landslide victory within her grasp. She ends it having to try to do a deal with the 10 Democratic Unionist Party MPs to stay in power, and knowing that, the decision to call a snap election will go down as one of the biggest own goals in British political history. So how did it come to this? This video can not be played Reaction from Bristol: 'You're joking. Why does she need to do it?' Theresa May had been serenely racking upstunning approval ratings,externaland huge opinion-poll leads. Her constant refrain was ""Brexit meant Brexit"" and it seemed a serious, tough, honest and non-flashy politician was what the British people wanted. Her honeymoon period felt like that of another self-consciously unshowy prime minister who came to power without an election - Gordon Brown. But unlike Mr Brown in 2007, she did not allow speculation about a snap election to run rife only to blow her reputation bydeciding not to call one after all,external. She ruled out having an election. And then she changed her mind. She insisted she was acting in the national interest but others detected baser motives.Jeremy Corbyn said:""How can any voter trust what the prime minister says?"".Nicola Sturgeon saidit was a naked power grab and a bid to crush all opposition. The public, like Brenda in Bristol, seemed weary of politics and voting. This was Theresa May's election - the Conservatives were some way off in the distance, if they were visible at all, at the start of the campaign. But was she the right kind of candidate to be placed front and centre like this? Katie Perrior, Mrs May's former director of communications thinks not.Writing in the Times,external, she said: ""If you run a presidential-style campaign with a woman who doesn't like media interviews, then you have to accept that it's better to do them and run the risk that they go badly than look like you are running scared. Furthermore, if you want to brag that your candidate is a bloody difficult woman, then she has to show some empathy to remind people she is human after all."" This video can not be played Home Secretary Amber Rudd and senior politicians from six other parties took part in the debate. With huge poll leads at the start of the campaign it was quickly decided that Mrs May would not take part in anything as risky as a TV debate with her main challenger, Jeremy Corbyn, or risk meeting too many members of the public in big rallies. That decision backfired when Mr Corbyn decided to take part in a seven-way debate with other party leaders - he did not make a big deal of her absence, buteverybody else on the stage did. The Green Party's Caroline Lucas said: ""You don't say it's the most important election of our lifetime and not be bothered to show up."" Mrs May might have performed badly in the debate, but she arguably took a far bigger reputational hit by not taking part, as it opened her up to accusations she was running scared, or that she was complacently assuming victory. Sporting history is littered with underdogs triumphing because they wanted to win more than their opponents, or put in more effort. The same sometimes goes for politics. In this election Mrs May seemed like she would be happy to say ""strong and stable"" from dawn until the sun set over the fields of wheatshe ""naughtily"" ran through as a child,external. There was little in the way of a positive message to entice floating voters. Her campaign team did not seem able to conceive of the idea that anyone would take Mr Corbyn seriously. They underestimated how well his anti-austerity message would go over with voters worn out by years of frozen wages and public spending squeezes. Many commentators, on the left and right, who had written Jeremy Corbyn off as vote-losing liability have had to eat their words since the election. Just about everyone underestimated his appeal, once he was given a chance to air his views unmediated by a largely hostile press. This video can not be played Anna Soubry has given a frank assessment of her party's campaign The turning point of the campaign, according to insiders, was Theresa May's U-turn on social care. Team May were apparently so confident of victory that they thought they could tackle the looming problem of social care costs - an issue parties scrapping to win elections have generally shied away from. But within hours the main thing many people knew about the Conservative programme for government was that it included a ""dementia tax"" that could lead to more people  having to sell their homes to pay for care. The same went for means-testing the winter fuel allowance and ending the ""triple lock"" that guarantees a minimum 2.5% increase in the state pension. Mrs May might have got away with the rapid U-turn on social care - something that is almost unheard of the middle of an election campaign - if she had owned up to it but she continued to insist that nothing had changed. This video can not be played Theresa May: This is the right way forward Anna Soubry, an anti-Brexit Tory MP said this was the moment that she lost her ""strong and stable"" reputation. Some Conservative MPs have suggested, off the record, that the 2017 manifesto was the worst the party has ever published. Ms Soubry said it was more a problem of ""appalling"" presentation - not properly explaining the social care changes, which would actually have benefited many less well-off people - and allowing people to think free school meals for poor children were being axed, when in fact the plan was to end the free lunches for all infants, which benefits the better-off. Nick Timothy, pictured, who was forced out as Theresa May's policy adviser after the election result, suggests Team May were not even aware that there was a surge in Labour support as polling day approached. Inhis resignation statement,external, he said this was ""because modern campaigning techniques require ever-narrower targeting of specific voters, and we were not talking to the people who decided to vote for Labour"". Instead of pushing their message on the NHS and the energy price cap to get wavering Labour voters on side, they doubled down on what they thought was their strongest suit - Brexit and ""strong and stable leadership"" in contrast to a ""coalition of chaos"" under Mr Corbyn. People knew very little about Theresa May before the campaign started - she had been home secretary for a long time but had not courted publicity like some of her cabinet colleagues. An introvert, by Westminster standards, who does not like talking about her private feelings, she tended to come across as ill-at-ease on the TV sofa. Like Hillary Clinton in last year's US elections, she was not a natural on the campaign trail either. As Daily Mail sketch writer Quentin Letts pointed out at one event, she tended to look a bit miserable, or as he put it, a""glumbucket'. Mr Corbyn, on the other hand, looked like he was enjoying himself. At the end of the campaign, Mrs May had to rely on Boris Johnson, a natural political showman, to whip up the crowds. Theresa May spent a lot of time attacking Jeremy Corbyn's credibility and, as Nick Timothy has acknowledged, not enough time setting out her ""positive plan for for the future"". There are shades of Clinton here again, who focused heavily on attacking her opponent's fitness for office rather than explaining what she would do with power. Conservative attacks on Mr Corbyn's anti-terror record will have sounded alarm bells with older readers of Conservative-supporting newspapers. They may have meant less to anyone under 30, who were more interested in what the Labour leader had to say about their future rather than who he was holding meetings with decades ago.Labour countered Tory attack ads on Facebookwith upbeat messages and celebrity endorsements. Labour's successful push to get out the youth vote was a decisive factor in some seats, although there is still somedebate about the size of the surge in voting among 18 to 24-year-olds. The Tory campaign waswidely criticised for being negative and uninspiring,external. Anti-hunting protesters marched on Downing Street It may simply have been a repetition of a longstanding Tory policy but Theresa May's vow to hold a free vote on bringing back fox hunting isthought by some to have harmed her effortsto seal the deal with Labour voters flirting with the Conservatives. It came up a lot on the doorstep,according to some reports,external, helping to ""re-toxify"" the Conservative brand among voters in traditional Labour areas, which Mrs May was banking on to win a big majority. Like the social care U-turn, or the pledge to bring back grammar schools, it may have given anyone flirting with backing the Tories for the first time in their lives a reason not to switch their vote. 10) Events Theresa May wanted the election to be about Brexit but the terror attacks in Manchester and London changed the course of the campaign. Suddenly it was all about security and anti-terror policy. This should have put the former home secretary in a strong position, and her statements on the attacks struck a suitably prime ministerial tone. Labour's criticism of cuts to police numbers gave them a line of attack against Mrs May - but the pause in campaigning that followed the terrorist incidents resulted in a sombre and strangely off-kilter ending to the election. ""Ignoring remain voters - too much focus on ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" and complaining that Remain voters were ""citizens of nowhere"" alienated the 48%. Playing so much to the UKIP vote backfired in many areas of the country. Evidence for this: the swing to Labour from Tories was much larger in Remain voting areas than Leave voting ones,""Sue, York. ""Jeremy Corbyn was reckless and irresponsible in the promises he was making particularly to the youth voters.  Promising to give 'free university' at a cost to the UK of Â£11.5 Billion a year,  is an example of the 'money tree' that pays for all !  Corbyn could afford to be reckless in his election promises because he didn't expect to win or be PM.""Ron, Stoke-on-Trent. ""The Conservatives underestimated the collapse in the number of votes for the UKIP party. It must have been apparent that these votes would go somewhere and not necessarily all to the Conservative Party. Clearly some of these went to the Labour Party. The Labour Party will always have a strong backing in the cities and these extra votes from the UKIP party helped Labour get more seats. This should have been anticipated and calculated before Mrs May called the election so some of her advisers and backroom staff got it clearly wrong and miscalculated - or was it Mrs May just determined to call the election whatever?,""Jeff ""Definitely Fox Hunting swayed me. I left the Labour Party as a member when JC became leader. I didn't think he was electable (and he still might not be) and predicted a Labour wipe-out with him at the helm. But as the election went on I was slowly taken back into the fold by his positive campaign. I'd always agreed with his policies, just him as a leader I had doubts over. The more he engaged though the more I cheered, and once the manifestos where published it was game over for the Tories. But yes, the fox hunting was the initial game changer (as it was announced early on) - and then everything else just fell into place,""Ian, Chester. ""I'm surprised that more hasn't been made of the proposed boundary changes, which would have reduced MPs from 650 to 600. If May had forced these through and then called the election she would have undoubtedly won a majority, as they massively favour the Conservatives. One report suggested that under the new boundaries Labour could be 10% ahead of the Tories and still not have a majority,""Andrew, Loughborough. ""The Tories did not lose their majority over the stance favouring a hard Brexit. They lost seats because the majority accept that Brexit will happen and all the other issues of economic and social policy were more important issues in the election. Mrs May needs to ignore the pro Remain Major, Cameron and Clarke who are using the situation to try to reverse their defeat in the Referendum,""Ian ""You've laid out some good reasons but as you state, both the Conservative and Labour vote increased...... why? Because of a huge amount of tactical voting especially driven by social media. A lot of the ""Remainers"" had been horrified about the way that she'd embraced a Hard Brexit and even though Labour supported Brexit, they felt that not voting Tory would potentially hinder this outcome. Labour need to bear this in mind too. As a lot of people like me ""lent"" them their vote,""Paul, Newcastle-under-Lyme ""Was there any evidence to suggest that tactical voting also played a part in the demise of the Conservative majority?  Were voters were more likely to vote for their second choice party if it meant stopping a Tory candidate from winning their constituency?  Clearly this could have been a case in constituencies where non-contest agreements were forged e.g. Brighton Pavilion (Caroline Lucas), and in Twickenham where there was an absence of any campaign leaflets from any parties other than Lib Dems and Conservatives,""John, London I am surprised by your list of reasons for the Conservative election results. For me this is very much about Brexit and Theresa May's stance. She was a remainer but since being elected has used a rhetoric which concerns much of the UK population. So this result is a protest against hard Brexit which will damage the UK economy beyond repair. It is also the young peoples's recognition that their vote matters. Had they voted in the referendum the result would have been remain, and they are angry and want their voices heard,Louise, Hampshire ""The media, including the BBC, displayed an attitude of sneering contempt towards Jeremy Corbyn ever since he was elected Labour Party leader right up to the recent election campaign.

"This video can not be played One eyewitness said he saw people blinking lights within the building At least six people have died after a huge fire raged through the night at a west London 24-storey tower block, and police expect that number to rise. Eyewitnesses described people trapped in the burning Grenfell Tower, in north Kensington, screaming for help and yelling for their children to be saved. Firefighters, who rescued many people, were called at 00:54 BST and are still trying to put out the fire. Police say there may still be people in the building who are unaccounted for. The ambulance service said 68 patients had been taken to six hospitals across London, with 18 in critical care. A further 10 patients made their own way to hospital. During the night, eyewitnesses said they saw lights - thought to be mobile phones or torches - flashing at the top of the block of flats, and trapped residents coming to their windows - some holding children. It is understood that ""several hundred"" people would have been in the block when the fire broke out shortly after midnight, most of them sleeping. This video can not be played Mickey, a resident of Grenfell Tower: 'It was like a horror movie' Commander Stuart Cundy, of the Metropolitan Police, said the recovery operation would be ""complex and lengthy"", and the number of fatalities was expected to rise. He declined to give any details of the number of people who may be missing. He said it was likely to be some time before police could identify the victims, adding that it was too early to speculate on the cause of the fire. An emergency number - 0800 0961 233 - has been set up for anyone concerned about friends or family. At 13:00 BST, Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton said firefighters expected to be on the scene for at least another 24 hours. She said there were concerns that people were still inside the tower and she urged all residents to make sure they had reported themselves to police so that the authorities know they are safe. Prime Minister Theresa May is ""deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life"", said Downing Street. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt praised the ""heroic"" response from the emergency services and the NHS hospital staff ""working tirelessly to help"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to demand a government statement in Parliament on Thursday on the tragedy, the BBC understands. There must be a ""full inquiry"" into the fire, newly-elected Kensington MP Emma Dent Coad told the BBC. Speaking outside the Rugby Portobello Trust emergency centre, the Labour MP said the fire was ""absolutely appalling"". ""The ferocity of that fire was extraordinary and terrifying,"" she said. ""This must never happen again."" Police and fire minister Nick Hurd was due to chair a cross-party meeting to look at how the government can assist the emergency services and local authorities. This video can not be played David Benjamin says he was woken by a neighbour banging on the door Paul Munakr, who lives on the seventh floor, managed to escape. ""As I was going down the stairs, there were firefighters, truly amazing firefighters that were actually going upstairs, to the fire, trying to get as many people out the building as possible,"" he told the BBC. He said he was alerted to the fire not by fire alarms but by people on the street below, shouting ""don't jump, don't jump"". Eyewitness Jody Martin said: ""I watched one person falling out, I watched another woman holding her baby out the window... hearing screams. ""I was yelling at everyone to get down and they were saying 'We can't leave our apartments, the smoke is too bad on the corridors.'"" What we know so far Baby caught after being 'dropped to safety from tower' Latest updates as crews work on building Pictures from the scene Residents raised fire risk fears Michael Paramasivan, who lives on the seventh floor with his girlfriend and young daughter, said he ignored official advice to stay in your home. ""If we had stayed in that flat, we would've perished.  My gut instinct told me just to get the girls out. I wrapped the little one up because of the smoke and I just got them out."" Another resident, Zoe, who lives on the fourth floor, said she was woken by a neighbour banging on her door. ""The whole landing was thick with smoke. The smoke alarms weren't going off but the way it spread so quickly from the fourth floor, all the way up to the 23rd floor was scary."" Mirna, Fatima and Zainnb are among those missing By Lucy Manning, BBC News They have lost their homes and for some, tragically their relatives. At times there is the sound of sobbing as the word goes round that someone is missing, someone is feared dead. I've spent the day inside the community centre where survivors have gathered. Downstairs in the hall families sit at tables and wait for news. One family told me they hadn't heard from their brother, sister and three children - Mirna, Fatima and Zainnb. Other relatives were out searching hospitals. There was still no news. Outside the centre, Sawsan was with a group of women. For one it was too much, she was on the floor crying. Sawsan hasn't heard from her mum, sister, brother-in-law and nieces. She spoke to them when the fire started but nothing since. Inside the centre, families are being helped with food, housing and medical treatment. It's busy and everyone is helping. Just not with the one thing they need - information about whether their relatives are safe. Christabel told me how lucky her father had been. He tried to fight the fire but made it out alive. Ed was saved when a friend called him to tell him to get out the building. ""I'm lucky"" he says. But they have lost everything. Grenfell Tower, built in 1974, is part of the Lancaster West Estate, a sprawling inner-city social housing complex of almost 1,000 homes. Robert Black, chief executive of the tower's management company, the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, said: ""The fire at Grenfell Tower is devastating and the reports of injury and losses of life absolutely heartbreaking. ""Along with my colleagues, I have been supporting residents since the early hours, working with the emergency services and the community."" The BBC's Andy Moore, who was at the scene through the night, described watching debris falling from the building, and hearing explosions and breaking glass. London fire crews said it was a ""large and very serious incident"" There are 120 flats in the residential block The London Fire Brigade said a structural engineer had checked the building and determined it was not in danger of collapse and that rescue teams were safe to be inside. Initially, it was feared that the building, which appears to be gutted, could collapse. Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was devastated by the horrific scenes, attended by more than 250 firefighters and 100 ambulance medics. Questions will need to be answered over the safety of tower blocks, he told BBC Radio. ""We can't have a situation where people's safety is put at risk because of bad advice being given or if it is the case, as has been alleged, of tower blocks not being properly serviced or maintained,"" he said. Matt Wrack, of the Fire Brigades Union said something had clearly gone badly wrong with fire prevention procedures at the building. Firefighters would normally fight a fire in a tower block from the inside, going up the fire escape, and fighting using the internal dry-rising mains, he said, but that's not been possible in this case. Construction firm Rydon said recent building work which it carried out on the block ""met all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards"". Refurbishment work completed in 2016 included more residential areas in the four lower 'podium' levels Appeals are being made on social media for news of missing friends and relatives, who might have been caught in the blaze. Emergency rest centres have opened for those now homeless at Latymer Community Centre, St Clement's Church, Harrow Club and Rugby Portobello Trust. There are also local collections under way for spare clothes, toys, blankets and toiletries. People are being advised by police to stay away from the area, where roads remain closed and nearby residents have been evacuated as a precaution. The London Fire Brigade said a structural engineer had checked the building More than 70 people have received treatment in hospital Smoke could be seen from miles away Grenfell Tower underwent a two-year Â£10m refurbishment as part of a wider transformation of the estate, that was completed last year. Work included new exterior cladding and a communal heating system. The 24-storey tower, containing about 120 flats, is managed by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO) on behalf of the council. Before and during the refurbishment, the localGrenfell Action Group,externalclaimed that the block constituted a fire risk and residents warned that site access for emergency vehicles was ""severely restricted"". Construction firm Rydon, which carried out the refurbishment, said it was ""shocked to hear of the devastating fire"" and added that the work ""met all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards"". Council leader Nick Paget-Brown said the buildings were regularly inspected, but a ""thorough investigation"" was needed. Read more onsafety concerns here.

"The ex-PM campaigned to remain in the EU in last year's referendum Theresa May will have to ""listen to other parties"" as she reviews her Brexit strategy in the wake of the election, David Cameron has said. The Financial Times,externalreported the former PM saying there would be pressure for a ""softer"" exit from the EU after his party did not win an election majority. Speaking in Poland, he said his successor should ""consult more widely"" both inside Parliament and beyond. It comes as Mrs May tries to seal a deal with the DUP to govern. Downing Street has so far rebuffed calls for major changes to its Brexit blueprint and ruled out the prospect of cross-party talks ahead of the start of official negotiations with the EU next week. Speaking in Paris after meeting French President Emmanuel Macron, Mrs May said there was a ""unity of purpose"" to get on with the process, reiterating that she wanted to maintain a ""close relationship"" with the EU. What are the Brexit options? Gove says Brexit 'consensus' needed Reality Check: Has the election changed EU views of Brexit? She is currently trying to negotiate the terms of a deal with the Democratic Unionists that will give her a majority in the Commons and enable her to pass a Queen's Speech - in which Brexit legislation will figure prominently. The Conservatives are having to seek a guarantee of support from the Northern Ireland party after failing to win enough seats to govern on their own. The two sides will continue what sources have described as ""positive"" talks on Wednesday, with the expectation that an agreement on a so-called ""confidence and supply agreement"" is imminent. Amid calls from opposition MPs for a rethink on Brexit, ministers have pointed out that the Conservative and Labour leaderships both agree that the UK needs to leave the single market to end free movement. But the PM is facing growing calls for other options to be put back on the agenda, including potentially remaining in the customs union, accepting a transitional role for the European Court of Justice, ruling out leaving without a deal and seeking some concessions on immigration. This video can not be played Prominent Vote Leave campaigner Gisela Stuart tells BBC Radio 4's Today party leaders need to come together According to the Financial Times,,externalMr Cameron, who campaigned for a Remain vote and quit after losing the referendum, told a business conference in Lodz the Tories' failure to win a majority had changed the outlook. ""It's going to be difficult, there's no doubt about that, but perhaps an opportunity to consult more widely with the other parties on how best we can achieve it,"" he said. ""Over Brexit, she is going to have to talk more widely, listen to other parties."" He said there would be pressure from Ruth Davidson's new group of Scottish Conservative MPs - 13 of whom were elected to Parliament - to revisit aspects of Brexit to place greater emphasis on economic considerations. This video can not be played Macron: 'Of course the door is always open' ""There's no doubt that there is a new player on the stage. Scotland voted against Brexit. I think most of the Scottish Conservatives will want to see perhaps some changes with the policy going forward."" Leading Brexiteers in the government have insisted that there will no U-turn on the single market and they remain hopeful of getting a deal that will secure the maximum market access. Steve Baker, a Eurosceptic backbencher who has been made a minister in the Brexit department, said his aim was as ""softest exit consistent with actually leaving and controlling laws, money, borders and trade"". The Times is reporting that Chancellor Philip Hammond is pushing for the UK to remain in the customs union to minimise the impact of withdrawal on trade. Labour MP Hilary Benn, who is seeking re-election as chair of the Brexit select committee, told BBC's Newsnight this was ""the first and clearest sensible step to take"" to support business. Speaking on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron said the possibility of the UK remaining in the EU remained an option until Brexit negotiations have concluded. Both the Conservatives and Labour have categorically ruled this option out. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke said that the French President was ""wrong"" and that the UK was now destined to leave the EU. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the British people had expressed a clear view last year that uncontrolled immigration from the EU must come to an end. He tweeted: ""Westminster politicians are positioning for a 'soft Brexit'. That would mean the continuation of open borders."" But Lib Dem leader Tim Farron, whose party has proposed a cross party joint cabinet committee on Brexit, said Mr Macron's comments ""show there is a chance for the British people to reject a bad Brexit deal and stay in the EU if that is what they decide"". As the PM fights to regain the initiative after her election setback, a former colleague of hers has warned the Conservatives are on ""death row"" and face ""years of opposition"" if they don't broaden their appeal. In an article for the Sun,external, Robert Halfon - who was sacked as a skills minister on Tuesday - said the party's manifesto had been ""devoid of ideas"" to help working families burdened by years of austerity. Among other ideas, he said the party should change its name to the Conservative Workers Party and develop a campaigning arm along the lines of Momentum or Vote Leave.

"A series of attacks in Europe over the summer months has raised the number of people killed in the West by jihadists during the past three years to more than 420, writes Dr Lorenzo Vidino. The deaths of 16 people in Barcelona and Cambrils earlier this month highlighted the continued threat posed by Islamist militants. The summer months have also seen new attacks inBelgium,France,Austria,external,Germanyandthe UK, as well as the first inFinlandand one inthe US. Although the vastmajority of Islamist attacks are elsewhere in the world, an unprecedented number have taken place in Europe and North America since thedeclaration of a ""caliphate"" by the so-called Islamic State, in June 2014. Thefirst look at the data behind the attacks,external- everything from the age of the perpetrators, to immigration status - offers an insight into those responsible and how they might be tackled. We identified 63 attacks between September 2014 and late August 2017 that we considered to be acts of jihadist terrorism. A relatively limited number of countries were affected: nine in Europe - those named above, plusDenmarkandSweden- along with the US and Canada. Flowers and a flag left near the Orlando nightclub where an Islamist gunman killed 49 people in June 2016 Regardless of country, most attacks were in large towns and cities - including Barcelona, London, Manchester, Paris, Nice, Berlin, Brussels, Stockholm and Orlando. A few attacks hit iconic targets, such as theChamps-Elyseesand theLouvre museumin Paris,Westminster in LondonandLas Ramblas in Barcelona. Many others targeted crowded spaces such as busy pedestrian areas, entertainment venues or transport hubs. But some terrorist attacks have hit more unusual places, including anoffice Christmas partyand aservice at a church. We looked at attacks motivated by jihadist ideology, that involved deliberate acts of violence against other people and were intended to intimidate or convey a message to a larger group. Other organisations use different definitions. Researchers used open-source material and interviews with officials It is possible that some attacks did not come to our attention, or that full details are not available The research covers the US, Canada and the 28 member states of the EU, plus Norway and Switzerland Attacks motivated by other ideologies - such asthe murder of Jo Cox- are not included in this study In total, the 63 attacks caused 424 deaths and left almost 1,800 people injured. The perpetrators are not included in these figures. TheParis attack of November 2015was the deadliest, with 130 people killed, including90 at the Bataclan theatre. France also saw theNice lorry attack, which left 86 people dead. 14 July 2016: A lorry ploughed into a crowd in the French Riviera town of Nice There were many other attacks that left many people dead and others injured. InOrlando, 49 people were killedin an attack on a gay nightclub Bombings atBrussels airport and at a metro stationleft 32 people dead 14 people were killed at aChristmas party in San Bernardino, California 12 people died when a lorry was driven into a crowdedChristmas market in Berlin 12 people died when the Paris offices ofCharlie Hebdowere attacked in January 2015 Five people were killed in theWestminster attackin April TheManchester Arena bombingin May led to 22 deaths TheLondon Bridge attackin June left eight people dead The attacks inBarcelona and Cambrilsleft 16 people dead In total, these 11 attacks were responsible for 386 deaths. However, most of the attacks did not cause casualties, with the exclusion of the perpetrators. Although thenumber of young people being radicalised has caused concern, the average age of the attackers - 27.5 - is not unusually young. The two youngest were 15 - an unnamed boywho attacked a Jewish teacher with a machetein Marseille, and Safia S,a girl who stabbed a police officerat a Hannover train station. Of the five who were under the age of 18 at the time, four were in Germany. The vast majority of the attackers were in their 20s, with about one in four attackers above the age of 30 and six aged 40 or older. The oldest suspect, Mohamed H Khalid, was 54 when he was accused of stabbing to death anelderly couple in the Austrian city of Linz,external. In the UK,Khalid Masood, was 52 when he drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and stabbed to death a police officer at the Houses of Parliament. Despitewomen becoming increasingly active in jihadist networks, only two out of 85 individual perpetrators were female. Fewer than one in five perpetrators was a convert to Islam, with a significantly higher percentage in North America than in Europe. However, the converts were significantly more likely to have a criminal background and to have served time in prison. Overall, half of the attackers had a prior criminal background. How can police stop terror suspects travelling? Is terror more of a threat to Europe than before? Terror deaths in Western Europe at highest level since 2004 Can you monitor every suspect? The relationship between terrorism and migration is a complex one and has been at the centre of extremely polarising debates, particularly during theEuropean migrant crisis. However, the number of attackers who were illegally in a country or who arrived as refugees is small. Two-thirds were citizens of the country they attacked, with others either legal residents, or legal visitors from neighbouring countries. However, individuals who were in the West illegally also carried out deadly attacks. November 2015: Tributes left in Paris following attacks that left 130 people dead At least two of those involved in the November 2015 Paris attacks arethought to have posed as refugeesto enter Europe through Greece. Three other individuals were refugees or asylum seekers at the time of attack, while seven were in the country illegally or awaiting deportation. The latter group includes Uzbek nationalRakhmat Akilov, who killed four people with a hijacked lorry in Stockholm in April 2017, and Tunisian citizenAnis Amri, who also used a lorry to commit his attack at the Berlin Christmas market. Wreckage from an attack on a Berlin Christmas market, December 2016 There is also one case of ""terrorist tourism"", involving Egyptian citizenAbdullah Hamamy, who lived in the United Arab Emirates and attacked soldiers at the Louvre in February 2017. Two of the four most lethal attacks - those in Paris in November 2015 and in Brussels in 2016 - are believed to bewell orchestrated multiple attacks directed by IS,external. 22 March 2016: A security guard helps a wounded woman after the attack on the Brussels metro system They were also executed in part by former foreign fighters. However, the two other most deadly attacks - those in Orlando in June 2016 and in Nice in July 2016 - were carried out independently by individuals without operational connection to a jihadist group. These episodes demonstrate that terrorist sympathisers who never travelled to conflict areas and who act independently can be as dangerous as a team of highly trained militants. Overall, links between attackers and jihadist groups operating overseas are not always easy to determine. Of the attacks that have hit the West since June 2014, fewer than one in 10 was carried out under direct orders from the leadership of IS. In some cases it can be difficult to tell, for example IS said it was behind both the Las Ramblas and Cambrils attacks, but it did not provide any evidence. Nevertheless, the influence of IS can be clearly seen. During or before the attack, six out of 10 perpetrators pledged allegiance to a jihadist group, almost always IS - which frequently claims responsibility. Unsurprisingly, given the frequency of attacks and the number of deaths and injuries, jihadist terrorism has come to the fore of political debates in the West and receives widespread news coverage. The threat is not expected to wane in the near future, with policymakers, counter-terrorism officials and the public all being asked to take action. 22 March 2017: Westminster Bridge following a terror attack There are huge implications for domestic and foreign policy throughout Western countries. It is hoped that knowing more about the attacks and the people who carried them out will help us all have a more informed debate about what action is needed.

"People over 75 taking daily aspirin after a stroke or heart attack are at higher risk of major - and sometimes fatal - stomach bleeds than previously thought, research in the Lancet shows. Scientists say that, to reduce these risks, older people should also take stomach-protecting PPI pills. But they insist aspirin has important benefits - such as preventing heart attacks - that outweigh the risks. And they warn that stopping aspirin suddenly can be harmful. Anyone with concerns should speak to a doctor before considering changing medication, they say. Doctors in the UK generally prescribe daily aspirin (75mg) for life after a person has a stroke or heart attack to help prevent more attacks. But researchers have known for some time that aspirin can increase the risk of stomach bleeds. Until now, most research involved people under 75, showing that the risk of serious bleeds was low in this group. But with around half the people on lifelong aspirin in the UK now over 75, researchers at Oxford University decided to find out whether the benefits still outweigh the risks in this group. Their study followed 3,166 patients who had previously had a stroke or heart attack and were prescribed aspirin or similar blood-thinning drugs. They found that, for patients aged under 65, the annual rate of disabling or fatal bleeds was less than 0.5% (around one person in every 200 people taking the medication). Meanwhile, for people aged 75 to 84, this rose to three people having major bleeds in every 200. And the risks of fatal or disabling bleeds continued to increase with age. Lead researcher Prof Peter Rothwell said: ""Our new study gives us a much clearer understanding of the size of the increased risk and the severity and consequences of bleeds in over-75s. ""Our findings raise questions about the balance of risk and benefit of long-term daily aspirin use in people aged 75 or over if a PPI drug is not co-prescribed."" Dr Tim Chico, heart specialist at the University of Sheffield, described the work as a well-conducted study. He said: ""Although bleeding is a well-recognised side-effect of aspirin, this drug is still seen by many people as harmless, perhaps because of how easily it can be bought over the counter."" Meanwhile, GP leader Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, said: ""The study does reassure us that, in most cases, aspirin is still the most appropriate course of treatment for patients, but highlights the importance of managing its use carefully and effectively and that some patients may require additional medication to protect them."" But she added: ""It is helpful that the researchers suggest action to mitigate this risk - the prescription of a PPI as a secondary drug - but this does raise a number of health implications. ""It will continue to be necessary to make decisions on a case-by-case basis, considering the patient's unique circumstances and medical history."" Current guidelines in the UK recommend people at ""high risk"" are given a PPI (proton pump inhibitor) drug which protects the stomach, along with aspirin therapy. But who exactly is at high risk is not specified. And Prof Rothwell says the majority of over-75s are not prescribed the drug. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, head of the Royal College of GPs, says: ""Patients who regularly take aspirin either as prescribed by their doctor or self-medicated, should not panic as a result of this research. ""But if they are concerned about taking the drug regularly, over a long period of time, they should make a non-urgent appointment with their GP, or discuss this with their local pharmacist."" Stopping aspirin suddenly has been shown to have a rebound effect - increasing the chance of heart attack, TIA and stroke for weeks after the pill is stopped. Anyone who is concerned must discuss it with their doctor. If stopping is advised, doctors will discuss cutting down pills gradually. For this group a number of previous studies show that the risk of major bleeding is low. Prof Rothwell says he would not recommend a stomach-protecting drug for people of this age. But researchers recommend anyone taking the drug should review the decision with their doctor every three to five years, to make sure individual circumstances are taken into account. Researchers say the decision for a healthy individual to take aspirin must be considered very carefully and the benefits and risks to the individual must be discussed with a doctor. Dr Tim Chico added: ""I would strongly recommend that people who are considering taking aspirin to prevent potential future problems such as cancer or heart attack (but who have not had a stroke or heart attack) should discuss this with their doctor."" All drugs have risks and benefits and the decision to take them must be made after weighing these up for the individual. When it comes to PPIs the side-effects can include flatulence, bloating and sometimes stomach infections.

"This video can not be played One eyewitness said he saw people blinking lights within the building At least six people have died after a huge fire raged through the night at a west London 24-storey tower block, and police expect that number to rise. Eyewitnesses described people trapped in the burning Grenfell Tower, in north Kensington, screaming for help and yelling for their children to be saved. Firefighters, who rescued many people, were called at 00:54 BST and are still trying to put out the fire. Police say there may still be people in the building who are unaccounted for. The ambulance service said 68 patients had been taken to six hospitals across London, with 18 in critical care. A further 10 patients made their own way to hospital. During the night, eyewitnesses said they saw lights - thought to be mobile phones or torches - flashing at the top of the block of flats, and trapped residents coming to their windows - some holding children. It is understood that ""several hundred"" people would have been in the block when the fire broke out shortly after midnight, most of them sleeping. This video can not be played Mickey, a resident of Grenfell Tower: 'It was like a horror movie' Commander Stuart Cundy, of the Metropolitan Police, said the recovery operation would be ""complex and lengthy"", and the number of fatalities was expected to rise. He declined to give any details of the number of people who may be missing. He said it was likely to be some time before police could identify the victims, adding that it was too early to speculate on the cause of the fire. An emergency number - 0800 0961 233 - has been set up for anyone concerned about friends or family. At 13:00 BST, Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton said firefighters expected to be on the scene for at least another 24 hours. She said there were concerns that people were still inside the tower and she urged all residents to make sure they had reported themselves to police so that the authorities know they are safe. Prime Minister Theresa May is ""deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life"", said Downing Street. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt praised the ""heroic"" response from the emergency services and the NHS hospital staff ""working tirelessly to help"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to demand a government statement in Parliament on Thursday on the tragedy, the BBC understands. There must be a ""full inquiry"" into the fire, newly-elected Kensington MP Emma Dent Coad told the BBC. Speaking outside the Rugby Portobello Trust emergency centre, the Labour MP said the fire was ""absolutely appalling"". ""The ferocity of that fire was extraordinary and terrifying,"" she said. ""This must never happen again."" Police and fire minister Nick Hurd was due to chair a cross-party meeting to look at how the government can assist the emergency services and local authorities. This video can not be played David Benjamin says he was woken by a neighbour banging on the door Paul Munakr, who lives on the seventh floor, managed to escape. ""As I was going down the stairs, there were firefighters, truly amazing firefighters that were actually going upstairs, to the fire, trying to get as many people out the building as possible,"" he told the BBC. He said he was alerted to the fire not by fire alarms but by people on the street below, shouting ""don't jump, don't jump"". Eyewitness Jody Martin said: ""I watched one person falling out, I watched another woman holding her baby out the window... hearing screams. ""I was yelling at everyone to get down and they were saying 'We can't leave our apartments, the smoke is too bad on the corridors.'""

""If we had stayed in that flat, we would've perished.  My gut instinct told me just to get the girls out. I wrapped the little one up because of the smoke and I just got them out."" Another resident, Zoe, who lives on the fourth floor, said she was woken by a neighbour banging on her door. ""The whole landing was thick with smoke. The smoke alarms weren't going off but the way it spread so quickly from the fourth floor, all the way up to the 23rd floor was scary."" Mirna, Fatima and Zainnb are among those missing By Lucy Manning, BBC News They have lost their homes and for some, tragically their relatives. At times there is the sound of sobbing as the word goes round that someone is missing, someone is feared dead. I've spent the day inside the community centre where survivors have gathered. Downstairs in the hall families sit at tables and wait for news. One family told me they hadn't heard from their brother, sister and three children - Mirna, Fatima and Zainnb. Other relatives were out searching hospitals. There was still no news. Outside the centre, Sawsan was with a group of women. For one it was too much, she was on the floor crying. Sawsan hasn't heard from her mum, sister, brother-in-law and nieces. She spoke to them when the fire started but nothing since. Inside the centre, families are being helped with food, housing and medical treatment. It's busy and everyone is helping. Just not with the one thing they need - information about whether their relatives are safe. Christabel told me how lucky her father had been. He tried to fight the fire but made it out alive. Ed was saved when a friend called him to tell him to get out the building. ""I'm lucky"" he says. But they have lost everything. Grenfell Tower, built in 1974, is part of the Lancaster West Estate, a sprawling inner-city social housing complex of almost 1,000 homes. Robert Black, chief executive of the tower's management company, the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, said: ""The fire at Grenfell Tower is devastating and the reports of injury and losses of life absolutely heartbreaking. ""Along with my colleagues, I have been supporting residents since the early hours, working with the emergency services and the community."" The BBC's Andy Moore, who was at the scene through the night, described watching debris falling from the building, and hearing explosions and breaking glass. London fire crews said it was a ""large and very serious incident"" There are 120 flats in the residential block The London Fire Brigade said a structural engineer had checked the building and determined it was not in danger of collapse and that rescue teams were safe to be inside. Initially, it was feared that the building, which appears to be gutted, could collapse. Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was devastated by the horrific scenes, attended by more than 250 firefighters and 100 ambulance medics. Questions will need to be answered over the safety of tower blocks, he told BBC Radio. ""We can't have a situation where people's safety is put at risk because of bad advice being given or if it is the case, as has been alleged, of tower blocks not being properly serviced or maintained,"" he said. Matt Wrack, of the Fire Brigades Union said something had clearly gone badly wrong with fire prevention procedures at the building. Firefighters would normally fight a fire in a tower block from the inside, going up the fire escape, and fighting using the internal dry-rising mains, he said, but that's not been possible in this case. Construction firm Rydon said recent building work which it carried out on the block ""met all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards"". Refurbishment work completed in 2016 included more residential areas in the four lower 'podium' levels Appeals are being made on social media for news of missing friends and relatives, who might have been caught in the blaze. Emergency rest centres have opened for those now homeless at Latymer Community Centre, St Clement's Church, Harrow Club and Rugby Portobello Trust. There are also local collections under way for spare clothes, toys, blankets and toiletries. People are being advised by police to stay away from the area, where roads remain closed and nearby residents have been evacuated as a precaution. The London Fire Brigade said a structural engineer had checked the building More than 70 people have received treatment in hospital Smoke could be seen from miles away Grenfell Tower underwent a two-year Â£10m refurbishment as part of a wider transformation of the estate, that was completed last year. Work included new exterior cladding and a communal heating system. The 24-storey tower, containing about 120 flats, is managed by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO) on behalf of the council. Before and during the refurbishment, the localGrenfell Action Group,externalclaimed that the block constituted a fire risk and residents warned that site access for emergency vehicles was ""severely restricted"". Construction firm Rydon, which carried out the refurbishment, said it was ""shocked to hear of the devastating fire"" and added that the work ""met all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards"". Council leader Nick Paget-Brown said the buildings were regularly inspected, but a ""thorough investigation"" was needed. Read more onsafety concerns here.

"One in 10 clients of a debt charity have no bed to sleep in and eight in 10 say their financial situation leads to sleepless nights. A review of visitors to Christians Against Poverty also found that three-quarters of them were afraid to open their post. The charity said that the survey exposed the day-to-day realities of living with unmanageable debt. The average debt of new clients seeking help last year was Â£14,298. Among the practical effects of debt identified by the charity were: A third of clients having gone without at least one essential item, such as a washing machine, causing inconvenience and extra cost by visiting laundrettes and other services A fifth of those asked had rented or bought at least one item on hire purchase A fifth had no internet access, blocking them from cheaper deals on utilities such as energy Some 91% of clients had used some form of credit to pay an essential bill or other debt. This money was borrowed primarily from friends and family (64%), and credit cards (64%) followed by overdrafts (55%). ""This is an unsustainable solution that pushes the financial crunch point further down the line, but escalates the level of debt when this happens,"" the charity's annual review found. ""Shame, fear and believing no one can help cause clients to delay seeking help for two years on average. This extended period of financial hardship and worry sees living standards and mental health deteriorate as debts spiral out of control. ""This means seven in 10 end up behind with a priority bill and average debt levels hit more than Â£14,000 before clients get the help they need."" A separate survey of debt by financial services company True Potential suggested that debt tolerance was higher among men. The average debt threshold, excluding mortgages, was Â£1,797, with men reaching debts of Â£1,960 before recognising it as a problem, compared with Â£1,645 among women. Adults under 25 reached Â£748 of debt before worries set in, compared with a figure of Â£2,299 among 45 to 54-year-olds. ""Personal debt is the elephant in the room. Consumer confidence and spending have been creeping up but there is growing concern that it is built on quicksand in the shape of rising individual debts. Underpinning this is easy access to debt, the costs of which are poorly understood,"" said managing partner David Harrison. ""But this is not just about people splashing cash they don't have. A big worry is the proportion of people needing debt just to get by. That's a bubble waiting to burst. The cost of living is 2.7% higher today compared to a year ago, adding an extra Â£468 to household bills."" In its report, Christians Against Poverty highlights the story of one of the charity's clients - Mark. ""My situation went downhill when my mental state deteriorated. I became anxious and depressed. I lost interest in life,"" he says. ""My studio flat fell into disrepair. It was dusty, dirty, full of broken furniture. The boiler didn't work. I slept on the floor. The bathroom pipes were broken and the floor was covered in rotting clothes. It was in an appalling state. I couldn't deal with the wreckage. ""I approached a number of services for help, but I never quite seemed to fit the category. I wasn't ill enough for one group, I wasn't drinking enough for another. So they kept referring me on and I became socially isolated. ""I had difficulties paying my mortgage, and I was in no position to work to earn the money to pay what I owed. It's fair to say I didn't know what my options were. I wondered if I'd be evicted and made homeless, if I'd have to kill myself. I wondered if I'd have to commit a crime so I could go to jail instead."" He says that the charity helped him start applying for jobs, to begin sorting out his debts and to put his flat on the market to avoid repossession. The City regulator - the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) - and the Bank of England have warned of an acceleration in consumer borrowing, such as loans, overdrafts, credit card debt and car finance. The FCA is already conducting is own inquiry into overdrafts, door-to-door lending and other forms of loans. Consumer groups have consistently argued there should be an overdraft cap in place. A Lords committee also recently called for stronger controls such as a cap on ""rent to own"" products. On Tuesday, the Financial Ombudsman Service said it had seen a nine-fold rise in complaints about payday loans in the last two years.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says she will carefully consider what is best for all of Scotland Scotland's first minister has branded speculation about the impact of the general election on her plans for an independence referendum as ""nonsense"". In a series of tweets, Nicola Sturgeon said she would set out the way forward ""in due course after talking to people across the SNP"". And she insisted she would take decisions in the best interests of Scotland, and not just her party. She later faced calls at Holyrood later to abandon her plans for a referendum. Opposition MSPs used a debate on the economy to argue that the continuing prospect of another referendum independence would cause damaging uncertainty for businesses - but their motions calling for it to be shelved were defeated in a vote. Scottish government ministers, whodid not discuss an independence referendumin their first cabinet meeting since the election, argued that the main threat to the economy is Brexit. Live election latest Ms Sturgeon attended a meeting on SNP MSPs in the Scottish Parliament ahead of the debate on Wednesday afternoon. She haswritten a letter to the prime minister,externalin which she argues that new Brexit proposals are ""urgently needed"" to end the ""confusion surrounding the UK's position"" with less than a week to go until talks with the EU are due to begin. She repeats her calls for Scotland and the UK to remain in both the single market and the customs union, for the UK's devolved administrations to be involved in the Brexit negotiating team, and for the rights of EU citizens living in the UK to be guaranteed. She says that the Scottish government'sScotland's Place in Europe document, which was published in December, provides a blueprint for the way forward for the whole of the UK. Ms Sturgeon has previously said she will ""reflect carefully"" on her plans for an independence referendum after the SNP lost 21 seats in the general election, but has conceded that her call for a second vote on leaving the UKwas a factor in the result. In March, she called for a referendum to be held either towards the end of next year or the spring of the following year, ""when the terms of Brexit are known"", but it was rejected by the UK government. But there have been reports since the election that Ms Sturgeon wasplanning to ""rebrand"" the independence referendum,externalas a vote on the finalised UK Brexit deal. SNP MEP Alyn Smith told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme on Wednesday morning that any future referendum ""would be on the terms of Brexit set against independence"". A short time later, the first minister tweeted that much of the media speculation about the implications of the election result for her referendum plans was ""nonsense"". She added: ""I'll set out way forward in due course after talking to people across @theSNP. ""I'll take decisions in best interests, not just of @theSNP, but of Scotland...and not be dictated to by demands for quick headlines!"" She went on to say that her government would focus on trying to influence Brexit talks - and repeated her claim that a ""Tory led hard Brexit is simply not acceptable"" in the wake of the election result. Ms Sturgeon later told BBC Scotland that she would not be ""rushed into knee-jerk decisions"" on a referendum, and that the immediate focus should be on the forthcoming Brexit negotiations. Will the SNP abandon independence? No. Will they abandon a referendum as the conduit through which independence is achieved? Absolutely not. So what are they doing? Well, they may need to change the nature of the language. I think they feel that they didn't get across sufficiently the point that the referendum they want on independence is at the end of the Brexit process. They kept saying: ""When the prime minister says there shouldn't be a referendum now, we agree"". So I think they will try and re-emphasise that. That will not be sufficient for their pro-Union opponents, who will say they don't care how it is rebranded or that it is being placed in contradistinction to Brexit - it is not wanted and it is not needed. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who saw the number of Scottish Tory MPs rise from one to 13, has claimed that the SNP's losses in the election meant that ""Indyref2 is dead"". Her party has accused Ms Sturgeon of having ""given up representing Scotland and is now focused solely on her discredited and unwanted plan to drag us back to a second referendum"" and of ""turning a tin ear to everyone outside the SNP who just want a break from her political games"". And Labour said that Scotland ""won't be fooled by Nicola Sturgeon's desperate plan to rebrand her divisive referendum"". In what was first formal chance for MSPs to debate the general election result, the Tories, Labour and Liberal Democrats  called on the SNP to shelve plans for another referendum. The Holyrood debate on ""opportunities for growth"" followed publication of the State of the Economy report by the Scottish government's chief economist. The report confirmed growth overall in Scotland during 2016 of 0.4%, which was ""below trend and expectation"". The oil and gas sector downturn continued to affect the economy last year, though there are emerging signs of confidence returning to the industry, the report found. Ruth Davidson has insisted that plans for a second independence referendum were now ""dead"" Meanwhile, Scotland's labour market has ""remained resilient"", with unemployment below the UK figure and falling over the past year. The report states: ""Brexit continues to present a significant risk,externalto business and consumer sentiment in Scotland with investment sensitive to changing market signals. ""It also presents the greatest source of uncertainty for the outlook particularly beyond 2018. The range of independent forecasts for 2017 suggest growth of between 0.9% and 1.3% for Scotland."" Economy Secretary Keith Brown said there was no doubt that the dip in oil and gas prices in recent years has had ""a continuing effect on the Scottish economy"". The minister said uncertainty around Brexit was the main concern for business leaders, while the ""very rapid"" depreciation in the price of oil and gas has had a major effect. But Mr Brown said there were signs of returning confidence and development activity in the North Sea, and pointed out that Scotland now has a lower unemployment rate than the UK as a whole. He told the Good Morning Scotland programme: ""What we are now seeing with Brexit is the push up in inflation, the impact that is having on people's lives in terms of wages. ""So that's the challenge we have now - but we have kept many people in employment throughout the recession and subsequent Brexit uncertainty.""

London fire crews said it was a ""large and very serious incident"" There are 120 flats in the residential block The London Fire Brigade said a structural engineer had checked the building and determined it was not in danger of collapse and that rescue teams were safe to be inside. Initially, it was feared that the building, which appears to be gutted, could collapse. Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was devastated by the horrific scenes, attended by more than 250 firefighters and 100 ambulance medics. Questions will need to be answered over the safety of tower blocks, he told BBC Radio. ""We can't have a situation where people's safety is put at risk because of bad advice being given or if it is the case, as has been alleged, of tower blocks not being properly serviced or maintained,"" he said. Matt Wrack, of the Fire Brigades Union said something had clearly gone badly wrong with fire prevention procedures at the building. Firefighters would normally fight a fire in a tower block from the inside, going up the fire escape, and fighting using the internal dry-rising mains, he said, but that's not been possible in this case. Construction firm Rydon said recent building work which it carried out on the block ""met all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards"". Refurbishment work completed in 2016 included more residential areas in the four lower 'podium' levels Appeals are being made on social media for news of missing friends and relatives, who might have been caught in the blaze. Emergency rest centres have opened for those now homeless at Latymer Community Centre, St Clement's Church, Harrow Club and Rugby Portobello Trust. There are also local collections under way for spare clothes, toys, blankets and toiletries. People are being advised by police to stay away from the area, where roads remain closed and nearby residents have been evacuated as a precaution. The London Fire Brigade said a structural engineer had checked the building More than 70 people have received treatment in hospital Smoke could be seen from miles away Grenfell Tower underwent a two-year Â£10m refurbishment as part of a wider transformation of the estate, that was completed last year. Work included new exterior cladding and a communal heating system.

"The number of migrants arriving in Italy by boat is rising The mayor of Rome, who is from the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, has asked Italy's government not to send more migrants to the city. Virginia Raggi said more arrivals could exacerbate social tension. Her call follows local elections on Sunday in which the Five Star Movement performed poorly. More than 500,000 people have arrived by boat since 2014. Nearly 200,000 are being housed in  centres across the country. ""We cannot permit the creation of more social tensions,"" Ms Raggisaid,externalon Facebook. ""That is why I am saying it is impossible, risky even, to think about creating any new reception structures."" EU leaders agree plan to stop Libya influx Greece's refugee children learn the hard way A haven from killings and kidnaps The interior ministry has asked all Italian municipalities to find space for an expected 250,000 new migrants this year, up from about 180,000 last year. Some observers say Ms Raggi is attempting to win back support by targeting migrants after her party failed to make the run-off in 24 of the main 25 cities choosing a new mayor. About half of Italians do not want the country to take in more people, pollster Renato Mannheimer told Reuters news agency. Ms Raggi's Five Star party did poorly in local elections on Sunday Italy is accommodating rising numbers of migrants because countries to the north have tightened their borders and some EU states have refused to take part in a plan to relocate 160,000 people from Italy and Greece. Just over 20,000 migrants have so far been relocated under the plan and the EU hasbegun legal actionagainst against Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for refusing to accept refugees. An estimated 40% of the migrants in Italy have a valid claim to asylum or leave to remain on humanitarian grounds, AFP news agency reported. The others are deemed to be illegal economic migrants and face deportation, but this can be difficult to arrange in practice because their countries of origin sometimes refuse to take them back. Beppe Grillo has gradually reduced his role in the party in favour of younger politicians Founded by comedian Beppe Grillo in 2009, Five Star has long campaigned against corruption in Italian politics Launched as a protest party, it is now a serious player, pushing for greater transparency in public life It wants many nationalised companies privatised or closed, a referendum on the euro and universal income support for the poor Beppe Grillo, 67, has taken a backseat in the party but still wields influence The party will compete in Italy's general election early next year A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

"Ariana Grande is seen by many as ""an honorary Mancunian"", says the leader of Manchester City Council Ariana Grande is to get honorary citizenship of Manchester under plans put forward by the city council. The council is proposing a new system to recognise outstanding contributions to the city. The US singer is in line to be the first recipient for organising the One Love Manchester concert in aid of victims of the bomb attack at her gig, in which 22 people died. An event to mark ""selfless acts"" after the blast is to be held, too. Ariana Grande performs during the One Love Manchester benefit concert Under the proposals for the new scheme, honorary citizenship of Manchester could be granted to those from outside Greater Manchester. Council leader Sir Richard Leese, said many people would already consider Grande to be ""an honorary Mancunian"". He said: ""This seems a fitting moment to update the way we recognise those who make noteworthy contributions to the life and success of our city. ""We've all had cause to be incredibly proud of Manchester and the resilient and compassionate way in which the city, and all those associated with it, have responded to the terrible events of 22 May - with love and courage rather than hatred and fear."" He said Ariana Grande had ""exemplified this response"". Some 50,000 people went to the One Love Manchester concert at Old Trafford on 4 June, which raised almost Â£3m for victims of the Manchester Arena attack. Salman Abedi, 22, detonated a home-made bomb in the arena's foyer at the end of Ariana Grande's concert. Manchester City Council has also announced it would hold an event later this year to recognise the ""great many selfless acts and demonstrations of community spirit in the aftermath of the atrocity"". The authority said there was a need for a new system of honours in addition to the rarely-awarded freedom of the city, which will remain the highest honour the city can give. The freedom of the city has only been awarded four times this century. The plans will go before the council on 12 July. Joy shines through pain at benefit gig Manchester attack: What we know so far Ariana Grande Manchester City Council Three people charged over alleged Â£1m fraud offences at car showroom LIVE: Roads shut and bomb squad called after 'suspicious package' found - latest updates Coronation Street's 'shock' exits: Who has left and who is rumoured to be leaving the cobbles in 2025 Police chief donates Â£10,000 to rape and sexual assault support centre Bury Market makes top 10 shortlist to be named 'Britain's favourite market' again Family rescued by boat in flood fear it will happen again At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"This video can not be played One eyewitness said he saw people blinking lights within the building At least six people have died after a huge fire raged through the night at a west London 24-storey tower block, and police expect that number to rise. Eyewitnesses described people trapped in the burning Grenfell Tower, in north Kensington, screaming for help and yelling for their children to be saved. Firefighters, who rescued many people, were called at 00:54 BST and are still trying to put out the fire. Police say there may still be people in the building who are unaccounted for. The ambulance service said 68 patients had been taken to six hospitals across London, with 18 in critical care. A further 10 patients made their own way to hospital. During the night, eyewitnesses said they saw lights - thought to be mobile phones or torches - flashing at the top of the block of flats, and trapped residents coming to their windows - some holding children. It is understood that ""several hundred"" people would have been in the block when the fire broke out shortly after midnight, most of them sleeping. This video can not be played Mickey, a resident of Grenfell Tower: 'It was like a horror movie' Commander Stuart Cundy, of the Metropolitan Police, said the recovery operation would be ""complex and lengthy"", and the number of fatalities was expected to rise. He declined to give any details of the number of people who may be missing. He said it was likely to be some time before police could identify the victims, adding that it was too early to speculate on the cause of the fire. An emergency number - 0800 0961 233 - has been set up for anyone concerned about friends or family. At 13:00 BST, Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton said firefighters expected to be on the scene for at least another 24 hours. She said there were concerns that people were still inside the tower and she urged all residents to make sure they had reported themselves to police so that the authorities know they are safe. Prime Minister Theresa May is ""deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life"", said Downing Street. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt praised the ""heroic"" response from the emergency services and the NHS hospital staff ""working tirelessly to help"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to demand a government statement in Parliament on Thursday on the tragedy, the BBC understands. There must be a ""full inquiry"" into the fire, newly-elected Kensington MP Emma Dent Coad told the BBC. Speaking outside the Rugby Portobello Trust emergency centre, the Labour MP said the fire was ""absolutely appalling"". ""The ferocity of that fire was extraordinary and terrifying,"" she said. ""This must never happen again."" Police and fire minister Nick Hurd was due to chair a cross-party meeting to look at how the government can assist the emergency services and local authorities. This video can not be played David Benjamin says he was woken by a neighbour banging on the door Paul Munakr, who lives on the seventh floor, managed to escape. ""As I was going down the stairs, there were firefighters, truly amazing firefighters that were actually going upstairs, to the fire, trying to get as many people out the building as possible,"" he told the BBC. He said he was alerted to the fire not by fire alarms but by people on the street below, shouting ""don't jump, don't jump"". Eyewitness Jody Martin said: ""I watched one person falling out, I watched another woman holding her baby out the window... hearing screams. ""I was yelling at everyone to get down and they were saying 'We can't leave our apartments, the smoke is too bad on the corridors.'"" What we know so far Baby caught after being 'dropped to safety from tower' Latest updates as crews work on building Pictures from the scene Residents raised fire risk fears Michael Paramasivan, who lives on the seventh floor with his girlfriend and young daughter, said he ignored official advice to stay in your home. ""If we had stayed in that flat, we would've perished.  My gut instinct told me just to get the girls out. I wrapped the little one up because of the smoke and I just got them out."" Another resident, Zoe, who lives on the fourth floor, said she was woken by a neighbour banging on her door. ""The whole landing was thick with smoke. The smoke alarms weren't going off but the way it spread so quickly from the fourth floor, all the way up to the 23rd floor was scary."" Mirna, Fatima and Zainnb are among those missing By Lucy Manning, BBC News They have lost their homes and for some, tragically their relatives. At times there is the sound of sobbing as the word goes round that someone is missing, someone is feared dead. I've spent the day inside the community centre where survivors have gathered. Downstairs in the hall families sit at tables and wait for news. One family told me they hadn't heard from their brother, sister and three children - Mirna, Fatima and Zainnb. Other relatives were out searching hospitals. There was still no news. Outside the centre, Sawsan was with a group of women. For one it was too much, she was on the floor crying. Sawsan hasn't heard from her mum, sister, brother-in-law and nieces. She spoke to them when the fire started but nothing since. Inside the centre, families are being helped with food, housing and medical treatment. It's busy and everyone is helping. Just not with the one thing they need - information about whether their relatives are safe. Christabel told me how lucky her father had been. He tried to fight the fire but made it out alive. Ed was saved when a friend called him to tell him to get out the building. ""I'm lucky"" he says. But they have lost everything. Grenfell Tower, built in 1974, is part of the Lancaster West Estate, a sprawling inner-city social housing complex of almost 1,000 homes. Robert Black, chief executive of the tower's management company, the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, said: ""The fire at Grenfell Tower is devastating and the reports of injury and losses of life absolutely heartbreaking.

"This video can not be played One eyewitness said he saw people blinking lights within the building At least six people have died after a huge fire raged through the night at a west London 24-storey tower block, and police expect that number to rise. Eyewitnesses described people trapped in the burning Grenfell Tower, in north Kensington, screaming for help and yelling for their children to be saved. Firefighters, who rescued many people, were called at 00:54 BST and are still trying to put out the fire. Police say there may still be people in the building who are unaccounted for. The ambulance service said 68 patients had been taken to six hospitals across London, with 18 in critical care. A further 10 patients made their own way to hospital. During the night, eyewitnesses said they saw lights - thought to be mobile phones or torches - flashing at the top of the block of flats, and trapped residents coming to their windows - some holding children. It is understood that ""several hundred"" people would have been in the block when the fire broke out shortly after midnight, most of them sleeping. This video can not be played Mickey, a resident of Grenfell Tower: 'It was like a horror movie' Commander Stuart Cundy, of the Metropolitan Police, said the recovery operation would be ""complex and lengthy"", and the number of fatalities was expected to rise. He declined to give any details of the number of people who may be missing. He said it was likely to be some time before police could identify the victims, adding that it was too early to speculate on the cause of the fire. An emergency number - 0800 0961 233 - has been set up for anyone concerned about friends or family. At 13:00 BST, Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton said firefighters expected to be on the scene for at least another 24 hours. She said there were concerns that people were still inside the tower and she urged all residents to make sure they had reported themselves to police so that the authorities know they are safe. Prime Minister Theresa May is ""deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life"", said Downing Street. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt praised the ""heroic"" response from the emergency services and the NHS hospital staff ""working tirelessly to help"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to demand a government statement in Parliament on Thursday on the tragedy, the BBC understands. There must be a ""full inquiry"" into the fire, newly-elected Kensington MP Emma Dent Coad told the BBC. Speaking outside the Rugby Portobello Trust emergency centre, the Labour MP said the fire was ""absolutely appalling"". ""The ferocity of that fire was extraordinary and terrifying,"" she said. ""This must never happen again."" Police and fire minister Nick Hurd was due to chair a cross-party meeting to look at how the government can assist the emergency services and local authorities. This video can not be played David Benjamin says he was woken by a neighbour banging on the door Paul Munakr, who lives on the seventh floor, managed to escape. ""As I was going down the stairs, there were firefighters, truly amazing firefighters that were actually going upstairs, to the fire, trying to get as many people out the building as possible,"" he told the BBC. He said he was alerted to the fire not by fire alarms but by people on the street below, shouting ""don't jump, don't jump"". Eyewitness Jody Martin said: ""I watched one person falling out, I watched another woman holding her baby out the window... hearing screams. ""I was yelling at everyone to get down and they were saying 'We can't leave our apartments, the smoke is too bad on the corridors.'"" What we know so far Baby caught after being 'dropped to safety from tower' Latest updates as crews work on building Pictures from the scene Residents raised fire risk fears Michael Paramasivan, who lives on the seventh floor with his girlfriend and young daughter, said he ignored official advice to stay in your home. ""If we had stayed in that flat, we would've perished.  My gut instinct told me just to get the girls out. I wrapped the little one up because of the smoke and I just got them out."" Another resident, Zoe, who lives on the fourth floor, said she was woken by a neighbour banging on her door. ""The whole landing was thick with smoke. The smoke alarms weren't going off but the way it spread so quickly from the fourth floor, all the way up to the 23rd floor was scary."" Mirna, Fatima and Zainnb are among those missing By Lucy Manning, BBC News They have lost their homes and for some, tragically their relatives. At times there is the sound of sobbing as the word goes round that someone is missing, someone is feared dead. I've spent the day inside the community centre where survivors have gathered. Downstairs in the hall families sit at tables and wait for news. One family told me they hadn't heard from their brother, sister and three children - Mirna, Fatima and Zainnb. Other relatives were out searching hospitals. There was still no news. Outside the centre, Sawsan was with a group of women. For one it was too much, she was on the floor crying. Sawsan hasn't heard from her mum, sister, brother-in-law and nieces. She spoke to them when the fire started but nothing since. Inside the centre, families are being helped with food, housing and medical treatment. It's busy and everyone is helping. Just not with the one thing they need - information about whether their relatives are safe. Christabel told me how lucky her father had been. He tried to fight the fire but made it out alive. Ed was saved when a friend called him to tell him to get out the building. ""I'm lucky"" he says. But they have lost everything. Grenfell Tower, built in 1974, is part of the Lancaster West Estate, a sprawling inner-city social housing complex of almost 1,000 homes. Robert Black, chief executive of the tower's management company, the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, said: ""The fire at Grenfell Tower is devastating and the reports of injury and losses of life absolutely heartbreaking. ""Along with my colleagues, I have been supporting residents since the early hours, working with the emergency services and the community."" The BBC's Andy Moore, who was at the scene through the night, described watching debris falling from the building, and hearing explosions and breaking glass. London fire crews said it was a ""large and very serious incident"" There are 120 flats in the residential block The London Fire Brigade said a structural engineer had checked the building and determined it was not in danger of collapse and that rescue teams were safe to be inside. Initially, it was feared that the building, which appears to be gutted, could collapse. Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was devastated by the horrific scenes, attended by more than 250 firefighters and 100 ambulance medics. Questions will need to be answered over the safety of tower blocks, he told BBC Radio. ""We can't have a situation where people's safety is put at risk because of bad advice being given or if it is the case, as has been alleged, of tower blocks not being properly serviced or maintained,"" he said. Matt Wrack, of the Fire Brigades Union said something had clearly gone badly wrong with fire prevention procedures at the building. Firefighters would normally fight a fire in a tower block from the inside, going up the fire escape, and fighting using the internal dry-rising mains, he said, but that's not been possible in this case. Construction firm Rydon said recent building work which it carried out on the block ""met all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards"". Refurbishment work completed in 2016 included more residential areas in the four lower 'podium' levels Appeals are being made on social media for news of missing friends and relatives, who might have been caught in the blaze. Emergency rest centres have opened for those now homeless at Latymer Community Centre, St Clement's Church, Harrow Club and Rugby Portobello Trust. There are also local collections under way for spare clothes, toys, blankets and toiletries. People are being advised by police to stay away from the area, where roads remain closed and nearby residents have been evacuated as a precaution. The London Fire Brigade said a structural engineer had checked the building More than 70 people have received treatment in hospital Smoke could be seen from miles away Grenfell Tower underwent a two-year Â£10m refurbishment as part of a wider transformation of the estate, that was completed last year. Work included new exterior cladding and a communal heating system. The 24-storey tower, containing about 120 flats, is managed by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO) on behalf of the council. Before and during the refurbishment, the localGrenfell Action Group,externalclaimed that the block constituted a fire risk and residents warned that site access for emergency vehicles was ""severely restricted"". Construction firm Rydon, which carried out the refurbishment, said it was ""shocked to hear of the devastating fire"" and added that the work ""met all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards"". Council leader Nick Paget-Brown said the buildings were regularly inspected, but a ""thorough investigation"" was needed. Read more onsafety concerns here.
