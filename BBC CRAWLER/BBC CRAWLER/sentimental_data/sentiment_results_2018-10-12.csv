"I admit it, I was wrong. When I saida couple of weeks agothat for the past century artists have failed to outwit and outdo Marcel Duchamp (the French conceptual artist who placed a urinal in a gallery in 1917), I hadn't realised that there was an artwork hanging on the walls of a London auction house which was about to do just that. Banksy's Girl With Balloon, 2006, estimated at Â£200,000 - Â£300,000 That ""moment"" at Sotheby's the other day when Banksy's Girl with Balloon sold for Â£860,000 (just over Â£1m with add-ons) and promptly self-destructed in front of a gobsmacked auction room was a match for any of Duchamp's mischievously ironic artworks. This video can not be played The anonymous artist uploaded a video of the destruction onto Instagram but soon deleted the post Before our very eyes, the familiar Banksy image of the girl with a balloon, for which an unnamed lady paid an unfathomably large sum, was transformed into an entirely new piece, retrospectively titled by the artist, Love is in the Bin. ""At first I was shocked,"" said the winning bidder and proud owner having decided to keep the work, ""but I realised I would end up with my own piece of art history."" And so she has. The idea of destroying one artwork to make another has turned into something of a genre post-Duchamp, who was the past master of the art stunt. In 1953, for example, Robert Rauschenberg famously rubbed out a drawing given to him by the revered Dutch artist Willem de Kooning. The American then spent two months obliterating the original image before mounting the now blank sheet of paper in a gilded frame, onto which his friend Jasper Johns inscribed with the words, Erased de Kooning Drawing. Robert Rauschenberg. Erased de Kooning Drawing by Robert Rauschenberg, is a famous example of destroying one artwork to make another In light of which, and for the sake of clarity, the subject of this review is not a 2006 Banksy canvas in a mock Victorian frame, but the new artwork made by the artist via a remote control device live in the auction room on 5th October 2018. The one with shredded canvas hanging from the bottom of the frame, which is on display at Sotheby's, London throughout the weekend. Love is in the Bin will come to be seen as one of the most significant artworks of the early 21st Century This is what I think about Love is in the Bin. It will come to be seen as one of the most significant artworks of the early 21st Century. It is not a great painting that can be compared to a late Rembrandt, or a sculpture to sit alongside Michelangelo's David, but in terms of conceptual art emanating from Duchamp's Dadaist sensibility, it is exceptional. Love is in the Bin isn't a sculpture that sits alongside Michelangelo's David It was brilliant in both conception and execution. Take its initial creation, which was a stunning piece of site-specific, mechanically-aided, performance art; an attention-grabbing spectacle taking place within an attention-grabbing spectacle, which highlighted through dark satire how art has become an investment commodity to be auctioned off to ultra-wealthy trophy-hunters. As an action, it was reminiscent of the K Foundation's spectacle of burning a million pounds on the Isle of Jura in 1994. The difference here was the one million pound object Banksy destroyed could quite possibly be worth more, which, when you think about it, tells you all you need to know about a cynical art world and its values. Imagine you'd saved up all your money to buy a painting you truly loved and then at the very moment you were about to take it home someone came along and shredded it. Would you want your money back? Would you be angry? Sure you would, you loved that piece. But contemporary art is not valued for its inherent aesthetic qualities (although that is how it is presented to us), it is valued pretty much solely on the basis of an artist's reputation. All that matters is the brand, that it is a Banksy, or a Koons, or a Kusama. For a lot of collectors art has become an asset class. Hence the talk after the event wasn't about art but the asset. Will the shredded work be worth more, or less? Surreptitious calls were made suggesting potential buyers were already lining up to purchase it, should it come back on the market. Speculation mounted. Maybe the whole thing was an elaborate prank by Banksy. He could have put the piece up for auction through an associate and then bought it for the staggering sum of Â£1m knowing full well the sale wouldn't go through because the work was about to be destroyed. You wouldn't put that past him, would you? Banksy making a shredder to fit in a frame for Girl With Balloon And what about the shredder? How did that work? Were Sotheby's in on it? If not, just how bad is its security not to spot an inbuilt metal contraption with (I assume) a remote control device installed? Why didn't Sotheby's security detect a metal contraption in the artwork? Duchamp would have loved it all. The provocation, the mystery (he signed his urinal R Mutt to hide his identity), the creation through destruction (he drew a goatee onto a postcard of the Mona Lisa to create an original artwork), the challenging question about the nature of art. What is Love is in the Bin? Is it a painting? Or, is it now a piece of conceptual art? Or should it be classified as a sculpture? Or is it rubbish? Who decides? Who knows? Duchamp would say it is up to you to decide. My view? It is art. Made by an artist who many don't rate but I do. Why? Because he has something to say. You might not agree with him, but at least he is making art that penetrates the public consciousness; art that is in the world, not detached from it; art that raises questions that need an airing. Banksy makes art that, as Hamlet said, holds""â¦the mirror up to nature: to show virtue her feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure."" And what artwork better captures the spirit of our times than Love is in the Bin? I can't think of one.

"Westminster attacker Khalid Masood was lawfully killed after murdering five people, an inquest has concluded. He died after being shot by a minister's bodyguard in the Palace of Westminster on 22 March last year. Masood had ploughed through pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in a car, killing four, and stabbed PC Keith Palmer. Met Police chief Cressida Dick praised the ""professionalism, bravery and compassion shown by the plain clothed officers in stopping a terrorist"". The inquest jury at the Old Bailey found that Masood was intent on inflicting ""serious harm"" when he carried out the attack. The jury said he had been issued with verbal warnings but ""continued to move towards the close protection officers at speed"" before being shot. Clockwise from top left: PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives Chief coroner Mark Lucraft QC had earlier directed the jury to return a lawful killing verdict on the grounds that the bodyguard who shot Masood believed opening fire was necessary to defend himself and others. Summing up the evidence he also said a senior policeman whowitnessed the murder of PC Palmer from a locked car, staying inside because he had no protective equipment, had not been to blame. Mr Lucraft said it was clear there was nothing Sir Craig Mackay, who was the Met's acting chief at the time, could have done to stop the killer. ""Even if he had got out of the car, it was clear from the CCTV evidence he would not have reached PC Palmer before Masood inflicted his fatal wounds,"" he said. Sir Craig Mackey with current Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick, before the funeral of PC Palmer Ms Dick said there had been an ""extraordinary amount of confused, unpleasant, personalised and ignorant commentary"" about Sir Craig's actions. ""The attack in New Palace Yard occurred and was stopped in seconds. Sir Craig had absolutely no opportunity to stop the killer or save PC Palmer. Anyone who suggests otherwise is simply wrong."" The issues raised at the inquests Met boss 'locked car door' during attack Could Khalid Masood have been stopped? Who were the victims? The Met Police also apologised after the coroner identified ""shortcomings"" in the security system at the palace where PC Palmer died. An earlier inquest into the death of the five people killed by Masood heardthere were no armed officers at the entranceto Parliament for almost an hour before the police officer was stabbed. Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Neil Basu said: ""Even the possibility that the Metropolitan Police Service lost the chance to prevent the murder of one of our officers is unacceptable and we are deeply sorry. ""Security arrangements have substantially changed since the attack and we will do everything possible to improve that position further."" This video can not be played Police officer: Why I tried to tackle Westminster attacker Speaking outside the court, Mr Basu said the attack lasted just 82 seconds but had the most ""appalling consequences"". ""The two armed close protection officers who confronted this individual acted with great courage. ""They undoubtedly prevented others from being injured and further loss of life. ""I pay tribute to their tremendous professionalism and their bravery."" Why I tried to tackle Westminster attacker.

"Mrs Trump said media speculation about her marriage hurt her US First Lady Melania Trump has dismissed speculation about the state of her marriage, saying her husband's alleged extra-marital affairs are not her ""concern or focus"" because she has better things to do. In an interview with ABC News,she said media speculation about her marriage was not ""pleasant"",external. Asked if she loves President Donald Trump, she said: ""Yes, we are fine."" He denies having had extra-marital affairs. Porn-star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal allege they slept with him. Mrs Trump said she loved her husband and that the media's coverage of their relationship was not always correct. ""It is not a concern and focus of mine. I'm a mother and a first lady and I have much more important things to think about and to do,"" she said. ""I know what is right and what is true and not true,"" she added. The interview was recorded on her trip last week across four African nations. Melania Trump visits Ghana slave fort In pictures: Melania Trump's whistle-stop Africa tour Mrs Trump refused to be drawn on comments by President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who maintained publicly that Melania Trump believed her husband's denials of involvement with Stormy Daniels. ""I never talk to Mr Giuliani,"" she said. In the first part of the interview released on Thursday, Mrs Trump said women who allege sexual abuse must produce ""really hard evidence"". Mrs Trump also claimed she was ""the most bullied person on the world."" Ms McDougal says she had a 10-month relationship with Mr Trump starting in 2006. He was already married to Melania and hosting TV show The Apprentice. Karen McDougal says she was tricked into staying silent about the alleged affair Ms McDougal had signed a $150,000 deal with the tabloid The National Enquirer which gave them exclusive story rights. However, her account was not published but she reached a settlement with the paper's publisher, AMI, in April freeing her to share her story. In the case of Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, she alleges that she had sex with Mr Trump in his room at Lake Tahoe, a resort area between California and Nevada, in 2006, and had an ""ongoing"" relationship after this encounter. Stormy Daniels alleges she had sex with Mr Trump Ms Daniels is suing the president to get out of a so-called ""hush agreement"" before the 2016 election - the focus being a payment of $130,000 (Â£96,000) given to her by Mr Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, in exchange for her silence.

"Hannah Berry will take over as comics laureate from Charlie Adlard in 2019 New comics laureate Hannah Berry has said she wants to use the position to remove some of the ""stigma"" that still surrounds graphic novels and comics, and harness their ""untapped"" potential. Berry is the award-winning creator of graphic novels Adamtine and Livestock. ""There are still a lot of people who think comics are just superheroes throwing stuff at each other. ""With the enormous, diverse, wealth of subjects out there, there's a graphic novel for everybody,"" she said. ""There's nothing wrong with superhero comics, but I think if people were aware, maybe the stigma could be removed."" Brighton-based Berry was unveiled as the UK's third comics laureate, and the first woman in the post, at the Lakes International Comic Art Festival in Kendal, Cumbria, on Friday. The job is described as an ""ambassadorial and educational role"" for the comic genre, intended to raise awareness of the impact comics can have on literacy and creativity. Berry will take over from Walking Dead artistCharlie Adlardin 2019. Berry's 2017 book Livestock examines the relationship between celebrity and politics Part of her duties will be to introduce comic books into literacy programmes in schools and libraries, and she also wants to work out a way to use comics to teach English. ""My mum is from Ecuador and when her family moved to the States for some time, she went to a school in Maryland,"" she told BBC News. ""She didn't speak English and learned it through reading comics with my granddad. ""I think the use of comics as a literacy tool for people learning English as a foreign language is phenomenal and almost untapped."" Berry said the first comic she ever read was Calvin and Hobbes, which followed the antics of a clever six-year-old boy named Calvin and stuffed tiger Hobbes. ""I kind of credit them for giving me the love of language. ""I remember reading them at the age of six and seeing Calvin use the most amazing vocabulary, I thought to myself, 'I'm going to be as good as him!"" It's because of this kind of accessibility why the author believes that comics are a great way to attract younger readers. ""The visual side of things is so easily relatable - it's like an inherent part of our psychology,"" she said. ""We can relate to things on the page before we understand the written word."" But the author believes the medium's accessibility can also be its downfall, because people think comics are childish ""because of their simplicity"". She added: ""There are hidden worlds and huge amounts of depth in the images and really rich worlds are portrayed.""

"This video can not be played Freed pastor Andrew Brunson prays with President Trump, calling for him to be granted ""supernatural wisdom"" A US pastor has met President Donald Trump at the White House after more than two years' detention in Turkey. Andrew Brunson appeared in the Oval Office with President Trump following a case that has strained relations between the two countries. Mr Brunson thanked the president and his administration for securing his release - and prayed for him. President Trump thanked Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for helping with his release. He said the US had been working ""long and hard"" to secure Mr Brunson's release, and told Mr Brunson he had ""galvanised this country"" with his strength and faith. Mr Brunson was arrested over alleged links to political groups, including the banned Gulenist movement, after a failed coup attempt in 2016. Pastor a 'pawn in personal feud' Who are the Gulenists? On Friday, a Turkish court sentenced Mr Brunson to three years in jail - but freed him because of the time he had already spent in detention. Additional espionage charges against him were also dropped by the court. Mr Brunson, seen here with his wife, was freed on Friday Mr Trump called the release a ""tremendous step"" towards a ""great relationship"" with Turkey. He insisted there had been no deal made with Turkey, but said the US would reconsider its ""very tough"" sanctions on the country. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump said the US felt ""very differently about Turkey"" in light of the pastor's release. When asked by a reporter if the release had any relation tothe disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the president said the timing was ""strict coincidence"". The pastor kneeled down to pray for Mr Trump in the Oval Office, asking that the president be made ""a great blessing to this country"". He then told reporters that he and his wife now wished to spend time with their children. In a statement earlier, Mr Brunson said his whole family ""thanks the president, the administration and Congress for their unwavering support"". After his release on Friday he flew from Izmir in western Turkey to a US base in Germany, and then on to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. Members of Mr Brunson's church celebrated in front of his house after he was released Mr Brunson lived in Turkey with his wife and three children for more than 20 years, most of it working for the small Izmir Resurrection Church, which had a congregation of about two dozen people. He was arrested in October 2016. The authorities accused him of having links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Gulenist movement, which Turkey blames for the 2016 failed coup. Turkey and US lock horns as relations sour Erdogan: Turkey's pugnacious president In July 2018 he was released from prison for health reasons and moved to house arrest until his trial. A few weeks later, the US imposed sanctions on Turkey's justice and interior ministers over his continued detention. Mr Brunson and US officials insisted he was innocent of all charges. Dressed in a black suit, white shirt and red tie, Mr Brunson, who was one of 20 Americans charged after the coup attempt two years ago, told the court he was ""an innocent man"". The pastor was convicted on charges of aiding terror groups while not being a member of them, and sentenced to three years in prison. The court took into account the time he had already spent in detention, lifting his house arrest and overseas travel ban. When the verdict was read out, he wept and hugged his wife Norine. By Mark Lowen, BBC Turkey Correspondent President Erdogan has always insisted that he could not meddle with Turkey's judicial independence and that only the courts would decide Pastor Brunson's fate. But the World Economic Forum places Turkey 103rd of 137 countries in the independent judiciary rankings and Turkey-watchers knew it would always come down to a political decision. In the end, pressure from Washington on Ankara was too much. Sanctions, trade tariffs and the threat of more had led US-Turkey relations to nosedive - and with them, the Turkish lira. Facing spiralling inflation, a 40% drop in the value of the currency and the start of an economic crisis, Turkey had to act to normalise relations with the US. Mr Brunson was the key. Andrew Brunson had the American government behind him. Deniz Yucel, the former correspondent of Die Welt, who was imprisoned and then finally freed in Turkey, had the German government supporting him. Tens of thousands of others here who claim wrongful imprisonment don't have the backing of a powerful state to resist what they say is Turkey's politicised judiciary. Pastor Brunson's detention has soured relations between Washington and Ankara, who are allies in Nato, with both sides imposing sanctions on the other. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blames Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen for the attempted coup but Mr Gulen, who is based in Pennsylvania, denies any involvement. Turkey wants the US to agree to his extradition. US support for Kurdish forces fighting the Syrian civil war has also angered Mr Erdogan, who views them as an extension of the PKK. The PKK - a Turkish-Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy since the 1980s - is considered a terrorist group by Turkey and the US. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played I will maintain fiscal firepower, says Mr Hammond The chancellor has opened the door to tax rises in the Budget, saying the government ""may have to raise a little more tax"" to pay for the NHS. Philip Hammond told the BBC he wanted to ""minimise"" any impact on the economy if taxes had to rise to cover the Â£20bn spending boost pledged for the NHS. ""We may have to raise a little more tax in order to support the NHS and deliver on our pledge,"" he said. However, he added, ""I am a low-tax Tory."" Speaking to me at the International Monetary Fund annual meeting in Bali, Mr Hammond said that if taxes have to go up, ""it's important that we do it in a way that minimises any negative impact on the economy, minimises the effect on people"". ""I will always do everything I can to minimise the necessity for any increases in taxation, and to keep the burden of taxes as low as I possibly can,"" he said. He refused to commit to keeping Conservative election manifesto promises made last year to raise the income tax threshold - so that workers pay less tax - and cut corporation tax for businesses. ""These are both very important commitments that were made,"" he said. ""We've also made a very important commitment to a big increase in funding for the National Health Service, something that we didn't anticipate at the time we wrote our manifesto. ""We're being very open and frank with the British people that if we're going to have rising standards of healthcare, with an ageing population in a world where technology is constantly making new treatments available, we are going to have to pay a little more to support that."" Hammond targets 'fake' self-employed Mr Hammond, who delivers his Budget in two weeks' time,said there had been a step-change in the Brexit negotiationsand that he expected an economic ""upturn"" if a deal was agreed with the rest of the European Union. He said that a public finances buffer of Â£15.4bn built up in case there is a disorderly Brexit could also be used to support public services. ""I will maintain fiscal firepower so that if we do find that things don't turn out the way we want, we have got the ability to support the British economy and minimise any effect,"" he said. ""But if we don't need that fiscal firepower, then of course it can be used for other things - either support for public services or further paying down of debt or indeed reducing taxes."" If there is no deal or a disorderly Brexit, then any dividend would be lost, he said. ""If we leave the EU without a deal, we will be in very different situation and we will need a different set of responses,"" he said.

"David Parnham sent out letters calling for attacks as part of a ""Punish a Muslim Day"" A man has admitted sending hundreds of racist letters nationwide including calls for a ""Punish a Muslim Day"". David Parnham, 35, sent the letters to mosques, Muslim parliamentarians including Lord Ahmed of Wimbledon, the Queen, David Cameron and Theresa May. He pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to 15 offences, including soliciting to murder and staging a bomb hoax. Parnham, of St Andrews Close, Lincoln, was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at a later date. During his two-year campaign, Parnham sent wave after wave of letters across the country that included white supremacist imagery and threats to minorities, mostly Muslims. His first letters sent in June 2016 contained a white powder as a hoax poison. Latest updates and stories from Lincolnshire In one letter sent to David Cameron, Parnham wrote ""Allah is Great"" and in others sent to mosques he wrote ""Paki filth"". Three months later Parnham sent another wave of white powder letters, including those addressed to the Queen and Theresa May respectively. One of his poison hoaxes was so sophisticated that it triggered a chemical attack alert at a Royal Mail sorting office in Sheffield. The following February, he targeted mosques around the UK. One letter to worshippers in Hull included a warning that they were going to be ""slaughtered very soon"". In March 2017 he escalated his campaign, encouraging recipients of his post at the University of Sheffield to attack ethnic minorities, proposing that he would donate Â£100 to charity for each killing. The court heard these letters amounted to soliciting to murder and Parnham's guilty plea to this charge means he could now receive a life sentence. A year later, Parnham sent out letters headlined ""Punish a Muslim Day"", offering ""awards"" for attacks on people, mosques and Mecca. He was eventually caught after his DNA and fingerprints were recovered from some of the letters, including one that he sent to Dylann Roof, a US white supremacist who is on death row for a mass murder of black churchgoers three years ago.

"Princess Eugenie has married her long-term partner Jack Brooksbank at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. The ninth in line to the throne was watched by her grandmother, the Queen, and Prince Philip, along with other members of her family. Among 850 guests were celebrities such as Cara Delevingne and Robbie Williams, while 1,200 people chosen by ballot followed proceedings from the grounds. They cheered as the newlyweds kissed twice on the chapel steps. Royal wedding in pictures 'I wanted my wedding dress to show my scar' Hold on to your hats: Best wedding moments The view from the crowds Guests laid out picnic blankets and quaffed champagne but had umbrellas at the ready and often had to fix their fascinators in the blustery conditions. This video can not be played The Queen's granddaughter was married in front of 850 guests There were huge cheers when the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh arrived. The service was also attended by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. The Duchess of York spotted a friend in the crowd and rushed to embrace her Mother of the bride Sarah, Duchess of York, wore a vibrant green outfit and sat alongside her eldest daughter, Eugenie's sister, Princess Beatrice. However, theDuchess of Cornwall missed the serviceto attend engagements including a display of Highland dancing near the Royal Family's home at Balmoral. Royal Family members, including the Queen and Prince Philip, inside the chapel Pippa Middleton with her husband James Matthews (left) and brother James Middleton (right) Princess Eugenie, the 28-year-old daughter of Prince Andrew, kept breaking into a broad smile during the ceremony. Her dress - with full-length train - was designed by Peter Pilotto and Christopher De Vos, who founded British label Peter Pilotto. Royal wedding guests sell goody bags online Princess Eugenie's dress in detail Meet the bride and groom What's the cost and who's paying? It featured a neckline folding around the shoulders to a low back at the request of the bride, who wanted to show a scar from surgery to correct scoliosis when she was 12. The bride asked for a low back to show her scar She wore the Queen's Greville Emerald Kokoshnik Tiara, made by Boucheron in 1919, featuring brilliant and rose-cut diamonds, pave set in platinum, with six emeralds on either side. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, acted as pageboy and bridesmaid. Charlotte waved enthusiastically at the crowds as they approached the chapel, though negotiating the steps in the high winds proved tricky. Charlotte struggled to keep balance, while pageboy Louis de Givenchy - son of family friends - took a tumble. Some of the youngsters were seen giggling and joking before walking down the aisle, appearing to imitate the royal trumpeters. However, George held his hand over his ear as the musicians heralded Eugenie's arrival. The bridesmaids and page boys at the ceremony Eugenie's sister, Princess Beatrice, was maid of honour. Mr Brooksbank chose his brother, Thomas, as best man. Numerous celebrities braved the weather, including singer Robbie Williams and his fellow X Factor judge Ayda Field, whose daughter Theodora, six, was a bridesmaid. Singer Ellie Goulding, comedians Stephen Fry and Jack Whitehall and supermodels Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell were in the congregation. Cara Delevingne grabbed the attention of social media commentators with a dashing top hat and tails combination.

Dean of Windsor David Conner officiated. This video can not be played Windy weather as royals and famous faces arrive for the wedding The couple travelled by carriage from St George's Chapel into Windsor, before heading for an afternoon reception hosted by the Queen in St George's Hall at the castle. It was estimated about 3,000 people gathered to cheer Princess Eugenie and her new husband. Rachel Price-Greenow, from Hereford, admitted she had a tear in her eye watching the couple go by. ""I got emotional!"" she said. ""I was quite teary. It's just lovely. I love all the pomp and sense of occasion."" Georgina Moroney, from Swindon, said: ""I'm a royal geek. It's just all part of our heritage. They're fantastic - I love the romance of it all. ""She looked so radiant."" Amy Gardner captured a photograph of the happy couple smiling and waving at the camera. ""She looked so beautiful - it was lovely,"" she said. ""It's definitely worth the wait."" However, Kerry Evans, 54, who arrived from Lincolnshire on Tuesday to secure a spot on the procession route, complained: ""Where were the Coldstream Guards? ""I expected to see military behind... and I'm thinking, really, that isn't a procession."" By Jonny Dymond, BBC royal correspondent, at Windsor The focus of the day was of course on the couple; an unsurprisingly nervous groom, his hand shaking at times, his gaze twitching as he waited for his bride; a beaming princess, unable to control her joy. There was more; flawless organisation, hat dysfunction as the wind blew and blew, hatchets buried as the Duke of Edinburgh settled into a seat near Sarah, Duchess of York, with whom he has had a frosty - sometimes frozen -  relationship. But most noticeable at Windsor? The applause that followed the national anthem and the cheers for the Queen as she left the chapel. No one eclipses the Queen in the affections of the British public. Eugenie and drinks executive Mr Brooksbank, who met when skiing in Switzerland in 2010, left the castle in a silver DB10 Aston Martin, originally made for the James Bond movie Spectre. The couple were understood to be heading to the York family home, Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, for their evening reception. The families paid for the private aspects of the wedding. However, republican campaigners said taxpayers faced an estimated Â£2m security bill. The campaign group Republic argued that as Princess Eugenie, the ninth in line to the throne, did not carry out public duties, the families should foot the bill. Buckingham Palace said security was a matter for the police. Are you ready for another royal wedding? Eugenie wedding: What's the cost and who's paying?

"Dedicated specialist cancer nurses provide physical and emotional support Thousands of incurable breast cancer patients are being denied a dedicated specialist nurse, according to Breast Cancer Care. The figures show almost three-quarters (72%) of NHS Trusts across the UK are not providing designated nurses. Three years ago, the government promised all cancer patients would have access to a designated nurse by 2020. The Department of Health said it was ""committed to increasing the capacity"" of specialist cancer nurses. Samia al Qadhi, chief executive of charity Breast Cancer Care, hit out at the deterioration in patient care. ""Our staggering figures reveal just how much NHS nursing care for people with incurable breast cancer has stagnated,"" she said. ""After this life-changing diagnosis, patients continue to be abandoned without ongoing specialist support they need to manage complex treatment and debilitating side effects, like chronic pain and fatigue."" The charity contacted NHS health trusts in the UK and obtained the data under Freedom of Information laws. Jo Myatt, 42, from Chorley, was diagnosed with incurable secondary breast cancer in August 2016, 10 years after primary breast cancer, and after many years of clear mammograms. She was told that the cancer had spread to her liver and bones. Jo Myatt said support was 'non-existent' after her diagnosis with incurable cancer ""Following my diagnosis, in the space of a 20-minute consultation, I felt I lost my identity and my future with those I love. ""Support following my diagnosis was non-existent. There were no specialist or secondary breast care nurses. I was told by a GP on a Friday evening and sent home with my husband with a lack of knowledge and lack of a plan. ""I was left completely in the dark, frightened, isolated and devastated."" Jo had to change hospitals in order to get a specialist nurse last year, who now supports her ""physically and emotionally"" and she is now campaigning for more nurses to be available to those with incurable cancer. ""Now I can just email my nurse about treatment and side effects. It's so stressful trying to keep track of all the different treatments and appointments, and the nurse helps me co-ordinate it all."" Latest BBC News stories on breast cancer 'Cinderella service short of key staff' Many worried about nurse staffing There are an estimated 35,000 people with secondary breast cancer (also known as metastatic, advanced or stage four breast cancer), and each year around 11,500 die from the disease. A few will have a dedicated nurse, while others will have a nurse who splits their time between primary and secondary breast cancer patients. Life expectancy for secondary breast cancer patients varies, but, as treatments have improved, more people are living longer after a diagnosis, making specialist care even more essential. Ms al Qadhi said: ""People living with incurable breast cancer tell us that access to a specialist nurse is the single most important aspect of their care and without it they feel isolated, forgotten and invisible. ""So today's failings must not be swept under the carpet. We are calling on the government to create a secondary support package for incurable breast cancer."" An NHS spokesperson said: ""Everyone with cancer is unique and patients themselves say their experience of being looked after is getting better every year - which makes sense as your chance of surviving cancer is now at its highest ever.""

"Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank went on a carriage procession around Windsor It was inevitable there'd be comparisons with this year's other royal wedding in Windsor. But while Prince Harry's wedding to Meghan Markle brought the town to a standstill in May, there was the feeling that the more low-key atmosphere for his cousin Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's nuptials was actually quite welcome. Yes, there were still the die-hard royal fans in Union Jack outfits, who'd put up bunting around the section of security barrier where they'd staked their claim to a prime viewing spot. Even before the sun rose on Friday, people were sat out in camping chairs, sipping much-needed coffee from flasks and takeaway cups. Meet the bride and groom Royal wedding in pictures Princess Eugenie marries Jack Brooksbank Royal wedding guests sell goody bags online And yes, there was a huge police presence, as you'd expect for an event with thousands of members of the public attending - but the crowds were rather thinner on the ground than they had been in May. And while some spoke of an ""electric"" party atmosphere at the Sussexes' wedding, this was more of a sedate affair. One onlooker said she'd use the word ""calm"" to sum up the atmosphere. So it was more like a family event perhaps - albeit with a smattering of A-list guests - than a state occasion. After all, Princess Eugenie grew up just down the road and - as the Dean of St George's Chapel, David Conner, said - she regards it as her parish church. To her, this was the equivalent of getting married at the church nearest to her mum and dad's place, with the local vicar doing the honours. Left to right: Friends Helen Freeman, Gemma Morgan, Rachel Price-Greenow and Alice Smart Well-wisher Gemma Morgan, who'd travelled from Hereford to watch the newlyweds process through the streets in a carriage, noted: ""I was speaking to someone who runs a shop here, who was telling us this wedding feels more like a community event - it's really relaxed and friendly."" In a very British touch, the goody bags distributed to the guests who watched proceedings inside the grounds - having won their spot in a public ballot - contained a biodegradable emergency rain poncho (as well as a giant chocolate coin, a fridge magnet and a can of water, rather than a bottle, as Eugenie had stipulated it was to be a plastic-free wedding).

There was a nice nod to some Princess Eugenie's charity work too. The cloth bags, emblazoned with the newlyweds' initials and wedding date, were made by women and girls from the Women's Interlink Foundation, an Indian charity which she supports. There were representatives too from other charities she works with, such as the Teenage Cancer Trust, whose nurses were among those invited to the castle to be part of the big day. Hold on to your hats: Best wedding moments Royal wedding as it happened What's the cost and who's paying? Despite the expected rain, it stayed dry (so no need for that poncho) with the gusting winds more of a concern for the guests desperately holding on to their hats as they made their way into the chapel. The dry weather was appreciated by the crowds just outside the grand Henry VIII gates of the castle, who settled for following the service on their phones because it was going on just on the other side of the walls. Some of them burst into a rousing God Save the Queen when the anthem was played at the end of the wedding - others readied their cameras and phones in anticipation of seeing the newlyweds. Jack Brooksbank and Eugenie waved to well-wishers outside the chapel The sun came out in time for them to glimpse the happy couple and church bells were ringing - and then suddenly there was a cry of ""They're here!"" The cheers were the polite, good-natured sort rather than being deafening, as flags and hands were waved in the direction of the bride and groom (who gamely waved back). ""You look stunning!"" shouted one person, above the applause and cries of congratulations. Most people were beaming but some looked emotional - and then, the moment was over. The crowds hung around for a bit, with some whispering ""Was that it?"" - hoping, perhaps, to see some of the other royals. But although brief, most said it was worth the wait. Margaret Feneck, 80, from Coffs Harbour, Australia, who made the trip to Windsor especially during her holiday to Europe, said: ""She was stunning, wasn't she? She was on our side of the street - and I was waving too hard I forgot to take a picture."" Crowds cheered the royal couple as their carriage travelled through Windsor But fellow Australian Babs Tahana, from Perth, said: ""She was beautiful - but I had thought there might be more people here. ""I wanted to come though as I might not see another royal wedding."" Another well-wisher described the atmosphere as ""flat"" but added: ""It's still nice to be a part of it - we're local and we like to join in with things like this."" By early afternoon, the town had returned to normal, with security barriers taken away and just the bunting, the odd discarded flag and the remaining film cameras a reminder that anything had gone on. For the happy couple, it has been just as extraordinary and magical as anyone else's wedding day is - but after the brief hubbub, for Windsor, and the people who'd headed to its streets, it was back to being another ordinary day.

"Three in four people do not think there are enough nurses to care safely for patients in the NHS, a survey suggests. The poll of 1,600 UK adults - carried out by YouGov for the Royal College of Nursing - found 74% were concerned about staffing levels. Latest figures for England show one in nine posts is vacant. The RCN branded the situation dangerous, but ministers said steps were being taken to recruit more nurses. Chief among their plans is the pay offer on which nurses are currently being balloted. Ministers have offered nurses a minimum of 6.5% over three years. The RCN is asking its members to back that offer, but described the current staffing situation as ""inevitable"" given the ""short-sighted"" cost-cutting of recent years. Pay has been capped or frozen since 2010 and training opportunities restricted, which, the union says, is to blame for the growing numbers of nurses leaving the profession. Health service 'haemorrhaging' nurses NHS 'dangerously' short of 100,000 staff 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble In a speech to launch the RCN's annual conference, being held in Belfast this year, its general secretary Janet Davies will say: ""This is a failure of politicians and policymakers - with an inability to recognise the value of nursing, an unwillingness to listen to those of you who are working in the service and a lack of political will to address it. ""The current shortages are not only dangerous, but a vicious circle too. ""Poor staffing levels are the number-one reason for working-age nurses leaving the register. ""Good nurses do not want to do a bad job."" The RCN wants to see safe staffing legislation introduced across the UK after Wales became the first country in Europe to introduce such laws in 2016. Scotland has already promised it will follow suit, but Northern Ireland and England have not committed to it. As part of a report on staffing to open the conference, the RCN released feedback from their members outlining the problems they were facing. This included evidence of patient care being compromised, being overburdened with paperwork and not having time to take breaks or eat. They said the pressures meant healthcare assistants were being asked to fill in for nurses at times. One said: ""Vital medication was missed during this shift as I had too much on my mind. ""I missed breaks and I went home feeling hungry, tired and like a failure. I am looking for a new job leaving nursing."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said steps were being taken to recruit more nurses, acknowledging ""the NHS would collapse without our wonderful nurses"". As well as the pay rise, the spokeswoman cited the 25% increase in student training places which is happening this year and greater flexible working opportunities that are being introduced.

"Vandana Pankhania Radia says she would use the new app Supermarket customers may soon have to get used to a new way of paying for their shopping. Marks & Spencer has become the latest food retailer to test an app which allows people to buy their shopping without having to use a till. Users of the app, called Mobile, Pay, Go, scan the barcodes of what they want to buy on their phone, pay via the app and then walk straight out of the shop. Tesco, Sainsbury's and the Co-op have all launched similar trials this year. It is still very early days for the technology though. M&S is currently testing the system in two stores and hoping to extend it to another four by Christmas with a larger, nationwide roll-out during 2019. Jim Cruickshank, head of digital development at M&S, says the company introduced the app to try to help people avoid queues at lunchtime. ""In 40 seconds you could have done the whole thing and walked out."" Several supermarkets are testing systems similar to the M&S app There are limitations to the app. It can only be used to buy food. There's a limit of Â£30 and if you want to buy things like alcohol you still have to go to a till. Then there's the issue of how to stop people who might want to abuse it. ""It's no different really to the self-checkout tills and our stores have a number of security measures,"" Mr Cruickshank says. ""Lots of our products are tagged and the alarm will sound if you walk out without purchasing them. We have security guards and our staff will be doing spot checks so  normal measures really."" However, shoppers remain divided over whether it is a good idea. Vicky Harvey says she would be happy to use the app and doesn't have any worries about data security. ""I guess it's up to M&S to decide if they've got their security sorted,"" she said - and as she can see on her banking app whether she has paid for something the second she has done so, ""it works for me"". ""I'm not so worried about data because the stuff's already on my phone. And if I haven't protected it already I'm doomed."" But Jean, who didn't want to give her surname, isn't convinced. ""I probably wouldn't use it because I do my own self-scanning and I don't like to give my bank account details out left, right and centre."" Vicky says it's up to M&S to make sure the security on the app is robust This type of technology is still in its very early stages. At the moment, it's being used in fewer than a dozen stores across the UK. But retail analyst Natalie Berg says it could be a sign of things to come. ""This is essentially about levelling the playing field with online retail. So bricks-and-mortar retailers are now using technology to bring the physical store into the 21st century,"" she said. It is not just British retailers who are looking to change the way we shop. Amazon has launched five of its Amazon Go stores since January with claims they're even easier to use. People can scan their mobile phone on the way in, pick up anything they want and walk out again. There are reports it's now scouting for possible locations to launch the brand here in the UK. Natalie Berg says Amazon's influence goes even further. ""When people think about the impact Amazon has had on the High Street it has a negative connotation; we think about boarding up shops and retailers going bankrupt. ""But it can be argued Amazon has been a force for good. They've forced retailers to invest in their stores to keep up, to keep a really compelling in-store experience.""

"Sophie Skinner was sentenced at Newport Crown Court to 18 months imprisonment A mother-of-three has been jailed for falsely claiming she was raped. Sophie Skinner, 25, from Llanfoist in Monmouthshire, denied perverting the course of justice but was found guilty by a jury. Newport Crown Court was told the life of her victim Damon Osborne was ""turned upside down"" by the accusation in 2016. She was sentenced to 18 months in prison by Judge Daniel Williams after he said she had shown ""no remorse at all"". The court heard that Skinner went out drinking in Abergavenny ""looking for attention"" on Saturday, 4 June in 2016. CCTV showed her in a Wetherspoons pub, before going to public toilets in White Horse Lane. ""You then saw Damon Osborne who was waiting for a lift home - at the time he was 18 and you were 23,"" Judge Williams said. ""You ran over to him and hugged him... the CCTV at the toilets could not be clearer - you initiated the sex with him. ""When he gave into your persistent demands for sex you told him you could get him into trouble for having sex with you."" The court was told that Skinner then made a false claim that she had been raped to Wetherspoons' door staff, and was interviewed by police. Judge Williams told the court that Skinner showed ""no remorse at all"" Mr Osborne ""strenuously and completely truthfully"" denied the accusation, Judge Williams said. ""After a commendably swift review of the evidence by police, the decision was properly made that Damon Osborne would not be prosecuted for the claim made, and to arrest you,"" he added. Mr Osborne said since he was accused in 2016 his life had ""been a mess"" in a victim statement. After a jury in the first trial against Skinner failed to reach a verdict, he agreed to give evidence against her again. ""I was accused of rape by Sophie Skinner, that turned my life upside down,"" Mr Osborne said. ""I was locked up for 17 hours, I had to undergo an embarrassing medical. ""I still think of the worst case scenario - if there had been no CCTV in this case - Sophie Skinner would have been believed and I would not have been giving this statement, because I would be in jail."" Judge Williams described Skinner's allegation of rape as ""patently false"". ""You maintain your denials,"" he said. ""You have no victim empathy, you have no remorse at all."" ""As the court have said before rape is a repulsive crime. The victims of rape should be treated with every possible consideration. ""On the other hand, just because rape is a repulsive crime, a false accusation can have dreadful consequences."" Judge Williams said such accusations could have an ""insidious"" effect on genuine victims, sometimes ""allowing doubt to creep in where none should exist"". The court heard Skinner had never been in trouble with the police before, but she had been taken into care as a child and was described as ""a vulnerable young woman"". She was sentenced to 18 months, of which she was told she would serve half before being released on licence.

"Dedicated specialist cancer nurses provide physical and emotional support Thousands of incurable breast cancer patients are being denied a dedicated specialist nurse, according to Breast Cancer Care. The figures show almost three-quarters (72%) of NHS Trusts across the UK are not providing designated nurses. Three years ago, the government promised all cancer patients would have access to a designated nurse by 2020. The Department of Health said it was ""committed to increasing the capacity"" of specialist cancer nurses. Samia al Qadhi, chief executive of charity Breast Cancer Care, hit out at the deterioration in patient care. ""Our staggering figures reveal just how much NHS nursing care for people with incurable breast cancer has stagnated,"" she said. ""After this life-changing diagnosis, patients continue to be abandoned without ongoing specialist support they need to manage complex treatment and debilitating side effects, like chronic pain and fatigue."" The charity contacted NHS health trusts in the UK and obtained the data under Freedom of Information laws. Jo Myatt, 42, from Chorley, was diagnosed with incurable secondary breast cancer in August 2016, 10 years after primary breast cancer, and after many years of clear mammograms. She was told that the cancer had spread to her liver and bones. Jo Myatt said support was 'non-existent' after her diagnosis with incurable cancer ""Following my diagnosis, in the space of a 20-minute consultation, I felt I lost my identity and my future with those I love. ""Support following my diagnosis was non-existent. There were no specialist or secondary breast care nurses. I was told by a GP on a Friday evening and sent home with my husband with a lack of knowledge and lack of a plan. ""I was left completely in the dark, frightened, isolated and devastated."" Jo had to change hospitals in order to get a specialist nurse last year, who now supports her ""physically and emotionally"" and she is now campaigning for more nurses to be available to those with incurable cancer. ""Now I can just email my nurse about treatment and side effects. It's so stressful trying to keep track of all the different treatments and appointments, and the nurse helps me co-ordinate it all."" Latest BBC News stories on breast cancer 'Cinderella service short of key staff' Many worried about nurse staffing There are an estimated 35,000 people with secondary breast cancer (also known as metastatic, advanced or stage four breast cancer), and each year around 11,500 die from the disease. A few will have a dedicated nurse, while others will have a nurse who splits their time between primary and secondary breast cancer patients. Life expectancy for secondary breast cancer patients varies, but, as treatments have improved, more people are living longer after a diagnosis, making specialist care even more essential. Ms al Qadhi said: ""People living with incurable breast cancer tell us that access to a specialist nurse is the single most important aspect of their care and without it they feel isolated, forgotten and invisible. ""So today's failings must not be swept under the carpet. We are calling on the government to create a secondary support package for incurable breast cancer."" An NHS spokesperson said: ""Everyone with cancer is unique and patients themselves say their experience of being looked after is getting better every year - which makes sense as your chance of surviving cancer is now at its highest ever.""

"This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the scene of the crash involving a minibus and lorry The driver of an autism school minibus involved in a motorway crash with a lorry has died. Police said a third person died in hospital on Friday after two people died at the scene of the collision on the M4 on Thursday. The victims, who were all in the minibus, were staff members at Prior's Court School in Thatcham, Berkshire. Prior's Court chief executive Mike Robinson said the school ""will never quite be the same again"". He added: ""The staff at Prior's Court are remarkable people and they are doing extraordinary things to transform the lives of those young people who are most challenged by autism. ""We are absolutely devastated that three of our colleagues have lost their lives."" Mr Robinson said the school would ""honour the memory of those who we have lost by making sure that they carry on the great work that those people have started"". The crash happened on the eastbound carriageway of the M4 Two other minibus passengers, who suffered life-threatening injuries, remain in a ""critical condition"" in hospital,  Mr Robinson said. He added the school was ""unbelievably blessed"" that three young adults suffered less serious injuries, with two being discharged from hospital. One young adult from the school remains in hospital to recover from an operation. Prior's Court Foundation is a charity providing schooling and provision for people aged between five and 25 who have severe autism and complex learning difficulties. Minibus crash victims from autism school Two dead in minibus and lorry crash Insp Andy Storey said the lorry driver, who suffered minor injuries, had also been discharged.

""Specially trained family liaison officers are providing support to the families and we are in regular contact with the school."" A lorry and minibus were involved in the crash The crash happened at about 12:20 BST on the eastbound carriageway of the M4 between junction 14 at Hungerford and junction 13 at Newbury of the M4. The westbound carriageway was initially closed to allow three air ambulances to land and the eastbound side remained closed for about nine hours.

"Patisserie Valerie has been saved from collapse after entrepreneur Luke Johnson, who owns 37% of the company, provided Â£20m in loans to the struggling chain. Mr Johnson agreed to lend Â£10m for three years to owners Patisserie Holdings plc, which the company said would provide ""immediate liquidity"". He has also provided a further bridging loan facility of up to Â£10m. The firm said it had also raised another Â£15m by issuing new shares. The directors said the company had required an immediate cash injection of no less than Â£20m, without which it could not continue trading in its present form. The cafe chain has been fighting for survival after revealing on Wednesday it had uncovered ""significant, and potentially fraudulent, accounting irregularities"". On Friday, the company said its finance director Chris Marsh had been arrested and released on bail. The Serious Fraud Office said it had ""opened a criminal investigation into an individual"". ""We can give no further information or comment at this time,""the SFO said,external, without naming the individual. Patisserie Valerie's shares were trading at 429p before they were suspended on Wednesday. It has five brands: Patisserie Valerie, Druckers - Vienna Patisserie, Philpotts, Baker & Spice and Flour Power City. Now, there are 206 stores across the chain and more than 2,500 staff as of May 2018. It was floated on the AIM stock market, for smaller companies, in 2014. The first Patisserie Valerie cafÃ© was opened on Frith Street in London's Soho district in 1926. In 1987 the Scalzo family bought the Old Compton Street store and ran the business. In 2006, Luke Johnson's Risk Capital Partners bought a majority stake when it had eight stores. Mr Johnson, who invested in Patisserie Valerie in 2006, is a serial entrepreneur who is best known for taking control of Pizza Express in 1993 before selling out in 1999. In 2001 he co-founded Risk Capital Partners, which owns stakes in companies including Majestic Bingo and swimming goods firm Zoggs. Patisserie Holding's directors said in a statement,externalthat once the share issue and loans had taken effect, the company would be able to continue trading in its present form ""for the foreseeable future"". ""Following the initial investigation, the directors can confirm that the group has net debt of approximately Â£9.8m,"" the statement said. However, it added that shareholders should be aware that investigations into the company's ""financial irregularities"" were at ""a very preliminary stage"". The statement also said that the irregularities were also likely to have affected the historical financial statements of the company.

"Mrs Trump said media speculation about her marriage hurt her US First Lady Melania Trump has dismissed speculation about the state of her marriage, saying her husband's alleged extra-marital affairs are not her ""concern or focus"" because she has better things to do. In an interview with ABC News,she said media speculation about her marriage was not ""pleasant"",external. Asked if she loves President Donald Trump, she said: ""Yes, we are fine."" He denies having had extra-marital affairs. Porn-star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal allege they slept with him. Mrs Trump said she loved her husband and that the media's coverage of their relationship was not always correct. ""It is not a concern and focus of mine. I'm a mother and a first lady and I have much more important things to think about and to do,"" she said. ""I know what is right and what is true and not true,"" she added. The interview was recorded on her trip last week across four African nations. Melania Trump visits Ghana slave fort In pictures: Melania Trump's whistle-stop Africa tour Mrs Trump refused to be drawn on comments by President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who maintained publicly that Melania Trump believed her husband's denials of involvement with Stormy Daniels. ""I never talk to Mr Giuliani,"" she said. In the first part of the interview released on Thursday, Mrs Trump said women who allege sexual abuse must produce ""really hard evidence"". Mrs Trump also claimed she was ""the most bullied person on the world."" Ms McDougal says she had a 10-month relationship with Mr Trump starting in 2006. He was already married to Melania and hosting TV show The Apprentice. Karen McDougal says she was tricked into staying silent about the alleged affair Ms McDougal had signed a $150,000 deal with the tabloid The National Enquirer which gave them exclusive story rights. However, her account was not published but she reached a settlement with the paper's publisher, AMI, in April freeing her to share her story. In the case of Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, she alleges that she had sex with Mr Trump in his room at Lake Tahoe, a resort area between California and Nevada, in 2006, and had an ""ongoing"" relationship after this encounter. Stormy Daniels alleges she had sex with Mr Trump Ms Daniels is suing the president to get out of a so-called ""hush agreement"" before the 2016 election - the focus being a payment of $130,000 (Â£96,000) given to her by Mr Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, in exchange for her silence.

"This video can not be played Freed pastor Andrew Brunson prays with President Trump, calling for him to be granted ""supernatural wisdom"" A US pastor has met President Donald Trump at the White House after more than two years' detention in Turkey. Andrew Brunson appeared in the Oval Office with President Trump following a case that has strained relations between the two countries. Mr Brunson thanked the president and his administration for securing his release - and prayed for him. President Trump thanked Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for helping with his release. He said the US had been working ""long and hard"" to secure Mr Brunson's release, and told Mr Brunson he had ""galvanised this country"" with his strength and faith. Mr Brunson was arrested over alleged links to political groups, including the banned Gulenist movement, after a failed coup attempt in 2016. Pastor a 'pawn in personal feud' Who are the Gulenists? On Friday, a Turkish court sentenced Mr Brunson to three years in jail - but freed him because of the time he had already spent in detention. Additional espionage charges against him were also dropped by the court. Mr Brunson, seen here with his wife, was freed on Friday Mr Trump called the release a ""tremendous step"" towards a ""great relationship"" with Turkey. He insisted there had been no deal made with Turkey, but said the US would reconsider its ""very tough"" sanctions on the country. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump said the US felt ""very differently about Turkey"" in light of the pastor's release. When asked by a reporter if the release had any relation tothe disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the president said the timing was ""strict coincidence"". The pastor kneeled down to pray for Mr Trump in the Oval Office, asking that the president be made ""a great blessing to this country"". He then told reporters that he and his wife now wished to spend time with their children. In a statement earlier, Mr Brunson said his whole family ""thanks the president, the administration and Congress for their unwavering support"". After his release on Friday he flew from Izmir in western Turkey to a US base in Germany, and then on to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. Members of Mr Brunson's church celebrated in front of his house after he was released Mr Brunson lived in Turkey with his wife and three children for more than 20 years, most of it working for the small Izmir Resurrection Church, which had a congregation of about two dozen people. He was arrested in October 2016. The authorities accused him of having links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Gulenist movement, which Turkey blames for the 2016 failed coup. Turkey and US lock horns as relations sour Erdogan: Turkey's pugnacious president In July 2018 he was released from prison for health reasons and moved to house arrest until his trial. A few weeks later, the US imposed sanctions on Turkey's justice and interior ministers over his continued detention. Mr Brunson and US officials insisted he was innocent of all charges. Dressed in a black suit, white shirt and red tie, Mr Brunson, who was one of 20 Americans charged after the coup attempt two years ago, told the court he was ""an innocent man"". The pastor was convicted on charges of aiding terror groups while not being a member of them, and sentenced to three years in prison. The court took into account the time he had already spent in detention, lifting his house arrest and overseas travel ban. When the verdict was read out, he wept and hugged his wife Norine. By Mark Lowen, BBC Turkey Correspondent President Erdogan has always insisted that he could not meddle with Turkey's judicial independence and that only the courts would decide Pastor Brunson's fate. But the World Economic Forum places Turkey 103rd of 137 countries in the independent judiciary rankings and Turkey-watchers knew it would always come down to a political decision. In the end, pressure from Washington on Ankara was too much. Sanctions, trade tariffs and the threat of more had led US-Turkey relations to nosedive - and with them, the Turkish lira. Facing spiralling inflation, a 40% drop in the value of the currency and the start of an economic crisis, Turkey had to act to normalise relations with the US. Mr Brunson was the key. Andrew Brunson had the American government behind him. Deniz Yucel, the former correspondent of Die Welt, who was imprisoned and then finally freed in Turkey, had the German government supporting him. Tens of thousands of others here who claim wrongful imprisonment don't have the backing of a powerful state to resist what they say is Turkey's politicised judiciary. Pastor Brunson's detention has soured relations between Washington and Ankara, who are allies in Nato, with both sides imposing sanctions on the other. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blames Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen for the attempted coup but Mr Gulen, who is based in Pennsylvania, denies any involvement. Turkey wants the US to agree to his extradition. US support for Kurdish forces fighting the Syrian civil war has also angered Mr Erdogan, who views them as an extension of the PKK. The PKK - a Turkish-Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy since the 1980s - is considered a terrorist group by Turkey and the US. Allow Twitter content?

"Daniel Olaloko, known as Trigga T, left, and Peter Adebayo A drill rapper from south London has been jailed for seven years for selling drugs in a county lines operation. Trigga T, real name Daniel Olaloko, 19, admitted supplying heroin and crack cocaine in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. The teenager was a member of the Silwood Nation drill group. He was a pharmacology student and had previously auditioned for ITV's X Factor in 2016. Peter Adebayo, 19, also received seven years, having also admitted two charges of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. Drill music often features rappers talking about violence and can be used to fuel rivalries between gangs, leading critics to link it to crime. But artists defend it as representing what is happening in their communities, as well as offering a way out for some from deprived areas. Is it right to blame the music genre for violence? Olaloko, who studied at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston, was arrested in a dawn raid at his halls of residence in April. When police searched his room, they found a sword, knives, four cheap mobile phones, wraps of heroin and crack cocaine and Â£480 in cash. There was also a Silwood Nation t-shirt. This video can not be played Daniel Olaloko rapped about money, drugs and violence At an earlier hearing, the 19-year-old, who grew up in Deptford and Bermondsey in south London, gave his address as ""the management suite"" at the halls of residence. In a simultaneous raid in April at an address in Manchester, police arrested Adebayo. Searching his room, officers found mobile phones used to sell drugs in Barrow. They also found quantities of drugs alongside weighing scales and mixing agents ready to be processed. Olaloko was on Twitter as Trigga T Adebayo pleaded guilty to two charges of conspiring to supply drugs in Barrow and was also sentenced to seven years in prison. Between December and April,at least 12 people diedof suspected drug overdoses in the town - which has a population of 67,000 people. Prosecutor Jonathan Dickinson said Olaloko and Adebayo were ""towards the top end of the conspiracy"" to supply people in Barrow with heroin and crack cocaine. They operated as part of a gang known as Nation, which supplied drugs from London, some 300 miles away. The Nation - named after Olaloko's drill rap group - are understood to have started operating in Barrow last September. A key breakthrough for police was the arrest in March of a vulnerable 17-year-old girl from London. She was found in a flat in Egerton Court in Barrow. When she was searched, officers found 53 wraps of ready-to-sell heroin and crack cocaine had been inserted inside her. The court was told Olaloko and Adebayo ""had control"" over the girl. Joshua Adam, 24, again from London, also pleaded guilty to supplying Class A drugs and received a four and a half years in prison. A 17-year-old from Manchester was sentenced to an 18-month detention and training order. They were all sentenced at Burnley Crown Court. He was arrested in dawn raids at halls of residence at the University of Central Lancashire in April Olaloko's family described him as a quiet, studious boy. He auditioned for the X Factor talent show in 2016 but failed to make the TV auditions. Instead, he focused on drill music, rapping about drugs, money, violence and sex in his videos. He was described as doing well in college until his arrest - after which he was suspended immediately, the University of Central Lancashire said. ""These men operated as a sophisticated and relentless organised crime group,"" said Detective Chief Inspector Nick Coughlan. ""They targeted vulnerable people to facilitate their illegal activities and they used fear and intimidation to operate their business. ""So during this operation, officers removed not just drugs from being sold on the streets, but a substantial quantity of illegal and dangerous weapons."" Peter Adebayo, who was also arrested in April, was sentenced for seven years Police in Barrow are struggling to cope with the changing nature of drug supply in the town. London gangs have joined groups from Liverpool, the usual drug sellers in Barrow, in running county lines operations. So-called county lines are when city-based dealers use children or adults to move drugs or illicit money around the country, or put up drug dealers in rural communities. Competition is fierce and the London gangs in particular are bringing violence - and the threat of violence - including knives and guns, into the town. One drug user in Barrow said the Londoners now ruled the town, and that it was ""easier than ever"" to buy illegal drugs. Police, working alongside the local council and charities, are planning to open a community centre next month in Egerton Court, long a magnet for drug users and sellers. The hub will provide support and advice to residents, offering them an alternative to the pushers. ""One of the things I need to look at is how I reduce the demand for those drugs,"" said Inspector Jim Bailey. ""And one of the ways to do that is to come here and work with those people who are subject to taking drugs - vulnerable, isolated - and try to tackle that.""

"This video can not be played Wada officials 'disrespected' me - Scott tells BBC sports editor Dan Roan The chair of the World Anti-Doping Agency's (Wada) Athlete Committee says some of the organisation's most senior officials tried to ""bully"" her over her opposition to Russian reinstatement. Beckie Scott told the BBC she was ""treated with disrespect"" at a recent meeting and faced ""inappropriate"" comments and gestures from some members of Wada's executive committee. The Canadian former Olympic cross-country skiing champion resigned from a Wada panel last month in protest at its highly controversial recommendation to end the suspension of Russia from international competition after a state-sponsored doping scandal. In her first interview since stepping down, Scott said the treatment she faced was ""indicative of a general attitude of dismissal and belittling of the athlete voice"". In a statement, Wada admitted ""tensions were running high"" at last month's meeting, and that the strong views on both sides of the debate ""do affect the tone and atmosphere"" but ""the athletes' voice was clearly heard"". It said Scott's concerns ""were being taken seriously"". In September the BBC revealed Wada's leadership had secretly softened two key criteria to help bring Russia back into compliance after a three-year suspension. Once Russia agreed to comply, Wada's compliance review committee (CRC) recommended reinstatement,prompting an outcry from many athletesand national anti-doping agencies. Scott, who is a former International Olympic Committee (IOC) member and one of the most high-profile athletes in the anti-doping movement, says she resigned because she ""fundamentally disagreed"" with her colleagues on the CRC. ""I felt it was a compromise,"" she said. ""I don't think it was acceptable to clean athletes, especially in light of the affront to clean sport that had taken place. ""It was an altering of a 'roadmap' that was established by Wada in order to regain compliance. And it was basically a reversal of the conditions, so compliance was established before conditions had been met. ""I think from an athletes' perspective that is such an affront because no-one is altering rules and regulations to ensure athletes reach their goals or achieve their results."" Former cross-country skier Beckie Scott is a three-time Olympian Wada's all-important 12-person executive committee then held a meeting in the Seychelles to formally approve Russia's reinstatement. It was there, Scott claims, as she made a presentation, that she faced ""upsetting"" comments by some of the members representing the Olympic movement ""definitely designed to denigrate, to belittle... and to bully"". ""I felt an intense amount of pressure going into that meeting. There was laughter when I read out the list of athlete committees who were confronting the decision [over Russia],"" she said. ""At the time it was upsetting, and on reflection it's a tactic, a manoeuvre and born out of a long-standing belief that athletes don't have to be part of this conversation."" Scott says she was ""disappointed"" neither Wada's president Sir Craig Reedie or director-general Olivier Niggli stepped in at the time. ""There was no confrontation or challenging of that behaviour at the time it took place,"" she said. ""I think it's indicative of the leadership of Wada's alignment with the Olympic movement."" Wada head Reedie defends Russian reinstatement decision Wada said Scott had shared her concerns in writing with its leadership and they were being taken seriously, with Reedie already responding to her. However, it denied Scott's suggestion its leadership had become aligned with the Olympic movement as ""completely and demonstrably untrue"". ""The leadership of Wada are independent and have shown time and time again that they make decisions exclusively in the best interests of the organisation and fight against doping,"" it said. ""In fact, this independence has led to criticism of Wada leadership by the very bodies with whom Miss Scott claims they are aligned."" Russia has made a qualified admission that its government was involved in an intricate and extensive doping conspiracy. It has also agreed to turn over data and doping samples that could help corroborate positive tests, with Wada insisting Russia will be made non-compliant again if it fails to meet ""strict conditions"". Scott accepts she did initially consider a means of breaking the deadlock that had developed with Russia over the terms for reinstatement, but became opposed once she understood the ramifications. The athletes' commission of the IOC said it ""agreed in principle"" with the ending of the suspension, and Wada has pointed out it was backed by a majority of government representatives. Reedie said some athletes did not fully understand Wada's intentions, a suggestion Scott described as ""quite offensive"". ""Would we be having this conversation if it was a nation with far smaller resources or far smaller teams participating in Olympic Games? We are talking about a superpower in sport and the influence and pressure that they are able to exert, even within Wada, has been remarkable."" Scott says the time had come for far-reaching reforms of Wada's governance, with athletes given a vote on the executive committee, as well as representatives of the Olympic movement and governments. She said she ""100% supported"" the proposals of British Paralympic medallist and Ukad athlete representative Ali Jawad, who hasdemanded an overhaul of Wada's governance structure. ""This is a real opportunity for change,"" Scott said. ""There has been an incredible loss of confidence and faith in the organisation. Athletes have been galvanised by this and expressed their frustration on a level I've never seen before. ""We have fallen under the pressure of politics, and we need a return to integrity based decision-making. ""If we go the way of sport just becoming a political arena then something is really lost and we're in danger of that right now."" United States Anti-Doping Agency CEO Travis Tygart said in a statement that Scott's claims ""present a damning reflection of the fragile state of the WADA-led global anti-doping system as it exists today."" He said: ""It's appalling Olympic sport leaders would attempt to suppress athletes' voices. ""Beckie Scott speaks for the huge majority - the silent majority - of athletes and fans when she says confidence in Wada has never been lower. ""There is now a perceptible and deafening noise from the global athlete community for change."" Beckie Scott is the nearest thing the Olympic and Paralympic athlete community has to a figurehead. A highly respected former IOC member, and the most senior athlete representative inside Wada, her explosive claims will be highly damaging for Wada's beleaguered leadership as it faces an unprecedented backlash from western athletes over its decision to reinstate Russia. With some critics suggesting Wada lacks the independence from the Olympic movement to be fit for purpose, this will only add to the pressure that the regulator is now under. Especially a week after the US indicted seven Russian spies for hacking in connection with the alleged hacking of Wada officials.

"Facebook first shared details of the attack last week, fearing as many as 50m people had been affected Facebook has said it will not provide identity fraud protection for the victims of its latest data breach. On Friday it revealed 14 million users had highly personal information stolen by hackers. It included search history, location data and information about relationships, religion and more. However, unlike other major hacks involving big companies, Facebook said it had no plans to provide protection services for concerned users. One analyst told the BBC the decision was ""unconscionable"". ""This kind of information could help thieves create social engineering-based theft programmes, preying on the Facebook hack victims,"" said Patrick Moorhead, from Moor Insights and Strategy. Users canvisit this link,externalto find out if they have been directly affected. For the most severely impacted users - a group of around 14 million, Facebook said - the stolen data included  ""username, gender, locale/language, relationship status, religion, hometown, self-reported current city, birthdate, device types used to access Facebook, education, work, the last 10 places they checked into or were tagged in, website, people or pages they follow, and the 15 most recent searches"". Typically, companies affected by large data breaches - such as Target, in 2013 - provide access to credit protection agencies and other methods to lower the risk of identity theft. Other hacked companies, such as on the Playstation Network, and credit monitoring agency Equifax, offered similar solutions. A Facebook spokeswoman told the BBC it would not be taking this step ""at this time"". Users would instead be directed to the website's help section. ""The resources we are pointing people toward are based on the actual types of data accessed - including the steps they can take to help protect themselves from suspicious emails, text messages, or calls,"" the spokeswoman said. She would not say if the help pages in question had been updated since the company discovered the recent breach. News of the hack emerged on 5 October when Facebook said it feared 50m users had been affected. On Friday, the company revised downwards its estimate to ""about 30m"". ""We have not ruled out the possibility of smaller-scale attacks, which we're continuing to investigate,"" Facebook's head of product management, Guy Rosen,wrote in a blog post,external. The stolen data could be highly valuable for hackers, said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology. ""What I'm worried about is about being able to break into other accounts,"" he said. ""If you look at the list of data, it's not financial data. But there is stuff in there that's useful for 'knowledge-based authentication', which is definitely important for setting up accounts."" He said Facebook should perhaps offer free premium access to password managers and other similar software. In Europe, the hack means Facebook faces a potential fine of up to $1.63bn (Â£1.25bn), approximately 4% of its annual global revenue. The breach is being seen as the first major test of the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which came into force in May. ""Today's update from Facebook is significant now that it is confirmed that the data of millions of users was taken by the perpetrators of the attack,"" the Irish Data Protection Commission wrote on Twitter.

"This video can not be played Vehicles are seen struggling along flooded Exmouth seafront About 2,000 homes and businesses have lost power and some flood defences have failed as Storm Callum batters the UK. Some coastal flood defences in Exmouth, Devon, have been breached and a yellow weather warning is in place for the west coast and north-east of England, parts of Wales and Northern Ireland. Wind speeds recorded in the Scilly Isles hit 76mph and 64mph at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall. In Northern Ireland, power has been lost to 500 properties. The weather has caused the cancellation of a number of flights in Exeter, Bristol, Belfast City, the Isle of Man and Cardiff. Western Power Distribution said about 1,080 properties were without electricity in Cornwall,Â while Electricity North West said 419 customers in Cumbria and Lancashire were affected. Cornwall is being battered by Storm Callum Rail passengers travelling to and from south-west England faced cancellations and delays of more than two and a half hours after power cables fell on to the track between Totnes and Plymouth. The line has since re-opened but Cross Country Trains has cancelled all further services through the area. A spokesperson for Great Western Railway said that it was still operating and every effort would be made to get people home. There are about 1,080 properties without electricity in Cornwall A coach full of children had a narrow escape when a tree fell into the path of their school bus near St Agnes in Cornwall. The driver, Alan Nielson, said it came down 10-15 seconds before they pulled on to the road. Village's evacuation warning as storm hits Storm disrupts travel and power supplies Several vehicles have been damaged by falling trees in the Biddulph area of Staffordshire. Trees have also blocked roads near Audley in Staffordshire and Nantwich in Cheshire, police said. Cormac, an engineering and construction contractor for Cornwall Council, said it had dealt with reports of 30 fallen trees and about 25 flooding cases in the past 12 hours. A tree came down about 10-15 seconds before this coach pulled into its path The emergency services and authorities have urged people to avoid taking unnecessary risks after a man was spotted swimming with seals in Dawlish, Devon. Another swimmer, Ross Edgley, who is attempting to complete a 2,000 mile swim around Britain, is floating on a boat in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, waiting for the North Sea to calm down enough for him to continue. The 32-year-old is not allowed to step foot on land under the rules of the challenge. Storm Callum halts 2,000-mile swimmer Live updates as Storm Callum batters the South West The Environment Agency submitted plans earlier this month to improve the flood defences in Exmouth. If approved the Â£12m works will help protect the currently flooded esplanade and highway by stopping the flow of water from nearby roads. This large tree outside Audley in Staffordshire was felled by high winds ""The storm has come in so we are just having to wait it out,"" says Ross Edgley Storm Callum is the third named storm this year after Storm Ali and Storm Bronagh last month. In Wales, the worst of the rain is expected to hit south-facing hills with up to 200mm falling in a 36-hour period, according to the Met Office. A yellow warning for the country is likely to cause problems on the roads, rail and ferries, while motorists have been warned to be prepared for poor driving conditions. In Northern Ireland a yellow warning has been issued for strong winds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkish officials have audio and video evidence that shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the BBC has been told. Mr Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government, has not been seen since he entered the building on 2 October. Turkish intelligence had ""documented evidence"" of the murder, a source close to the investigation said. Saudi Arabia's interior minister has dismissed the accusations. According to the official Saudi Press Agency, Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Naif bin Abdulaziz said ""orders to kill him are lies and baseless allegations"". What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance Saudi ties with West at risk over Khashoggi The journalist who vanished into a consulate Saudi Arabia has maintained the journalist left the building, with the minister saying the kingdom was keen to discover ""the whole truth"", according to the news agency. Mr Khashoggi's disappearance and reported death have prompted international outrage and dented business confidence in Saudi Arabia. Tycoon Sir Richard Branson has halted talks over $1bn Saudi investmentin Virgin space firms and several top business leaders and media groups have pulled out of a Saudi investment conference later this month. However, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told American news network CNBC he was still planning to attend the conference, despite the House of Representatives' foreign affairs committee writing to President Donald Trump urging him to reconsider. The latest reports suggest an assault and a struggle took place in the consulate. A Turkish security source has confirmed to BBC Arabic the existence of an audio and a video recording. What is not clear is if anyone other than Turkish officials has seen or heard them. One source is cited by the Washington Post saying men can be heard beating Mr Khashoggi; it adds that the recordings show he was killed and dismembered. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death ""You can hear his voice and the voices of the men speaking Arabic,"" a separate source told the Post. ""You can hear how he was interrogated, tortured and then murdered"". Mr Khashoggi is a contributing columnist for the newspaper. Earlier this week leading columnist Kemal Ozturk, considered close to the Turkish government, alleged there was a video of the moment Jamal Khashoggi was killed. Turkish TV has already broadcast CCTV footage of the moment Mr Khashoggi walked into the consulate for an appointment at which he was due to receive papers for his forthcoming marriage to Turkish fiancÃ©e Hatice Cengiz. Saudi UK envoy 'concerned' over Khashoggi Turkish press trail Khashoggi's last steps Missing Saudi writer gets blank column Separately, a video has emerged of men described as Saudi intelligence officers entering and leaving Turkey. A 15-strong team has been identified by Turkish media who are described as involved in Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. The BBC has been told that one was Maher Mutreb, an intelligence colonel based in London, and another was thought to be a forensics specialist. Turkey's official line is that Mr Khashoggi is missing but that it knows ""for sure"" he has been killed. However, the government has agreed to a joint investigation with the Saudis, and a Saudi delegation arrived in Turkey on Friday to take part in talks expected over the weekend. Their arrival came a day after a senior Saudi royal figure, Prince Khaled al-Faisal, was said to have briefly visited Turkey amid signs that the Saudi monarchy was seeking an urgent solution to the diplomatic crisis between the two countries. A Saudi delegation arrived in Turkey on Friday ahead of talks expected to take place at the weekend Mr Khashoggi's disappearance threatens the reputation of the new Saudi Crown Prince, Mohamed bin Salman, and his country's relationships across the world, the BBC's Turkey correspondent Mark Lowen reports. By Jane Kinninmont, Middle East expert, The Elders Foundation Jamal Khashoggi's disappearance and alleged murder has sent a chill through writers and activists, in Saudi Arabia and more broadly across the Middle East. They ask: If this could happen to someone as well known and well connected as Jamal Khashoggi, a US resident and Washington Post writer, what else could happen to the less well-known? Mr Khashoggi did not position himself as a dissident. A former adviser to two Saudi princes, he criticised some aspects of Saudi policy, like the war in Yemen and the lack of free speech, while praising others, like the social reforms of new Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman. He argued for reform rather than regime change - which is a very widespread stance among Saudis. There are many people there who seek a greater voice in how to improve their society without being enemies of the state.

"Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank went on a carriage procession around Windsor It was inevitable there'd be comparisons with this year's other royal wedding in Windsor. But while Prince Harry's wedding to Meghan Markle brought the town to a standstill in May, there was the feeling that the more low-key atmosphere for his cousin Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's nuptials was actually quite welcome. Yes, there were still the die-hard royal fans in Union Jack outfits, who'd put up bunting around the section of security barrier where they'd staked their claim to a prime viewing spot. Even before the sun rose on Friday, people were sat out in camping chairs, sipping much-needed coffee from flasks and takeaway cups. Meet the bride and groom Royal wedding in pictures Princess Eugenie marries Jack Brooksbank Royal wedding guests sell goody bags online And yes, there was a huge police presence, as you'd expect for an event with thousands of members of the public attending - but the crowds were rather thinner on the ground than they had been in May. And while some spoke of an ""electric"" party atmosphere at the Sussexes' wedding, this was more of a sedate affair. One onlooker said she'd use the word ""calm"" to sum up the atmosphere. So it was more like a family event perhaps - albeit with a smattering of A-list guests - than a state occasion. After all, Princess Eugenie grew up just down the road and - as the Dean of St George's Chapel, David Conner, said - she regards it as her parish church. To her, this was the equivalent of getting married at the church nearest to her mum and dad's place, with the local vicar doing the honours. Left to right: Friends Helen Freeman, Gemma Morgan, Rachel Price-Greenow and Alice Smart Well-wisher Gemma Morgan, who'd travelled from Hereford to watch the newlyweds process through the streets in a carriage, noted: ""I was speaking to someone who runs a shop here, who was telling us this wedding feels more like a community event - it's really relaxed and friendly."" In a very British touch, the goody bags distributed to the guests who watched proceedings inside the grounds - having won their spot in a public ballot - contained a biodegradable emergency rain poncho (as well as a giant chocolate coin, a fridge magnet and a can of water, rather than a bottle, as Eugenie had stipulated it was to be a plastic-free wedding).

There was a nice nod to some Princess Eugenie's charity work too. The cloth bags, emblazoned with the newlyweds' initials and wedding date, were made by women and girls from the Women's Interlink Foundation, an Indian charity which she supports. There were representatives too from other charities she works with, such as the Teenage Cancer Trust, whose nurses were among those invited to the castle to be part of the big day. Hold on to your hats: Best wedding moments Royal wedding as it happened What's the cost and who's paying? Despite the expected rain, it stayed dry (so no need for that poncho) with the gusting winds more of a concern for the guests desperately holding on to their hats as they made their way into the chapel. The dry weather was appreciated by the crowds just outside the grand Henry VIII gates of the castle, who settled for following the service on their phones because it was going on just on the other side of the walls. Some of them burst into a rousing God Save the Queen when the anthem was played at the end of the wedding - others readied their cameras and phones in anticipation of seeing the newlyweds. Jack Brooksbank and Eugenie waved to well-wishers outside the chapel The sun came out in time for them to glimpse the happy couple and church bells were ringing - and then suddenly there was a cry of ""They're here!"" The cheers were the polite, good-natured sort rather than being deafening, as flags and hands were waved in the direction of the bride and groom (who gamely waved back). ""You look stunning!"" shouted one person, above the applause and cries of congratulations. Most people were beaming but some looked emotional - and then, the moment was over. The crowds hung around for a bit, with some whispering ""Was that it?"" - hoping, perhaps, to see some of the other royals. But although brief, most said it was worth the wait. Margaret Feneck, 80, from Coffs Harbour, Australia, who made the trip to Windsor especially during her holiday to Europe, said: ""She was stunning, wasn't she? She was on our side of the street - and I was waving too hard I forgot to take a picture."" Crowds cheered the royal couple as their carriage travelled through Windsor But fellow Australian Babs Tahana, from Perth, said: ""She was beautiful - but I had thought there might be more people here. ""I wanted to come though as I might not see another royal wedding."" Another well-wisher described the atmosphere as ""flat"" but added: ""It's still nice to be a part of it - we're local and we like to join in with things like this."" By early afternoon, the town had returned to normal, with security barriers taken away and just the bunting, the odd discarded flag and the remaining film cameras a reminder that anything had gone on. For the happy couple, it has been just as extraordinary and magical as anyone else's wedding day is - but after the brief hubbub, for Windsor, and the people who'd headed to its streets, it was back to being another ordinary day.

"This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the destruction in Mexico Beach, Florida Hurricane Michael has landed on a Florida beach town like the ""mother of all bombs"", almost wiping it off the map, officials say. The storm smashed into the state's north-west coast near Mexico Beach on Wednesday with 155mph (250km/h) winds. The hurricane, one of the most powerful in US history, has killed 16 people, with fears the toll will rise. Rescuers ""still haven't got to some of the hardest-hit areas"", emergency management officials say. Mexico Beach is yet to report any fatalities, but rescuers working there have yet to carry out a thorough search of the devastated area. Meanwhile, more than 1m homes remain without power in Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Virginia and the Carolinas. In pictures: Before and after How to survive a monster storm Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Michael, which fell just 2mph short of a top-level category five, ripped apart entire neighbourhoods before moving out to sea by Friday morning. The hurricane's shrieking winds and wall of water swept beachfront homes off their foundations, snapped boats in two and knocked over 30-tonne freight rail cars like toys. By Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Mexico Beach One of the first things you notice as you walk into Mexico Beach is the stillness. No wind, almost no-one on the street, just the beating hot sun and the tossed and scattered debris - the calling card of a monstrous storm. And then you hear faint bleeping sounds coming from all directions - a dissonant symphony of high-pitched notes that turn out to be myriad small alarms, still transmitting their warnings from the batteries which power them. Much of the damage in Mexico Beach, Florida was caused by the over-100mph winds. On the left, as we walk, there's a mattress slumped at the roadside, on the right a Dean Koontz novel lies in the dirt. A little further on, and a woman, accompanied by a friend, is sifting through the remains of her home, loading what she can salvage into the boot of  a car. This was her dream retirement place she tells me - the last four years spent doing it up. ""I'll never step back in there,"" she says through her tears. The sheer force of Hurricane Michael has been well analysed, but it's only when you see the everyday stuff of people's lives crushed, broken, smashed to pieces, that you realise they will be living with this long after we have gone. One weeping resident of Mexico Beach pictured on CNN struggled to even find her street, let alone her home. Tom Bailey, the town's former mayor, told the New York Times: ""The mother of all bombs doesn't do any more damage than this."" Some 285 people in the community - population 1,000 - defied a mandatory evacuation order and stayed behind to ride out the storm. A Mexico Beach home knocked from its foundations An insurance firm, Karen Clark & Company, estimated Michael caused about $8bn (Â£6bn) in damage. Flash flooding affected the big North Carolina cities of Charlotte and Raleigh and parts of Virginia. Police said there were five suspected tornados in Virginia. But it was Florida's Panhandle that bore the brunt of the tempest. Thousands of military, police and rescue teams are converging on the area. Marianna, Florida US Army personnel have been using heavy equipment to clear away fallen trees so rescuers can reach any trapped residents. Trees around Marianna Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) crews are using dogs, drones and GPS in the search. Flooding destroyed 1,000 homes in the small town of Port St Joe, not far from Mexico Beach. A toppled train in Panama City, Florida The number of people in emergency shelters was expected to reach 20,000 across five states by Friday, said the American Red Cross. The 16 known storm-related deaths so far are: Three in North Carolina, one in Georgia, seven in Florida and five in Virginia. In North Carolina, one motorist was killed when a tree fell on his car, while two others died when their car crashed into a tree felled by heavy winds. Eleven-year-old Sarah Radney, who was visiting her grandparents in Seminole County, Georgia, died when a metal carport near their home was lifted by powerful winds and slammed through their roof. Are hurricanes getting worse? A guide to the world's deadliest storms In Virginia, police said four of the deaths were due to drowning - including one man who drowned when his vehicle was caught in flash floods in Pittsylvania County. The waters were too turbulent for rescuers to reach him, officials say. Firefighter Lt Brad Clark died when a truck hit his fire engine on a rain-slicked road at the scene of a crash in Hanover County, Virginia, on Thursday night. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!""Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/hSome minor flooding, little structural damage.Storm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/hRoofs and trees could be damaged.Storm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/hHouses suffer damage, severe floodingStorm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/hSome roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses.Storm surge +4m-5.5m Hurricane Ike (2008) hit Caribbean islands and Louisiana and was blamed for at least 195 deaths Winds 252km/h+Serious damage to buildings, severe flooding further inland.Storm surge +5.5m Hurricane Irma (2017) caused devastation in Caribbean islands, leaving thousands homeless ""For everyone thinking they can ride this storm out, I have news for you: that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life.""Mayor of New Orleans Ray Nagin ahead of Hurricane Gustav, 2008 Click arrow to proceed Loading ...

"This video can not be played Vehicles are seen struggling along flooded Exmouth seafront About 2,000 homes and businesses have lost power and some flood defences have failed as Storm Callum batters the UK. Some coastal flood defences in Exmouth, Devon, have been breached and a yellow weather warning is in place for the west coast and north-east of England, parts of Wales and Northern Ireland. Wind speeds recorded in the Scilly Isles hit 76mph and 64mph at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall. In Northern Ireland, power has been lost to 500 properties. The weather has caused the cancellation of a number of flights in Exeter, Bristol, Belfast City, the Isle of Man and Cardiff. Western Power Distribution said about 1,080 properties were without electricity in Cornwall,Â while Electricity North West said 419 customers in Cumbria and Lancashire were affected. Cornwall is being battered by Storm Callum Rail passengers travelling to and from south-west England faced cancellations and delays of more than two and a half hours after power cables fell on to the track between Totnes and Plymouth. The line has since re-opened but Cross Country Trains has cancelled all further services through the area. A spokesperson for Great Western Railway said that it was still operating and every effort would be made to get people home. There are about 1,080 properties without electricity in Cornwall A coach full of children had a narrow escape when a tree fell into the path of their school bus near St Agnes in Cornwall.

The 32-year-old is not allowed to step foot on land under the rules of the challenge. Storm Callum halts 2,000-mile swimmer Live updates as Storm Callum batters the South West The Environment Agency submitted plans earlier this month to improve the flood defences in Exmouth. If approved the Â£12m works will help protect the currently flooded esplanade and highway by stopping the flow of water from nearby roads. This large tree outside Audley in Staffordshire was felled by high winds ""The storm has come in so we are just having to wait it out,"" says Ross Edgley Storm Callum is the third named storm this year after Storm Ali and Storm Bronagh last month. In Wales, the worst of the rain is expected to hit south-facing hills with up to 200mm falling in a 36-hour period, according to the Met Office. A yellow warning for the country is likely to cause problems on the roads, rail and ferries, while motorists have been warned to be prepared for poor driving conditions. In Northern Ireland a yellow warning has been issued for strong winds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Caesarean procedures can save lives - but can also risk them unnecessarily Doctors' use of Caesarean section to deliver babies has nearly doubled in 15 years to reach ""alarming"" proportions in some countries, a study says. Rates surged from about 16 million births (12%) in 2000 to an estimated 29.7 million (21%) in 2015, the report in the medical journal The Lancet said. The nation with the highest rate for using the surgery to assist childbirth is the Dominican Republic with 58.1%. Doctors say in many cases the use of the medical procedure is unjustified. Until recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) suggested that Caesarean section - or C-section - rates of more than 15% were excessive. Women 'being denied Caesarean choice' Video: 'I had to fight for my C-section while in labour' The study analysed data from 169 countries using statistics from 2015 - the most recent year for which the information is available. It says there is an over-reliance on Caesarean section procedures - when surgery is used to help with a difficult birth - in more than half of the world's nations. Researchers reported a rate of more than 50% in the Dominican Republic, Brazil, Egypt and Turkey, though Brazil implemented a policy in 2015 to reduce the number of Caesarean sections performed by doctors. They also found huge disparities in the use of the technique between rich and poor nations. In some circumstances, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, the surgery is unavailable when it is genuinely required. Use in 2015 was up to 10 times more frequent in the Latin America and Caribbean region, at 44% of births, than in the west and central Africa region, where it was used in just 4% of cases. The study urges healthcare professionals, women and their families to only choose a Caesarean when it is needed for medical reasons - and for more education and training to be offered to dispel some of the concerns surrounding childbirth. A Caesarean section can be a life-saving procedure for both mother and infant if, for example, a baby is in an awkward position in the womb or if labour is not progressing as it should be. Jane Sandall, professor of social science and women's health at King's College London and an author of one of the studies, told the BBC that the risk for mothers and babies can be both short and long-term. ""In particular, C-sections have a more complicated recovery for the mother, and lead to scarring of the womb, which is associated with bleeding, abnormal development of the placenta, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth and preterm birth in subsequent pregnancies."" Prof Sandall says it is important to note that these are small but serious risks, but each of these risks increases with each time a woman undergoes the surgery. This video can not be played Caesarean sections: Why and when are they used? ""There is emerging evidence that babies born via C-section have different hormonal, physical, bacterial and medical exposures during birth, which can subtly alter their health. While the long-term risks of this are not well-researched, the short-term effects include changes in immune development which can increase the risk of allergies and asthma and alter the bacteria in the gut."" ""There is the risk that comes with any type of surgery,"" Prof Sandall said, adding that multiple Caesarean procedures lead to a higher risk of maternal mortality when compared with a natural birth. Earlier this week,the WHO published guidance highlighting the need to reduce unnecessary procedures,externalthat ""cannot be medically justified"". ""It is crucial that women who need Caesarean sections are able to access this potentially life-saving procedure,"" the WHO advises, adding that it is equally important that unnecessary procedures be avoided ""so women and their babies are not put at risk"". Prof Sandall says that reasons vary from country to country and that with poorer nations, choices are extremely limited. ""Globally, drivers for the increasing rates vary between countries and include a lack of midwives to prevent and detect problems, loss of medical skills to confidently and competently attend a [potentially difficult] vaginal delivery, as well as medico-legal issues."" She adds that financial incentives exist for both doctor and hospital with the certainty of planned day-time deliveries, especially in private practices. Why some mothers in China want August C-sections ""In some cases the trend is system-driven. In Brazil, for example, the free public healthcare system is of poorer quality and pregnant mothers who can't afford private healthcare might be offered the procedure to help clear patients more quickly through the system."" ""In China, a shortage of midwives can result in a lack of screening, meaning not only that necessary medical checks are not being carried out, but that there is a lack of expert help with assisting childbirth."" Variation exists within countries between the urban wealthy giving birth in private facilities where there are high rates of Caesarean section and the rural poor without access to the procedure, Prof Sandall says. ""The issue for women is how do you plan?"" Prof Sandall says. ""Conjecture that blames mothers for the high Caesarean section rate, either because of their poor health - eg, obesity, hypertension - or because they are demanding medically unnecessary Caesarean sections due to fear or disinterest in labour ignores the wider systems issues that drive the growing reliance on caesarean sections. ""Pregnant mothers must have access to professional and informed advice in order to make a decision."" She adds that the focus must now be on providing more frontline staff at facilities in countries where the issue is of greatest concern. ""We need to start working with insurance companies in these countries to help with the provision of services and staff, as well as dealing with local and national governments to invest in healthcare."" Campaigners say some women who request an elective Caesarean sometimes ""meet judgmental attitudes"". They argue that some expectant mothers who ask for the proceduremay be survivors of sexual abuse, or suffer from poor physical or mental health.,external A Caesarean section is when a baby is delivered by making a surgical cut in the abdomen and womb. They fall into three categories: elective - at the mother's request and sometimes for non-medical reasons planned - usually for medical reasons, such as the baby is either in the wrong position or very large emergency - usually because of complications during labour Recovering from Caesarean surgery usually takes longer than from a natural birth. The wound eventually forms a scar. Why are Caesarean sections used? Video, 00:00:58Why are Caesarean sections used?

"If there is no deal Eurostar trains and electricity supplies in Northern Ireland face possible disruption if the UK exits the EU without a deal, the government says. The latest batch of contingency papers,externalfor a no-deal Brexit warn rail services could be suspended without specific agreements with France and Belgium. The Single Electricity Market on the island of Ireland may cease to operate, hitting consumers on both sides. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK was prepared for all eventualities. Ministers have insisted they are striving for a negotiated agreement ahead of the UK's exit on 29 March 2019. But they are continuing to provide information to the public and businesses about the consequences if this does not happen. Credit card warning in UK's 'no-deal' plans Flights 'at risk' under no-deal Brexit No-deal Brexit planning shuts M26 overnight The latest tranche of documents, the fourth to be published so far, state that in the event of a no-deal exit, some train operators will have to apply for new licences, certificates and authorisations from an EU rail regulator to continue services. Operators such as Eurostar, which currently only hold a UK licence, would be affected unless individual agreements are struck with countries on the continent. The operator runs about 40 direct services a day, via the Channel Tunnel, from London to Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Rotterdam and other destinations. Mr Raab said people should not hold off buying rail tickets as the UK would work with its French, Belgian and Dutch counterparts to ensure they were able to travel and goods could be moved. But Labour said this would ""not reassure anyone"" as ""ministers have barely scratched the surface of what would need to be done in the event of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal"". In a separate development, the M26 in Kent is being shut overnight while work is done to see if it can be used as a ""parking lot"" for lorries, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, prompting complaints from road hauliers. This video can not be played ""Something like this that is going to disrupt operations so massively, we need advance notice of this"" says FTA's spokesperson The Lib Dems said a no-deal would be a ""catastrophe"" but people should not be ""scared"" into settling for what it said was Theresa May's flawed proposed agreement with the EU. Talks on the terms of the UK's exit are nearing a crunch point, with both sides pushing for an agreement by the middle of November at the latest. Brexit papers: What no deal could mean Brexit: Netflix 'passport' not yet decided Access to full Netflix content when travelling to the continent cannot be guaranteed British horses are a regular fixture in Europe's top races - but may face additional handicaps The latest documents cover more than 25 subjects ranging from package holidays to pesticides Documents released on Friday warn of the potential fallout to the electricity market in Northern Ireland if the current Single Electricity Market arrangements that apply on a north-south basis cannot be continued. The Department for Exiting the EU said it was keen to work with Dublin and Brussels to reach an agreement on maintaining existing arrangements whatever the outcome of the negotiations, including no deal. But it warned that there was a risk Northern Ireland would become separated from the Republic of Ireland, in energy terms, and that this would make the market ""less efficient"". In such a situation, it said regulators may have to use ""fall-back arrangements"" to ensure power is transmitted between Britain and Northern Ireland and to maintain the necessary generating capacity. Mr Raab said the Single Electricity Market was the product of bilateral co-operation between London and Dublin and he hoped this would continue. Even if it did not, he said the UK would be prepared. ""We have got interconnectors and the regulatory measures that the government can take to make sure that Northern Ireland maintains the energy supply it needs."" Current arrangements mean Northern Ireland is, in effect, reliant on electricity generated in the Republic On consumer rights,British subscribers to Netflix, Spotifyand other online entertainment could see their access to content limited when they travel to the EU's 27 remaining member states, depending on what local rights deals and portability agreements are struck. There would be no change for package holidaymakers unless their booking is with an EU-based firm and completed outside the UK - when they might not be protected from the firm going bust. In the event of a no-deal exit, the transportation of horses to the continent could also be disrupted. Unless the EU agrees to grant the UK ""third country status"" on the day it leaves, no horses will be allowed to travel to the continent - a potentially huge blow to the racing industry. The government said it was confident the UK meets the animal health requirements to secure an immediate listing as a third country, making it subject to the same rules as countries like Australia and New Zealand. But, it added ""in the event the UK is not a listed country equine movement to the EU could not take place"". The documents also state that the UK wants to maintain the benefits of the 40 free trade agreements with more than 70 countries that it is party to from being an EU member. Other subjects covered in Friday's documents include: Trading and moving endangered species protected by CITES Breeding animals Commercial fishing Exporting objects of cultural interest Funding for British Overseas Territories Sanctions policy Trade in rough diamonds Accounting and auditing practices Previous no-deal papers have warned of the risks of UK flights to the continent being grounded and Britons visiting the EU facing extra credit card charges.

"Patisserie Valerie has been saved from collapse after entrepreneur Luke Johnson, who owns 37% of the company, provided Â£20m in loans to the struggling chain. Mr Johnson agreed to lend Â£10m for three years to owners Patisserie Holdings plc, which the company said would provide ""immediate liquidity"". He has also provided a further bridging loan facility of up to Â£10m. The firm said it had also raised another Â£15m by issuing new shares. The directors said the company had required an immediate cash injection of no less than Â£20m, without which it could not continue trading in its present form. The cafe chain has been fighting for survival after revealing on Wednesday it had uncovered ""significant, and potentially fraudulent, accounting irregularities"". On Friday, the company said its finance director Chris Marsh had been arrested and released on bail. The Serious Fraud Office said it had ""opened a criminal investigation into an individual"". ""We can give no further information or comment at this time,""the SFO said,external, without naming the individual. Patisserie Valerie's shares were trading at 429p before they were suspended on Wednesday. It has five brands: Patisserie Valerie, Druckers - Vienna Patisserie, Philpotts, Baker & Spice and Flour Power City. Now, there are 206 stores across the chain and more than 2,500 staff as of May 2018. It was floated on the AIM stock market, for smaller companies, in 2014. The first Patisserie Valerie cafÃ© was opened on Frith Street in London's Soho district in 1926. In 1987 the Scalzo family bought the Old Compton Street store and ran the business. In 2006, Luke Johnson's Risk Capital Partners bought a majority stake when it had eight stores. Mr Johnson, who invested in Patisserie Valerie in 2006, is a serial entrepreneur who is best known for taking control of Pizza Express in 1993 before selling out in 1999. In 2001 he co-founded Risk Capital Partners, which owns stakes in companies including Majestic Bingo and swimming goods firm Zoggs. Patisserie Holding's directors said in a statement,externalthat once the share issue and loans had taken effect, the company would be able to continue trading in its present form ""for the foreseeable future"". ""Following the initial investigation, the directors can confirm that the group has net debt of approximately Â£9.8m,"" the statement said. However, it added that shareholders should be aware that investigations into the company's ""financial irregularities"" were at ""a very preliminary stage"". The statement also said that the irregularities were also likely to have affected the historical financial statements of the company.

"Robert Sharkey spent thousands of pounds of Marie Conlon's money on pepperoni pizzas A man who spent Â£6,000 of his dead neighbour's savings on pizzas has been told he faces jail. Robert Sharkey, 24, of Grays Hill, Bangor, was convicted of 11 charges last month after failing to report the woman had died, and then stealing from her. The judge said he had committed a ""wicked series of offences"". These included using one of Marie Conlon's debit cards to buy almost Â£6,000 worth of pepperoni pizzas. It occurred when he lived above her flat in Larkspur Rise, Poleglass. The judge told Sharkey: ""In any view this is a wicked, wicked series of offences against a decent woman who was clearly vulnerable because of her age."" ""This was disgraceful behaviour, it confronts every feeling of right-thinking people."" The court heard that 68-year-old Marie Conlon died at her flat in January 2015. The body of Marie Conlon was found in a flat at Larkspur Rise, off Suffolk Road, in west Belfast She was described as ""an extremely private person"" who made little attempt to keep in touch with her family. Sharkey has admitted that on October 2015 he noticed Ms Conlon's post piling up in a communal area of the flats and kicked her door in. He saw a handbag and money, and told police that he took around Â£50 because ""at the time I was worried about money."" As for discovering Ms Conlon's remains, he said he did not call the police because he was worried about calling them. He had been on probation after previously being convicted of disorderly behaviour. The court heard that Sharkey memorised the details of Ms Conlon's Bank card, and a later one issued to her address five months later. Over two years he used the details to buy almost Â£6,000 worth of pizza from Dominos. Every day, he bought a nine-inch pepperoni pizza with anchovies and two cans of juice to be delivered to his own address in the same block of flats. The staff at the pizza company were so used to this that they referred to him as the ""Fish Guy"". When police officers entered Sharkey's flat they found piles of empty pizza boxes from his online purchases with Ms Conlon's bank card details. Ms Conlon's pension was still being paid into her bank account because everyone except Sharkey was unaware of her death. The card was used to buy services from O2, Sainsbury's and Power NI. The court heard that Sharkey was careful to pay the rates bill on Ms Conlon's flat to avoid discovery. When ordering online he used an old phone and swapped SIM cards as another method of avoiding discovery. In total he defrauded Â£11,700 from Ms Conlon's estate. The defence told the court that Sharkey had offered Ms Conlon's family his ""sincerest, deepest apologies"" and had found his arrest was ""to a large extent a relief to him"". The judge remanded Sharkey in custody ahead of sentencing next Friday, and he told the defendant a custodial sentence was ""almost inevitable"".

"Cuadrilla has drilled two wells at its Preston New Road site in Lancashire Fracking for shale gas can go ahead for the first time in the UK since it was linked with earthquakes in 2011. Energy firm Cuadrilla has drilled two wells at its site in Lancashire since being given the go-ahead to extract shale gas by the government in 2016. Campaigner Bob Dennett tried to prevent work starting, arguing in the High Court that Lancashire County Council failed to assess safety risks properly. But Mr Justice Supperstone said there was ""no evidence"" to support the claim. Cuadrilla chief executive Francis Egan said he was ""delighted"". Fracking had been due to start on Saturday but bad weather has led to its postponement until Monday at the earliest. The Preston New Road site has been the scene ofrepeated protestsfrom environmentalists who object to fracking - hydraulic fracturing - and its potential impact on the environment. The process sees liquid pumped at high pressure deep underground to fracture rock and release gas. Work at Cuadrilla's Preese Hall site near Blackpool was suspended in 2011 afterit was linked with two earth tremors. Mr Dennett had applied for an interim injunction preventing Cuadrilla from fracking the UK's first horizontal shale gas well. This video can not be played Judith Moritz shows us around one of the UK's first horizontal exploration wells Dismissing the application, the judge said: ""The claimant first has to establish that there is a serious issue to be tried. ""I am satisfied that the claimant falls at the first hurdle."" He also refused permission for a judicial review of Lancashire County Council's emergency planning procedures regarding the site, saying he was ""entirely satisfied that the claim as formulated is unarguable"". Jamie Peters, of Friends of the Earth, said the court ruling was ""sad news for local residents"" and it was ""simply wrong to be heralding the start of a new fossil-fuel industry"". ""You can have fracking or you can deal with climate change - you can't do both,"" he added. This video can not be played The BBC's David Shukman explains how fracking works The judge heard several hours of submissions from Mr Dennett, the local authority and Cuadrilla on Thursday. What is fracking? Fracking given go-ahead by government Fracking gear brought to first UK wells Nathalie Lieven QC, for Cuadrilla, told the judge that ""every day, it costs Cuadrilla Â£94,000 to keep all that kit and equipment on site"". Marc Willers QC, for Mr Dennett, had argued that the county council's risk assessment which ""underpinned the hydraulic fracturing consent"" was ""fundamentally flawed"". Mr Willers said there was ""a serious issue as to whether or not there is a proper safety regime in place that would cope with and ensure the safety of the local residents in the event of an emergency, in the event of a well blowout or in the event of a major gas leak"". Cuadrilla said drilling at Preston New Road was still at the exploration phase and, once fracking began, the energy firm would test the flow rates of shale gas. Before shale gas can be extracted on a commercial basis, Cuadrilla would need new licences and permits to drill more wells.

"This video can not be played I will maintain fiscal firepower, says Mr Hammond The chancellor has opened the door to tax rises in the Budget, saying the government ""may have to raise a little more tax"" to pay for the NHS. Philip Hammond told the BBC he wanted to ""minimise"" any impact on the economy if taxes had to rise to cover the Â£20bn spending boost pledged for the NHS. ""We may have to raise a little more tax in order to support the NHS and deliver on our pledge,"" he said. However, he added, ""I am a low-tax Tory."" Speaking to me at the International Monetary Fund annual meeting in Bali, Mr Hammond said that if taxes have to go up, ""it's important that we do it in a way that minimises any negative impact on the economy, minimises the effect on people"". ""I will always do everything I can to minimise the necessity for any increases in taxation, and to keep the burden of taxes as low as I possibly can,"" he said. He refused to commit to keeping Conservative election manifesto promises made last year to raise the income tax threshold - so that workers pay less tax - and cut corporation tax for businesses. ""These are both very important commitments that were made,"" he said. ""We've also made a very important commitment to a big increase in funding for the National Health Service, something that we didn't anticipate at the time we wrote our manifesto. ""We're being very open and frank with the British people that if we're going to have rising standards of healthcare, with an ageing population in a world where technology is constantly making new treatments available, we are going to have to pay a little more to support that."" Hammond targets 'fake' self-employed Mr Hammond, who delivers his Budget in two weeks' time,said there had been a step-change in the Brexit negotiationsand that he expected an economic ""upturn"" if a deal was agreed with the rest of the European Union. He said that a public finances buffer of Â£15.4bn built up in case there is a disorderly Brexit could also be used to support public services. ""I will maintain fiscal firepower so that if we do find that things don't turn out the way we want, we have got the ability to support the British economy and minimise any effect,"" he said. ""But if we don't need that fiscal firepower, then of course it can be used for other things - either support for public services or further paying down of debt or indeed reducing taxes."" If there is no deal or a disorderly Brexit, then any dividend would be lost, he said. ""If we leave the EU without a deal, we will be in very different situation and we will need a different set of responses,"" he said.

"Rowling said she had done ""what we believe to be the right thing"" in sticking by Depp Johnny Depp has said he ""felt bad"" for author JK Rowling after the backlash she received for supporting his casting in the Fantastic Beasts film series. In December,Rowling saidshe was ""genuinely happy"" about Depp's casting, despite accusations of domestic violence by his ex-wife Amber Heard. ""JK has seen the evidence and therefore knows I was falsely accused,"" Depp toldEntertainment Weekly,external. ""That's why she has publicly supported me. She doesn't take things lightly."" He continued: ""She would not stand up if she didn't know the truth."" Heard filed for divorce from the actor after 15 months of marriage in May 2016. Her filing alleged a history of abuse throughout the relationship, which the actor has denied. Heard and Depp finalised their divorce in January 2017 Depp made a fleeting appearance as the wizard Grindelwald in the first Fantastic Beasts film in 2016, but will play a much larger part in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, which is due for release in November. Some fans threatened to boycott the sequel because of his role. ""I felt bad for JK having to field all these various feelings from people out there,"" the actor told Entertainment Weekly. ""I felt bad that she had to take that. ""But ultimately, there is real controversy. The fact remains I was falsely accused, which is why I'm suing the Sun newspaper for defamation for repeating false accusations."" In her statement in December, Rowling admitted that recasting the role was ""naturally considered"", but that she was ultimately ""comfortable"" sticking with Depp. Amid the controversy, Depp said he has found the Potter fans ""incredibly impressive"".

"Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank went on a carriage procession around Windsor It was inevitable there'd be comparisons with this year's other royal wedding in Windsor. But while Prince Harry's wedding to Meghan Markle brought the town to a standstill in May, there was the feeling that the more low-key atmosphere for his cousin Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's nuptials was actually quite welcome. Yes, there were still the die-hard royal fans in Union Jack outfits, who'd put up bunting around the section of security barrier where they'd staked their claim to a prime viewing spot. Even before the sun rose on Friday, people were sat out in camping chairs, sipping much-needed coffee from flasks and takeaway cups. Meet the bride and groom Royal wedding in pictures Princess Eugenie marries Jack Brooksbank Royal wedding guests sell goody bags online And yes, there was a huge police presence, as you'd expect for an event with thousands of members of the public attending - but the crowds were rather thinner on the ground than they had been in May. And while some spoke of an ""electric"" party atmosphere at the Sussexes' wedding, this was more of a sedate affair. One onlooker said she'd use the word ""calm"" to sum up the atmosphere. So it was more like a family event perhaps - albeit with a smattering of A-list guests - than a state occasion. After all, Princess Eugenie grew up just down the road and - as the Dean of St George's Chapel, David Conner, said - she regards it as her parish church. To her, this was the equivalent of getting married at the church nearest to her mum and dad's place, with the local vicar doing the honours. Left to right: Friends Helen Freeman, Gemma Morgan, Rachel Price-Greenow and Alice Smart Well-wisher Gemma Morgan, who'd travelled from Hereford to watch the newlyweds process through the streets in a carriage, noted: ""I was speaking to someone who runs a shop here, who was telling us this wedding feels more like a community event - it's really relaxed and friendly."" In a very British touch, the goody bags distributed to the guests who watched proceedings inside the grounds - having won their spot in a public ballot - contained a biodegradable emergency rain poncho (as well as a giant chocolate coin, a fridge magnet and a can of water, rather than a bottle, as Eugenie had stipulated it was to be a plastic-free wedding).

There was a nice nod to some Princess Eugenie's charity work too. The cloth bags, emblazoned with the newlyweds' initials and wedding date, were made by women and girls from the Women's Interlink Foundation, an Indian charity which she supports. There were representatives too from other charities she works with, such as the Teenage Cancer Trust, whose nurses were among those invited to the castle to be part of the big day. Hold on to your hats: Best wedding moments Royal wedding as it happened What's the cost and who's paying? Despite the expected rain, it stayed dry (so no need for that poncho) with the gusting winds more of a concern for the guests desperately holding on to their hats as they made their way into the chapel. The dry weather was appreciated by the crowds just outside the grand Henry VIII gates of the castle, who settled for following the service on their phones because it was going on just on the other side of the walls. Some of them burst into a rousing God Save the Queen when the anthem was played at the end of the wedding - others readied their cameras and phones in anticipation of seeing the newlyweds. Jack Brooksbank and Eugenie waved to well-wishers outside the chapel The sun came out in time for them to glimpse the happy couple and church bells were ringing - and then suddenly there was a cry of ""They're here!"" The cheers were the polite, good-natured sort rather than being deafening, as flags and hands were waved in the direction of the bride and groom (who gamely waved back). ""You look stunning!"" shouted one person, above the applause and cries of congratulations. Most people were beaming but some looked emotional - and then, the moment was over. The crowds hung around for a bit, with some whispering ""Was that it?"" - hoping, perhaps, to see some of the other royals. But although brief, most said it was worth the wait. Margaret Feneck, 80, from Coffs Harbour, Australia, who made the trip to Windsor especially during her holiday to Europe, said: ""She was stunning, wasn't she? She was on our side of the street - and I was waving too hard I forgot to take a picture."" Crowds cheered the royal couple as their carriage travelled through Windsor But fellow Australian Babs Tahana, from Perth, said: ""She was beautiful - but I had thought there might be more people here. ""I wanted to come though as I might not see another royal wedding."" Another well-wisher described the atmosphere as ""flat"" but added: ""It's still nice to be a part of it - we're local and we like to join in with things like this."" By early afternoon, the town had returned to normal, with security barriers taken away and just the bunting, the odd discarded flag and the remaining film cameras a reminder that anything had gone on. For the happy couple, it has been just as extraordinary and magical as anyone else's wedding day is - but after the brief hubbub, for Windsor, and the people who'd headed to its streets, it was back to being another ordinary day.

"Princess Eugenie is Queen's granddaughter and ninth in line to the throne She married Jack Brooksbank at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle Celebrities including Cara Delevingne and Robbie Williams were among 850 guests Prince George was a page boy, and Princess Charlotte a bridesmaid The couple invited 1,200 members of the public to watch the wedding Cherry Wilson and Vanessa Barford Thank you for reading our live coverage of the royal wedding. Here are our highlights from the marriage of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank:  Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent The focus of the day was of
course on the couple; an unsurprisingly nervous groom, his hand shaking at
times, his gaze twitching as he waiting for his bride.  A beaming
Princess, unable to control her joy. There was more; flawless
organisation, hat dysfunction as the wind blew and blew, hatchets buried as the
Duke of Edinburgh settled into a seat in near Sarah, Duchess of York with whom
he has had a frosty - sometimes frozen -  relationship. But most noticeable at
Windsor?  The applause that followed the national anthem, and the cheers
for the Queen as she left the Chapel. No-one
eclipses the Queen in the affections of the British public. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prince Philip ""took quite a big step"" towards reconciliation with the Duchess of York at today's wedding, according to a body language expert. Judi James said the Duke of Edinburgh was warm towards Sarah Ferguson and approached her with a smile, despite reported tensions between the pair after her divorce from Prince Andrew. ""You could tell the tension as soon as the duchess arrived in the church,"" she said. ""As soon as she walked in she pulled her arms into her side and put her head down."" But, she continued: ""She got quite the look from Philip, he smiled at her at least twice, almost as if he had planned to greet her warmly. ""That was quite a big step for the Duke of Edinburgh."" The duchess may not have been aware, however, as she was seated with her back to him. ""Unless she had eyes in the back of her head, she wouldn't have known,"" said Ms James. ""She probably didn't want to take the risk of turning round."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's wedding was attended by the majority of the royal family. But there was one very conspicuous absentee, the Duchess of Cornwall. Prince Charles's wife was actually in Scotland to visit a village school. The Duchess of Rothesay, as she is known in Scotland, had a longstanding invitation to the school in Aberdeenshire.   Maeve Henry, from Amersham, brought her three-year-old
daughter Elise Bright to Windsor as the little girl is âobsessed with
princessesâ. Elise said of Princess Eugenie: âShe looked pretty.â Maeve added: âElise loved it. It was a very nice calm day
out. ""Harryâs was chaos but this was really nice: there wasnât much of a spark,
and I wouldnât say it was electric - they could have done with some music for
the crowds. But calm is the word I would use to describe it.â Here are some more views from the crowds at Windsor,
where itâs estimated about 3,000 gathered to cheer Princess Eugenie and her new
husband. Jackie Brown, from Ashford, Surrey, said: âIâm such a
royal fan. Iâve always followed them, since Charles and Anne were youngsters. âIâd have liked to see more than just the carriage, but
Iâm so glad we came. We had a great time and spoke to people from all over the
world.â Georgina Moroney, from Swindon, said: âIâm a royal geek.
Itâs just all part of our heritage. Theyâre fantastic - I love the romance of
it all. âShe looked so radiant.â Hereâs a picture taken by Amy Gardner who was watching
and said the couple looked straight at her. âShe looked so beautiful - it was lovely. Itâs definitely
worth the wait,"" she said. ""They looked right at the camera, which was great.â Among the crowds watching Eugenie and Jack leaving the
castle in their carriage was a group of friends whoâd gathered especially for
the occasion. Rachel Price-Greenow, from Hereford, admitting she had a
tear in her eye watching the couple go by. âI got emotional,â she said. âI was quite teary. Itâs
just lovely. I love all the pomp and sense of occasion.â Her friend Helen Freeman, from Swansea, was wearing a
home-made fascinator with the coupleâs initials embroidered on top. âItâs a royal event - and youâve got to wear a fascinator
to a wedding,â she said. âThey just seem like a normal couple, which is great.â Gemma Morgan, also from Hereford, said: âSomeone in a
shop here was telling us this wedding feels more like a community event - itâs really relaxed and friendly.â Alice Smart, from Manchester, said: âThey seem really
sweet and humble. And itâs great to be here to celebrate this, as thereâs so
much unhappiness in the world.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A passage from the book was read by Princess Beatrice during the ceremony. Turns out it's because the novel's famous character Jay Gatsby has a special place in Princess Eugenie's relationship with Jack Brooksbank. The Dean of Windsor said the princess had read the book not long after meeting her husband and it made her think of him. Addressing the congregation, the dean said: ""The words that particularly reminded her of Jack concern Gatsby's smile. ""As we heard from the reading 'It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it ... it concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour'. ""Well, a few years have passed and Eugenie and Jack come here today to smile on each other, and to offer each other something like 'eternal reassurance' and the promise of an 'irresistible prejudice' in each other's favour.""

"Robert Sharkey spent thousands of pounds of Marie Conlon's money on pepperoni pizzas A man who spent Â£6,000 of his dead neighbour's savings on pizzas has been told he faces jail. Robert Sharkey, 24, of Grays Hill, Bangor, was convicted of 11 charges last month after failing to report the woman had died, and then stealing from her. The judge said he had committed a ""wicked series of offences"". These included using one of Marie Conlon's debit cards to buy almost Â£6,000 worth of pepperoni pizzas. It occurred when he lived above her flat in Larkspur Rise, Poleglass. The judge told Sharkey: ""In any view this is a wicked, wicked series of offences against a decent woman who was clearly vulnerable because of her age."" ""This was disgraceful behaviour, it confronts every feeling of right-thinking people."" The court heard that 68-year-old Marie Conlon died at her flat in January 2015. The body of Marie Conlon was found in a flat at Larkspur Rise, off Suffolk Road, in west Belfast She was described as ""an extremely private person"" who made little attempt to keep in touch with her family. Sharkey has admitted that on October 2015 he noticed Ms Conlon's post piling up in a communal area of the flats and kicked her door in. He saw a handbag and money, and told police that he took around Â£50 because ""at the time I was worried about money."" As for discovering Ms Conlon's remains, he said he did not call the police because he was worried about calling them. He had been on probation after previously being convicted of disorderly behaviour. The court heard that Sharkey memorised the details of Ms Conlon's Bank card, and a later one issued to her address five months later. Over two years he used the details to buy almost Â£6,000 worth of pizza from Dominos. Every day, he bought a nine-inch pepperoni pizza with anchovies and two cans of juice to be delivered to his own address in the same block of flats. The staff at the pizza company were so used to this that they referred to him as the ""Fish Guy"". When police officers entered Sharkey's flat they found piles of empty pizza boxes from his online purchases with Ms Conlon's bank card details. Ms Conlon's pension was still being paid into her bank account because everyone except Sharkey was unaware of her death. The card was used to buy services from O2, Sainsbury's and Power NI. The court heard that Sharkey was careful to pay the rates bill on Ms Conlon's flat to avoid discovery. When ordering online he used an old phone and swapped SIM cards as another method of avoiding discovery. In total he defrauded Â£11,700 from Ms Conlon's estate. The defence told the court that Sharkey had offered Ms Conlon's family his ""sincerest, deepest apologies"" and had found his arrest was ""to a large extent a relief to him"". The judge remanded Sharkey in custody ahead of sentencing next Friday, and he told the defendant a custodial sentence was ""almost inevitable"".

"Theresa May's Brexit proposals have divided her cabinet The prime minister would ""never agree"" to a permanent customs union with the EU, No 10 says, amid concern from ministers about Brexit compromises. They are thought to fear that Theresa May will agree to such a move, if a trade deal cannot be done in time. Downing Street insists any post-Brexit customs union would be ""time limited"". EU leaders meet next week for what has been described by European Council president Donald Tusk as a ""moment of truth for Brexit negotiations"". The EU leaders are not expected to reach agreement with the UK but they say they want to see if ""decisive progress"" has been made to convene a special summit in November, to finalise a deal. Tory-DUP Brexit war of words intensifies Latest no-deal Brexit contingency plans Laura Kuenssberg on the cabinet's customs union unease Hammond expects 'Brexit deal dividend' Meanwhile,it has emergedthat a motorway in Kent is being shut overnight as part of contingency preparations in case the Brexit negotiations ultimately fail and the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 without a deal. And Northern Ireland's DUP, which supports Theresa May's government in key Commons votes, has warned it could vote against her Budget next month, if Brexit negotiations result in trade barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK is due to leave both the customs union and the single market when it leaves the EU in March 2019. Trying to resolve what should happen on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - an EU member - has been a key sticking point in Brexit negotiations. Please upgrade your browser Brexit: All you need to know The UK and the EU both want to avoid a ""hard border"" - physical checks or infrastructure - should a long-term trade deal not be concluded before temporary post-Brexit arrangements designed to give businesses time to adjust come to an end in December 2020. Brussels has suggested that, if that happens, Northern Ireland should stay in the EU customs union - something the UK says is unacceptable as it would effectively create a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, down the Irish Sea. By BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake Delving into the detail can be fascinating, if frustrating, for those following Brexit closely. But the big picture is always important and that has been playing out for all to see over the past 24 hours. Theresa May, at a crucial stage in the negotiations, is having to work to keep her own sideonside. Days before a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels when both sides will want to show some sign of progress at least, ministers are worried about what the UK could be about to agree to. Those unsure have a choice, stay and hope for the best or decide they can't support the prime minister's plan after all. In June the UK government brought forward its proposal for a""temporary customs arrangement"",externalbetween the EU and the UK as a whole, which would eliminate the need for tariffs, quotas, rules of origin and customs processes on UK-EU trade. That included the line that the ""UK expects the future arrangement to be in place by the end of December 2021 at the latest"", whichfollowed a cabinet row. BBC political editorLaura Kuenssberg saidit was understood that the EU was now prepared to accept the idea of the whole of the UK remaining in the customs union if a trade deal cannot be done during the so-called ""transition period"". But it is understood they have not accepted that there should be a time limit on it. Many Conservative Brexiteers argue an open-ended arrangement is unacceptable. It is understood that cabinet ministers Liam Fox, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab and Jeremy Hunt expressed concerns about the possibility of such an outcome. Speaking on Friday, Brexit Secretary Mr Raab said any such arrangement ""would have to be finite, it would have to be short and it would have to be, I think, time-limited in order for it to be supported here."" He added: ""What we cannot do is see the United Kingdom locked in via the backdoor to a customs union arrangement which would leave us in an indefinite limbo - that would not be leaving the EU."" A Downing Street spokeswoman said: ""The prime minister would never agree to a deal which would trap the UK in a backstop permanently."" She added: ""Our position is that this future economic relationship needs to be in place by the end of December 2021 at the latest."" Amid speculation she could resign, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom told the BBC she was ""really looking forward to us getting a good deal for the United Kingdom"" and that was ""all I am focused on"". Asked about the customs union concerns, she added: ""We are at the final stages of a really complicated negotiation and I do think we have to give the prime minister the opportunity to be able to do a good deal for the United Kingdom, something that she is absolutely determined to do."" Conservative backbench Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns tweeted that remaining in a customs union would be the ""ultimate betrayal"" of Leave voters. Allow Twitter content?

Police said a third person died in hospital on Friday after two people died at the scene of the collision on the M4 on Thursday. The victims, who were all in the minibus, were staff members at Prior's Court School in Thatcham, Berkshire. Prior's Court chief executive Mike Robinson said the school ""will never quite be the same again"". He added: ""The staff at Prior's Court are remarkable people and they are doing extraordinary things to transform the lives of those young people who are most challenged by autism. ""We are absolutely devastated that three of our colleagues have lost their lives."" Mr Robinson said the school would ""honour the memory of those who we have lost by making sure that they carry on the great work that those people have started"". The crash happened on the eastbound carriageway of the M4 Two other minibus passengers, who suffered life-threatening injuries, remain in a ""critical condition"" in hospital,  Mr Robinson said. He added the school was ""unbelievably blessed"" that three young adults suffered less serious injuries, with two being discharged from hospital.

"The owner of Patisserie Valerie has said its finance director Chris Marsh was arrested last night and then released on bail. The cafe chain is fighting for survival after revealing on Wednesday it had uncovered ""significant, and potentially fraudulent, accounting irregularities"". Mr Marsh had been suspended when these problems were discovered. Later on Friday the Serious Fraud Office said it had ""opened a criminal investigation into an individual"". ""We can give no further information or comment at this time,""the SFO said,externalwithout naming the individual. On Thursday, Patisserie Holdings - the owner of the cafe chain -said it needed ""an immediate injection of capital""to continue trading in its current form. In a brief announcement to the stock market,externalon Friday, the firm said: ""The company has been made aware that Chris Marsh, who is currently suspended from his role as company finance director, was arrested by the police last night and has been released on bail. Further updates will be released in due course as appropriate"". Hertfordshire Police said: ""A 44-year old man from St Albans has been arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation. He has been released under investigation."" Patisserie Holdings is 37%-owned by entrepreneur Luke Johnson. Since Thursday's statement it has not provided any more detail on its attempts to raise funds. The majority of Patisserie Valerie's stores are continuing to operate, and the BBC understands that talks are currently taking place in an attempt to save the business. It is also understood that Mr Johnson is not in a position to personally provide the cash needed immediately. A further update is expected later on Friday or on Saturday. Simon Jack: Patisserie Valerie has questions to answer Shares in Patisserie Holdings were suspended on Wednesday. In its most recent results statement in May, the company said it had cash reserves of Â£28.8m. But on Thursday, Patisserie Holdings said it had found ""a material shortfall between the reported financial status and the current financial status of the business"". It also said that the board had been become aware this week of awinding-up petition against its principal subsidiary Stonebeach,external, from HMRC over Â£1.14m of tax. Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, Julie Palmer of restructuring experts Begbies Traynor said that ""normally"" after a winding-up petition ""banks will freeze company bank accounts which makes day-to-day trading very difficult"". The company did not comment on this. Patisserie Holdings was listed on the stock market in 2014 when its shares were floated at 170p a share. They were trading at 429p before its shares were suspended, valuing the business at Â£440m. The first Patisserie Valerie store was opened in the Soho district of London in 1926 by a Belgian woman, Madame Valerie. It is now part of a chain with 206 stores which employs more than 2,000 people. Its swift expansion took place after Mr Johnson bought into Patisserie Valerie in 2006 when it had eight stores. Shortly after its stock market listing, on the AIM market for small companies,Patisserie Holdings listed Mr Marsh's credentials in a presentation,external. It said: He joined as finance director in 2006 Had worked with Paul May (chief executive) since 1998 Had advised many companies over the previous 15 years in finance director and consultancy roles His previous experience included roles at two AIM-listed companies He is a chartered accountant and tax accountant, formerly with EY While the stock market awaited details about the company's future, two stores were closed. The landlord of the shop in London's Hammersmith - MP Kings Retail SARL - confirmed it had taken possession of the shop. ""We have taken possession of the unit on King Street in question. We are sorry to see the store close but have been forced to act given the tenant was in breach of their lease agreement,"" a spokesperson said. A bailiff's notice has also been posted on a store in London's Edgware Road. Patisserie Holdings declined to comment. Mr Johnson, who was chairman of Channel 4 for six years until January 2010, has a number of business ventures. He earned his reputation taking control of Pizza Express in 1993 before selling out in 1999. Luke Johnson: The boss who likes to be very busy Mr Johnson is the executive chairman of Patisserie Holdings which owns Patisserie Valerie, Druckers, Philpotts, Baker & Spice and Flour Power City. His wealth in 2018 was valued at Â£260m by the Sunday Times Rich List, which calculated he had sold Â£46m of shares in Patisserie Holdings when it was floated and valued his remaining stake at Â£134m. Accountancy firm PwC is reported to have been hired by the company to look at its accounts, which are audited by Grant Thornton. The accountancy watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council, said: ""We are looking into this matter carefully and will give full consideration to further action as more facts become available.""

"If there is no deal Eurostar trains and electricity supplies in Northern Ireland face possible disruption if the UK exits the EU without a deal, the government says. The latest batch of contingency papers,externalfor a no-deal Brexit warn rail services could be suspended without specific agreements with France and Belgium. The Single Electricity Market on the island of Ireland may cease to operate, hitting consumers on both sides. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK was prepared for all eventualities. Ministers have insisted they are striving for a negotiated agreement ahead of the UK's exit on 29 March 2019. But they are continuing to provide information to the public and businesses about the consequences if this does not happen. Credit card warning in UK's 'no-deal' plans Flights 'at risk' under no-deal Brexit No-deal Brexit planning shuts M26 overnight The latest tranche of documents, the fourth to be published so far, state that in the event of a no-deal exit, some train operators will have to apply for new licences, certificates and authorisations from an EU rail regulator to continue services. Operators such as Eurostar, which currently only hold a UK licence, would be affected unless individual agreements are struck with countries on the continent. The operator runs about 40 direct services a day, via the Channel Tunnel, from London to Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Rotterdam and other destinations. Mr Raab said people should not hold off buying rail tickets as the UK would work with its French, Belgian and Dutch counterparts to ensure they were able to travel and goods could be moved. But Labour said this would ""not reassure anyone"" as ""ministers have barely scratched the surface of what would need to be done in the event of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal"". In a separate development, the M26 in Kent is being shut overnight while work is done to see if it can be used as a ""parking lot"" for lorries, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, prompting complaints from road hauliers. This video can not be played ""Something like this that is going to disrupt operations so massively, we need advance notice of this"" says FTA's spokesperson The Lib Dems said a no-deal would be a ""catastrophe"" but people should not be ""scared"" into settling for what it said was Theresa May's flawed proposed agreement with the EU. Talks on the terms of the UK's exit are nearing a crunch point, with both sides pushing for an agreement by the middle of November at the latest. Brexit papers: What no deal could mean Brexit: Netflix 'passport' not yet decided Access to full Netflix content when travelling to the continent cannot be guaranteed British horses are a regular fixture in Europe's top races - but may face additional handicaps The latest documents cover more than 25 subjects ranging from package holidays to pesticides Documents released on Friday warn of the potential fallout to the electricity market in Northern Ireland if the current Single Electricity Market arrangements that apply on a north-south basis cannot be continued. The Department for Exiting the EU said it was keen to work with Dublin and Brussels to reach an agreement on maintaining existing arrangements whatever the outcome of the negotiations, including no deal. But it warned that there was a risk Northern Ireland would become separated from the Republic of Ireland, in energy terms, and that this would make the market ""less efficient"". In such a situation, it said regulators may have to use ""fall-back arrangements"" to ensure power is transmitted between Britain and Northern Ireland and to maintain the necessary generating capacity. Mr Raab said the Single Electricity Market was the product of bilateral co-operation between London and Dublin and he hoped this would continue. Even if it did not, he said the UK would be prepared. ""We have got interconnectors and the regulatory measures that the government can take to make sure that Northern Ireland maintains the energy supply it needs."" Current arrangements mean Northern Ireland is, in effect, reliant on electricity generated in the Republic On consumer rights,British subscribers to Netflix, Spotifyand other online entertainment could see their access to content limited when they travel to the EU's 27 remaining member states, depending on what local rights deals and portability agreements are struck. There would be no change for package holidaymakers unless their booking is with an EU-based firm and completed outside the UK - when they might not be protected from the firm going bust. In the event of a no-deal exit, the transportation of horses to the continent could also be disrupted. Unless the EU agrees to grant the UK ""third country status"" on the day it leaves, no horses will be allowed to travel to the continent - a potentially huge blow to the racing industry. The government said it was confident the UK meets the animal health requirements to secure an immediate listing as a third country, making it subject to the same rules as countries like Australia and New Zealand. But, it added ""in the event the UK is not a listed country equine movement to the EU could not take place"". The documents also state that the UK wants to maintain the benefits of the 40 free trade agreements with more than 70 countries that it is party to from being an EU member. Other subjects covered in Friday's documents include: Trading and moving endangered species protected by CITES Breeding animals Commercial fishing Exporting objects of cultural interest Funding for British Overseas Territories Sanctions policy Trade in rough diamonds Accounting and auditing practices Previous no-deal papers have warned of the risks of UK flights to the continent being grounded and Britons visiting the EU facing extra credit card charges.

"Regis UK, the firm behind hairdressing chains Regis and Supercuts, is seeking a rescue deal in order to stay afloat. The firm is looking to slash its rents through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) as it struggles with lower footfall, the apprenticeship levy and higher pension costs. The firm employs 1,300 staff and has 220 salons. It said it did not intend to have any store closures or redundancies as part of the CVA plan. Jackie Lang, managing director of Regis UK, said: ""This action has been taken to restructure our costs to ultimately enable reinvestment into the business to improve our digital platforms and our expertise in salon. If successful, over 90% of our creditors will be unaffected."" The firm said it planned to ask for a reduction on rental costs on half of its stores. Eddie Williams, a partner at Grant Thornton, which is acting for Regis UK, says: ""The company has put forward a proposal to its creditors that seeks to amend some terms in its lease obligations and stabilise the business. ""As part of this, there are no planned salon closures and as such, no employee redundancies are planned, which is a positive in the context of the challenges the High Street has seen over the last 12 months and which continue to be prevalent.""

"Much of the cost of the latest royal wedding will ultimately be paid for by UK taxpayers On 12 October Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank will be tying the knot in Windsor. Their marriage will mark thesecond royal wedding of the yearfollowing Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's ceremony back in May. So how much is it expected to cost and who pays? Providing security is likely to be one of the bigger expenses. That bill will be borne by the police - and, by extension, the taxpayer. Security inside Windsor Castle will be handled by diplomatic protection officers - a branch of London's Metropolitan Police Service. Security in the town of Windsor itself will be met by the local force, Thames Valley Police. It hasn't said how much it thinks that will cost. However, it haspublished some details,externalabout the sort of security measures it will provide - such as putting up anti-vehicle barriers, carrying out searches, using sniffer dogs and providing ""a higher presence of armed and non-armed officers"" in and around Windsor. Jack Brooksbank and Princess Eugenie Princess Eugenie's wedding comes five months after Prince Harry and Meghan also married at Windsor Castle. Not long after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's big day, Thames Valley's police and crime commissioner, Anthony Stansfeld, told the BBC that the estimated cost of policing their wedding was ""between Â£2m and Â£4m"". We also know that Â£6.35m was spent by the Metropolitan Police Service on security for the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton back in 2011 - that's based on a Freedom of Information requestreleased to the Press Association,external. We asked Mr Stansfeld's office to provide a similar estimate for Princess Eugenie's ceremony - but we were told this wouldn't be possible ""until it has concluded"". Eugenie's wedding is expected to attract a smaller crowd and there will also be a considerably shorter carriage ride. The BBC understands that logically, the cost to Thames Valley Police should be lower than that of Prince Harry's wedding - but until all the numbers are crunched they can't say for certain. Some newspapers suggest the security billcould be about Â£2m,external- but this is only an estimate and not an official figure. Initially, Thames Valley Police has to absorb the costs. After the wedding the police will be allowed to make an application to the Home Office for a ""special grant,external"" to recoup some of the money. Special grants - funded by the taxpayer - are available to all police forces in England and Wales to help with the cost ofpolicing unexpected and exceptional events,external. The cost of the event must be more than 1% of a force's annual budget to qualify. In the case of Thames Valley this would be about Â£3.7m - based on last year'sannual budget of Â£372m,external. The force has not yet claimed for Prince Harry's wedding, but deputy police and crime commissioner Matthew Barber says that Thames Valley Police will be doing so ""in due course"". The complexity of the operation, as well as the number of organisations involved, means that costs are still to be finalised, he said. The couple will walk down the aisle of St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle Other organisations, such as the local council, will also be involved, and that will lead to additional public cost. Abudget report,externalon the Windsor and Maidenhead Borough Council website shows that the local authority spent Â£1.2m on Prince Harry's wedding in May. This cost includes Â£495,000 on stewarding, Â£108,000 on providing toilets, and Â£75,744 on setting up a temporary car park. The council also received income of Â£73,332 - the majority coming from parking and media fees. In addition, the local economy is likely to have received a boost from the influx of people visiting the town - but the precise impact is hard to quantify. The report reveals that central government (again, by extension, the UK taxpayer) reimbursed most of the bill, meaning the final cost to the council was Â£92,891. Windsor and Maidenhead says it's too early to work out how much it needs to spend this time, but it is hopeful that it will receive another government reimbursement. Princess Eugenie is ninth in line to the throne - a ""minor royal"" in the eyes of some critics. Republic, which campaigns for an elected head of state, hasset up a petition,externalurging the government ""to commit no public money"" towards the royal wedding. So far it's received about 40,000 signatures. Republic's vice-chairwoman, Dani Beckett, argues that as Princess Eugenie is not a working royal - ie she doesn't carry out public duties as a member of the royal family - the wedding should be treated as a private event, and all elements (including security) should be paid for by the couple themselves. ""No-one has forced her to have a carriage and a high-profile ceremony. There are other ways she could have chosen to have had a less lavish wedding,"" says Ms Beckett. Eugenie wedding: All you need to know Royal wedding 2018: Who's paying? Buckingham Palace says the cost of supplying security ""is a matter for the police"". So why are the police providing security - at public expense - for Princess Eugenie's wedding? Decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, regardless of how major or minor the royal is, according to Dai Davies, a former head of royal protection. ""In truth you have to look at the threat assessment and someone has to make a judgement,"" he says. ""Will the couple in question attract attention and is there a potential risk to the public?"" If the answer is yes, the police - according to Mr Davies - are obliged to provide security, no matter how major or minor the royal person is perceived to be. There will be an increased presence of armed and unarmed officers in and around Windsor The private aspects of the wedding - such as flowers, entertainment and the dress - will be paid for by the royal family itself. But how distant a relative do you need to be to expect the Queen to pay for your wedding? ""The Queen herself draws the line on which weddings the Royal Family chooses to pay for,"" says Dickie Arbiter, a former royal press secretary. So in theory the Queen can fund any wedding she chooses to, no matter how far down in line of succession. But in reality Mr Arbiter says she restricts it to her children and grandchildren. Every year the royal family gets a chunk of money from the annual Sovereign Grantworth Â£82m this year,external, paid directly by the Treasury. Some members of the royal family also benefit from additional income. For example, Prince Charles gets money from the Duchy of Cornwall estate, a portfolio of land, property and financial investments. But it's not clear from which ""pots"" the Palace will choose to fund Princess Eugenie's wedding. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"Daniel Olaloko, known as Trigga T, left, and Peter Adebayo A drill rapper from south London has been jailed for seven years for selling drugs in a county lines operation. Trigga T, real name Daniel Olaloko, 19, admitted supplying heroin and crack cocaine in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. The teenager was a member of the Silwood Nation drill group. He was a pharmacology student and had previously auditioned for ITV's X Factor in 2016. Peter Adebayo, 19, also received seven years, having also admitted two charges of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. Drill music often features rappers talking about violence and can be used to fuel rivalries between gangs, leading critics to link it to crime. But artists defend it as representing what is happening in their communities, as well as offering a way out for some from deprived areas. Is it right to blame the music genre for violence? Olaloko, who studied at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston, was arrested in a dawn raid at his halls of residence in April. When police searched his room, they found a sword, knives, four cheap mobile phones, wraps of heroin and crack cocaine and Â£480 in cash. There was also a Silwood Nation t-shirt. This video can not be played Daniel Olaloko rapped about money, drugs and violence At an earlier hearing, the 19-year-old, who grew up in Deptford and Bermondsey in south London, gave his address as ""the management suite"" at the halls of residence. In a simultaneous raid in April at an address in Manchester, police arrested Adebayo. Searching his room, officers found mobile phones used to sell drugs in Barrow. They also found quantities of drugs alongside weighing scales and mixing agents ready to be processed. Olaloko was on Twitter as Trigga T Adebayo pleaded guilty to two charges of conspiring to supply drugs in Barrow and was also sentenced to seven years in prison. Between December and April,at least 12 people diedof suspected drug overdoses in the town - which has a population of 67,000 people. Prosecutor Jonathan Dickinson said Olaloko and Adebayo were ""towards the top end of the conspiracy"" to supply people in Barrow with heroin and crack cocaine. They operated as part of a gang known as Nation, which supplied drugs from London, some 300 miles away. The Nation - named after Olaloko's drill rap group - are understood to have started operating in Barrow last September. A key breakthrough for police was the arrest in March of a vulnerable 17-year-old girl from London. She was found in a flat in Egerton Court in Barrow. When she was searched, officers found 53 wraps of ready-to-sell heroin and crack cocaine had been inserted inside her. The court was told Olaloko and Adebayo ""had control"" over the girl. Joshua Adam, 24, again from London, also pleaded guilty to supplying Class A drugs and received a four and a half years in prison. A 17-year-old from Manchester was sentenced to an 18-month detention and training order. They were all sentenced at Burnley Crown Court. He was arrested in dawn raids at halls of residence at the University of Central Lancashire in April Olaloko's family described him as a quiet, studious boy. He auditioned for the X Factor talent show in 2016 but failed to make the TV auditions. Instead, he focused on drill music, rapping about drugs, money, violence and sex in his videos. He was described as doing well in college until his arrest - after which he was suspended immediately, the University of Central Lancashire said. ""These men operated as a sophisticated and relentless organised crime group,"" said Detective Chief Inspector Nick Coughlan. ""They targeted vulnerable people to facilitate their illegal activities and they used fear and intimidation to operate their business. ""So during this operation, officers removed not just drugs from being sold on the streets, but a substantial quantity of illegal and dangerous weapons."" Peter Adebayo, who was also arrested in April, was sentenced for seven years Police in Barrow are struggling to cope with the changing nature of drug supply in the town. London gangs have joined groups from Liverpool, the usual drug sellers in Barrow, in running county lines operations. So-called county lines are when city-based dealers use children or adults to move drugs or illicit money around the country, or put up drug dealers in rural communities. Competition is fierce and the London gangs in particular are bringing violence - and the threat of violence - including knives and guns, into the town. One drug user in Barrow said the Londoners now ruled the town, and that it was ""easier than ever"" to buy illegal drugs. Police, working alongside the local council and charities, are planning to open a community centre next month in Egerton Court, long a magnet for drug users and sellers. The hub will provide support and advice to residents, offering them an alternative to the pushers. ""One of the things I need to look at is how I reduce the demand for those drugs,"" said Inspector Jim Bailey. ""And one of the ways to do that is to come here and work with those people who are subject to taking drugs - vulnerable, isolated - and try to tackle that.""

"This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkish officials have audio and video evidence that shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the BBC has been told. Mr Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government, has not been seen since he entered the building on 2 October. Turkish intelligence had ""documented evidence"" of the murder, a source close to the investigation said. Saudi Arabia's interior minister has dismissed the accusations. According to the official Saudi Press Agency, Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Naif bin Abdulaziz said ""orders to kill him are lies and baseless allegations"". What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance Saudi ties with West at risk over Khashoggi The journalist who vanished into a consulate Saudi Arabia has maintained the journalist left the building, with the minister saying the kingdom was keen to discover ""the whole truth"", according to the news agency. Mr Khashoggi's disappearance and reported death have prompted international outrage and dented business confidence in Saudi Arabia. Tycoon Sir Richard Branson has halted talks over $1bn Saudi investmentin Virgin space firms and several top business leaders and media groups have pulled out of a Saudi investment conference later this month. However, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told American news network CNBC he was still planning to attend the conference, despite the House of Representatives' foreign affairs committee writing to President Donald Trump urging him to reconsider. The latest reports suggest an assault and a struggle took place in the consulate. A Turkish security source has confirmed to BBC Arabic the existence of an audio and a video recording. What is not clear is if anyone other than Turkish officials has seen or heard them. One source is cited by the Washington Post saying men can be heard beating Mr Khashoggi; it adds that the recordings show he was killed and dismembered. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death ""You can hear his voice and the voices of the men speaking Arabic,"" a separate source told the Post. ""You can hear how he was interrogated, tortured and then murdered"". Mr Khashoggi is a contributing columnist for the newspaper. Earlier this week leading columnist Kemal Ozturk, considered close to the Turkish government, alleged there was a video of the moment Jamal Khashoggi was killed. Turkish TV has already broadcast CCTV footage of the moment Mr Khashoggi walked into the consulate for an appointment at which he was due to receive papers for his forthcoming marriage to Turkish fiancÃ©e Hatice Cengiz. Saudi UK envoy 'concerned' over Khashoggi Turkish press trail Khashoggi's last steps Missing Saudi writer gets blank column Separately, a video has emerged of men described as Saudi intelligence officers entering and leaving Turkey. A 15-strong team has been identified by Turkish media who are described as involved in Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. The BBC has been told that one was Maher Mutreb, an intelligence colonel based in London, and another was thought to be a forensics specialist. Turkey's official line is that Mr Khashoggi is missing but that it knows ""for sure"" he has been killed. However, the government has agreed to a joint investigation with the Saudis, and a Saudi delegation arrived in Turkey on Friday to take part in talks expected over the weekend. Their arrival came a day after a senior Saudi royal figure, Prince Khaled al-Faisal, was said to have briefly visited Turkey amid signs that the Saudi monarchy was seeking an urgent solution to the diplomatic crisis between the two countries. A Saudi delegation arrived in Turkey on Friday ahead of talks expected to take place at the weekend Mr Khashoggi's disappearance threatens the reputation of the new Saudi Crown Prince, Mohamed bin Salman, and his country's relationships across the world, the BBC's Turkey correspondent Mark Lowen reports. By Jane Kinninmont, Middle East expert, The Elders Foundation Jamal Khashoggi's disappearance and alleged murder has sent a chill through writers and activists, in Saudi Arabia and more broadly across the Middle East. They ask: If this could happen to someone as well known and well connected as Jamal Khashoggi, a US resident and Washington Post writer, what else could happen to the less well-known? Mr Khashoggi did not position himself as a dissident. A former adviser to two Saudi princes, he criticised some aspects of Saudi policy, like the war in Yemen and the lack of free speech, while praising others, like the social reforms of new Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman. He argued for reform rather than regime change - which is a very widespread stance among Saudis. There are many people there who seek a greater voice in how to improve their society without being enemies of the state.

"Airbus made fuel system changes to its existing A350-900 aircraft to allow for an extended flight range - giving it the name A350-900 ULR (ultra long range) The world's longest non-stop commercial flight has landed in New York, ending a journey from Singapore of more than 15,000km in 17 hours and 52 minutes. Singapore Airlines relaunched the service five years after it was cut because it had become too expensive. Flight SQ22 landed at 0529 US Eastern time with 150 passengers and 17 crew. Geoffrey Thomas, editor-in-chief of Airlineratings.com, said the time passed swiftly and had not seemed like a 17-and-a-half hour flight. He told the BBC: ""The flight was effortless and very smooth. ""On board the consensus was that the time passed very quickly and didn't seem like 17.5 hours."" The inaugural flight from Changi Airport to Newark's international airport, which services New York, took off amid much fanfare. Qantas launched a 17-hour non-stop service from Perth to London earlier this year, while Qatar runs a 17.5-hour service between Auckland and Doha. Singapore Airlines (SIA) said there is demand for customers for non-stop services which help cut travelling times compared with flights which have a stopover. Ahead of the take-off, the airline told the BBC that business class seats for the flight were fully booked, and there were ""a very limited number"" of premium economy seats left. A business class ticket entitles passengers to two meals, and the choice of when they are served, plus refreshments in between. They will also have a bed to sleep in. Premium economy fares get three meals at fixed times, with refreshments in between. The airline said it is not planning to offer any economy bookings on the route. The brand new Airbus plane that SIA is using has been configured to seat 161 passengers in all - 67 business passengers and 94 premium economy passengers. It's the world's longest non-stop flight... for now Jet makes history on flight from Australia Geoffrey Thomas said: ""This is a route between two massive financial hubs, and so they will fill this plane up with business people, or well-heeled travellers who want the convenience of a non stop flight. ""It's also been proven that when carriers introduce a new non-stop route, the traffic on that route increases threefold."" Mr Thomas, the editor-in-chief of airline rating site Airlineratings.com, has been on several such inaugural flights, including Qantas'new long-haul from Perth to London, inaugurated earlier this year. Qantas is using a 787-9 Dreamliner for its Perth to London route Qantas meanwhile is in advanced discussions with Airbus and Boeing over an aircraft capable of making a 20-hour flight between London and Sydney. The Australian national flag carrier also plans to fly non-stop from Australia to New York - slightly shorter than the London-Sydney non-stop flight. But Max Kingsley-Jones, group editor of Flight Global, warned that plans for new non-stop routes had a habit of changing in line with the economics of the world. ""In the boom times you get a lot of what we call direct-connect flights between smaller citiesâ¦ [then] each time there's a downturn you see all those tail off, and then we go back to people flying over hubs,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""Even though it costs more for an airline to fly over a hub, they'll always charge you less because of the disadvantage of going via somewhere else."" Do 'longest flight' records matter? How UK-Australia travel evolved to one flight Can long-haul air travel also be low cost? Business class seating on Singapore Airline's new A350-900 ULR - the flight will not offer any economy seating The A350-900 ULR (ultra-long-range) that set off on Thursday from Singapore to Newark belongs to Airbus' family of long-range, twin-engine aircraft. The planes have been designed to replace Boeing's older 777 series and use between 20% and 30% less fuel than the 777s did - which is a good thing amid rising oil prices. Singapore Airlines launched the same non-stop route between Changi and Newark in 2004, but by 2013 the carrier was forced to cancel it. The A340-500 it was using at the time used a lot of fuel and eventually the route became too expensive to run. Several carriers already use the newer A350-900s on their long-haul routes. They have higher ceilings, larger windows and lighting designed to reduce jetlag - all good things for busy business travellers. But the ultra-long-range version that SIA has bought from Airbus has the longest capability of any aircraft flying today, thanks in part to a slightly modified fuel system. It can fly for 20 hours non-stop, which most aviation experts will tell you is the future of very long-haul travel for business and pleasure. Mr Thomas says it's been proven over and over again that people want to fly non-stop, ""so these sorts of aeroplanes are set to gain terrific momentum"". ""Qantas' flight from Perth to London is seeing a load factor in economy of 92% - and in premium it's 94%. So from an airline perspective, these routes are money-making. ""We really are entering a new era of travel."" Jet makes history on flight from Australia Can long-haul air travel also be low cost?

"Rowling said she had done ""what we believe to be the right thing"" in sticking by Depp Johnny Depp has said he ""felt bad"" for author JK Rowling after the backlash she received for supporting his casting in the Fantastic Beasts film series. In December,Rowling saidshe was ""genuinely happy"" about Depp's casting, despite accusations of domestic violence by his ex-wife Amber Heard. ""JK has seen the evidence and therefore knows I was falsely accused,"" Depp toldEntertainment Weekly,external. ""That's why she has publicly supported me. She doesn't take things lightly."" He continued: ""She would not stand up if she didn't know the truth."" Heard filed for divorce from the actor after 15 months of marriage in May 2016. Her filing alleged a history of abuse throughout the relationship, which the actor has denied. Heard and Depp finalised their divorce in January 2017 Depp made a fleeting appearance as the wizard Grindelwald in the first Fantastic Beasts film in 2016, but will play a much larger part in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, which is due for release in November. Some fans threatened to boycott the sequel because of his role. ""I felt bad for JK having to field all these various feelings from people out there,"" the actor told Entertainment Weekly. ""I felt bad that she had to take that. ""But ultimately, there is real controversy. The fact remains I was falsely accused, which is why I'm suing the Sun newspaper for defamation for repeating false accusations."" In her statement in December, Rowling admitted that recasting the role was ""naturally considered"", but that she was ultimately ""comfortable"" sticking with Depp. Amid the controversy, Depp said he has found the Potter fans ""incredibly impressive"".

"This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkish officials have audio and video evidence that shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the BBC has been told. Mr Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government, has not been seen since he entered the building on 2 October. Turkish intelligence had ""documented evidence"" of the murder, a source close to the investigation said. Saudi Arabia's interior minister has dismissed the accusations. According to the official Saudi Press Agency, Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Naif bin Abdulaziz said ""orders to kill him are lies and baseless allegations"". What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance Saudi ties with West at risk over Khashoggi The journalist who vanished into a consulate Saudi Arabia has maintained the journalist left the building, with the minister saying the kingdom was keen to discover ""the whole truth"", according to the news agency. Mr Khashoggi's disappearance and reported death have prompted international outrage and dented business confidence in Saudi Arabia. Tycoon Sir Richard Branson has halted talks over $1bn Saudi investmentin Virgin space firms and several top business leaders and media groups have pulled out of a Saudi investment conference later this month. However, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told American news network CNBC he was still planning to attend the conference, despite the House of Representatives' foreign affairs committee writing to President Donald Trump urging him to reconsider. The latest reports suggest an assault and a struggle took place in the consulate. A Turkish security source has confirmed to BBC Arabic the existence of an audio and a video recording. What is not clear is if anyone other than Turkish officials has seen or heard them. One source is cited by the Washington Post saying men can be heard beating Mr Khashoggi; it adds that the recordings show he was killed and dismembered. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death ""You can hear his voice and the voices of the men speaking Arabic,"" a separate source told the Post. ""You can hear how he was interrogated, tortured and then murdered"". Mr Khashoggi is a contributing columnist for the newspaper. Earlier this week leading columnist Kemal Ozturk, considered close to the Turkish government, alleged there was a video of the moment Jamal Khashoggi was killed. Turkish TV has already broadcast CCTV footage of the moment Mr Khashoggi walked into the consulate for an appointment at which he was due to receive papers for his forthcoming marriage to Turkish fiancÃ©e Hatice Cengiz. Saudi UK envoy 'concerned' over Khashoggi Turkish press trail Khashoggi's last steps Missing Saudi writer gets blank column Separately, a video has emerged of men described as Saudi intelligence officers entering and leaving Turkey. A 15-strong team has been identified by Turkish media who are described as involved in Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. The BBC has been told that one was Maher Mutreb, an intelligence colonel based in London, and another was thought to be a forensics specialist. Turkey's official line is that Mr Khashoggi is missing but that it knows ""for sure"" he has been killed. However, the government has agreed to a joint investigation with the Saudis, and a Saudi delegation arrived in Turkey on Friday to take part in talks expected over the weekend. Their arrival came a day after a senior Saudi royal figure, Prince Khaled al-Faisal, was said to have briefly visited Turkey amid signs that the Saudi monarchy was seeking an urgent solution to the diplomatic crisis between the two countries. A Saudi delegation arrived in Turkey on Friday ahead of talks expected to take place at the weekend Mr Khashoggi's disappearance threatens the reputation of the new Saudi Crown Prince, Mohamed bin Salman, and his country's relationships across the world, the BBC's Turkey correspondent Mark Lowen reports.

"HMP Lindholme is a Category C prison with 1,000 inmates A prison officer was left unconscious after he was ""strangled"" by an inmate, a union has said. He was one of two officers assaulted in separate attacks at HMP Lindholme in Doncaster on Thursday night, the Prison Officers' Association (POA) said. The other officer was ""punched in the throat"" and was recovering at home, POA chairman Mark Fairhurst said. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) confirmed a worker at the jail was attacked and an inmate had been segregated. Following the attacks, staff refused to go back into the category C jail and staged a protest. The POA said one of the officers ""was strangled to the point of unconsciousness"". ""Despite the seriousness of these unprovoked assaults the prisoners had to be put back in their own cells as the segregation unit was full, emphasising the problems at Lindholme,"" it said. ""Staff at Lindholme genuinely feared for their safety this morning and refused to enter the prison until safety assurances and plans were put in place."" Officers went back to work following a meeting with the governor. Up to 24 prison officers were getting attacked at HMP Lindholme on a daily basis, Mark Fairhurst said Full details of both attacks have not been released by the MoJ, but it confirmed an officer was found unconscious and treated at the prison before receiving hospital treatment. An investigation had started, it added. One of the two inmates involved in the attacks had been segregated after a space had become available in the morning, while the other still remained in his cell ""awaiting segregation"", Mr Fairhurst said. He described HMP Lindholme as ""one of the worst performing prisons"", with up to 24 prison officers getting attacked at the jail on a daily basis. Policing longest prison fence 'impossible' Jail drug trade linked to organised crime Prison staff protest over inmate violence Staff at HMP Lindholme staged a protest following the attack The jail is one of 10 the MoJ had previously identified as having ""acute problems"" with high drug use, violence and building issues. Packages containing the Spice drug and mini mobile phones were said to be regularly thrown over the fence. A report by inspectors in February found ""shocking"" levels of drug use at the jail were due to a large number of prisoners connected to organised crime. Last month, prison staff across England and Wales took part in widespread protests over ""unprecedented violence"" in jails.

"Regis UK, the firm behind hairdressing chains Regis and Supercuts, is seeking a rescue deal in order to stay afloat. The firm is looking to slash its rents through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) as it struggles with lower footfall, the apprenticeship levy and higher pension costs. The firm employs 1,300 staff and has 220 salons. It said it did not intend to have any store closures or redundancies as part of the CVA plan. Jackie Lang, managing director of Regis UK, said: ""This action has been taken to restructure our costs to ultimately enable reinvestment into the business to improve our digital platforms and our expertise in salon. If successful, over 90% of our creditors will be unaffected."" The firm said it planned to ask for a reduction on rental costs on half of its stores. Eddie Williams, a partner at Grant Thornton, which is acting for Regis UK, says: ""The company has put forward a proposal to its creditors that seeks to amend some terms in its lease obligations and stabilise the business. ""As part of this, there are no planned salon closures and as such, no employee redundancies are planned, which is a positive in the context of the challenges the High Street has seen over the last 12 months and which continue to be prevalent.""

"This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the destruction in Mexico Beach, Florida Hurricane Michael left ""unimaginable destruction"" as it ploughed into coastal areas of Florida, the state's governor, Rick Scott says. ""So many lives have been changed forever,"" he said. ""So many families have lost everything."" The worst hit areas of Florida's northwest coast saw houses ripped from their foundations, trees felled, and power lines strewn across streets. Hurricane Michael struck on Wednesday with winds of 155mph (250km/h). It weakened to a storm as it moved inland towards the north-east, but at least six people have died, most of them in Florida. In pictures: Hurricane Michael hits Florida How to survive a monster storm Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. More than 370,000 people in Florida were ordered to evacuate but officials believe many ignored the warning. Governor Scott said the US Coast Guard carried out 10 missions overnight, saving at least 27 people. Michael ploughed into Florida's Panhandle coast near the town of Mexico Beach at 14:00 (18:00 GMT) on Wednesday, one of the strongest storms to ever hit the US mainland. Ranked four on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale and with a storm surge of 9ft (2.7m), it lifted homes from their foundations and heavily damaged others in districts closest to the sea in Mexico Beach, CNN helicopter footage showed. Twenty survivors were found in the town overnight, AP reports, but 285 had refused to obey warnings to evacuate. Mexico Beach saw widespread destruction Head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Brock Long, called Mexico Beach ""ground zero"" due to the damage. Trees were downed in Panama City, northwest of Mexico Beach, buildings flattened, boats and electrical cables scattered. Apalachicola, with 2,300 residents, was also badly affected, the mayor reporting that downed cables were making it difficult to get through the town. Are hurricanes getting worse? A guide to the world's deadliest storms Debris and floodwater are also making some of the worst-hit areas difficult to reach. Governor Scott urged residents not to return until the authorities ""make sure things are safe"", given the danger from power lines and other debris. By Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Mexico Beach, Florida One of the first things you notice as you walk into Mexico Beach is the stillness. No wind, almost no-one on the street, just the beating hot Sun and the debris: debris everywhere, tossed and scattered - the calling card of a monstrous storm. And then you hear faint bleeping sounds coming from all directions - a dissonant symphony of high-pitched notes that turn out to be myriad small alarms, still transmitting their warnings from the batteries which power them. On the left, as we walk, there's a mattress slumped at the roadside, on the right a Dean Koontz novel lies in the dirt. Picking our way through a mass of rubble and detritus that was once a house, we spot an American flag on the ground; in amongst it all there is also a toy car and a cracked glass plate from a microwave. A little further on, and a woman, accompanied by a friend, is sifting through the remains of her home, loading what she can salvage into the boot of  a car. This was her dream retirement place she tells me - the last four years spent doing it up. ""I'll never step back in there,"" she says through her tears. The sheer force of Hurricane Michael has been well analysed, but it's only when you see the everyday stuff of people's lives crushed, broken, smashed to pieces, that you realise they will be living with this long after we have gone. Six deaths have been confirmed - four in Florida, one in Georgia and one in North Carolina. Florida officials say one man died when he was crushed in an incident involving a tree in Gadsden County. In Seminole County, Georgia, a metal car-shelter lifted by a gust of wind hit a mobile home, killing a girl of 11. Residents of Mexico Beach have returned to find homes heavily damaged Travis Brooks, director of Seminole County's emergency management agency, told ABC News there was ""complete and total devastation"". Michael earlier reportedly killed at least 13 people as it passed through Central America: six in Honduras, four in Nicaragua and three in El Salvador. Winds have knocked out power to more than 900,000 homes and businesses across Florida, Alabama, the Carolinas and Georgia. Around 6,000 are thought to have sought refuge in official shelters, mainly in Florida. With reduced winds of 50mph, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), Michael has moved north-east crossing Georgia and is now bringing heavy rain to North Carolina and Virginia. The NHC warned that communities in north-west Florida and North Carolina faced the threat of life-threatening flooding as rising water moved inland from the coast. The Carolinas are still recovering fromthe floods of Hurricane Florence. States of emergency have been declared in all or parts of Florida, Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina. And further north, inVirginia 202,000 people are without power, officials said.,external A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds.

"Royal Bank of Scotland has paid its first dividend to shareholders since the bank was brought to the brink of collapse in the 2008 financial crisis. The bank - which is still 62% government-owned - has paid a 2p dividend to investors, which include about 190,000 private shareholders. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan said the payment was an ""important milestone"" in the bank's turnaround. The bank received an emergency Â£45bn bailout from the taxpayer in 2008. Earlier this year,the government sold a tranche of RBS sharesat 271p each, almost half the 502p a share it paid for them 10 years ago. RBS boss: Rebuilding trust will take another 10 years RBS had said in August that it intended to pay a dividend, as soon as it had completed its $4.9bn (Â£3.8bn) settlement with the US Department of Justice over mortgage-backed securities. Announcing the payment of the dividend, Mr McEwan said it was ""a small return"" to shareholders ""after their many years of patience"". ""This is another important milestone in our turnaround, almost 10 years to the day that RBS was rescued by the British taxpayer,"" he said. ""We have created a smaller, safer bank that is generating more sustainable profits. Our capital position is above our target and we are also looking to return any excess capital as soon as possible to shareholders."" Earlier this week,Mr McEwan told the BBCthat while RBS's finances may now be fixed, there remained a long way to go in terms of rebuilding levels of trust in the bank. ""I think it will take five - maybe even 10 - years to rebuild trust to where we'd want it to be,"" he said.

Here are our highlights from the marriage of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank:  Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent The focus of the day was of
course on the couple; an unsurprisingly nervous groom, his hand shaking at
times, his gaze twitching as he waiting for his bride.  A beaming
Princess, unable to control her joy. There was more; flawless
organisation, hat dysfunction as the wind blew and blew, hatchets buried as the
Duke of Edinburgh settled into a seat in near Sarah, Duchess of York with whom
he has had a frosty - sometimes frozen -  relationship. But most noticeable at
Windsor?  The applause that followed the national anthem, and the cheers
for the Queen as she left the Chapel. No-one

princessesâ. Elise said of Princess Eugenie: âShe looked pretty.â Maeve added: âElise loved it. It was a very nice calm day
out. ""Harryâs was chaos but this was really nice: there wasnât much of a spark,
and I wouldnât say it was electric - they could have done with some music for
the crowds. But calm is the word I would use to describe it.â Here are some more views from the crowds at Windsor,
where itâs estimated about 3,000 gathered to cheer Princess Eugenie and her new
husband. Jackie Brown, from Ashford, Surrey, said: âIâm such a
royal fan. Iâve always followed them, since Charles and Anne were youngsters. âIâd have liked to see more than just the carriage, but
Iâm so glad we came. We had a great time and spoke to people from all over the
world.â Georgina Moroney, from Swindon, said: âIâm a royal geek.
Itâs just all part of our heritage. Theyâre fantastic - I love the romance of
it all. âShe looked so radiant.â Hereâs a picture taken by Amy Gardner who was watching
and said the couple looked straight at her. âShe looked so beautiful - it was lovely. Itâs definitely
worth the wait,"" she said. ""They looked right at the camera, which was great.â Among the crowds watching Eugenie and Jack leaving the
castle in their carriage was a group of friends whoâd gathered especially for
the occasion. Rachel Price-Greenow, from Hereford, admitting she had a
tear in her eye watching the couple go by. âI got emotional,â she said. âI was quite teary. Itâs
just lovely. I love all the pomp and sense of occasion.â Her friend Helen Freeman, from Swansea, was wearing a
home-made fascinator with the coupleâs initials embroidered on top. âItâs a royal event - and youâve got to wear a fascinator

A passage from the book was read by Princess Beatrice during the ceremony. Turns out it's because the novel's famous character Jay Gatsby has a special place in Princess Eugenie's relationship with Jack Brooksbank. The Dean of Windsor said the princess had read the book not long after meeting her husband and it made her think of him. Addressing the congregation, the dean said: ""The words that particularly reminded her of Jack concern Gatsby's smile. ""As we heard from the reading 'It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it ... it concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour'. ""Well, a few years have passed and Eugenie and Jack come here today to smile on each other, and to offer each other something like 'eternal reassurance' and the promise of an 'irresistible prejudice' in each other's favour.""

"Robert Sharkey spent thousands of pounds of Marie Conlon's money on pepperoni pizzas A man who spent Â£6,000 of his dead neighbour's savings on pizzas has been told he faces jail. Robert Sharkey, 24, of Grays Hill, Bangor, was convicted of 11 charges last month after failing to report the woman had died, and then stealing from her. The judge said he had committed a ""wicked series of offences"". These included using one of Marie Conlon's debit cards to buy almost Â£6,000 worth of pepperoni pizzas. It occurred when he lived above her flat in Larkspur Rise, Poleglass. The judge told Sharkey: ""In any view this is a wicked, wicked series of offences against a decent woman who was clearly vulnerable because of her age."" ""This was disgraceful behaviour, it confronts every feeling of right-thinking people."" The court heard that 68-year-old Marie Conlon died at her flat in January 2015. The body of Marie Conlon was found in a flat at Larkspur Rise, off Suffolk Road, in west Belfast She was described as ""an extremely private person"" who made little attempt to keep in touch with her family. Sharkey has admitted that on October 2015 he noticed Ms Conlon's post piling up in a communal area of the flats and kicked her door in. He saw a handbag and money, and told police that he took around Â£50 because ""at the time I was worried about money."" As for discovering Ms Conlon's remains, he said he did not call the police because he was worried about calling them. He had been on probation after previously being convicted of disorderly behaviour. The court heard that Sharkey memorised the details of Ms Conlon's Bank card, and a later one issued to her address five months later. Over two years he used the details to buy almost Â£6,000 worth of pizza from Dominos. Every day, he bought a nine-inch pepperoni pizza with anchovies and two cans of juice to be delivered to his own address in the same block of flats. The staff at the pizza company were so used to this that they referred to him as the ""Fish Guy"". When police officers entered Sharkey's flat they found piles of empty pizza boxes from his online purchases with Ms Conlon's bank card details. Ms Conlon's pension was still being paid into her bank account because everyone except Sharkey was unaware of her death. The card was used to buy services from O2, Sainsbury's and Power NI. The court heard that Sharkey was careful to pay the rates bill on Ms Conlon's flat to avoid discovery. When ordering online he used an old phone and swapped SIM cards as another method of avoiding discovery. In total he defrauded Â£11,700 from Ms Conlon's estate. The defence told the court that Sharkey had offered Ms Conlon's family his ""sincerest, deepest apologies"" and had found his arrest was ""to a large extent a relief to him"". The judge remanded Sharkey in custody ahead of sentencing next Friday, and he told the defendant a custodial sentence was ""almost inevitable"".

"The ban on fracking in England will be reinstated, new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said. It reverses a decision by his predecessor Liz Truss. Fracking was first halted in England in 2019, amid opposition from green groups and concerns about earth tremors. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a technique for recovering gas and oil from shale rock. It involves drilling into the earth and directing a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals at a rock layer, to release the gas inside. This video can not be played The BBC's David Shukman explains how fracking works Wells can be drilled vertically or horizontally in order to release the gas. The injection of fluid at high pressure into the rock can cause earth tremors - small movements in the earth's surface. More than 120 tremorswere recorded,externalduring drilling at a Cuadrilla site in Blackpool,including one which lasted almost 100 hours. Seismic events of this scale are considered minor and are rarely felt by people - but are a concern to local residents. Shale gas is also a fossil fuel, and campaigners say allowing fracking could distract energy firms and governments from investing in renewable and green sources of energy. Fracking also uses huge amounts of water, which must be transported to the site at significant environmental cost. Rishi Sunak was asked about fracking at his first Prime Minister's Questions, by Green Party MP Caroline Lucas. He told the Commons he ""stands by"" the 2019 Conservative Party manifesto, which pledged to maintain a ban on the practice in England. It had banned fracking earlier that year and stated that it would not be allowed unless the science changed. A scientific review into fracking by the British Geological Survey says there is still a limited understanding of the impacts of such drilling. Rishi Sunak reimposes fracking ban in England Mr Sunak's stance reverses a decision taken by the government in September, when Liz Truss was prime minister. At that time it saidfracking could go ahead in some places. It said it could help the UK strengthen the security of its energy supplies, amid uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine. The Scottish and Welsh governments continue to oppose fracking, and say they will not use their powers to grant drilling licences. An anti-fracking protester writes messages on a wall in Lancashire Fracking for shale gas in the UK has only taken place on a small scale and has faced several public and legal challenges. However, exploration has identifiedlarge swathes of shale gas across the UK,external, particularly in northern England. More than 100 exploration and drilling licences were awarded to firms including Third Energy, IGas, Aurora Energy Resources and Ineos. Cuadrilla was the only company given consent to begin fracking. It drilled two wells at a site in Lancashire butfaced repeated protestsfrom local people and campaigners. The Oil and Gas Authority told Cuadrillato permanently concrete and abandon the wells,external. It is not clear what difference restarting fracking would make to energy bills. The UK can only meet 48% of its gas demand from domestic supplies (this would be 54% if it did not export any gas). A small number of Tory MPs, known as the Net Zero Scrutiny Group,claimed restarting drilling at Cuadrilla's two existing wells could be done quickly, and would provide significant supplies,external. Cuadrilla claimed that ""just 10%"" of the gas from shale deposits in Lancashire and surrounding areas""could supply 50 years' worth of current UK gas demand"",external. Energy experts dispute this, pointing out that the UK's shale gas reserves are held in complex layers of rock. Mike Bradshaw, professor of global energy at Warwick University, says estimates of how much shale gas the UK hasare not the same as the amount of gas that could be produced commercially,external. And BBC business editor Simon Jack recently shared a quotemade by Kwasi Kwarteng when he was business secretary,external: ""No amount of shale gas from wells across rural England would be enough to lower European price any time soon."" Shale gas in the US is estimated to make up 25% of its total gas reserves It is thought that fracking has given energy security to the US and Canada for the next 100 years, and has presented an opportunity to generate electricity at half the CO2 emissions of coal. Fracking remains banned in numerous EU countries, including Germany, France and Spain, as well as Australia. Authorities in countries including Brazil and Argentina are split, with some banning the practice, and others allowing operations.

Here are our highlights from the marriage of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank:  Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent The focus of the day was of
course on the couple; an unsurprisingly nervous groom, his hand shaking at
times, his gaze twitching as he waiting for his bride.  A beaming
Princess, unable to control her joy. There was more; flawless
organisation, hat dysfunction as the wind blew and blew, hatchets buried as the
Duke of Edinburgh settled into a seat in near Sarah, Duchess of York with whom
he has had a frosty - sometimes frozen -  relationship. But most noticeable at
Windsor?  The applause that followed the national anthem, and the cheers
for the Queen as she left the Chapel. No-one

Prince Philip ""took quite a big step"" towards reconciliation with the Duchess of York at today's wedding, according to a body language expert. Judi James said the Duke of Edinburgh was warm towards Sarah Ferguson and approached her with a smile, despite reported tensions between the pair after her divorce from Prince Andrew. ""You could tell the tension as soon as the duchess arrived in the church,"" she said. ""As soon as she walked in she pulled her arms into her side and put her head down."" But, she continued: ""She got quite the look from Philip, he smiled at her at least twice, almost as if he had planned to greet her warmly. ""That was quite a big step for the Duke of Edinburgh."" The duchess may not have been aware, however, as she was seated with her back to him. ""Unless she had eyes in the back of her head, she wouldn't have known,"" said Ms James. ""She probably didn't want to take the risk of turning round."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's wedding was attended by the majority of the royal family. But there was one very conspicuous absentee, the Duchess of Cornwall. Prince Charles's wife was actually in Scotland to visit a village school. The Duchess of Rothesay, as she is known in Scotland, had a longstanding invitation to the school in Aberdeenshire.   Maeve Henry, from Amersham, brought her three-year-old
daughter Elise Bright to Windsor as the little girl is âobsessed with
princessesâ. Elise said of Princess Eugenie: âShe looked pretty.â Maeve added: âElise loved it. It was a very nice calm day
out. ""Harryâs was chaos but this was really nice: there wasnât much of a spark,
and I wouldnât say it was electric - they could have done with some music for
the crowds. But calm is the word I would use to describe it.â Here are some more views from the crowds at Windsor,
where itâs estimated about 3,000 gathered to cheer Princess Eugenie and her new
husband. Jackie Brown, from Ashford, Surrey, said: âIâm such a
royal fan. Iâve always followed them, since Charles and Anne were youngsters. âIâd have liked to see more than just the carriage, but
Iâm so glad we came. We had a great time and spoke to people from all over the
world.â Georgina Moroney, from Swindon, said: âIâm a royal geek.
Itâs just all part of our heritage. Theyâre fantastic - I love the romance of
it all. âShe looked so radiant.â Hereâs a picture taken by Amy Gardner who was watching
and said the couple looked straight at her. âShe looked so beautiful - it was lovely. Itâs definitely
worth the wait,"" she said. ""They looked right at the camera, which was great.â Among the crowds watching Eugenie and Jack leaving the
castle in their carriage was a group of friends whoâd gathered especially for
the occasion. Rachel Price-Greenow, from Hereford, admitting she had a
tear in her eye watching the couple go by. âI got emotional,â she said. âI was quite teary. Itâs
just lovely. I love all the pomp and sense of occasion.â Her friend Helen Freeman, from Swansea, was wearing a
home-made fascinator with the coupleâs initials embroidered on top. âItâs a royal event - and youâve got to wear a fascinator
to a wedding,â she said. âThey just seem like a normal couple, which is great.â Gemma Morgan, also from Hereford, said: âSomeone in a
shop here was telling us this wedding feels more like a community event - itâs really relaxed and friendly.â Alice Smart, from Manchester, said: âThey seem really
sweet and humble. And itâs great to be here to celebrate this, as thereâs so
much unhappiness in the world.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A passage from the book was read by Princess Beatrice during the ceremony. Turns out it's because the novel's famous character Jay Gatsby has a special place in Princess Eugenie's relationship with Jack Brooksbank. The Dean of Windsor said the princess had read the book not long after meeting her husband and it made her think of him. Addressing the congregation, the dean said: ""The words that particularly reminded her of Jack concern Gatsby's smile. ""As we heard from the reading 'It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it ... it concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour'. ""Well, a few years have passed and Eugenie and Jack come here today to smile on each other, and to offer each other something like 'eternal reassurance' and the promise of an 'irresistible prejudice' in each other's favour.""

The couple were understood to be heading to the York family home, Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, for their evening reception. The families paid for the private aspects of the wedding. However, republican campaigners said taxpayers faced an estimated Â£2m security bill. The campaign group Republic argued that as Princess Eugenie, the ninth in line to the throne, did not carry out public duties, the families should foot the bill.

"This video can not be played Judith Moritz shows us around one of the UK's first horizontal exploration wells An injunction has been lodged to halt the start of fracking at one of the UK's first horizontal exploration wells. Cuadrilla has drilled two wells at its Preston New Road site in Lancashire after being given the go-ahead to extract shale gas by the government. The company's chief executive Francis Egan announced on Friday that fracking was due to start at one well next week. However, the injunction bid will be heard at the High Court on 10 October. Anti-fracking campaigner Bob Dennett from Lytham lodged papers at the court seeking an injunction to halt fracking operations in Little Plumpton. He has claimed there was ""no clear and robust plan"" to evacuate residents in the event of an earthquake resulting from fracking. A Cuadrilla spokesman said they were aware of the ""last-ditch attempt to delay our efforts"" but called the grounds for a judicial review ""hopelessly weak"". ""We remain confident that we and Lancashire County Council have undertaken all necessary risk assessments and have thorough emergency response safety procedures in place,"" the spokesman added. Tina Rothery from Frack Free Lancashire said she dreaded the start of fracking The site has been the scene of repeated protests from campaigners who object to hydraulic fracturing and its potential impact on the environment. The process sees liquid pumped at high pressure deep underground to fracture rock and release gas. In 2011, fracking operations by Cuadrilla were suspended at Preese Hall near Blackpool afterthey were linked with two earth tremors. Campaigner Tina Rothery, from Frack Free Lancashire, claimed people in the area were being treated like ""guinea pigs"". ""We have feared and dreaded this day for seven years,"" she said. What is fracking? Fracking given go-ahead by government Fracking gear brought to first UK wells ""We have done everything we can that is permitted in our democracy to stop this and we have had to resort to peaceful, not direct action. ""Why is it acceptable for the government to allow us to be treated like guinea pigs?"" Cuadrilla completed the first horizontal shale gas well in April, with a second well finished in July. The company's CEO Francis Egan said results from a six-month test period were expected early next year. These will provide information on how much gas the firm could potentially recover.

" On a warm summer's evening, Maryna Kovalenko is playing football with her two teenage daughters in their backyard. Iryna and Olena laugh as the family dog attempts to wrestle away the ball, scattering the startled chickens. But out beyond the family’s back fence, all is silent and still. Numerous houses, a shop and a library stand vacant in the village of Steshchyna, northern Ukraine. Only the forest is gaining ground as creeping plants explore the cracks in this abandoned village. An abandoned house on the outskirts of the town of Chernobyl The family do have a few neighbours, but almost all are in their 70s and 80s. Despite the lack of amenities or opportunities, four years ago Maryna and her daughters packed up everything they owned and travelled hundreds of miles across Ukraine to live here - just 30km from the Chernobyl nuclear exclusion zone. Toys left behind in an abandoned nursery in the city of Pripyat On 26 April 1986, Chernobyl suffered the world’s worst nuclear disaster. An experiment designed to test the safety of the power plant went wrong and caused a fire which spewed radiation for 10 days. Clouds carrying radioactive particles drifted for thousands of miles, releasing toxic rain all over Europe. Those living close to Chernobyl - about 116,000 people - wereimmediately evacuated. A 30km exclusion zone was imposed around the damaged reactor. This was later expanded to cover more affected areas. Toy trucks left behind in an abandoned nursery Over the next few months a further 234,000 people were moved out. Almost all left in a hurry. Some were given just a few hours to pack up all their belongings. Others were told they would only be gone a few days, but werenever allowed back. Many of the evacuees, who were subsistence farmers, found themselves rehoused in concrete tower blocks. A child's shoes left behind in an abandoned nursery in the city of Pripyat But some people never left. Today it is still illegal to live inside the exclusion zone. Despite this,about 130 to 150 peopledo. Many are women, still farming their ancestral land in their 70s and 80s. And just outside of the exclusion zone, there are a number of new arrivals. Maryna’s house is in desperate need of repair. The floors are rotting and the metal radiators have cracked - a major problem in a place where temperatures can drop to -20C in the winter. They have basic amenities - gas, electricity and a mobile phone signal, which means they can access the internet. But they only have an outside toilet. Water is a problem - their only source is a polluted well which connects to the house via a single pipe. They need to boil all their water before it’s used. A house in good condition in the village might cost $3,500, but such properties are rare. Most of the vacant homes - many made of wood - are being sold by their former occupants for less than a few hundred dollars. Iryna's sketches cover the walls of the sisters' bedroom Maryna was too poor to buy even one of those when she arrived. Instead, the governing council offered her family an unusual house-share. In return for their bed and board, the family cared for an elderly man in the late stages of dementia. When he died two years ago, the family inherited the house. Outside in the yard, Iryna and Olena show off the rest of their “family” - several hens, rabbits, goats, even a couple of guinea-pigs. When not at the school - a 5km walk away - the sisters spend much of their time helping mum in the garden, growing vegetables and looking after the animals. The family’s sole source of income is state benefits -  $183 a month (5,135 Ukrainian hryvnia). Growing their own food and keeping livestock for milk and meat is essential on their budget. Maryna and her daughters fled from Toshkivka, a large industrial town in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine. After four years of conflict in the east of the country, an estimated10,000 people have been killed, and about two million displaced. The conflict began in 2014. After Russia’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula, armed separatists claiming to act on behalf of local Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine decided to act. Fighters declared two separatist enclaves around the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk in the Donbass, the heart of the Ukraine’s coal industry. As pro-Russian separatists began capturing villages and driving the Ukrainian military out of the region’s towns and cities, Maryna and her daughters’ home came under heavy shelling. Except for a few hours each morning, the bombardment was relentless. During these temporary ceasefires, everyone would attempt to regain some sense of normality. Iryna and Olena would go to school, while Maryna went to the market. But by noon, the firing would resume. Most nights were spent sheltering in the cellar. Walking home from school during one such hiatus, Iryna and Olena were unexpectedly caught in crossfire. With mortars raining down, Maryna could not get to them. The girls owe their survival to a shopkeeper, who dragged them off the street and into the safety of her cellar. That’s when Maryna decided they had to leave. A monument to Lenin, the first leader of the USSR There are at least ten other families from the Donbass region who have made the same long journey to the abandoned villages close to the exclusion zone. Like Maryna, most of them came on the recommendation of old friends or neighbours. One woman even says she simply Googled “cheapest place to live in the Ukraine”. The result - near to Chernobyl. Signposts of the evacuated ""dead"" villages around Chernobyl Since the disaster, scientists have been continuously monitoring the radiation levels in the soil, trees, plants and animals around Chernobyl, even in areas outside the exclusion zone. There is no longer a risk from radiation in the atmosphere, says Dr Valery Kashparov, from the Ukrainian Institute of Agricultural Radiology (UIAR). But in some areas soil contamination could pose a threat to people’s health. Kashparov and his team recently found potentiallydangerous levels of radioactive caesium-137in cow’s milk produced in some areas outside the exclusion zone. Caesium particles, absorbed by grass roots, had been passed on to grazing cattle. Olena picks apples from her garden In large enough quantities, ingesting it can damage human cells, and in some cases lead to serious diseases such as thyroid cancer. But these risks, Kashparov says, are confined to specific hotspots. For more than 30 years his team have been working to map such hotspots so they can estimate the potential risk for people living and working around the exclusion zone. On one map, showing the dispersion of caesium-137 from the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, Kashparov looks at the village of Steshchyna where Maryna and her daughters live. He says the risk from growing vegetables or drinking goats’ milk in a place like Steshchyna is very low. But the area is currently being investigated for the risk of radiation in wild food stuffs, such as forest mushrooms or wild berries. Maryna says she has thought about the potential risks from radiation, but that her family was fleeing from something much more dangerous - the threat of war. ""Radiation may kill us slowly, but it doesn't shoot or bomb us,"" says Maryna. ""It's better to live with radiation than with war"". Background image: Declining caesium levels.

""Radiation may kill us slowly, but it doesn't shoot or bomb us,"" says Maryna. ""It's better to live with radiation than with war"". Less than two hours’ drive from the capital Kiev, along the perimeter of the exclusion zone, it’s not just families looking for opportunities in these ghost towns, but also entrepreneurs. Every day Vadim Minzuyk walks his dog along the high wire fence marking out the beginning of the exclusion zone. It’s his favourite place to enjoy the birdsong and the quiet of the forest. ""It’s like living in the north of Finland or Alaska,"" says Vadim. ""This area has the lowest population density of anywhere in Ukraine - only two people per square kilometre.” In his former hometown of Horlivka, eastern Ukraine, Vadim was a businessman turning over a million dollars a year. But after the town ended up on the front line, pounded by artillery, his once-flourishing factories and warehouses were obliterated - some are just craters now. Horlivka is still being fought over. Vadim remembers looking out of his back window to see the rebels erecting a barricade right against his garden fence. Sometimes the two armies would be stationed only 100m apart. For more than a year, his family endured daily ID checks at military checkpoints across the city. They saw dead bodies left lying along the roadside. They even witnessed a murder, when a man was pulled from the car right in front of them by rebels and shot dead in broad daylight. After evacuating his children, Vadim and his wife soon followed. Driving out of Horlivka, they left everything behind them. For several months, living off savings, Vadim travelled around Ukraine looking for ways for his family to start again. One day, he had a tip-off. A relative had heard about cheap property for sale near Chernobyl. He went to see an abandoned grain silo in the village of Dytyatky. Lying right on the border of the exclusion zone, property was cheap, but it was also close enough to the capital city of Kiev (115km) to make it a viable business opportunity. “The roof was leaking where locals had stripped it of all its metal. I met the owner, and we struck a cheap deal.” Buying up the warehouse for $1,400, and a further three houses for just $240, he connected them all to the electricity grid and started up a smelting business. “My strategy was to start a business by producing a product made out of waste.The first year was the most difficult, but over the last two years I feel much better."" Vadim even re-employed seven of his former workers from Donbass, offering them accommodation by converting one of his houses into a hostel. ""I can make a living and help my workers to make money too. I’m the largest taxpayer here in the village. After all, I’m Ukrainian and I want to help my country.” Vadim says he does sometimes think about the radiation. He even bought himself a handheld Geiger counter to measure it. But he’s not worried. He is confident that the atmospheric radiation level is safe. “After what you witness in war, radiation is nothing. It was a miracle we survived.” He’s enjoying life here. It’s not just the absence of war, but a special kind of peace. Both Maryna and Vadim’s families talk about their love of taking long quiet walks in the forest. Life may be basic, but neither family wants to move to a bigger town, even if it would mean more friends or opportunities. Their need for stillness after fleeing from the chaos of war is sobering. ""I don’t care about the radiation,"" says Maryna. ""I only care that there are no shells flying over my children. It’s quiet here. We sleep well and we don’t need to hide.” Vadim says his wife Olena sometimes likens parts of the derelict exclusion zone to their war-torn hometown of Horlivka.

"Theresa May's Brexit proposals have divided her cabinet The prime minister would ""never agree"" to a permanent customs union with the EU, No 10 says, amid concern from ministers about Brexit compromises. They are thought to fear that Theresa May will agree to such a move, if a trade deal cannot be done in time. Downing Street insists any post-Brexit customs union would be ""time limited"". EU leaders meet next week for what has been described by European Council president Donald Tusk as a ""moment of truth for Brexit negotiations"". The EU leaders are not expected to reach agreement with the UK but they say they want to see if ""decisive progress"" has been made to convene a special summit in November, to finalise a deal. Tory-DUP Brexit war of words intensifies Latest no-deal Brexit contingency plans Laura Kuenssberg on the cabinet's customs union unease Hammond expects 'Brexit deal dividend' Meanwhile,it has emergedthat a motorway in Kent is being shut overnight as part of contingency preparations in case the Brexit negotiations ultimately fail and the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 without a deal. And Northern Ireland's DUP, which supports Theresa May's government in key Commons votes, has warned it could vote against her Budget next month, if Brexit negotiations result in trade barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK is due to leave both the customs union and the single market when it leaves the EU in March 2019. Trying to resolve what should happen on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - an EU member - has been a key sticking point in Brexit negotiations. Please upgrade your browser Brexit: All you need to know The UK and the EU both want to avoid a ""hard border"" - physical checks or infrastructure - should a long-term trade deal not be concluded before temporary post-Brexit arrangements designed to give businesses time to adjust come to an end in December 2020. Brussels has suggested that, if that happens, Northern Ireland should stay in the EU customs union - something the UK says is unacceptable as it would effectively create a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, down the Irish Sea. By BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake Delving into the detail can be fascinating, if frustrating, for those following Brexit closely. But the big picture is always important and that has been playing out for all to see over the past 24 hours. Theresa May, at a crucial stage in the negotiations, is having to work to keep her own sideonside. Days before a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels when both sides will want to show some sign of progress at least, ministers are worried about what the UK could be about to agree to. Those unsure have a choice, stay and hope for the best or decide they can't support the prime minister's plan after all. In June the UK government brought forward its proposal for a""temporary customs arrangement"",externalbetween the EU and the UK as a whole, which would eliminate the need for tariffs, quotas, rules of origin and customs processes on UK-EU trade. That included the line that the ""UK expects the future arrangement to be in place by the end of December 2021 at the latest"", whichfollowed a cabinet row. BBC political editorLaura Kuenssberg saidit was understood that the EU was now prepared to accept the idea of the whole of the UK remaining in the customs union if a trade deal cannot be done during the so-called ""transition period"". But it is understood they have not accepted that there should be a time limit on it. Many Conservative Brexiteers argue an open-ended arrangement is unacceptable. It is understood that cabinet ministers Liam Fox, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab and Jeremy Hunt expressed concerns about the possibility of such an outcome. Speaking on Friday, Brexit Secretary Mr Raab said any such arrangement ""would have to be finite, it would have to be short and it would have to be, I think, time-limited in order for it to be supported here."" He added: ""What we cannot do is see the United Kingdom locked in via the backdoor to a customs union arrangement which would leave us in an indefinite limbo - that would not be leaving the EU."" A Downing Street spokeswoman said: ""The prime minister would never agree to a deal which would trap the UK in a backstop permanently."" She added: ""Our position is that this future economic relationship needs to be in place by the end of December 2021 at the latest."" Amid speculation she could resign, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom told the BBC she was ""really looking forward to us getting a good deal for the United Kingdom"" and that was ""all I am focused on"". Asked about the customs union concerns, she added: ""We are at the final stages of a really complicated negotiation and I do think we have to give the prime minister the opportunity to be able to do a good deal for the United Kingdom, something that she is absolutely determined to do."" Conservative backbench Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns tweeted that remaining in a customs union would be the ""ultimate betrayal"" of Leave voters. Allow Twitter content?

"South Korean President Moon Jae-in has told the BBC that it is only a matter of time before the US and North Korea declare an end to their state of war on the Korean peninsula. The war ended in 1953 with an armistice but a peace treaty was never signed. Mr Moon, the son of North Korean refugees, also said there could be more diplomatic ""bumps and bruises"" as he tries to persuade Kim Jong-un to give up his nuclear weapons. But he described Mr Kim as ""candid"". The leader caught between Trump and Kim Seeing through Kim Jong-un's K-pop sign The son of refugees who became president Moon's unprecedented speech at mass games In an interview with the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul, he also said he hoped European leaders would help him to mediate between Mr Kim and US President Donald Trump if negotiations stalled. Mr Moon has met Mr Kim three times this year and has acted as a mediator between him and Mr Trump. Mr Moon said that he had had ""ample discussions"" with President Trump and other US officials about an end-of-war declaration. This video can not be played South Korea's President Moon Jae-in: ""The dogs are designated as national treasures in North Korea"" ""If North Korea takes certain measures, the end-of-war declaration would be a political statement that would announce that the longstanding hostile relations between Pyongyang and Washington had ended,"" he said. Mr Moon said he wanted this to happen at the ""earliest possible date"" and he believed there was a ""shared understanding between Washington and Seoul regarding this view"". Korea summit puts diplomacy back on track The stories behind Korean family reunions Imagine a North Korean family... Last month, he became the first South Korean leader to give a speech to the North Korean public during a trip to Pyongyang. He spoke at the Arirang Games - a major propaganda event - and received a standing ovation from 150,000 people. ""I was actually quite nervous to give the speech,"" he said. ""I had to address the problem of denuclearisation and had to receive positive vibes from the North Korean people. And also I had to satisfy the Korean public as well as the global public. So it was not an easy task for me."" By Laura Bicker, BBC News, Seoul President Moon gives little away. He is careful with his words and answers all the questions thoughtfully. When I asked who was easier to deal with - Kim Jong-un or Donald Trump, he suppressed a wry smile. What is very clear to me is that his extensive diplomatic efforts, which also involve praising these two unpredictable leaders, are part of a personal mission. President Moon is driven by his desire to see peace on the peninsula. That's why he's in politics. Away from the formal interview setting, as we walked through the beautiful grounds of the presidential office known as the Blue House, Mr Moon was more relaxed. Smiling and keen to tell me more about his visit to Pyongyang, he even admitted to being nervous as he addressed 150,000 North Koreans at the Mass Games. He was obviously more comfortable sitting on the ground in the  shade of a tree playing with the two rare dogs gifted by Kim Jong-un than he was in the interview chair. He also took real delight as I tried out my level 1 Korean. President Moon is an optimist when it comes to his dream of ending the Korean War. But some fear that he may not be a realist. He said that Mr Kim had not set any restrictions on the speech. ""He didn't even want to know what I was going to say before the speech. I believe this demonstrates the changes that are happening in North Korea right now."" This video can not be played How North Korea welcomed the South Korean leader President Moon told the BBC that he became president of South Korea to help prevent war returning to the peninsula and said that he acutely felt the pain of war and separation. Mr Moon's parents fled North Korea in 1953 and they never saw their family again. This video can not be played The war that never officially ended Began with an incursion across the 38th parallel, the boundary between North and South Korea, by 75,000 troops from the Communist North in June 1950. American troops entered the war on the side of the South in the following months and the North Koreans, supported by China and the USSR, were pushed back. After some back and forth across the boundary, a bloody stalemate ensued. An armistice was signed in July 1953 by the US and North Korea. South Korea was not a signatory. Five million troops and civilians lost their lives in the conflict. There have been ups and down since a landmark June meeting between Mr Kim and Mr Trump in Singapore saw an agreement to work toward denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, but with few specifics in terms of actions that would be taken. President Moon went to Pyongyang in September to reinvigorate the stalled negotiations. He returned with concessions that analysts said exceeded expectations. Mr Kim agreed to shut one of the country's main missile testing and launch sites - the Tongchang-ri facility. Significantly, North Korea said international experts would be able to observe and verify the dismantlement. The South's defence minister and the head of the North Korean army also signed an agreement to reduce military tensions, with a buffer zone to be established along the border to prevent accidental clashes. The US has called for further actions - including a full disclosure of North Korea's weapons and nuclear facilities. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited North Korea for the fourth time on Sunday, and held talks with Mr Kim. ""While there's still a long way to go and much work to do, we can now see a path where we will achieve [our] ultimate goal, which is the full and final verified denuclearisation of North Korea,"" he said on Tuesday at the White House. He added that international inspectors could soon be arriving at two North Korean nuclear sites. A second meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Kim will be held after the US mid-term elections, President Trump also said earlier this week. He has praised Mr Kim on several occasions and again asserted that they had a ""very good relationship"".

"Much of the cost of the latest royal wedding will ultimately be paid for by UK taxpayers On 12 October Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank will be tying the knot in Windsor. Their marriage will mark thesecond royal wedding of the yearfollowing Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's ceremony back in May. So how much is it expected to cost and who pays? Providing security is likely to be one of the bigger expenses. That bill will be borne by the police - and, by extension, the taxpayer. Security inside Windsor Castle will be handled by diplomatic protection officers - a branch of London's Metropolitan Police Service. Security in the town of Windsor itself will be met by the local force, Thames Valley Police. It hasn't said how much it thinks that will cost. However, it haspublished some details,externalabout the sort of security measures it will provide - such as putting up anti-vehicle barriers, carrying out searches, using sniffer dogs and providing ""a higher presence of armed and non-armed officers"" in and around Windsor. Jack Brooksbank and Princess Eugenie Princess Eugenie's wedding comes five months after Prince Harry and Meghan also married at Windsor Castle. Not long after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's big day, Thames Valley's police and crime commissioner, Anthony Stansfeld, told the BBC that the estimated cost of policing their wedding was ""between Â£2m and Â£4m"". We also know that Â£6.35m was spent by the Metropolitan Police Service on security for the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton back in 2011 - that's based on a Freedom of Information requestreleased to the Press Association,external. We asked Mr Stansfeld's office to provide a similar estimate for Princess Eugenie's ceremony - but we were told this wouldn't be possible ""until it has concluded"". Eugenie's wedding is expected to attract a smaller crowd and there will also be a considerably shorter carriage ride. The BBC understands that logically, the cost to Thames Valley Police should be lower than that of Prince Harry's wedding - but until all the numbers are crunched they can't say for certain. Some newspapers suggest the security billcould be about Â£2m,external- but this is only an estimate and not an official figure. Initially, Thames Valley Police has to absorb the costs. After the wedding the police will be allowed to make an application to the Home Office for a ""special grant,external"" to recoup some of the money. Special grants - funded by the taxpayer - are available to all police forces in England and Wales to help with the cost ofpolicing unexpected and exceptional events,external. The cost of the event must be more than 1% of a force's annual budget to qualify. In the case of Thames Valley this would be about Â£3.7m - based on last year'sannual budget of Â£372m,external. The force has not yet claimed for Prince Harry's wedding, but deputy police and crime commissioner Matthew Barber says that Thames Valley Police will be doing so ""in due course"". The complexity of the operation, as well as the number of organisations involved, means that costs are still to be finalised, he said. The couple will walk down the aisle of St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle Other organisations, such as the local council, will also be involved, and that will lead to additional public cost. Abudget report,externalon the Windsor and Maidenhead Borough Council website shows that the local authority spent Â£1.2m on Prince Harry's wedding in May. This cost includes Â£495,000 on stewarding, Â£108,000 on providing toilets, and Â£75,744 on setting up a temporary car park. The council also received income of Â£73,332 - the majority coming from parking and media fees. In addition, the local economy is likely to have received a boost from the influx of people visiting the town - but the precise impact is hard to quantify. The report reveals that central government (again, by extension, the UK taxpayer) reimbursed most of the bill, meaning the final cost to the council was Â£92,891. Windsor and Maidenhead says it's too early to work out how much it needs to spend this time, but it is hopeful that it will receive another government reimbursement. Princess Eugenie is ninth in line to the throne - a ""minor royal"" in the eyes of some critics. Republic, which campaigns for an elected head of state, hasset up a petition,externalurging the government ""to commit no public money"" towards the royal wedding. So far it's received about 40,000 signatures. Republic's vice-chairwoman, Dani Beckett, argues that as Princess Eugenie is not a working royal - ie she doesn't carry out public duties as a member of the royal family - the wedding should be treated as a private event, and all elements (including security) should be paid for by the couple themselves. ""No-one has forced her to have a carriage and a high-profile ceremony. There are other ways she could have chosen to have had a less lavish wedding,"" says Ms Beckett. Eugenie wedding: All you need to know Royal wedding 2018: Who's paying? Buckingham Palace says the cost of supplying security ""is a matter for the police"". So why are the police providing security - at public expense - for Princess Eugenie's wedding? Decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, regardless of how major or minor the royal is, according to Dai Davies, a former head of royal protection. ""In truth you have to look at the threat assessment and someone has to make a judgement,"" he says. ""Will the couple in question attract attention and is there a potential risk to the public?"" If the answer is yes, the police - according to Mr Davies - are obliged to provide security, no matter how major or minor the royal person is perceived to be. There will be an increased presence of armed and unarmed officers in and around Windsor The private aspects of the wedding - such as flowers, entertainment and the dress - will be paid for by the royal family itself. But how distant a relative do you need to be to expect the Queen to pay for your wedding? ""The Queen herself draws the line on which weddings the Royal Family chooses to pay for,"" says Dickie Arbiter, a former royal press secretary. So in theory the Queen can fund any wedding she chooses to, no matter how far down in line of succession. But in reality Mr Arbiter says she restricts it to her children and grandchildren. Every year the royal family gets a chunk of money from the annual Sovereign Grantworth Â£82m this year,external, paid directly by the Treasury. Some members of the royal family also benefit from additional income. For example, Prince Charles gets money from the Duchy of Cornwall estate, a portfolio of land, property and financial investments. But it's not clear from which ""pots"" the Palace will choose to fund Princess Eugenie's wedding. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"The couple issued a number of photographs before their big day, including one taken of them celebrating the New Year Hot on the heels of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the second royal wedding of the year is fast approaching. Same venue, different people - Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank are the couple tying the knot on 12 October. So what can you expect this time around? Here's everything you need to know. She is the Queen's granddaughter and the second daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York. The 28-year-old is ninth in line to the throne, just behind her sister Beatrice. The princess, who studied English and history of art at Newcastle University, is a director at contemporary art gallery Hauser and Wirth in London. In an interview with British Vogue,,externalshe said she had an ""anti-plastic"" house and wanted their wedding to follow suit, reflecting their environmentally-friendly views. A profile of Princess Eugenie Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice make waves at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Eugenie (right) calls her mother, the Duchess of York, ""Mumsy"" Jack Brooksbank is a brand manager for Casamigos Tequila, which was co-founded by George Clooney Jack Brooksbank, the former manager of Mayfair club Mahiki, met the princess when she was 20, on a skiing trip to Verbier in the Swiss Alps.

Princess Eugenie will walk down the aisle of St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle The couple will wed at 11:00 BST on 12 October at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. It's the same venue used by Prince Harry and Meghan. After the ceremony the newlyweds will take a carriage ride through Windsor, but will not go up the Long Walk like the Duke and Duchess of Sussex did in May. Princess Eugenie arrived with her father, Prince Andrew, for the royal wedding in May In the afternoon, the Queen will host a reception for her granddaughter and her new husband and guests, at Windsor Castle. Evening celebrations will reportedly be staged at Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park - the property is the family home of Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah. As with the first royal wedding of the year, the wedding will be paid for privately except for the security - which will be picked up by the taxpayer. Who's paying for Harry and Meghan's wedding? Anti-monarchist campaign group Republic claims security costs are estimated to be Â£2m. The full security bill for Prince Harry's wedding to Meghan Markle is yet to be revealed, although this one is expected to be much cheaper because of the couple's lower profile. Could singer Ellie Goulding, seen here with Eugenie at a New York Knicks game, make an appearance? Just like Meghan and Harry's wedding, 1,200 members of the public have been invited into the castle grounds to see the couple tie the knot. Buckingham Palace said they had received more than 100,000 applications from people wanting to attend. Representatives of charities and organisations supported by the couple will be among the guests in the castle grounds, including the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, the Teenage Cancer Trust, the Salvation Army and the UN Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women. There will also be children from two local schools which Princess Eugenie attended - St George's School and Coworth Flexlands School. About 800 guests will be at the wedding service, with a few famous faces expected to be among them. Some of Eugenie's friends include singer Ellie Goulding, model Cara Delevingne and Sir Richard Branson's children, Holly and Sam. Others expected to attend include supermodel Cindy Crawford, David and Victoria Beckham, Prince Harry's ex-girlfriends Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy, model Cara Delevingne, singer James Blunt and wife Sofia Wellesley, and George and Amal Clooney. London-based designer Erdem, who was behind Eugenie's dress for her engagement photo shoot, is a contender to design her wedding gown The princesstold Vogue,externalthe dress was the one thing she had been ""decisive"" about. ""As soon as we announced the wedding, I knew the designer, and the look, straight away,"" she said. ""I never thought I'd be the one who knew exactly what I like, but I've been pretty on top of it."" She hinted at her ideasin an interview with the BBC's The One Show.Asked whether she would wear a straight gown or a meringue, Eugenie replied: ""Maybe a mix of both. Can you do that? Is there such a thing? ""No meringue shoulders - that's a little bit out of fashion - maybe it's in fashion now? We'll see what happens."" Erdem - a London-based designer - has been suggested as one of the favourites to design the wedding dress. The princess wore a floral, cap-sleeve dress by the Canadian-born designer for her engagement photo-shoot at Buckingham Palace. When Princess Eugenie's mother married the Duke of York in 1986, she initially hid her tiara under a crown of flowers... ...only revealing it after signing the register to symbolise her new royal status. She wore the York diamond tiara, a wedding gift from the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, many times after the wedding and kept it following her split from Prince Andrew in 1992. So could Princess Eugenie's ""something borrowed"" be her mother's tiara? Or perhaps, like Catherine and Meghan, the Queen will lend her one from her personal collection. Princess Eugenie's sister Beatrice, 30, will be her maid of honour. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

"Royal fans are gearing up for the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank in Windsor on Friday. But who are the pair preparing to say ""I do""? Here's all you need to know about the happy couple. Art-loving Eugenie (pronounced YOO-juh-nee, not you-JAY-nee, but she's said she's""used to every pronunciation"",external) is the Queen's granddaughter and is ninth in line to the throne. Born in 1990 - full name Princess Eugenie Victoria Helena of York - she's now 28 and is the younger daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, and the sister of Princess Beatrice. All you need to know about princess's big day What's the cost and who's paying? Royal Family tree and line of succession Her parents divorced when Eugenie was six, but the family of four has remained a tight unit. Eugenie works at a central London art gallery She hadsurgery when she was 12,externalto correct curvature of the spine, having been born with scoliosis. She lives with metal rods in her back as a result and has become patron of the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital. Eugenie went to Marlborough College in Wiltshire - also attended by cousin-in-law the Duchess of Cambridge - where she took A-levels in art, English literature and history of art before heading on a gap year to countries including Thailand and South Africa. She studied English, politics and history of art at Newcastle University - graduating with a 2:1 - and is now an associate director at contemporary art gallery Hauser & Wirth in central London. She says her favourite artist is Jean-Michael Basquiat, the pioneer of the 1980s New York art scene. Eugenie with her sister Beatrice at Ascot earlier this year According to aHarper's Bazaar profile,external, Eugenie gets up at 6.45am every day to do exercise, has a pet dog who's also called Jack, does make-up in the car on the way to work, and likes to relax by watching Netflix and eating cashew nuts with mustard. As well as her work at the gallery, she also spends time carrying out royal engagements - though she is not a full-time working royal, which means taxpayers don't pay for her police protection - and says her family is the most important thing in her life. Princess Eugenie spoke about her work as director of the Anti-Slavery Collective to the UN in New York this summer She supports charities include the Elephant Family, the Teenage Cancer Trust, the Coronet Theatre and the European School of Osteopathy. She also spoke to the UN earlier this year, in her capacity as director of the Anti-Slavery Collective. Drinks executive Jack Brooksbank, 32, dated Princess Eugenie for about seven years before proposing while they were on holiday in Nicaragua. They met through their mutual love of skiing, with friends introducing them while they were in Verbier, Switzerland. Mr Brooksbank said it was love at first sight. He went to Stowe School, one of the most prestigious private schools in the UK, before studying at the University of Bristol. Jack Brooksbank works for a tequila company He started working life in the hospitality industry, eventually becoming manager of Mahiki, a club which was often attended by Prince Harry and Princess Beatrice. After helping to launch a Mexican-themed pub in Chelsea, co-founded by Harry's friend Guy Pelly, he got a job as a brand ambassador for Casamigos tequila. Its co-founders include Rande Gerber, husband of supermodel Cindy Crawford, and Hollywood star George Clooney. The couple get married in Windsor on Friday The Duke of York has described his future son-in-law as ""an absolutely outstanding young man"", with Sarah, Duchess of York, saying she loved him and was ""so excited to have a son, a brother and best friend"". She's nicknamed him ""Jack the Man"". His grandmother Joanna Newton, 91, told the MailOnline that she was surprised he was marrying a royal though - describing him as a ""charming boy"" but joking he was ""not the most intelligent"".

"An immigration enforcement hotline was called 68 times by MPs or their staff last year, it has been revealed. Charities have now written to Commons Speaker John Bercow asking MPs to pledge not to inform on constituents, arguing people should not have to fear being reported on by their MPs. The pledge has been signed by107 MPs,external, however, Heidi Allen is the only Tory. A number of Tory MPs said they ""would be expected by most constituents to report any suspected illegal activity"". Some Labour MPs also declined to sign, without making their reasons public. Of the 68 calls by MPs to the hotline, 34 were from Conservatives, 32 from Labour, one DUP and one Lib Dem. The immigration hotline statistics were revealed in written questions by Labour MP David Lammy. Mr Lammy's questions also revealed that between 30 September 2012 and 25 May 2018, MPs reported immigration abuse to the Home Office 723 times. The group of charities that wrote the letter - shown to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme - to the House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow, said they would tell people not to seek advice from MPs who did not sign. It asks him to raise the issue in the House of Commons ""at the earliest opportunity and request that party whips instruct their MPs to immediately cease the practice"". ""MPs have a responsibility to advocate for all their constituents, regardless of immigration status,"" the letter reads. ""Many migrants are now fearful of contacting their MP, effectively excluding them from democratic representation."" Lib Dem MP Tim Farron, who is also supporting the campaign, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""It astonishes me that any MP would think that the best way to respond to a vulnerable constituent is to shop them to the Home Office. ""Many of those immigrants who may be here illegally will be victims of administrative error, dodgy solicitors or even human trafficking."" Akram Salhab, who coordinated the campaign for the groups Migrants Organise and Global Justice Now, said that many MPs refusing to sign were confused about their duties. ""Some have said that they will not report people for immigration enforcement but may do if they have committed a crime. ""But these are separate issues - if someone has committed a serious crime, they should be reported to the police not the Home Office,"" he said. Mr Salhab said he feared those reported would be caught up in the ""Home Office's unjust broken system"", citing the Windrush scandal, in which migrants from Commonwealth countries were wrongly categorised as illegal immigrants. Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams, who recently raised the case of Bangor engineering student Shiromini Satkunarajah, one of his constituents, in the House of Commons - helping to stop her imminent deportation to Sri Lanka, said: ""I don't think that MPs should be reporting cases to the authorities. Hywel Williams MP worked to stop Shiromini Satkunarajah's deportation ""This would break the trust between MPs and their constituents. ""It would also discourage other vulnerable people from seeking help."" A number of Conservative MPs who declined to sign the pledge, including Alberto Costa and Craig Whittaker, said in a statement that while ""sometimes devastating"" mistakes had been made by the Home Office, lessons were being learned. ""Like any member of the public, an MP may decide to contact the Home Office to report suspected immigration offences just as he or she would be expected by most constituents to report any suspected illegal activity, not least because that is an obligation we all have.""

"The plane landed safely in the city of Mumbai A passenger plane travelling from the south Indian city of Trichy to Dubai sustained damage after hitting the airport wall during take off. Air India IX 611, which was carrying 130 passengers and six crew members, was diverted to Mumbai, where it landed safely. Air India said the two pilots, who have more than 6,500 hours of flying experience between them, have been grounded, pending investigation. Air India is India's national carrier. The airline said in a statement that the Boeing 737 aircraft took off from Trichy airport in southern India early on Friday when airport officials ""observed that aircraft might have come in contact with the airport perimeter wall"". The aircraft has sustained some damage. Jet Airways: Passengers hurt as pilots 'forget' cabin pressure Air India blames weather for bed bugs infestation ""The matter was conveyed to the pilot in command. The pilot in command reported that the aircraft systems were operating normally."" The plane was then diverted to the western city of Mumbai. The plane clipped the airport wall in Trichy The incident has been reported to the aviation regulator and Air India says it is cooperating with the investigation. It comes weeks after more than 30 passengers aboard Indian carrier Jet Airways had to receive treatmentafter pilots ""forgot"" to turn on a switch regulating cabin pressure. One of India's oldest airlines, Air India has not turned a profit since 2007. In June 2017, India's cabinet approved plans to privatise the carrier. But it failed to attract buyers after the federal government offered to sell a controlling stake. Any buyer would have to take on about $5bn (Â£3.7bn) of debt, which is only about half of what the airline owes.

"Princess Eugenie has married her long-term partner Jack Brooksbank at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. The ninth in line to the throne was watched by her grandmother, the Queen, and Prince Philip, along with other members of her family. Among 850 guests were celebrities such as Cara Delevingne and Robbie Williams, while 1,200 people chosen by ballot followed proceedings from the grounds. They cheered as the newlyweds kissed twice on the chapel steps. Royal wedding in pictures 'I wanted my wedding dress to show my scar' Hold on to your hats: Best wedding moments The view from the crowds Guests laid out picnic blankets and quaffed champagne but had umbrellas at the ready and often had to fix their fascinators in the blustery conditions. This video can not be played The Queen's granddaughter was married in front of 850 guests There were huge cheers when the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh arrived. The service was also attended by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. The Duchess of York spotted a friend in the crowd and rushed to embrace her Mother of the bride Sarah, Duchess of York, wore a vibrant green outfit and sat alongside her eldest daughter, Eugenie's sister, Princess Beatrice. However, theDuchess of Cornwall missed the serviceto attend engagements including a display of Highland dancing near the Royal Family's home at Balmoral. Royal Family members, including the Queen and Prince Philip, inside the chapel Pippa Middleton with her husband James Matthews (left) and brother James Middleton (right) Princess Eugenie, the 28-year-old daughter of Prince Andrew, kept breaking into a broad smile during the ceremony.

The bride asked for a low back to show her scar She wore the Queen's Greville Emerald Kokoshnik Tiara, made by Boucheron in 1919, featuring brilliant and rose-cut diamonds, pave set in platinum, with six emeralds on either side. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, acted as pageboy and bridesmaid. Charlotte waved enthusiastically at the crowds as they approached the chapel, though negotiating the steps in the high winds proved tricky. Charlotte struggled to keep balance, while pageboy Louis de Givenchy - son of family friends - took a tumble. Some of the youngsters were seen giggling and joking before walking down the aisle, appearing to imitate the royal trumpeters. However, George held his hand over his ear as the musicians heralded Eugenie's arrival. The bridesmaids and page boys at the ceremony Eugenie's sister, Princess Beatrice, was maid of honour. Mr Brooksbank chose his brother, Thomas, as best man. Numerous celebrities braved the weather, including singer Robbie Williams and his fellow X Factor judge Ayda Field, whose daughter Theodora, six, was a bridesmaid. Singer Ellie Goulding, comedians Stephen Fry and Jack Whitehall and supermodels Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell were in the congregation. Cara Delevingne grabbed the attention of social media commentators with a dashing top hat and tails combination. Cara Delevingne waved to crowds outside the wedding Naomi Campbell dressed to impress for the nuptials Actress Liv Tyler was among the 850 guests Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli performed two pieces during the ceremony, which also featured members of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Dean of Windsor David Conner officiated. This video can not be played Windy weather as royals and famous faces arrive for the wedding The couple travelled by carriage from St George's Chapel into Windsor, before heading for an afternoon reception hosted by the Queen in St George's Hall at the castle. It was estimated about 3,000 people gathered to cheer Princess Eugenie and her new husband. Rachel Price-Greenow, from Hereford, admitted she had a tear in her eye watching the couple go by. ""I got emotional!"" she said. ""I was quite teary. It's just lovely. I love all the pomp and sense of occasion."" Georgina Moroney, from Swindon, said: ""I'm a royal geek. It's just all part of our heritage. They're fantastic - I love the romance of it all. ""She looked so radiant."" Amy Gardner captured a photograph of the happy couple smiling and waving at the camera. ""She looked so beautiful - it was lovely,"" she said. ""It's definitely worth the wait."" However, Kerry Evans, 54, who arrived from Lincolnshire on Tuesday to secure a spot on the procession route, complained: ""Where were the Coldstream Guards? ""I expected to see military behind... and I'm thinking, really, that isn't a procession."" By Jonny Dymond, BBC royal correspondent, at Windsor The focus of the day was of course on the couple; an unsurprisingly nervous groom, his hand shaking at times, his gaze twitching as he waited for his bride; a beaming princess, unable to control her joy. There was more; flawless organisation, hat dysfunction as the wind blew and blew, hatchets buried as the Duke of Edinburgh settled into a seat near Sarah, Duchess of York, with whom he has had a frosty - sometimes frozen -  relationship. But most noticeable at Windsor? The applause that followed the national anthem and the cheers for the Queen as she left the chapel. No one eclipses the Queen in the affections of the British public. Eugenie and drinks executive Mr Brooksbank, who met when skiing in Switzerland in 2010, left the castle in a silver DB10 Aston Martin, originally made for the James Bond movie Spectre. The couple were understood to be heading to the York family home, Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, for their evening reception. The families paid for the private aspects of the wedding. However, republican campaigners said taxpayers faced an estimated Â£2m security bill. The campaign group Republic argued that as Princess Eugenie, the ninth in line to the throne, did not carry out public duties, the families should foot the bill. Buckingham Palace said security was a matter for the police. Are you ready for another royal wedding? Eugenie wedding: What's the cost and who's paying?

However, George held his hand over his ear as the musicians heralded Eugenie's arrival. The bridesmaids and page boys at the ceremony Eugenie's sister, Princess Beatrice, was maid of honour. Mr Brooksbank chose his brother, Thomas, as best man. Numerous celebrities braved the weather, including singer Robbie Williams and his fellow X Factor judge Ayda Field, whose daughter Theodora, six, was a bridesmaid. Singer Ellie Goulding, comedians Stephen Fry and Jack Whitehall and supermodels Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell were in the congregation. Cara Delevingne grabbed the attention of social media commentators with a dashing top hat and tails combination. Cara Delevingne waved to crowds outside the wedding Naomi Campbell dressed to impress for the nuptials Actress Liv Tyler was among the 850 guests Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli performed two pieces during the ceremony, which also featured members of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Dean of Windsor David Conner officiated. This video can not be played Windy weather as royals and famous faces arrive for the wedding The couple travelled by carriage from St George's Chapel into Windsor, before heading for an afternoon reception hosted by the Queen in St George's Hall at the castle. It was estimated about 3,000 people gathered to cheer Princess Eugenie and her new husband. Rachel Price-Greenow, from Hereford, admitted she had a tear in her eye watching the couple go by. ""I got emotional!"" she said. ""I was quite teary. It's just lovely. I love all the pomp and sense of occasion."" Georgina Moroney, from Swindon, said: ""I'm a royal geek. It's just all part of our heritage. They're fantastic - I love the romance of it all. ""She looked so radiant."" Amy Gardner captured a photograph of the happy couple smiling and waving at the camera. ""She looked so beautiful - it was lovely,"" she said. ""It's definitely worth the wait."" However, Kerry Evans, 54, who arrived from Lincolnshire on Tuesday to secure a spot on the procession route, complained: ""Where were the Coldstream Guards? ""I expected to see military behind... and I'm thinking, really, that isn't a procession."" By Jonny Dymond, BBC royal correspondent, at Windsor The focus of the day was of course on the couple; an unsurprisingly nervous groom, his hand shaking at times, his gaze twitching as he waited for his bride; a beaming princess, unable to control her joy. There was more; flawless organisation, hat dysfunction as the wind blew and blew, hatchets buried as the Duke of Edinburgh settled into a seat near Sarah, Duchess of York, with whom he has had a frosty - sometimes frozen -  relationship. But most noticeable at Windsor? The applause that followed the national anthem and the cheers for the Queen as she left the chapel. No one eclipses the Queen in the affections of the British public. Eugenie and drinks executive Mr Brooksbank, who met when skiing in Switzerland in 2010, left the castle in a silver DB10 Aston Martin, originally made for the James Bond movie Spectre. The couple were understood to be heading to the York family home, Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, for their evening reception. The families paid for the private aspects of the wedding. However, republican campaigners said taxpayers faced an estimated Â£2m security bill. The campaign group Republic argued that as Princess Eugenie, the ninth in line to the throne, did not carry out public duties, the families should foot the bill. Buckingham Palace said security was a matter for the police. Are you ready for another royal wedding? Eugenie wedding: What's the cost and who's paying?

"This video can not be played Philip Hammond says he believes a Brexit deal would lead to higher economic growth Britain could see an economic boost if it successfully negotiates a Brexit deal with the European Union, the chancellor has said. Philip Hammond told the BBC that there has been a ""measurable change of pace"" in talks, adding to the sense of optimism that a deal could be imminent. He said there were still hurdles, but the ""process"" was much more positive. If a deal is done, the UK could enjoy a ""deal dividend"" which would ""deliver us an upside"" for the economy, he said. Speaking at the International Monetary Fund annual meeting in Bali, Mr Hammond said that the UK's official economic watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, had forecast economic growth as slowing because of Brexit uncertainty and the risk of a no-deal outcome. If there is a deal, the OBR would be likely to upgrade that forecast. ""I believe there will be a dividend, a deal dividend for us,"" he told me. ""The OBR's forecast, which is the basis of our current projections for the economy and our fiscal position, is based on pretty much a mid-way point between no deal at all and an EEA [European Economic Area] solution. ""The deal that we're trying to negotiate with the EU now represents an improvement from the point of view of the British economy over that mid-point and therefore should deliver us an upside in the form of higher economic growth and better outcomes than were otherwise anticipated."" Ministers 'concerned' by Brexit compromises Brexit: All you need to know Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon Mr Hammond has also built up a ""fiscal buffer"" to his Budget projections in case there is a disorderly Brexit. Some of that Â£15.4bn could be released if a deal is signed, giving a ""double boost"" to the economy. ""I've always been optimistic that we would get to a deal in the end, because it's clearly in the interest of both sides to do so,"" Mr Hammond said. ""And what has happened over the last week, 10 days, is there's been a measurable change in pace. ""There's a real sense now of engagement from both sides of shared enterprise in trying to solve a problem rather than posturing towards each other - a really important step change. ""But that shouldn't conceal the fact that we've still got some big differences left to resolve. ""So the process is a lot more positive this week, but the substance still very challenging."" To be clear,  Philip Hammond is not saying there is a ""Brexit dividend"".I have made problems with that phrase clear. He is saying a deal dividend is possible - a boost to the economic growth forecasts that were substantially downgraded after the referendum. John McDonnell, Labour's shadow chancellor, said: ""This all smacks of good old fashioned spin. It looks like Mr Hammond is desperate to save his and the Prime Minister's skins by dressing up a classic ""put it off"" fudge as a deal, which will fail to provide the long term security and certainty investors and businesses need. ""It appears that Hammond is planning a few tax conjuring tricks in the budget to kid people that austerity is over when the reality is that the vast bulk of the cuts are still rolling out. We need a chancellor, not a conjurer."" Hammond expects boost from a Brexit deal.

Prince Philip ""took quite a big step"" towards reconciliation with the Duchess of York at today's wedding, according to a body language expert. Judi James said the Duke of Edinburgh was warm towards Sarah Ferguson and approached her with a smile, despite reported tensions between the pair after her divorce from Prince Andrew. ""You could tell the tension as soon as the duchess arrived in the church,"" she said. ""As soon as she walked in she pulled her arms into her side and put her head down."" But, she continued: ""She got quite the look from Philip, he smiled at her at least twice, almost as if he had planned to greet her warmly. ""That was quite a big step for the Duke of Edinburgh."" The duchess may not have been aware, however, as she was seated with her back to him. ""Unless she had eyes in the back of her head, she wouldn't have known,"" said Ms James.

Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's wedding was attended by the majority of the royal family. But there was one very conspicuous absentee, the Duchess of Cornwall. Prince Charles's wife was actually in Scotland to visit a village school. The Duchess of Rothesay, as she is known in Scotland, had a longstanding invitation to the school in Aberdeenshire.   Maeve Henry, from Amersham, brought her three-year-old
daughter Elise Bright to Windsor as the little girl is âobsessed with
princessesâ. Elise said of Princess Eugenie: âShe looked pretty.â Maeve added: âElise loved it. It was a very nice calm day
out. ""Harryâs was chaos but this was really nice: there wasnât much of a spark,
and I wouldnât say it was electric - they could have done with some music for
the crowds. But calm is the word I would use to describe it.â Here are some more views from the crowds at Windsor,
where itâs estimated about 3,000 gathered to cheer Princess Eugenie and her new
husband. Jackie Brown, from Ashford, Surrey, said: âIâm such a
royal fan. Iâve always followed them, since Charles and Anne were youngsters. âIâd have liked to see more than just the carriage, but
Iâm so glad we came. We had a great time and spoke to people from all over the
world.â Georgina Moroney, from Swindon, said: âIâm a royal geek.
Itâs just all part of our heritage. Theyâre fantastic - I love the romance of
it all. âShe looked so radiant.â Hereâs a picture taken by Amy Gardner who was watching
and said the couple looked straight at her. âShe looked so beautiful - it was lovely. Itâs definitely
worth the wait,"" she said. ""They looked right at the camera, which was great.â Among the crowds watching Eugenie and Jack leaving the
castle in their carriage was a group of friends whoâd gathered especially for
the occasion. Rachel Price-Greenow, from Hereford, admitting she had a
tear in her eye watching the couple go by. âI got emotional,â she said. âI was quite teary. Itâs
just lovely. I love all the pomp and sense of occasion.â Her friend Helen Freeman, from Swansea, was wearing a
home-made fascinator with the coupleâs initials embroidered on top. âItâs a royal event - and youâve got to wear a fascinator
to a wedding,â she said. âThey just seem like a normal couple, which is great.â Gemma Morgan, also from Hereford, said: âSomeone in a
shop here was telling us this wedding feels more like a community event - itâs really relaxed and friendly.â Alice Smart, from Manchester, said: âThey seem really
sweet and humble. And itâs great to be here to celebrate this, as thereâs so
much unhappiness in the world.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A passage from the book was read by Princess Beatrice during the ceremony. Turns out it's because the novel's famous character Jay Gatsby has a special place in Princess Eugenie's relationship with Jack Brooksbank. The Dean of Windsor said the princess had read the book not long after meeting her husband and it made her think of him. Addressing the congregation, the dean said: ""The words that particularly reminded her of Jack concern Gatsby's smile. ""As we heard from the reading 'It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it ... it concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour'. ""Well, a few years have passed and Eugenie and Jack come here today to smile on each other, and to offer each other something like 'eternal reassurance' and the promise of an 'irresistible prejudice' in each other's favour.""

"This video can not be played Kanye: MAGA hat ""made me feel like Superman"" Kanye West launched into an expletive-filled rant as he lavished praise on US President Donald Trump at an event in the Oval Office. Wearing a Make America Great Again hat ""made me feel like Superman"", he said. West had been invited to the White House for lunch to discuss prison reform and other issues. At the end of the 10-minute monologue, during which Mr Trump nodded in approval, the president said: ""That was quite something."" West replied: ""It was from the soul. I just channelled it."" ""I love this guy right here,"" West said, walking behind the desk to hug the seated president, who said: ""That's really nice."" Allow Twitter content?

During his monologue that ranged from prison reform to manufacturing, politics and the universe, West said: ""They tried to scare me, my friends to not wear this hat, but this hat, it gives me power in a way. ""You know, my dad and my mum separated, so I didn't have a lot of male energy in my home."" He continued: ""I love Hillary, I love everyone, right. ""But the campaign, I'm With Her, just didn't make me feel as a guy that didn't get to see my dad all the time, like a guy that could play catch with his son."" Addressing Mr Trump, he added: ""There was something about when I put this hat on it made me feel like Superman. ""You made a Superman - that's my favourite superhero - you made a Superman cape for me."" West denied that all black Americans were Democrats. ""People expect that if you're black, you have to be Democrat,"" he said. ""If he [President Trump] don't look good, we don't look good,"" he said at one point, attacking the ""liberals"" on the Saturday Night Live show who have criticised his support for Mr Trump. Mr Trump won 8% of the African-American vote in 2016. Mr Trump was asked by a journalist if West could be a future presidential candidate, and the president replied: ""Could very well be."" West told reporters: ""Let's stop worrying about the future, all we have is today. ""Trump is on his hero's journey right now."" He added: ""You might not have expected a crazy [expletive] like Kanye running up to support."" West told the assembled group an earlier diagnosis of bipolar disorder was incorrect, according to a neuro-psychologist he saw. ""He said that I actually wasn't bipolar, I had sleep deprivation, which could cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now where I wouldn't even remember my son's name,"" he said. West has previously revealed he received treatment for bipolar disorder, and has made reference to it in his music. ""Sometimes people say, 'This kid has ADD [Attention Deficit Disorder], this kid has ADD.'"" ""You don't have ADD, school is boring. It is boring, it's not as exciting as this,"" he said gesturing towards his mobile phone. At one point he typed in his mobile phone password, in full view of the assembled news cameras - a fact which did not go unnoticed by the world. Allow Twitter content?

West was ostensibly at the lunch in part to discuss crime in Chicago, his hometown. He asked Mr Trump to pardon the leader of a notorious Chicago street gang, and called on the president to build ""Trump factories"" in Chicago. At one point he did disagree with Mr Trump, saying that he considers police ""stop-and-frisk"" to be unhelpful. Mr Trump has called upon Chicago police to institute the practice, which allows random searches. ""I didn't mean to put you on blast like that, bro,"" West told Mr Trump. ""I like the North Korea,"" West said. ""You stopped the war,"" he told Mr Trump. ""Day One, solved one of his biggest problems. We solved one of the biggest problems."" West visited Mr Trump at his eponymous Manhattan skyscraper in 2016, a month after he won the election, but this was the rapper's first trip to the White House. West's wife, reality TV star Kim Kardashian, has made two visits to the White House. Kim Kardashian meets inmate she helped free During her first trip there,she successfully argued to have a grandmother's prison sentence commutedby Mr Trump. However, did she get a lunch like this?

"High Court judges could receive an additional Â£60,000-a-year Senior judges in England and Wales could be set for pay rises of up to 32% if recommendations made by the Senior Salaries Review Body are accepted. The move aims to address low morale among judges and to compensate them for changes to their pension scheme. The recommendations would see a High Court judge receive an additional Â£60,000 a year. Crown Court judges would receive a 22% rise - taking them to Â£165,000 - and district judges would get an 8% rise. The government says it values the work of what it calls the UK's world-renowned judiciary, and is considering the recommendations. Pay rises announced for a million public sector workers Bill for public sector wage rises Â£820m, estimates IFS Teachers' pay rise 'a con-trick' High Court judges currently earn Â£181,566 - around Â£30,000 more than the prime minister's salary - but that has not stopped a recruitment crisis from developing. The number of high calibre, high earning lawyers applying to the judiciary has halved in the last 10 years. A report last year linked low morale in the judiciary - where one in three judges were considering resigning - to pay, pension changes, and increased workloads. If accepted, the pay rises would be considerably greater than those offered to other public sector workers. Police and prison officers, for example, have been restricted to pay rises of less than 3%. During the summer,the government announceda 2.9% rise for armed forces personnel, a 3.5% rise for teachers and a 2% rise for doctors and dentists.

"This video can not be played Garry Pettigrew told the BBC that his company had been ""vilified for providing an excellent service"" The boss of the firm at the centre of the NHS clinical waste scandal has hit back against claims of mismanagement. Garry Pettigrew, managing director of Healthcare Environmental Services, told the BBC his company had been ""vilified for providing an excellent service"". The firm has been stripped of NHS contracts after hundreds of tonnes of clinical waste piled up at its sites. But Mr Pettigrew said the problems were caused by a shortage of incinerators rather than the company's actions. The Environment Agency has taken enforcement action against North Lanarkshire-based HES and has launched a criminal investigation. NHS waste scandal firm loses contracts Criminal probe over medical waste Reality Check: How do you dispose of medical waste? On Tuesday, Health Minister Stephen Barclay told Parliament that NHS Improvement had concluded that HES ""failed to demonstrate that they were operating within their contractual limits"". As a result, 15 NHS Trusts in England had served notices to terminate their contracts with the firm, he said. The contracts it has with more than 30 other trusts in England are still ongoing. The Environment Agency previously said HES was in breach of its environmental permits at four of its six sites which deal with clinical waste - by having more waste on site than their permit allows and storing waste inappropriately. HES is to retain its NHS contracts in Scotland. In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Mr Pettigrew denied suggestions that his company had mismanaged services, instead blaming the problems on a ""major drop"" in incineration capacity since 2015. On Tuesday, Mr Barclay insisted there was ""significant"" additional incineration capacity. ""We have basically got to the point of where we are today where the lack of incineration capacity was just getting worse,"" Mr Pettigrew said. ""At every part of this we have been talking to the Environment Agency. We thought they would be able to help."" An Environment Agency spokesman told the BBC: ""There is industry-wide agreement that there is enough capacity to deal with clinical waste and our site inspections show the rest of the sector is performing well. ""However, Healthcare Environmental Services has significantly and repeatedly breached its environmental permits by storing excess waste at a number of its sites. ""We have taken a range of action with the company but they have continued to operate unlawfully. As a result, in addition to our enforcement activity to clear the sites, we have launched a criminal investigation."" HES is based in Shotts, North Lanarkshire But Mr Pettigrew said he felt his company had been treated unfairly. ""We have been a success story up until last week, and all of a sudden now everyone sees this as being a horror story,"" he said. ""We feel it's a horror story, but purely because in reality we've told the truth and at the moment, we don't feel the news is getting out there in the way we would like it to."" Mr Pettigrew also denied allegations that the waste that built up on sites included human body parts, such as amputated limbs. He said: ""None of that is true. ""Every single part that people are referring to there is dealt with securely, professionally, and any anatomical waste would be stored in fridges and at the same time prioritised for outward bound."" It was put to Mr Pettigrew that former staff at HES had contacted the BBC to allege there had been a range of unsafe and unhygienic practices. ""The reality is, our sites work within permit, we've worked within compliance."" Mr Pettigrew also rejected suggestions that the firm had not been equipped to properly run the services. ""I'd refute all of that. ""We've had this contract since 2010. If you go back to the articles in 2010, this was the jewel in the crown of NHS England, that we had saved them Â£30m by awarding this contract to us. ""For the last eight years we have done this contract and never seen the situation we are in now."" Mr Pettigrew also claimed that he knew of medical waste being stored in shipping containers at hospitals as a result of HES being stripped of some of its contracts. ""The contractors and the site this waste will now be going to will not be meeting the high standards our facilities met,"" he said. ""I know just now that waste is being stored in hospitals in shipping containers, and shipping containers are being lined with black liners to stop liquids, whatever else, coming out of this. It's been put into skips. ""We operate obviously UN-approved containers and specialist vehicles with specialist drivers. Not one of the companies who are dealing with this just now can cope with this. And at the same time as well, they don't have this specialist equipment because this is a very unique industry."" A government spokesman said: ""Strong governance arrangements are in place to ensure the new contract continues to dispose of waste in a safe and timely fashion.

"Billy McFarland acknowledged he had betrayed people's trust in him The founder of the ill-fated Fyre Festival - called a ""complete disaster"" by fans - has been jailed for six years by a US judge. Billy McFarland, 26, pleaded guilty to fraud earlier this year. A judge on Thursday described him as ""a serial fraudster"" who had been dishonest for ""most of his life"". Partygoers were promised a luxury event in the Bahamas but instead were stranded on an island without enough food, water or accommodation. The event in April 2017 was eventually cancelled and hundreds of people evacuated. Tickets had cost between $1,200 and $100,000 (Â£900 and Â£75,000). ""Today, McFarland found out the hard way that empty promises don't lead to jet-setting, champagne and extravagant parties - they lead to federal prison,"" said US Attorney for Manhattan, Geoffrey Berman. Addressing the court on Thursday, McFarland said he knew he had ""betrayed the trust of my investors, my customers, my family"". Fyre Festival cancelled after 'chaos' He said the sentencing was an ""extremely bitter reality"". McFarland pleaded guilty in March to two counts of wire fraud related to the festival, but then in July admitted two more counts of fraud relating to another ticket-selling scam that he had set up while on bail. In October, prosecutors requested that McFarland serve between 11 and 14 years in prison, describing him as ""the consummate con artist"". Sentencing on Thursday, Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald said McFarland was ""unique in this court's memory"". ""The defendant is a serial fraudster and to date his fraud, like a circle, has no end,"" she told the court in Manhattan. ""Mr McFarland has been dishonest most of his life."" Fyre Festival was billed as a ""cultural moment created from a blend of music, art and food"" in the Bahamas. Tickets included a flight from Miami; a stay in a ""geodesic dome"" and activities including yoga and kayaking. It had initially been advertised with an Instagram video featuring famous models sailing on a luxury yacht and top music acts such as Blink-182 were on the bill. But festival-goers posted videos and photos online of the ""mass chaos"" and ""a compete disaster"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"High Court judges could receive an additional Â£60,000-a-year Senior judges in England and Wales could be set for pay rises of up to 32% if recommendations made by the Senior Salaries Review Body are accepted. The move aims to address low morale among judges and to compensate them for changes to their pension scheme. The recommendations would see a High Court judge receive an additional Â£60,000 a year. Crown Court judges would receive a 22% rise - taking them to Â£165,000 - and district judges would get an 8% rise. The government says it values the work of what it calls the UK's world-renowned judiciary, and is considering the recommendations. Pay rises announced for a million public sector workers Bill for public sector wage rises Â£820m, estimates IFS Teachers' pay rise 'a con-trick' High Court judges currently earn Â£181,566 - around Â£30,000 more than the prime minister's salary - but that has not stopped a recruitment crisis from developing. The number of high calibre, high earning lawyers applying to the judiciary has halved in the last 10 years. A report last year linked low morale in the judiciary - where one in three judges were considering resigning - to pay, pension changes, and increased workloads. If accepted, the pay rises would be considerably greater than those offered to other public sector workers. Police and prison officers, for example, have been restricted to pay rises of less than 3%. During the summer,the government announceda 2.9% rise for armed forces personnel, a 3.5% rise for teachers and a 2% rise for doctors and dentists.

"This video can not be played Ambassador to the UK Prince Mohammed bin Nawaf al Saud says he is ""concerned about Jamal"" Saudi Arabia's UK ambassador has told the BBC he is ""concerned"" about missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But Prince Mohammed bin Nawaf al Saud added it would be ""premature"" to comment on the issue at present. Mr Khashoggi, a well-known critic of the Saudi government, has not been seen since visiting the country's consulate in Istanbul last week. Meanwhile, Sir Richard Branson has said he has halted investing in Saudi Arabia over Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. Mr Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e fears he has been kidnapped or killed while Turkish authorities in Istanbul believe he was murdered by Saudi agents. Saudi Arabia denies killing Mr Khashoggi and insists that he left the consulate shortly after he arrived. What we know about Jamal Khashoggi's disappearance Who is Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi? ""There is an ongoing investigation and it would be premature of me to comment until we see the final results,"" Prince Mohammed said. He added that Saudi Arabia ""would like to know what happened"" to Mr Khashoggi, and hoped the investigation would provide answers ""soon"". Jamal Khashoggi has not been seen since entering the consulate in Istanbul Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and US President Donald Trump are among the political figures to have demanded answers from Saudi Arabia over the case, while Virgin boss Sir Richard has also added pressure on the Gulf kingdom. The entrepreneur said he would be suspending his directorship of two tourism projects in the country, while Virgin would halt discussions with the Saudis over investment in its space projects. Sir Richard said he ""had high hopes for the current government"" in Saudi Arabia - but was concerned by reports of state involvement in the disappearance of one of its own citizens. ""What has reportedly happened in Turkey around the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, if proved true, would clearly change the ability of any of us in the West to do business with the Saudi government,"" he said. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing journalist Mr Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. A critic of the kingdom's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Mr Khashoggi was living in self-imposed exile in the US and writing opinion pieces for the Washington Post before he vanished. He visited the consulate in Istanbul last Tuesday to obtain a document confirming he had divorced his ex-wife, in order to allow him to remarry.

"Seann and Katya are dancing The Charleston on Saturday night Strictly judge Craig Revel Horwood says contestant Seann Walsh and his professional partner Katya Jones should do ""the dance of shame"" on Saturday. The couple apologisedafter they were caught kissing in public - Walsh had a long-term girlfriend and Jones is married to another dancer on the show. ""My take was keep them in the show, make them do the 'dance of shame,'"" Craig toldITV's Jonathan Ross show,external. ""Get on with the job and show people what you're made of,"" he added. ""It's really important that if this does happen to you, you face up to it and you... as they've done, apologise... and show people, 'Ok, this is what I did, I've been employed to do this job, I'm going to... get on with it and do it well and do it professionally.'"" The rumba is one of Craig's favourite dances Asked aboutthe so-called 'Strictly curse', which claims the BBC One show has caused several relationship break-ups, Craig said ""there has to be something wrong in your relationship"" in the first place for it to go off the rails while on Strictly. Fellow judge Darcey Bussell concurred: ""I danced for over 20 years in the Royal Ballet and I'm still happily married."" Craig said he had wanted to see Seann and Katya do the rumba, which is thought to have been their original dance for this Saturday. ""I wanted to see the rumba, the dance of love, I'm sure everyone wants to see that. That's one of my favourite dances, as well."" Shirley Ballas joined the Strictly panel last year Asked whether they could see any chemistry with Seann and Katya in particular, Craig said: ""There was a mild improvement [in their dance last weekend] from the week before but I would not put that down to a snog at the back of a pub, if that's what you're asking. I would put it down to hard work and having to act through the dance and tell that story."" The judges were askedwhether they felt the public might vote Seann and Katya off the showfollowing the controversy.

"Washington state has banned the death penalty Washington has become the 20th US state to ban the death penalty, after its Supreme Court ruled the punishment was applied in an ""arbitrary and racially biased manner"". The eight people currently on death row in the north-western state immediately had their sentences commuted to life. The news was welcomed by campaigners. A total of 23 people were executed in the US last year, but Washington has not carried out the death penalty since 2010. Why would you write to a death row inmate? The woman who watched 300 executions How US death penalty capital changed its mind Judges sitting on the Washington state Supreme Court unanimously backed Thursday's decision, made during an appeal by death row inmate Allen Eugene Gregory, who raped and murdered a woman in 1996. The appeal had included a study which showed black convicts were 4.5 times more likely to be sentenced to death in Washington state than white inmates. The ruling said the death penalty ""fails to serve any legitimate penological goal"" in Washington. Furthermore, it is ""invalid because it is imposed in an arbitrary and racially biased manner"". Following the decision, Governor Jay Inslee tweeted he had ""long been convinced that the death penalty in the state of Washington does not pass"" the test of equal justice. ""We know that zip code and race are likely determinants of whether an accused criminal is sentenced to death,"" he added. ""There has been nothing equal, or fair, or just, about that.""

""Now that Washington has become the 20th state to end the ultimate cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment, other states should follow suit,"" she added. ""The court ruled that the death penalty is imposed in an arbitrary and racially biased manner and is invalid.

"Andrew Brunson (raising his hand) was first arrested in October 2016 Hopes are rising that American pastor Andrew Brunson may be freed, more than two years after he was first detained in Turkey. Mr Brunson returned to court on Friday, with US media outlets reporting a deal had been struck for the North Carolina evangelical's release. However, US Vice-President Mike Pence would only say ""we remain hopeful"". Mr Brunson was arrested over alleged links to political groups following the failed 2016 coup attempt in Turkey. The latest hearing of his case is now under way in a court in the western province of Izmir. The court has heard witnesses for both the prosecution and defence and Turkish media are reporting that some of the witnesses have withdrawn their earlier statements. The pastor, who has been under house arrest since being released from prison in July, denies charges of espionage. If found guilty, he faces up to 35 years behind bars. His detention has damaged relations between Washington and Ankara, with both sides imposing sanctions on the other - resulting in the Turkish lira plummeting. Pastor a 'pawn in personal feud' Who are the Gulenists? Turkey and US lock horns as relations sour On Thursday both The Washington Post and NBC News reported a deal had been reached between the US and Turkey for Mr Brunson's release, citing unnamed sources. However, Mr Pence would not confirm such a deal existed. ""We remain hopeful that with the court proceeding tomorrow that Turkey will see its way clear and free this good man who is guilty of nothing and who has been incarcerated for several years in Turkey unjustly,"" the vice-president told reporters at a briefing. He added that the Trump administration had ""made it clear that we will continue to stand strong until Pastor Brunson is free"". Mr Brunson is a long-term resident in Turkey. He lived with his wife and three children while working as the pastor of the small Izmir Resurrection Church, which had a congregation of about two dozen. The authorities accuse him of having links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Gulenist movement, which Turkey blames for a 2016 failed coup. Turkey has urged the US to extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen Mr Brunson was moved into house arrest in July for health reasons, but US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this was not enough. ""We have seen no credible evidence against Mr Brunson,"" Mr Pompeo tweeted at the time. Turkey's foreign ministry said it had shared ""necessary information"" with the US, but insisted the case should be left with its judiciary. Mr Brunson is one of 20 Americans who were charged after the coup attempt two years ago, according to the New York Times. More than 50,000 people were arrested in Turkey in President Erdogan's huge post-coup crackdown. He blames Pennsylvania-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen for the attempt, but Mr Gulen denies any involvement. Erdogan's Turkey in depth Turkey wants the US to agree to his extradition. Mr Erdogan has indicated he would swap the pastor for ""the priest"" (Mr Gulen). US support for Kurdish forces fighting the Syrian civil war has also angered Mr Erdogan, who views them as an extension of the PKK. The PKK - a Turkish-Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy since the 1980s - is considered a terrorist group by Turkey and the US.

By Jonny Dymond, BBC royal correspondent, at Windsor The focus of the day was of course on the couple; an unsurprisingly nervous groom, his hand shaking at times, his gaze twitching as he waited for his bride; a beaming princess, unable to control her joy. There was more; flawless organisation, hat dysfunction as the wind blew and blew, hatchets buried as the Duke of Edinburgh settled into a seat near Sarah, Duchess of York, with whom he has had a frosty - sometimes frozen -  relationship. But most noticeable at Windsor? The applause that followed the national anthem and the cheers for the Queen as she left the chapel. No one eclipses the Queen in the affections of the British public. Eugenie and drinks executive Mr Brooksbank, who met when skiing in Switzerland in 2010, left the castle in a silver DB10 Aston Martin, originally made for the James Bond movie Spectre. The couple were understood to be heading to the York family home, Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, for their evening reception. The families paid for the private aspects of the wedding. However, republican campaigners said taxpayers faced an estimated Â£2m security bill. The campaign group Republic argued that as Princess Eugenie, the ninth in line to the throne, did not carry out public duties, the families should foot the bill.

"Motoring groups have condemned the government's decision to cut subsidies for buying greener cars. From 9 November, grants for new plug-in hybrids will be scrapped, while discounts on all-electric cars will be cut from Â£4,500 to Â£3,500. Cash incentives have been offered since 2011 to help promote cleaner cars and meet emissions targets. The RAC and AA motoring groups said the change was a backward step, and the SMMT trade body called it ""astounding"". The Department for Transport (DfT) said,externalthat the Plug-in Car Grant was introduced seven years ago to help the market become established. It was now time to focus support on zero-emission models such as pure electric and hydrogen fuel cell cars, the DfT added. The change comes three months after the government published its Road to Zero strategy, with a proposal to remove cars powered by petrol and diesel cars from UK roads by 2050. Ultra-low emission vehicles currently available for discounts are placed into three categories: Category 1: COâ emissions of less than 50g/km and a zero emission range of at least 70 miles Category 2: COâ emissions of less than 50g/km and a zero emission range between 10 and 69 miles Category 3: COâ emissions of 50 to 75g/km and a zero emission range of at least 20 miles. The government said the cut in the support for Category 1 cars to Â£3,500 reflected recent reductions in the price of electric vehicles. May's Â£106m drive to push green vehicles Electric vehicle sales surge in UK How electric vehicles are moving into the fast lane But motoring groups denounced the changes, saying it would leave the government struggling to meet its emissions reduction targets. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT motor manufacturers body, said removing the grant for plug-in hybrids was ""totally at odds"" with ambitions to cut CO2 and ""sends yet more confusing signals to car buyers"". Manufacturers, which are having to adjust to tumbling sales of diesel cars, have invested heavily in electric technologies, he said. ""Prematurely removing up-front purchase grants can have a devastating impact on demand - without world-class incentives, government's world-class ambitions will not be delivered,"" Mr Hawes said. The RAC's head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said the move was ""a major blow to anyone hoping to go green with their next vehicle choice"". ""With up-front costs still a huge barrier for those hoping to switch to an electric vehicle, this move from the government is a big step backwards and is in stark contrast to countries like Norway where generous tax incentives have meant that it has one of the highest ownership levels of ultra-low emission vehicles of anywhere in the world."" And Jack Cousens, head of roads policy for the AA, said: ""The government wants to end the sale of petrol and diesel cars, but scrapping grants for low emission cars may well stall their progress. ""This announcement will simply put more drivers off from buying greener cars.""

"Keira Knightley has called for funding for mental health services to be ring-fenced, with more help provided for children and young mothers. The actressrevealed last week she had a mental breakdownat 22 and suffered post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as she struggled with her rise to fame. Asked about her comments, Knightly told the BBC: ""People need to know they are not aloneâ¦ everybody breaks down."" Speaking at the London Film Festival, she said it was important to seek help. Knightley was still a teenager in 2002 when she starred in her breakthrough film Bend it Like Beckham, and a year later she was cast in blockbuster Pirates of the Caribbean. Despite her success, criticism bit hard. This video can not be played Keira Knightley on how she has coped with the ""difficulties"" of being a working mother Arriving at the premiere of her new film, Colette, on Thursday evening, Knightley said: ""Everybody, no matter who you are, has a tricky time in your life."" ""There should be help for children with mental health issues, there should be help for young mothers with mental health issues,"" Knightley told Natalie Jamieson, for BBC Radio 5 Live. ""It's something as a society that we really need to look at,"" she said, adding that funding should be ringfenced. Research suggeststhree-quarters of mental health problems are establishedby the age of 24. And analysis last year by the King's Fund health think tank found 40% of mental health trusts in England had seen their budgets cut in 2015-16. The government has announced increases to mental health funding, while bodies dealing with hospital and community health are being required to increase the 13.7% of their budgets currently spent in that area. Knightley spoke about highlighting inspirational women, as in her latest role as French author Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette whose husband Willy took credit for her first four novels. She also said more needed to be done for working mothers, pointing out she was lucky to be able to have her daughter on set. ""I'm in a very lucky place... where I can demand certain things. That is not the case for every single woman,"" she added. Reality Check: What are the targets for mental health?

"This video can not be played ""Something like this that is going to disrupt operations so massively, we need advance notice of this"" says FTA's spokesperson The M26 in Kent is being shut overnight while work is done to see if it can be used as a ""parking lot"" for lorries, in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It will be closed from 2200 BST until 0530 BST until 15 October and again between 19 November and 21 December. Local Tory MP Tom Tugendhat questioned why work began with ""no consultation"" - despite assurances none was planned. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said was part of ""no-deal"" contingency plans but he thought it would not be needed. The M26 is a 10-mile stretch of road connecting the M25 at Sevenoaks and the M20 near West Malling. Sections of the M20 in Kent can be closed under Operation Stack, when lorries are forced to queue because of disruption to rail or ferry journeys. And there have been concerns that a no-deal Brexit could mean lorries getting stuck at the nearby port of Dover because of customs delays. What do Brexit 'no-deal' papers reveal? Brexit: What happens next? Mr Tugendhat, MP for Tonbridge and Malling, which covers the eastern half of the M26, told the Commons he had been assured that works were not planned as recently as last week - only to find out on Wednesday night that they were going ahead. He told MPs: ""It's come to a pretty pass when a member finds out that works have begun on a motorway to turn that motorway into a parking lot without consultation either with the local community or with surrounding members. ""The M26 works started last night. I wrote (to Mr Grayling) in April, asking whether or not this would happen. ""I was assured the works were not planned and only yesterday (Wednesday) was it confirmed to me that Highways England had said that is exactly what was planned, despite having told me the reverse a week earlier."" Mr Grayling replied that he would be happy to meet the MP to discuss the issue, but added: ""I do not expect any of the contingencies that we have in place for a no-deal Brexit to be needed because I'm confident we will reach a sensible agreement."" Operation Stack is currently used on closed sections of the M20 in Kent, where lorries park while waiting to cross the English Channel when traffic is disrupted. A new strategy, Operation Brock, due to start in early 2019, plans to use a contraflow to keep the roads open when problems arise. Paul Carter, the Conservative leader of Kent County Council, said turning sections of the M26 into a lorry park would be complex and cause ""significant problems"". ""It is possible to close part of the M26 but my mantra is that we must keep our roads open to the public no matter what is thrown at us,"" he told Kent Online. Highways England said traffic was relatively light on the M26 overnight and drivers were being informed of alternative routes during the closure period. ""As part of wider resilience planning, Highways England has been asked by the Department for Transport to develop plans to utilise the M26 to hold heavy goods vehicles, should further capacity be required in the future,"" a spokesman added. ""We will be undertaking site surveys on the M26 during October leading to the installation of two gates in the central reservation to support the safe management of freight in the future, if needed.""
