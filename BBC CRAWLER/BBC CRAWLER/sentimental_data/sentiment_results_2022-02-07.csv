"The assembly is still in place despite the collapse of the executive The ex-Northern Ireland secretary who helped restore power-sharing at Stormont in 2020 has described the fresh crisis as ""deeply depressing"". Julian Smith was speaking as MPs approved legislation based on proposals he helped draft two years ago. The bill helps protect the assembly from future collapse. It removes the duty on the government to set a date for an election if the roles of first and deputy first minister are not replaced this week. The bill also allows the assembly to continue without an executive for at least six months. Paul Givan resigned as first minister on Thursdayin protest at the Northern Ireland Protocol. It triggered the collapse of the executive, but the legislation which passed its final hurdle in the House of Commons on Monday allows the assembly to remain in place. TheNI Ministers, Elections and Petitions of Concern Billcould also come into play after the assembly election in Mayif the parties fail to fill the posts of first and deputy first ministers. MPs approved a House of Lords amendment to the bill which allows it to be applied retrospectively, to cover the resignation of Mr Givan. It will now need to receive royal assent by Thursday. Julian Smith was involved in restoring devolution in 2020 Julian Smith was secretary of state for Northern Ireland when thethe New Decade New Approach dealwas signed. It paved the way for the legislation which is now going through parliament to stave off future immediate collapses. He told the Commons: ""The lack of a first minister and deputy first minister and the fall of the executive is really bad news for the majority of men and women who want good governance. ""The majority who want to get on with day-to-day life are held hostage by parallel universe of elements of the Northern Ireland political world."" Mr Smith also questioned whether it was ""just coincidence"" that the retrospective power had been recently added to the bill by peers and said many people may have questions about the level of knowledge the government could have had ahead of the crisis unfolding. But Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson insisted there was ""no question of collusion"" with the government over when it had taken its decision to withdraw from the first minister role. He maintained that unless the government makes changes to the protocol, his party cannot continue to operate within the current structures. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood hit out at the prime minister for being ""nowhere to be seen"" since the crisis had begun. ""If I was a unionist, I would be looking very closely at what this government is doing and how it treats them,"" he added. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the DUP could not stay in government without changes to the NI Protocol Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said parties who walked away from power-sharing did so ""at their peril"", as ultimately there remained no alternative to the Stormont institutions. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis was not present during the debate but his colleague, Northern Ireland minister Conor Burns, responded for the government. He said the ""clear message"" to the DUP was that it should return to government immediately in the interests of stability, and that negotiations with the EU over the protocol would continue until a resolution is found. Mr Burns also said he had spent five nights in Northern Ireland last week speaking to a range of communities and that the government would continue to work for everyone. Earlier on Monday, Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill, who lost her role as deputy first minister when Mr Givan stood down, urged assembly members (MLAs) at Stormont to salvage what they could from the ""chaos"" of Mr Givan's resignation. Highlighting the public apology for victims of institutional abuse which wasto have been made by the first and deputy first ministers in March, Ms O'Neill added the DUP had caused ""real hurt and trauma"". Michelle O'Neill lost her post of deputy first minister after Paul Givan's resignation Afterwards, she told the media she wanted to ""fast-track"" some pieces of legislation, however, there cannot be an agreement now on a draft budget. SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon said her party would ""not be falling into the DUP's trap"" and accused them of a instigating a ""manufactured self-serving political crisis"". The Alliance Party's Andrew Muir said MLAs should not ""knock-off early"" and must work to the end of the mandate. Givan resignation triggers fresh political crisis NI First Minister Paul Givan announces resignation Commons passes Bill to prevent Stormont collapse Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said parties should come together to write to the EU about their concerns over the protocol, adding: ""if the aim is to stand here and just poke each other in the eye for the sake of poking each other in the eye then we will not make this place better for the people here."" Defending his party's action, the former DUP leader Edwin Poots told the assembly he was ""surprised that people couldn't see it coming"", and that there would not be an executive ""to come back to"" while checks exist under the Northern Ireland Protocol. Earlier, Speaker Alex Maskey met party whips to discuss how to progress legislation which is still outstanding. At the start of business on Monday, he said it was his intention the assembly passes ""as much legislation as possible"" in the weeks ahead. He also said he had no contact with the Northern Ireland Office about ending the assembly's mandate at an ""early stage"". On Monday, MLAs passed the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill, which gives parents the right to two weeks' paid statutory leave if they have suffered the loss of a child, including through miscarriage. The bill had initially brought Northern Ireland into line with employment laws in Great Britain, however following an amendment, NI will now be the first jurisdiction in Europe to legislate for miscarriage employment rights, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons said. ""Following a full public consultation, my department will draw up detailed miscarriage leave and pay regulations, with an introduction date following shortly after,"" the minister added. Paul Givan resigned as first minister as part of the DUP's protest against the NI Protocol The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) pulled Mr Givan out of Stormontin protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has saidit will be ""difficult"" for his party to form a government after the upcoming election,if issues around the post-Brexit trading mechanism are not addressed. This has prompted Sinn FÃ©in to call for an early election, after Ms O'Neill was removed as deputy first minister. The roles are joint and one cannot continue without the other. Without the two top positions being filled, the executive - Northern Ireland's government - can no longer meet. Under previous rules, the resignation of the first or deputy first minister would have set in motion a seven-day countdown to re-nominate the roles. If candidates were not successfully re-nominated the Northern Ireland secretary would then be required to set a date for a fresh assembly election and the institutions would immediately collapse. However, when power-sharing was restored at Stormont in January 2020,after three years of deadlock,it was agreed Westminster would change the rules to avoid this.

"New ""tough targets"" will be set to tackle record NHS waiting lists in England, Boris Johnson has said. The PM promised action after plans to tackle the backlog of people waiting for treatment were delayed. It had been expected to be published on Monday but Mr Johnson said more details would be set out later this week. Earlier,Health Secretary Sajid Javid denied reports the Treasury had blocked the announcement, blaming the Omicron wave for the delay. He told BBC Breakfast the plans were due to be released in early December but the emergence of the more transmissible coronavirus variant meant the focus shifted to the booster programme. 'I went to Sri Lanka for my operation' 'I had to give up work over operation wait' Is this NHS crisis really worse than ones before? Birmingham hospital office space turned into wards During a visit to a hospital in Kent, Mr Johnson said: ""We're now working with the NHS to set some tough targets so that we are able to deliver for patients and also for the taxpayer."" He pointed out more money is being invested and extra staff recruited. The prime minister denied the Treasury had been concerned the targets were not tough enough, saying the department was ""working together in harmony"" with Downing Street. Pressed on whether he had doubts about the chancellor's loyalty to his leadership, Mr Johnson said: ""Absolutely not."" Louise McAllan, from Essex, has stage four lung and bone cancer and had an operation and chemotherapy cancelled because of the pandemic. She was diagnosed in February 2020 but said she did not receive any treatment for eight months. ""It was so devastating I was literally lost for words,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""It was just so unbelievable that they were allowing me to die because of Covid."" Louise was previously diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013 and said her treatment then was much quicker, with tests taking place within two weeks and chemotherapy starting shortly after. ""It does make me angryâ¦ they've put people's lives in jeopardy,"" she said. ""I'm not saying Covid isn't serious because it is. But cancer, heart disease, they don't go away - they get worse."" The waiting list for hospital treatment in England hit a record six million in November- a rise of nearly 50% since the pandemic started. More than 300,000 patients have been waiting more than a year for treatment after the suspension of routine surgery during certain parts of the pandemic, adding to pressures which were already clear before it began. Mr Johnson warned that waiting lists would increase before they started to fall. Ministers are encouraging those who stayed away from the NHS during the pandemic to come forward for treatment.

That target was originally due to have come in last year, but had been delayed because of the pandemic. He also said that by March next year, no-one would wait longer than two months to find out if they have cancer. But that target already exists - and is not for diagnosis, but for treatment within two months. It is understood the commitment was for the NHS to return to pre-pandemic performance by March next year. With Covid in retreat - at least in terms of serious illness and pressure on the NHS - the challenge facing the government is how to get the core services back on track. Whether it is cancer or hospital treatments, the pandemic has had a huge impact. Waiting times have got worse across the board. For hospital treatments ministers need to find a way to increase capacity - the NHS is still doing fewer treatments than it was before the pandemic began. Tough new targets on their own will not be enough without the staff needed to see patients. Much the same is true for cancer - but it is further complicated by the missing cases. The number of diagnoses are down by 34,000 since the pandemic started. Getting those people to come forward for checks and ensuring they get them quickly when they do is essential. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Downing Street was ""embroiled"" in allegations about lockdown parties and ""the price is the government not getting on with the job"". ""When we need a plan we haven't got one from the government and many people on waiting lists will be really dismayed,"" he said. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents the healthcare system, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the delay was ""frustrating"" as the plan had already been agreed with NHS leaders who ""want to get on with the work"". However, with an unknown number of people not included in waiting list figures because they did not come forward for treatment during the pandemic, he warned that ""unrealistic"" targets could end up ""skewing clinical priorities"". Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health trusts, said the parts of the plan being held up included measures to free up clinician time, support for trusts working together, use of the independent sector and how funding would be allocated. Earlier, the government announced a new online platform called My Planned Care, which will allow people needing non-urgent surgery to get information about waiting times. The platform, which will be launched later this month, will also offer advice on prevention services, such as how to stop smoking and exercise plans, to make sure people are fit for surgery.

"Asda has promised to stock its budget ranges in all 581 supermarkets and online after complaints from anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe. The retailer said it had ""taken on board"" her comments about availability of cheaper food for households struggling to make ends meet. She had highlighted Asda in tweets critical about value ranges removed from shelves or going up in price. In response to Asda's move, Ms Monroetweeted,external: ""Well, that went rather well."" Asda currently stocks 150 Smart Price and Farm Stores products in 300 stores. All 200 products in these value ranges will now be available in all Asda stores by 1 March, said Meg Farren, Asda's chief customer officer. ""We want to help our customers' budgets stretch further and have taken on board the comments about the availability of our Smart Price range made by Jack Monroe. Jack Monroe has said value products have to be universally available ""We are taking steps to put our full Smart Price and Farm Stores ranges in store and online to make these products as accessible as possible,"" Ms Farren said. Rising inflation and the cost of living crisis is hitting low-income households particularly hard. Ms Monroe, an activist and blogger on how to eat on a budget, says the cost of food staples such as cheap pasta and rice are going up in price faster than other products. She criticised Asda for discontinuing some budget products, such as a bag of rice sold online for 45p and replaced with rice costing a minimum of Â£1.20. Her Twitter thread details many other Asda products no longer available in her local store, where she is a regular shopper. In one tweet she said supermarket value products had to be ""universally available, or it's as good as useless"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Sunday, the chairman of Tesco,John Allan, told the BBC that the worst of food price inflation is to come, with prices likely to rise by 5% by April. But he said food costs make up a bigger proportion of spending for households on low-incomes, so it will hit the ""hardest up harder"". Ms Monroe has been critical of the way the official UK inflation rate - currently at a 30-year high of 5.4% - is calculated, saying it does not reflect the higher cost of food staples bought by poorer people. Earlier this month, the Office for National Statistics, which publishes the monthly inflation figure, said it would alsopublish a wider variety of ""cost of living metrics""to better reflect the impact of price rises on households.

"Primark has been accused of selling kids clothing with ""hugely sexist messaging"" by a best-selling author. Novelist Kate Long shared images on social media of tops in a Chester store on Sunday which urged girls to ""be kind"", ""keep on smiling"" and to be ""always perfect"". In contrast, items in the boys' range told them ""you are limitless"" and that they could ""make the rules"". A Primark spokesperson said: ""Inclusivity really matters to us."" Ms Long questioned the effect of the difference in messaging: ""Can anyone spot a difference in tone here? A difference in narrative? Boys are awesome in themselves and don't need to consider anyone else,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""Boys are about *doing* and girls are about *feeling*. Boys take what they want' girls consider others. ""Stop telling girls their place is to serve others! Stop telling boys they should have nothing to do with kindness and love! What are you, a throwback to the 1950s?"", she added. Asos and Primark set out new green pledges Primark: Leggings still popular as comfort rules She drew support from other social media users on the topic. Small business owner Not Only Pink and Blue wrote: ""We really need the High Street to think about the expectations these messages set. Why not have all these messages across all the clothes?"" On Monday, several children's items were also on display on the Primark website, such as hoodies branded ""fearless"" for boys and ""happy happy happy"" for girls. The Primark spokesperson added that it offers a ""broad range of styles"" across kids' clothing in-store to cater for a mix of tastes, and that it had removed gender-specific labels on its kids and baby ranges in recent years. ""However, we are always learning, we welcome customer feedback and will continue to look at where we can do more,"" they said. The fashion chain, which is owned by AB Foods, is best-known for its discount clothing. Ms Long has previously drawn attention to differing messaging used on clothing for different genders in other stores such as Tesco and Marks & Spencer. Brands like Boden have also come under fire for choosing slogans such as ""cool to be kind"" on girls' clothing, whereas boys' items featured the words ""genius"" or ""warrior knees"". At the time, the firm apologised and that it takes the topic of gender stereotyping very seriously, pointing towards its ""gender busting"" ranges in previous seasons.

"The NHS in Scotland reached crisis point because of a ""complete lack of planning"" during the pandemic, opposition politicians have said. Waiting times in A&E are the highest on record,while GPs have warned of unprecedented staff shortages. The Scottish Conservatives and Labour have also claimed that dentists ""are on the brink of mass exodus"". The Scottish government insists the NHS ""has come through the worst"" crisis in its history. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf has also announced Â£82.6m of funding to improve services for patients at GP practices. However, the SNP government has been accused of ""knee-jerk reaction-making"" which has damaged the economy and people's mental health. It comes asthe UK government has also faced criticismas plans to tackle the backlog of patients on hospital waiting lists in England have been delayed. Scottish Labour's health spokesperson Jackie Baillie told the BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that workforce shortages ""haven't been addressed for years"" and the service remains under acute pressure. She said: ""What we have seen is waiting lists getting longer, cancelled operations up and real challenges for people. ""One in nine of the population of Scotland is stuck on a waiting list and there is no sign of catch-up or recovery. ""So whilst we would all want the NHS to keep people safe - and the staff work incredibly hard - remobilising the NHS has to be a key priority. At the moment, that simply isn't happening."" NHS Scotland's 'biggest crisis' in five charts Scottish A&E waiting times worst on record 'Lives being lost' due to ambulance waiting times Plan to tackle England's NHS backlog delayed Dr Sandesh Gulhane, the Scottish Tory health spokesman, told the programme that ambulance waiting times -in some cases up to eight hours- were also a symptom of inaction from the Scottish government. He added: ""What this all points to is no planning, knee-jerk reaction making then not following through. ""At the height of the pandemic, we needed to do things to protect the public and protect our global health. But it has come at a cost. ""We have to understand we were saving lives, but it was coming with unintended consequences of mental health breakdown and also our economy not doing as well. ""As the pandemic progressed, it was quite clear that decisions were being made badly. ""We were very quick to restrict but are very slow here in Scotland to relax and people are beginning to feel the mental health strain of what's going on. ""This isn't all pandemic-made - we have a complete lack of job planning for doctors and nurses."" Dentists are having to deal with a huge backlog of patients Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said the NHS in Scotland had suffered its most intense period ever at the end of December and the beginning of January. But he insisted everything was being done to ensure patients were ""not being left behind"" as hospitals continued to deal with Covid and non-Covid patients. He said: ""While we are through the worst of it, we should also say that there is still significant pressure on the health service. ""That comes from the continued number of patients who are in hospital with Covid. ""It also comes from the accumulative impact of almost two years of a pandemic and having to catch up with a significant backlog."" Mr Yousaf announced the new Â£82.6m of funding for GP practices across the country during a visit to the Dunblane Health Centre. He said it would enable: pharmacy support for repeat prescriptions and medication reviews nursing support for routine tests and wound treatment access to physiotherapy services The health secretary said: ""We have now delivered every penny we committed to health boards and GPs as part of our ongoing commitment to help support practices deliver care. ""The NHS is facing the biggest challenge this winter and this investment will have real benefits for both patients and frontline staff."" Meanwhile, Scottish Labour claimed dental care could become ""the privilege of people who can afford to go private"" unless emergency funding for NHS treatment is ramped up. Practices across Scotland are still operating with full Covid infection controls while dealing with a case backlog. Jackie Baillie said the government must retain emergency NHS payments after 1 April and do more to tackle the problems facing dentistry. She said: ""Dental care is seeing 850,00 fewer patients - a lot of them from deprived communities. ""We would keep the emergency support in place beyond April so they can continue to remobilise. ""There should also be a review of the funding model, which is almost as old as the NHS itself. ""And fund things like outcomes and reward prevention, because dental care cannot become the privilege of the few who can afford to go private. ""The Scottish government needs to tackle the crisis facing dentistry and that's one way of doing so."" The Scottish government said it had invested an additional Â£50m in NHS dental care during the pandemic, while Â£20m had been allocated this month alone to deal with a backlog in children's treatment.

"BBC Reality Check has examined Boris Johnson's claim that Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy Savile when he was director of public prosecutions (DPP) and has found no evidence that Sir Keir was involved at any point in the decision not to charge Savile. The Labour leader called Mr Johnson's comments a ""ridiculous slur"" and they have been criticised by the Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle. Mr Johnson had said that Sir Keir ""spent most of his time [as DPP] prosecuting journalists and failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile"". He made the unfounded claim, which has been discredited before, in the House of Commons where ""parliamentary privilege"" gives MPs certain legal protections over what they say. On Tuesday 1 February, Downing Street said Boris Johnson ""stands by"" his comments. But on Thursday 3 February, Mr Johnson said: ""I'm not talking about the leader of the opposition's personal record when he was DPP. I was making a point about his responsibility for the organisation as a whole."" In response to Mr Johnson's latest comments, Downing Street's head of policy, Munira Mirza,announced her resignation- saying the PM should have apologised. In her resignation letter, published by The Spectator, she wrote: ""You are a better man than many of your detractors will ever understand, which is why it is so desperately sad that you let yourself down by making a scurrilous accusation against the leader of the opposition."" Jimmy Savile was revealed to be a serial sexual abuser after his death in 2011. The DJ and television presenter had attacked hundreds of women and children at various locations including hospitals, schools and the BBC. Four allegations of sexual assault by Savile in the 1970s were investigated by Surrey and Sussex Police in 2007 and 2008. Sir Keir was head of the Crown Prosecution Service in 2009 when Surrey Police interviewed Savile and consulted a CPS lawyer who decided there was insufficient evidence for a prosecution to take place. As Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Keir Starmer was the most senior public prosecutor in England and Wales and responsible for leading the CPS. The CPS prosecutes most criminal cases in England and Wales and employsabout 6,000 staff,,externalhalf of them lawyers who decide which cases should go ahead. In 2012, Sir Keir commissioneda report,externalfrom Alison Levitt QC into why Savile was not prosecuted. In three cases investigated by Surrey Police, no prosecutions were brought on the basis that none of the victims was prepared to give evidence in court. The report suggestedthat had the victims known there were other people making similar complaints they might have been prepared to do so. Prosecutions could have been possible ""had the police and prosecutors taken a different approach"". It also concluded: ""I have seen nothing to suggest that the decisions not to prosecute were consciously influenced by any improper motive on the part of either police or prosecutors."" The CPS said: ""There is no reference within the report to any involvement from the DPP in the decision-making in the case. The reviewing lawyer at the time set out their own reasons for the decisions they took, which are reproduced in the report."" Reality Check spoke to Nazir Afzal who was Chief Crown Prosecutor in the CPS for North West England from 2011-15. We asked him whether - as DPP - Keir Starmer would have known about the decision not to prosecute Savile. He said: ""None of that would have been escalated beyond the south-east and Keir wasn't aware of it."" ""At that time we were dealing [with] 900,000 prosecutions a year,"" he added. Sir Keir said when the report was published: ""I would like to take the opportunity to apologise for the shortcomings in the part played by the CPS in these cases. If this report and my apology are to serve their full purpose, then this must be seen as a watershed moment."" The Labour leader called Mr Johnson's comment ""a ridiculous slur, peddled by right-wing trolls"". Unfounded posts directly accusing Sir Keir of failing to prosecute Savile saw an upsurge on social media after he became Labour leader in April 2020. They have been shared by British followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory, among others. A video clip of the prime minister's accusation has been spreading on anti-vaccine channels with thousands of followers on social media chat app Telegram, as ""proof"" of an alleged cover-up of high-profile child abuse. Richard Scorer, a lawyer who represented victims of Savile, told the BBC that the prime minister's claim was ""fundamentally baseless"". He said the victims he had spoken to were ""disgusted by Mr Johnson's comments"" and called on the prime minister to withdraw them and apologise. The Speaker of the House of Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he was ""far from satisfied that the comments in question were appropriate on this occasion"".

"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promisedtough targets to tackle record NHS waiting listsin England after plans to reduce the backlog were delayed. Speaking during a visit to a hospital in Kent, he denied reports the Treasury rejected the plans because the targets were not tough enough and insisted it was ""working together in harmony"" with No 10. Mr Johnson said the ""vast majority"" of people who suspect they have cancer should get a diagnosis within 28 days. That target was originally due to have come in last year, but had been delayed because of the pandemic. He also said that by March next year no-one should have to wait longer than two months. But that target already exists - and is not for diagnosis, but for treatment within two months. It is understood the commitment was for the NHS to return to pre-pandemic performance by March next year. Away from NHS patient backlogs, it has emerged that Mr Johnson told his new communications chief""I will survive"", singing lyrics from the Gloria Gaynor song, as he faces continued pressure -including calls to resign from MPs- over Downing Street parties during lockdown. Gutto Harri - who was appointed after a string of No 10 aides quit amid turmoil over ""Partygate"" - tolda Welsh news website,externalthat after exchanging lines from the 1970s disco hit, and ""a lot of laughing"" during the Friday afternoon meeting, he and Mr Johnson ""sat down to have a serious discussion about how to get the government back on track and how we move forward"". He said the PM was ""not a complete clown, he's a very likeable character"". In Northern Ireland,Health Minister Robin Swann has said he is taking legal adviceon how he can replace most remaining Covid restrictions as ""this week"" is the right time to remove them. It followsthe resignation of First Minister Paul Givan- which means the executive - Northern Ireland's government - cannot meet. It had been due to discuss removing the remaining measures on Thursday. However, Mr Swann said he was not ""prepared to allow a failure of politics to get in the way of lifting now unnecessary restrictions"". Rules still in place include Covid passports for nightclubs and indoor unseated and partially-seated events of 500 or more people, and a limit of 30 on gatherings. This video can not be played 'We have both hands tied behind our back' Truckers in the Canadian capital of Ottawaare vowing to continue their protestsdespite a state of emergency and mounting frustration and anger among residents. For more than a week now, anti-vaccine mandate protests have paralysed the city's core, forcing businesses to close and disrupting daily life. The so-called Freedom Convoy is in response to the introduction of a rule that all truckers must be vaccinated to cross the US border. On Monday, several of them told the BBC they will stay until their demands are met. Trucker Lloyd Brubacher said he was supporting the protests because he fears his nine-year-old son would grow up ""not having the right to choose for his freedom and his rights"". The ""Freedom Convoy"" began as a protest against vaccine mandates US podcast host Joe Rogan - who has been at the centre of controversy over claims he helped spread Covid misinformation and his past use of racist language -will remain on Spotify, the boss of the the music streaming platform has said.In a letter to staff, Daniel Ek said that although he ""strongly"" condemned racial slurs and other comments by Rogan, he did not believe silencing him was the answer. Neil Young and Joni Mitchellrecently quit Spotifyin protest at what they allege is Rogan's role in spreading Covid misinformation. Rogan denied trying to spread misinformation, but backed Spotify's plan to put a disclaimer at the start of controversial episodes.

"Asda has promised to stock its budget ranges in all 581 supermarkets and online after complaints from anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe. The retailer said it had ""taken on board"" her comments about availability of cheaper food for households struggling to make ends meet. She had highlighted Asda in tweets critical about value ranges removed from shelves or going up in price. In response to Asda's move, Ms Monroetweeted,external: ""Well, that went rather well."" Asda currently stocks 150 Smart Price and Farm Stores products in 300 stores. All 200 products in these value ranges will now be available in all Asda stores by 1 March, said Meg Farren, Asda's chief customer officer. ""We want to help our customers' budgets stretch further and have taken on board the comments about the availability of our Smart Price range made by Jack Monroe. Jack Monroe has said value products have to be universally available ""We are taking steps to put our full Smart Price and Farm Stores ranges in store and online to make these products as accessible as possible,"" Ms Farren said. Rising inflation and the cost of living crisis is hitting low-income households particularly hard. Ms Monroe, an activist and blogger on how to eat on a budget, says the cost of food staples such as cheap pasta and rice are going up in price faster than other products. She criticised Asda for discontinuing some budget products, such as a bag of rice sold online for 45p and replaced with rice costing a minimum of Â£1.20. Her Twitter thread details many other Asda products no longer available in her local store, where she is a regular shopper. In one tweet she said supermarket value products had to be ""universally available, or it's as good as useless"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Sunday, the chairman of Tesco,John Allan, told the BBC that the worst of food price inflation is to come, with prices likely to rise by 5% by April. But he said food costs make up a bigger proportion of spending for households on low-incomes, so it will hit the ""hardest up harder"". Ms Monroe has been critical of the way the official UK inflation rate - currently at a 30-year high of 5.4% - is calculated, saying it does not reflect the higher cost of food staples bought by poorer people. Earlier this month, the Office for National Statistics, which publishes the monthly inflation figure, said it would alsopublish a wider variety of ""cost of living metrics""to better reflect the impact of price rises on households.

"Louise O'Shea often takes her daughters to visit work and says firms need to normalise families in the workplace Workplace change is needed to normalise and support women reaching the top, one company chief executive has said. Louise O'Shea of Confused.com said she was lucky to work somewhere that nurtured her and where she could help women - but this was rare. She spoke as a report said the number of women in management or directors in Wales was ""stubbornly"" staying at 39%. The Welsh government said its advancing gender equality plan set out action in areas such as education. When Ms O'Shea, from Cardiff, announced to a group of female colleagues at the price comparison website that she applied to be chief executive officer at eight months pregnant, she said the whole room cheered. Pay gap between men and women fails to improve Are men-dominated offices the future of the workplace? Can my employer ask me to wear make-up and heels? This environment, she said, allowed women to grow, but it was unusual compared to some ""toxic workplaces"". Louise O'Shea went on maternity leave just before being promoted from finance director to CEO at Confused.com She said many felt intimidated walking into all-male management and culture needed to change across the board. She said: ""I still experience barriers. It is not as if when you become a CEO you are no longer singled out as a women."" She said she had been verbally abused in person and on social media, ""more than a man would have been"", adding to fears women may have about leadership roles requiring ""personal sacrifice"". But she said policies such as bereavement leave for miscarriages, appropriate maternity and paternity policies and normalising family life in the office could help ""change the culture"" for women. She believed it also helped women outside the organisation as better paternity leave for men could mean their partners were better supported. This video can not be played Last year, Louise O'Shea of Confused.com shared her CEO secrets She said the pandemic had some positive changes, such as hybrid working providing flexibility ""that allows working parents to be more present for their children"". But she argued that the school curriculum needed to be widened to help girls at a younger age, including particularly ""male dominated subjects"" such as technology and coding. She said it would be a ""20-year shift"" but could be a ""great opportunity to really make a dent"" in the pay gap and would be a flexible skill women can use elsewhere. ""I would say there's a huge investment required in that skill set because that for me it is critical for us to have for thelevelling up agendafundamentally, not just between Wales and the rest of the world but between men and women,"" she said. This video can not be played Channelle Taylor was working six days a week but cut this to two to look after her daughter The annual State of the Nation report by charity Chwarae Teg also found 72% of working mothers in the UK worked fewer hours and cut their earnings due to a lack of childcare during the first lockdown. Chanelle Taylor, who owns Lady Paint and Decor Company in Caerphilly, had to drop from six to two days a week to look after her seven-year-old daughter when schools closed. Chanelle's husband, an energy production engineer for a company in Liverpool, is classed as an essential worker, and continued to travel away to work throughout lockdown. She said: ""It was pretty stressful purely because I felt like I wasn't doing enough. ""A job that was meant to be done within 10 days took me more like three weeks because I only worked two days a week. ""As a mum, we're kind of expected to be there for our children a little bit more, where dads can go to work. It was very difficult as it is natural for the mum to be expected to do everything."" Cerys Furlong, chief executive at Chwarae Teg, said while there had been progress, the pace of change was ""far too slow"". ""While action is needed in a number of areas we know that two issues remain absolutely critical if we want to secure a gender equal Wales - childcare and unpaid work and sexual harassment, abuse and violence."" She said there was an ""over-reliance on women to provide care and unpaid work"" and a lack of affordable childcare meant women often fell behind. Ms Furlong said high-profile cases of violence against women such asWenjing Lin,Sarah EverardandAshling Murphy""shone a light on the endemic and unacceptable misogyny and violence that women continue to face"". ""In a Wales that says all the right things about gender equality and the progress we want to see, the lack of progress highlighted in our report is deeply disappointing,"" she added. ""We clearly need to do things differently, faster and with more commitment. ""That is why we need government, business and civil society to act now to ensure that all women achieve and prosper in Wales."" The Welsh government said it was working with organisations to develop how digital and computing subjects were taught in schools, with ""particular focus on improving gender equality"" in science, technology, engineering and maths. It added: ""Theadvancing gender equality in Wales plan,externalsets out our ambition to achieve gender equality in Wales. ""The plan outlines a range of actions to achieve this ambition including commitments relating to education, employability and improving representation in leadership roles.""

"BBC Reality Check has examined Boris Johnson's claim that Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy Savile when he was director of public prosecutions (DPP) and has found no evidence that Sir Keir was involved at any point in the decision not to charge Savile. The Labour leader called Mr Johnson's comments a ""ridiculous slur"" and they have been criticised by the Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle. Mr Johnson had said that Sir Keir ""spent most of his time [as DPP] prosecuting journalists and failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile"". He made the unfounded claim, which has been discredited before, in the House of Commons where ""parliamentary privilege"" gives MPs certain legal protections over what they say. On Tuesday 1 February, Downing Street said Boris Johnson ""stands by"" his comments. But on Thursday 3 February, Mr Johnson said: ""I'm not talking about the leader of the opposition's personal record when he was DPP. I was making a point about his responsibility for the organisation as a whole."" In response to Mr Johnson's latest comments, Downing Street's head of policy, Munira Mirza,announced her resignation- saying the PM should have apologised. In her resignation letter, published by The Spectator, she wrote: ""You are a better man than many of your detractors will ever understand, which is why it is so desperately sad that you let yourself down by making a scurrilous accusation against the leader of the opposition."" Jimmy Savile was revealed to be a serial sexual abuser after his death in 2011.

"Primark has been accused of selling kids clothing with ""hugely sexist messaging"" by a best-selling author. Novelist Kate Long shared images on social media of tops in a Chester store on Sunday which urged girls to ""be kind"", ""keep on smiling"" and to be ""always perfect"". In contrast, items in the boys' range told them ""you are limitless"" and that they could ""make the rules"". A Primark spokesperson said: ""Inclusivity really matters to us."" Ms Long questioned the effect of the difference in messaging: ""Can anyone spot a difference in tone here? A difference in narrative? Boys are awesome in themselves and don't need to consider anyone else,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""Boys are about *doing* and girls are about *feeling*. Boys take what they want' girls consider others. ""Stop telling girls their place is to serve others! Stop telling boys they should have nothing to do with kindness and love! What are you, a throwback to the 1950s?"", she added. Asos and Primark set out new green pledges Primark: Leggings still popular as comfort rules She drew support from other social media users on the topic. Small business owner Not Only Pink and Blue wrote: ""We really need the High Street to think about the expectations these messages set. Why not have all these messages across all the clothes?"" On Monday, several children's items were also on display on the Primark website, such as hoodies branded ""fearless"" for boys and ""happy happy happy"" for girls. The Primark spokesperson added that it offers a ""broad range of styles"" across kids' clothing in-store to cater for a mix of tastes, and that it had removed gender-specific labels on its kids and baby ranges in recent years. ""However, we are always learning, we welcome customer feedback and will continue to look at where we can do more,"" they said. The fashion chain, which is owned by AB Foods, is best-known for its discount clothing. Ms Long has previously drawn attention to differing messaging used on clothing for different genders in other stores such as Tesco and Marks & Spencer. Brands like Boden have also come under fire for choosing slogans such as ""cool to be kind"" on girls' clothing, whereas boys' items featured the words ""genius"" or ""warrior knees"". At the time, the firm apologised and that it takes the topic of gender stereotyping very seriously, pointing towards its ""gender busting"" ranges in previous seasons.

Our live coverage is coming to a close for the evening, so here's a recap of the day's Covid news: Earlier, we told you about how England's exam regulator is planning to grade this summer's GCSEs and A-levels more generously than in  pre-pandemic years. It's one way in which officials are trying to make things fairer as exams resume across the UK for the first time since the pandemic began, amid ongoing disruption to education. In England, most of the exam boards have also published advanced information about most A-level, AS-level and GCSE subjects, giving students a better sense of what topics they need to revise. They list the topics that will be the main focus of assessments, but do not include everything which will be covered in the exams. GCSE English literature, geography, history and ancient history are not included - but they will offer more choice in the exam questions. Other UK nations have their own plans to support students as exams return. Read more about this summer's exams Responding to Labour, health minister Edward Argar has told MPs there is ""undeniably a huge Covid backlog that needs urgent attention"". ""Throughout the pandemic we had to take steps to make sure we could treat those with the greatest clinical need, and make sure that we provided a safe environment for those who needed Covid care,"" he says. ""The number of people waiting for care in England now stands at around six million and we know that this figure will get worse before it gets better."" Argar adds that the ""best current estimate"" suggested about 8.5 million had not come forward for treatment during the pandemic. ""But we are pulling out all stops to help the NHS recover and make sure patients are receiving the right care at the right time."" ""This isn't a Covid backlog, this is a Tory backlog,""
says shadow health secretary Wes Streeting â who has been quizzing the health minister
about the delayed plan to tackle the NHS backlog in England. ""More than a million are waiting for scans and tests used
to diagnose cancer, and the NHS itself is waiting, waiting for the government's
plan to deal with the backlog,"" he says. He says Monday's unexplained delay is like something fromThe
Thick Of Itâ the satirical show about the inner workings of British
government. ""But the reality is worse than fiction. A photo op without
a plan, their own NHS recovery plan just another cancelled operation,"" Streeting
says. He concludes: ""Briefings for the Department for Health and
Social Care claimed the chancellor blocked the plan because, to quote one
government official, it's pretty obvious it's about Treasury reluctance to
rescue the prime minister."" Through the day we've heard from people affected by theongoing backlog to NHS treatment in England. One of the latest to speak to us, Matthew Watkinson, from Scarborough, has been waiting for an operation to repair a hernia in his stomach for more than two years. Matthew, who is 70, says: âI suffer a lot and it doesnât get better."" He tells us a similar delay led to his mother's death when a ruptured hernia caused organ failure. He says he is not expecting waiting lists to shorten and feels forced to consider unaffordable private treatment, costing around Â£3,000, because the NHS is so stretched and ""just can't cope"". Northern Ireland's health minister says he is taking legal advice on how he can ""replace the bulk of remaining Covid-19 restrictions"" with guidance ""this week"". Robin Swann was speaking afterFirst Minister Paul Givanresigned in protest over a Brexit deal known asthe Northern Ireland Protocol. Givan's resignation means Northern Ireland's government cannot meet but it was due to discuss removing remaining Covid restrictions on Thursday. Swann says he is not ""prepared to allow a failure of politics to get in the way of lifting now unnecessary restrictions"". He told a press conference:""We need to start getting normal back."" With the latest stats suggesting Covid cases are continuing to decrease, what are the rules on face coverings? People in England are no longer legally required to wear face
masks in most public spaces â although they are still recommended in some
places. They remain a requirement in healthcare settings, as well as on public
transport in London. Masks are still required in many situations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, including in shops and for secondary school pupils while in school.

primary and secondary schools across England, says it is ""hard to

AS and A-level exams will be helpful - to students or teachers. It comes after exam boards in England published details of what
will come up in this summer's exams in most core subjects - including maths,
biology, chemistry and languages. Chalke highlighted the number of children currently struggling
with serious mental health issues and said the UK, like many other countries,
should be dropping GCSEs altogether. ""It strikes me that an opportunity is being lost. We know
that exams don't work, they are unfair."" ""[Exams] measure a particular kind of intelligence - so,

Details of exam content have been released today in England and Wales, to help pupils revise. There's been a mixed reaction among teachers and students at Wales Comprehensive School in Kiveton, South Yorkshire.

a new daily record number of Covid cases. According to the South China Morning Post newspaper, 614
new cases have been recorded in the last 24 hours and more than 600 preliminary
positive results. The paper calls this a""steep increase"",externalover the 342 cases confirmed on Sunday. This in itself is a significant increase
on earlier daily cases; for the last week, cases in Hong Kong had hovered
around the 100 mark. Officials have been warning people in the city that a large
proportion of cases are untraceable, and urging them to stay at home, as the
Chinese city has azero-Covid strategy. One of the theories is that imported hamsters at pet shops
across the city could have facilitated animal-to-human transmission,although this has been widely critiqued. Hong Kong
is currently under partial lockdown. Last month, bars and gyms were ordered to closed, as
well as schools and nurseries. A 6pm
restaurant curfew was also
introduced. There are currently more than 1,400 people in hospital.
However, at least 80% of Hong Kongâs 7.5m population have received at least one
vaccine dose. Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt has been speaking
to Radio 4's World At One about thedelay to tackling NHS waiting lists in England. Hunt, who is the chair of the Commons health and social care
committee, says ""there does seem to be a Whitehall hold-up"" and every
moment of delay is creating ""more agony and pain for NHS patients"". He also refuses to reveal if he would stand in any
leadership contest should Boris Johnson be forced out of office. We're in a ""very difficult limbo period"" waiting for the
result of a police investigation into Downing Street parties, he adds. If you're just joining us, we've been hearing this afternoon from patients' groups, who've expressed concern that a plan to tackle NHS waiting lists - due to have been published today -has been delayed. Rachel Power, from the Patients' Association, tells BBC Radio 5 live that the government needs to publish its NHS recovery plan so that patients can see it and learn how they're going to start their journey to getting better. Asked what she thinks the plan will include, she says: ""I think it'll show people where they are on the waiting list but will also give advice about that key issue around how to keep well while waiting. ""And hopefully it will have an element of allowing the patient to do some shared decision-making as they prepare for their treatment."" She says one of the key things she wants to see in the plan is how the NHS is going to reach out to patients so they aren't sitting wondering when they are going to have the treatment they need to be able to get on with their lives. Let'stake a look at the latest daily figures on the spread of Covid worldwide. There were 5,729 deaths reported around the world, bringing the global total to 5.7 million since the pandemic began. And with 1.7 million new infections recorded, it means there have been 395.2 million confirmed cases since the virus first emerged. But in many parts of the world, the spike in cases caused by the appearance of the Omicron variant has begun to subside. Cases are now clearly falling in Asia, North America and Latin America. In Europe, where cases are highest, the virus is continuing to spread at a greater rate than at any other time in the pandemic.  In the US, cases have fallen sharply but the number of deaths remains high â averaging nearly 2,500 in the past seven days. Many places in the world are using booster vaccinations to top up immunity and keep the pandemic under control in the face of the Omicron variant. Among larger countries, Chile has the highest proportion of the
population who have had booster jabs, with 67% having had the extra dose. Denmark, which recently lifted all its Covid restrictions, is
second on that list, with 62% having had the booster vaccination. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent With Covid in retreat â at least in terms of serious illness and pressure on the NHS â the challenge facing the government is how to get the core services back on track. Whether it is cancer or hospital treatments, the pandemic has had a huge impact. Waiting times have got worse across the board. For hospital treatments ministers need to find a way to increase capacity â the NHS is still doing fewer treatments than it was before the pandemic began. Tough new targets on their own will not be enough without the staff needed to see patients. Much the same is true for cancer â but it is further complicated by the missing cases. The number of diagnoses are down by 34,000 since the pandemic started. Getting those people to come forward for checks, and ensuring they get them quickly when they do, is essential. We've got a bit more on the PM's comments we
brought you earlier â in which he said he was""working with the NHS to set some tough targets"" for the delayed NHS Recovery Plan. Boris Johnson appeared to confirm a 28-day target for a cancer
diagnosis for three out of four people, and that by March next year no-one
would wait longer than two months to find out if they have cancer. That target was originally due to have come in last year, but had been delayed because of the pandemic. The waiting list for hospital treatment in England hit a record six million in Novemberâ a rise of nearly 50% since the pandemic started. More than 300,000 patients have been waiting more than a year for treatment after the suspension of routine surgery during certain parts of the pandemic, adding to pressures which were already clear before Covid. Sir Keir Starmer has been talkingabout the police's decision to clear him of breaking lockdown rulesafter he was filmed
drinking a beer in an office in April 2021. Asked by broadcasters in south London whether he was
""relieved"" by Durham Constabulary's announcement, the Labour leader
says he was clear throughout that no rules had been broken. ""And here's the contrast - only last Monday we got the
overview from Sue Gray, and 12 cases being referred to the Metropolitan Police
in relation to the prime minister and the goings on in Downing Street,"" he
says. ""Because the Metropolitan Police consider there was
evidence not only of offences, but they were serious enough and flagrant enough
to put aside their usual rule that they won't investigate 12 months after the
event. ""So that's a huge
contrast, as there always was in this case."" Weâve heard from a cancer patientdirectly impacted by the NHS backlog in England. Louise McAllan, who lives in Essex, tells BBC Radio 4's World At One programme she was diagnosed with cancer in February 2020 and didn't receive any treatment for eight months. She says the delay left her ""lost for words"" and her chances of survival have now been compromised. People's lives have been put in ""jeopardy"" by the delays caused during the pandemic, she says.

"France won the 2018 World Cup in Russia The UK and Republic of Ireland football associations have agreed not to bid for the 2030 World Cup. They will instead focus on a joint bid to host Euro 2028. The decision comes after the UK government committedÂ£2.8m to a feasibility studyinto the bid. Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee chair Julian Knight had previously described the prospective World Cup bid as a""giant, expensive vanity project"". On Monday he said: ""It's unacceptable that Â£2.8m in taxpayer money was wasted on a pipe dream that was clearly doomed from the start. Football in the UK needs to sort out its reputation at home before we can go after the biggest tournament."" The feasibility study included an analysis of the economic impact, the political football landscape and the likely costs of hosting major international tournaments. Following the study, the football associations of the Republic of Ireland, England, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland will focus on an official bid to host Uefa Euro 2028. A statement said: ""Hosting a Uefa Euro offers a similar return on investment, with the European tournament carrying a far lower delivery cost and the potential of the benefits being realised sooner. ""It would be an honour and a privilege to collectively host Euro 2028 and to welcome all of Europe. ""It would also be a wonderful opportunity to demonstrate the true impact of hosting a world-class football tournament by driving positive change and leaving a lasting legacy across our communities."" The UK government had previously said it would investÂ£550m in grassroots football if the 2030 bid was successful,with Prime Minister Boris Johnson hoping to ""transform lives with a legacy to match the 2012 Olympics"". England failed with a bid - fronted by former captain David Beckham, Prince William and former prime minister David Cameron - to host the 2018 World Cup, which was staged in Russia. Northern Ireland determined to host games should Euros bid be successful Principality Stadium to be Wales' only venue for joint Euro 2028 bid The UK government said it supported the five football associations' decision and added that it remained ""passionate about bringing a World Cup to the UK and Ireland when the time is right"". Mark Bullingham, chief executive of the English FA, identified both bids as ""brilliant"" opportunities but said after assessing the ""winnability"" a decision was made to go for the Euro 2028 bid. He added there was also ""uncertainty"" around future World Cups - football's world governing body Fifa has proposed staging the tournament every two years as part of a revamped calendar. FA of Wales president Stephen Williams also said the impact of a successful bid for Wales would be ""immeasurable"" and would leave a ""long-lasting legacy"".

"Primark has been accused of selling kids clothing with ""hugely sexist messaging"" by a best-selling author. Novelist Kate Long shared images on social media of tops in a Chester store on Sunday which urged girls to ""be kind"", ""keep on smiling"" and to be ""always perfect"". In contrast, items in the boys' range told them ""you are limitless"" and that they could ""make the rules"". A Primark spokesperson said: ""Inclusivity really matters to us."" Ms Long questioned the effect of the difference in messaging: ""Can anyone spot a difference in tone here? A difference in narrative? Boys are awesome in themselves and don't need to consider anyone else,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""Boys are about *doing* and girls are about *feeling*. Boys take what they want' girls consider others. ""Stop telling girls their place is to serve others! Stop telling boys they should have nothing to do with kindness and love! What are you, a throwback to the 1950s?"", she added. Asos and Primark set out new green pledges Primark: Leggings still popular as comfort rules She drew support from other social media users on the topic. Small business owner Not Only Pink and Blue wrote: ""We really need the High Street to think about the expectations these messages set. Why not have all these messages across all the clothes?"" On Monday, several children's items were also on display on the Primark website, such as hoodies branded ""fearless"" for boys and ""happy happy happy"" for girls. The Primark spokesperson added that it offers a ""broad range of styles"" across kids' clothing in-store to cater for a mix of tastes, and that it had removed gender-specific labels on its kids and baby ranges in recent years. ""However, we are always learning, we welcome customer feedback and will continue to look at where we can do more,"" they said. The fashion chain, which is owned by AB Foods, is best-known for its discount clothing. Ms Long has previously drawn attention to differing messaging used on clothing for different genders in other stores such as Tesco and Marks & Spencer. Brands like Boden have also come under fire for choosing slogans such as ""cool to be kind"" on girls' clothing, whereas boys' items featured the words ""genius"" or ""warrior knees"". At the time, the firm apologised and that it takes the topic of gender stereotyping very seriously, pointing towards its ""gender busting"" ranges in previous seasons.

"France won the 2018 World Cup in Russia The UK and Republic of Ireland football associations have agreed not to bid for the 2030 World Cup. They will instead focus on a joint bid to host Euro 2028. The decision comes after the UK government committedÂ£2.8m to a feasibility studyinto the bid. Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee chair Julian Knight had previously described the prospective World Cup bid as a""giant, expensive vanity project"". On Monday he said: ""It's unacceptable that Â£2.8m in taxpayer money was wasted on a pipe dream that was clearly doomed from the start. Football in the UK needs to sort out its reputation at home before we can go after the biggest tournament."" The feasibility study included an analysis of the economic impact, the political football landscape and the likely costs of hosting major international tournaments. Following the study, the football associations of the Republic of Ireland, England, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland will focus on an official bid to host Uefa Euro 2028. A statement said: ""Hosting a Uefa Euro offers a similar return on investment, with the European tournament carrying a far lower delivery cost and the potential of the benefits being realised sooner. ""It would be an honour and a privilege to collectively host Euro 2028 and to welcome all of Europe. ""It would also be a wonderful opportunity to demonstrate the true impact of hosting a world-class football tournament by driving positive change and leaving a lasting legacy across our communities."" The UK government had previously said it would investÂ£550m in grassroots football if the 2030 bid was successful,with Prime Minister Boris Johnson hoping to ""transform lives with a legacy to match the 2012 Olympics"". England failed with a bid - fronted by former captain David Beckham, Prince William and former prime minister David Cameron - to host the 2018 World Cup, which was staged in Russia. Northern Ireland determined to host games should Euros bid be successful Principality Stadium to be Wales' only venue for joint Euro 2028 bid The UK government said it supported the five football associations' decision and added that it remained ""passionate about bringing a World Cup to the UK and Ireland when the time is right"". Mark Bullingham, chief executive of the English FA, identified both bids as ""brilliant"" opportunities but said after assessing the ""winnability"" a decision was made to go for the Euro 2028 bid. He added there was also ""uncertainty"" around future World Cups - football's world governing body Fifa has proposed staging the tournament every two years as part of a revamped calendar. FA of Wales president Stephen Williams also said the impact of a successful bid for Wales would be ""immeasurable"" and would leave a ""long-lasting legacy"". All associations say they will continue to ""collaborate"" with government partners about the next steps.

"Asda has promised to stock its budget ranges in all 581 supermarkets and online after complaints from anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe. The retailer said it had ""taken on board"" her comments about availability of cheaper food for households struggling to make ends meet. She had highlighted Asda in tweets critical about value ranges removed from shelves or going up in price. In response to Asda's move, Ms Monroetweeted,external: ""Well, that went rather well."" Asda currently stocks 150 Smart Price and Farm Stores products in 300 stores. All 200 products in these value ranges will now be available in all Asda stores by 1 March, said Meg Farren, Asda's chief customer officer. ""We want to help our customers' budgets stretch further and have taken on board the comments about the availability of our Smart Price range made by Jack Monroe. Jack Monroe has said value products have to be universally available ""We are taking steps to put our full Smart Price and Farm Stores ranges in store and online to make these products as accessible as possible,"" Ms Farren said. Rising inflation and the cost of living crisis is hitting low-income households particularly hard. Ms Monroe, an activist and blogger on how to eat on a budget, says the cost of food staples such as cheap pasta and rice are going up in price faster than other products. She criticised Asda for discontinuing some budget products, such as a bag of rice sold online for 45p and replaced with rice costing a minimum of Â£1.20. Her Twitter thread details many other Asda products no longer available in her local store, where she is a regular shopper. In one tweet she said supermarket value products had to be ""universally available, or it's as good as useless"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Sunday, the chairman of Tesco,John Allan, told the BBC that the worst of food price inflation is to come, with prices likely to rise by 5% by April. But he said food costs make up a bigger proportion of spending for households on low-incomes, so it will hit the ""hardest up harder"". Ms Monroe has been critical of the way the official UK inflation rate - currently at a 30-year high of 5.4% - is calculated, saying it does not reflect the higher cost of food staples bought by poorer people. Earlier this month, the Office for National Statistics, which publishes the monthly inflation figure, said it would alsopublish a wider variety of ""cost of living metrics""to better reflect the impact of price rises on households.

"The assembly is still in place despite the collapse of the executive The ex-Northern Ireland secretary who helped restore power-sharing at Stormont in 2020 has described the fresh crisis as ""deeply depressing"". Julian Smith was speaking as MPs approved legislation based on proposals he helped draft two years ago. The bill helps protect the assembly from future collapse. It removes the duty on the government to set a date for an election if the roles of first and deputy first minister are not replaced this week. The bill also allows the assembly to continue without an executive for at least six months. Paul Givan resigned as first minister on Thursdayin protest at the Northern Ireland Protocol. It triggered the collapse of the executive, but the legislation which passed its final hurdle in the House of Commons on Monday allows the assembly to remain in place. TheNI Ministers, Elections and Petitions of Concern Billcould also come into play after the assembly election in Mayif the parties fail to fill the posts of first and deputy first ministers. MPs approved a House of Lords amendment to the bill which allows it to be applied retrospectively, to cover the resignation of Mr Givan. It will now need to receive royal assent by Thursday. Julian Smith was involved in restoring devolution in 2020 Julian Smith was secretary of state for Northern Ireland when thethe New Decade New Approach dealwas signed. It paved the way for the legislation which is now going through parliament to stave off future immediate collapses. He told the Commons: ""The lack of a first minister and deputy first minister and the fall of the executive is really bad news for the majority of men and women who want good governance. ""The majority who want to get on with day-to-day life are held hostage by parallel universe of elements of the Northern Ireland political world."" Mr Smith also questioned whether it was ""just coincidence"" that the retrospective power had been recently added to the bill by peers and said many people may have questions about the level of knowledge the government could have had ahead of the crisis unfolding. But Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson insisted there was ""no question of collusion"" with the government over when it had taken its decision to withdraw from the first minister role. He maintained that unless the government makes changes to the protocol, his party cannot continue to operate within the current structures. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood hit out at the prime minister for being ""nowhere to be seen"" since the crisis had begun. ""If I was a unionist, I would be looking very closely at what this government is doing and how it treats them,"" he added. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the DUP could not stay in government without changes to the NI Protocol Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said parties who walked away from power-sharing did so ""at their peril"", as ultimately there remained no alternative to the Stormont institutions. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis was not present during the debate but his colleague, Northern Ireland minister Conor Burns, responded for the government. He said the ""clear message"" to the DUP was that it should return to government immediately in the interests of stability, and that negotiations with the EU over the protocol would continue until a resolution is found. Mr Burns also said he had spent five nights in Northern Ireland last week speaking to a range of communities and that the government would continue to work for everyone. Earlier on Monday, Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill, who lost her role as deputy first minister when Mr Givan stood down, urged assembly members (MLAs) at Stormont to salvage what they could from the ""chaos"" of Mr Givan's resignation. Highlighting the public apology for victims of institutional abuse which wasto have been made by the first and deputy first ministers in March, Ms O'Neill added the DUP had caused ""real hurt and trauma"". Michelle O'Neill lost her post of deputy first minister after Paul Givan's resignation Afterwards, she told the media she wanted to ""fast-track"" some pieces of legislation, however, there cannot be an agreement now on a draft budget. SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon said her party would ""not be falling into the DUP's trap"" and accused them of a instigating a ""manufactured self-serving political crisis"". The Alliance Party's Andrew Muir said MLAs should not ""knock-off early"" and must work to the end of the mandate. Givan resignation triggers fresh political crisis NI First Minister Paul Givan announces resignation Commons passes Bill to prevent Stormont collapse Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said parties should come together to write to the EU about their concerns over the protocol, adding: ""if the aim is to stand here and just poke each other in the eye for the sake of poking each other in the eye then we will not make this place better for the people here."" Defending his party's action, the former DUP leader Edwin Poots told the assembly he was ""surprised that people couldn't see it coming"", and that there would not be an executive ""to come back to"" while checks exist under the Northern Ireland Protocol. Earlier, Speaker Alex Maskey met party whips to discuss how to progress legislation which is still outstanding. At the start of business on Monday, he said it was his intention the assembly passes ""as much legislation as possible"" in the weeks ahead. He also said he had no contact with the Northern Ireland Office about ending the assembly's mandate at an ""early stage"". On Monday, MLAs passed the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill, which gives parents the right to two weeks' paid statutory leave if they have suffered the loss of a child, including through miscarriage. The bill had initially brought Northern Ireland into line with employment laws in Great Britain, however following an amendment, NI will now be the first jurisdiction in Europe to legislate for miscarriage employment rights, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons said. ""Following a full public consultation, my department will draw up detailed miscarriage leave and pay regulations, with an introduction date following shortly after,"" the minister added. Paul Givan resigned as first minister as part of the DUP's protest against the NI Protocol The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) pulled Mr Givan out of Stormontin protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has saidit will be ""difficult"" for his party to form a government after the upcoming election,if issues around the post-Brexit trading mechanism are not addressed. This has prompted Sinn FÃ©in to call for an early election, after Ms O'Neill was removed as deputy first minister. The roles are joint and one cannot continue without the other. Without the two top positions being filled, the executive - Northern Ireland's government - can no longer meet. Under previous rules, the resignation of the first or deputy first minister would have set in motion a seven-day countdown to re-nominate the roles. If candidates were not successfully re-nominated the Northern Ireland secretary would then be required to set a date for a fresh assembly election and the institutions would immediately collapse. However, when power-sharing was restored at Stormont in January 2020,after three years of deadlock,it was agreed Westminster would change the rules to avoid this.

"Ms Peng, seen here at the Australian Open in 2019, insisted she never disappeared from public life Tennis star Peng Shuai says there has been a ""huge misunderstanding"" over a post in which she claimed she was forced into having sexual relations with a former Chinese party leader. The November 2021 social media post was swiftly deleted and Ms Peng disappeared for weeks, sparking global concern. But now, speaking to France's L'Equipe newspaper, Ms Peng says she never alleged she suffered a sexual assault. However, the interview was done in highly controlled circumstances. The BBC's China correspondent Stephen McDonell compared it to a propaganda exercise, saying it left more questions than answers. L'Equipe had to submit questions in advance, and the interview was conducted at the Winter Olympics under the presence of a representative from China's Olympic Committee who also translated her comments from Chinese. Ms Peng told the outlet she was living a normal life - a line which has also been used by Chinese state officials about her previously. She also expressed thanks for the concern directed towards her. ""I would like to know: why such concern?... I never said anyone sexually assaulted me,"" she told L'Equipe. The 36-year-old sporting star also hinted she could retire from professional tennis. ""Considering my age, my multiple surgeries and the pandemic that forced me to stop for so long, I believe it will be very difficult to regain my physical level,"" she told L'Equipe. How China censored a tennis star Peng Shuai: What we know so far Australian Open reverses Peng Shuai T-shirt ban On 2 November, Ms Peng had published a 1,600-word essay on Chinese social platform Weibo where she accused former Chinese Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli of forcing her to have sex with him. The post detailed her relationship with him, but also included accusations that on at least one occasion she had felt coerced into sex. The post was shared widely on Chinese social media before it was removed less than an hour after publication. In the months that followed,Ms Peng denied making the accusations. She told L'Equipe interview the post had ""given rise to a huge misunderstanding from the outside world"". Ms Peng also added that she had deleted the post herself because she ""wanted to"". But she did not elaborate on how the post had been misunderstood. Every attempt by the Communist Party, at times in collusion with the International Olympic Committee (IOC), to play down the Peng Shuai controversy just seems to inflame it, leaving more questions.

Having multiple potential translations has caused confusion. Either way, these are serious allegations about a very senior government figure. We still don't know what the tennis star meant because L'Equipe did not ask her. The interview was granted to the French outlet following permission from the Chinese Olympic Committee. L'Equipe said that despite submitting questions prior to the interview, it was able to ask more on the day. The IOC on Monday also reported that the Chinese athlete had had dinner with its president, Thomas Bach, in the Chinese capital, Beijing, on Saturday, as a follow-up meeting for the pair. Mr Bach had been one of the first authorities to vouch for Peng's welfare after he held a video call with her during the period of concern about her treatment by state authorities. The IOC has been criticised by some rights groups for failing to address China's human rights record in the lead up to and during the Winter Games.

"Ms Peng, seen here at the Australian Open in 2019, insisted she never disappeared from public life Tennis star Peng Shuai says there has been a ""huge misunderstanding"" over a post in which she claimed she was forced into having sexual relations with a former Chinese party leader. The November 2021 social media post was swiftly deleted and Ms Peng disappeared for weeks, sparking global concern. But now, speaking to France's L'Equipe newspaper, Ms Peng says she never alleged she suffered a sexual assault. However, the interview was done in highly controlled circumstances. The BBC's China correspondent Stephen McDonell compared it to a propaganda exercise, saying it left more questions than answers. L'Equipe had to submit questions in advance, and the interview was conducted at the Winter Olympics under the presence of a representative from China's Olympic Committee who also translated her comments from Chinese. Ms Peng told the outlet she was living a normal life - a line which has also been used by Chinese state officials about her previously. She also expressed thanks for the concern directed towards her. ""I would like to know: why such concern?... I never said anyone sexually assaulted me,"" she told L'Equipe. The 36-year-old sporting star also hinted she could retire from professional tennis. ""Considering my age, my multiple surgeries and the pandemic that forced me to stop for so long, I believe it will be very difficult to regain my physical level,"" she told L'Equipe. How China censored a tennis star Peng Shuai: What we know so far Australian Open reverses Peng Shuai T-shirt ban On 2 November, Ms Peng had published a 1,600-word essay on Chinese social platform Weibo where she accused former Chinese Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli of forcing her to have sex with him. The post detailed her relationship with him, but also included accusations that on at least one occasion she had felt coerced into sex. The post was shared widely on Chinese social media before it was removed less than an hour after publication. In the months that followed,Ms Peng denied making the accusations. She told L'Equipe interview the post had ""given rise to a huge misunderstanding from the outside world"". Ms Peng also added that she had deleted the post herself because she ""wanted to"". But she did not elaborate on how the post had been misunderstood. Every attempt by the Communist Party, at times in collusion with the International Olympic Committee (IOC), to play down the Peng Shuai controversy just seems to inflame it, leaving more questions.

"Louise O'Shea often takes her daughters to visit work and says firms need to normalise families in the workplace Workplace change is needed to normalise and support women reaching the top, one company chief executive has said. Louise O'Shea of Confused.com said she was lucky to work somewhere that nurtured her and where she could help women - but this was rare. She spoke as a report said the number of women in management or directors in Wales was ""stubbornly"" staying at 39%. The Welsh government said its advancing gender equality plan set out action in areas such as education. When Ms O'Shea, from Cardiff, announced to a group of female colleagues at the price comparison website that she applied to be chief executive officer at eight months pregnant, she said the whole room cheered. Pay gap between men and women fails to improve Are men-dominated offices the future of the workplace? Can my employer ask me to wear make-up and heels? This environment, she said, allowed women to grow, but it was unusual compared to some ""toxic workplaces"". Louise O'Shea went on maternity leave just before being promoted from finance director to CEO at Confused.com She said many felt intimidated walking into all-male management and culture needed to change across the board. She said: ""I still experience barriers. It is not as if when you become a CEO you are no longer singled out as a women."" She said she had been verbally abused in person and on social media, ""more than a man would have been"", adding to fears women may have about leadership roles requiring ""personal sacrifice"". But she said policies such as bereavement leave for miscarriages, appropriate maternity and paternity policies and normalising family life in the office could help ""change the culture"" for women. She believed it also helped women outside the organisation as better paternity leave for men could mean their partners were better supported. This video can not be played Last year, Louise O'Shea of Confused.com shared her CEO secrets She said the pandemic had some positive changes, such as hybrid working providing flexibility ""that allows working parents to be more present for their children"". But she argued that the school curriculum needed to be widened to help girls at a younger age, including particularly ""male dominated subjects"" such as technology and coding. She said it would be a ""20-year shift"" but could be a ""great opportunity to really make a dent"" in the pay gap and would be a flexible skill women can use elsewhere. ""I would say there's a huge investment required in that skill set because that for me it is critical for us to have for thelevelling up agendafundamentally, not just between Wales and the rest of the world but between men and women,"" she said. This video can not be played Channelle Taylor was working six days a week but cut this to two to look after her daughter The annual State of the Nation report by charity Chwarae Teg also found 72% of working mothers in the UK worked fewer hours and cut their earnings due to a lack of childcare during the first lockdown. Chanelle Taylor, who owns Lady Paint and Decor Company in Caerphilly, had to drop from six to two days a week to look after her seven-year-old daughter when schools closed. Chanelle's husband, an energy production engineer for a company in Liverpool, is classed as an essential worker, and continued to travel away to work throughout lockdown. She said: ""It was pretty stressful purely because I felt like I wasn't doing enough. ""A job that was meant to be done within 10 days took me more like three weeks because I only worked two days a week. ""As a mum, we're kind of expected to be there for our children a little bit more, where dads can go to work. It was very difficult as it is natural for the mum to be expected to do everything."" Cerys Furlong, chief executive at Chwarae Teg, said while there had been progress, the pace of change was ""far too slow"". ""While action is needed in a number of areas we know that two issues remain absolutely critical if we want to secure a gender equal Wales - childcare and unpaid work and sexual harassment, abuse and violence."" She said there was an ""over-reliance on women to provide care and unpaid work"" and a lack of affordable childcare meant women often fell behind. Ms Furlong said high-profile cases of violence against women such asWenjing Lin,Sarah EverardandAshling Murphy""shone a light on the endemic and unacceptable misogyny and violence that women continue to face"". ""In a Wales that says all the right things about gender equality and the progress we want to see, the lack of progress highlighted in our report is deeply disappointing,"" she added. ""We clearly need to do things differently, faster and with more commitment. ""That is why we need government, business and civil society to act now to ensure that all women achieve and prosper in Wales."" The Welsh government said it was working with organisations to develop how digital and computing subjects were taught in schools, with ""particular focus on improving gender equality"" in science, technology, engineering and maths. It added: ""Theadvancing gender equality in Wales plan,externalsets out our ambition to achieve gender equality in Wales. ""The plan outlines a range of actions to achieve this ambition including commitments relating to education, employability and improving representation in leadership roles.""

"Lord Bilimoria said this is not the time to pile tax rises onto business. The founder of beer brand Cobra has said prices will have to rise because of a ""vicious cycle"" of cost pressures. Lord Bilimoria told the BBC that ""virtually every business in every sector"" is being squeezed by inflation, interest rate rises and tax increases. The Cobra chairman, who is also president of the CBI employers' group, said the picture had become really challenging for firms and consumers. On Sunday, Tesco's chairman warned the worst on price rises is yet to come. John Allan told the BBC he expected food price inflation to reach 5% by the spring, hitting the ""hardest-up harder"". The warnings from two of Britain's most prominent executives come as UK inflation stands at a 30-year high of 5.4%, and it is forecast to top 7% by April. Meanwhile, the cost of energy is set to soar under new price-cap rules, prompting the chancellor to unveil a support package for households last week. Lord Bilimoria told BBC 5 Live's Wake up to Money programme: ""Our input costs in every way - bottling, energy - are up. Freight costs have soared, sometimes ten-times. Wages are increasing and on top of that there are labour shortages. ""It does mean that businesses have to put up prices. But the consumer is already feeling the squeeze. It is a really challenging situation for everyone,"" he said. Worst to come for food price rises - Tesco Why are prices rising so quickly? He declined to say have much bottles of beer would increase, but said price rises ""were a necessity. There's no running away from that."" Lord Bilimoria repeated his opposition to planned tax rises in April. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has come under pressure to scrap a planned increase in National Insurance, but has vowed the rise will go ahead. ""This is completely the wrong time to do this,"" Lord Bilimoria said. ""It will stifle investment. It will stifle growth"". His warning about the impact of inflation was echoed by the head of the British Retail Consortium (BRC), Helen Dickinson. ""At every business I am talking to, and across lots of other industries, the picture is very similar,"" she told the BBC. ""In retail, we've got a multiple list of things that are pushing up costs which they are now needing to pass on to customers."" A BRC report earlier this month said food inflation had accelerated to 2.7% in January, up from 2.4% in December. Fury after Bank boss says don't ask for big pay rise Jack Monroe hails inflation-measure shake-up A report on Monday set out some of the impact of rising costs, with more people struggling to feed themselves. The Food Foundation said 8.8% of UK households - 4.7 million adults - had experienced food insecurity in the past month. This has increased from 7.3% in July 2021. The foundation, a think-tank that pushes for better food production, diets, and government policy, said food insecurity refers to disrupted eating, such as skipping a meal, due to lack of money. The report said people on Universal Credit were five times more likely to have experienced food insecurity the past six months. It added that food security should be made part of the government's levelling up agenda. ""Food insecurity is a vital measure if we are to monitor severe material deprivation,"" said Anna Taylor, executive director of The Food Foundation. ""It contributes not only to health inequalities and life expectancy, but also social wellbeing."" Worst to come for food price rises - Tesco Why are prices rising in the UK?

"New ""tough targets"" will be set to tackle record NHS waiting lists in England, Boris Johnson has said. The PM promised action after plans to tackle the backlog of people waiting for treatment were delayed. It had been expected to be published on Monday but Mr Johnson said more details would be set out later this week. Earlier,Health Secretary Sajid Javid denied reports the Treasury had blocked the announcement, blaming the Omicron wave for the delay. He told BBC Breakfast the plans were due to be released in early December but the emergence of the more transmissible coronavirus variant meant the focus shifted to the booster programme. 'I went to Sri Lanka for my operation' 'I had to give up work over operation wait' Is this NHS crisis really worse than ones before? Birmingham hospital office space turned into wards During a visit to a hospital in Kent, Mr Johnson said: ""We're now working with the NHS to set some tough targets so that we are able to deliver for patients and also for the taxpayer."" He pointed out more money is being invested and extra staff recruited. The prime minister denied the Treasury had been concerned the targets were not tough enough, saying the department was ""working together in harmony"" with Downing Street. Pressed on whether he had doubts about the chancellor's loyalty to his leadership, Mr Johnson said: ""Absolutely not."" Louise McAllan, from Essex, has stage four lung and bone cancer and had an operation and chemotherapy cancelled because of the pandemic. She was diagnosed in February 2020 but said she did not receive any treatment for eight months. ""It was so devastating I was literally lost for words,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""It was just so unbelievable that they were allowing me to die because of Covid."" Louise was previously diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013 and said her treatment then was much quicker, with tests taking place within two weeks and chemotherapy starting shortly after. ""It does make me angryâ¦ they've put people's lives in jeopardy,"" she said. ""I'm not saying Covid isn't serious because it is. But cancer, heart disease, they don't go away - they get worse."" The waiting list for hospital treatment in England hit a record six million in November- a rise of nearly 50% since the pandemic started. More than 300,000 patients have been waiting more than a year for treatment after the suspension of routine surgery during certain parts of the pandemic, adding to pressures which were already clear before it began. Mr Johnson warned that waiting lists would increase before they started to fall. Ministers are encouraging those who stayed away from the NHS during the pandemic to come forward for treatment.

That target was originally due to have come in last year, but had been delayed because of the pandemic. He also said that by March next year, no-one would wait longer than two months to find out if they have cancer. But that target already exists - and is not for diagnosis, but for treatment within two months. It is understood the commitment was for the NHS to return to pre-pandemic performance by March next year. With Covid in retreat - at least in terms of serious illness and pressure on the NHS - the challenge facing the government is how to get the core services back on track. Whether it is cancer or hospital treatments, the pandemic has had a huge impact. Waiting times have got worse across the board. For hospital treatments ministers need to find a way to increase capacity - the NHS is still doing fewer treatments than it was before the pandemic began. Tough new targets on their own will not be enough without the staff needed to see patients. Much the same is true for cancer - but it is further complicated by the missing cases. The number of diagnoses are down by 34,000 since the pandemic started. Getting those people to come forward for checks and ensuring they get them quickly when they do is essential. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Downing Street was ""embroiled"" in allegations about lockdown parties and ""the price is the government not getting on with the job"". ""When we need a plan we haven't got one from the government and many people on waiting lists will be really dismayed,"" he said. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents the healthcare system, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the delay was ""frustrating"" as the plan had already been agreed with NHS leaders who ""want to get on with the work"". However, with an unknown number of people not included in waiting list figures because they did not come forward for treatment during the pandemic, he warned that ""unrealistic"" targets could end up ""skewing clinical priorities"". Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health trusts, said the parts of the plan being held up included measures to free up clinician time, support for trusts working together, use of the independent sector and how funding would be allocated. Earlier, the government announced a new online platform called My Planned Care, which will allow people needing non-urgent surgery to get information about waiting times. The platform, which will be launched later this month, will also offer advice on prevention services, such as how to stop smoking and exercise plans, to make sure people are fit for surgery.

"New ""tough targets"" will be set to tackle record NHS waiting lists in England, Boris Johnson has said. The PM promised action after plans to tackle the backlog of people waiting for treatment were delayed. It had been expected to be published on Monday but Mr Johnson said more details would be set out later this week. Earlier,Health Secretary Sajid Javid denied reports the Treasury had blocked the announcement, blaming the Omicron wave for the delay. He told BBC Breakfast the plans were due to be released in early December but the emergence of the more transmissible coronavirus variant meant the focus shifted to the booster programme. 'I went to Sri Lanka for my operation' 'I had to give up work over operation wait' Is this NHS crisis really worse than ones before? Birmingham hospital office space turned into wards During a visit to a hospital in Kent, Mr Johnson said: ""We're now working with the NHS to set some tough targets so that we are able to deliver for patients and also for the taxpayer."" He pointed out more money is being invested and extra staff recruited. The prime minister denied the Treasury had been concerned the targets were not tough enough, saying the department was ""working together in harmony"" with Downing Street. Pressed on whether he had doubts about the chancellor's loyalty to his leadership, Mr Johnson said: ""Absolutely not."" Louise McAllan, from Essex, has stage four lung and bone cancer and had an operation and chemotherapy cancelled because of the pandemic. She was diagnosed in February 2020 but said she did not receive any treatment for eight months. ""It was so devastating I was literally lost for words,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""It was just so unbelievable that they were allowing me to die because of Covid."" Louise was previously diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013 and said her treatment then was much quicker, with tests taking place within two weeks and chemotherapy starting shortly after. ""It does make me angryâ¦ they've put people's lives in jeopardy,"" she said. ""I'm not saying Covid isn't serious because it is. But cancer, heart disease, they don't go away - they get worse."" The waiting list for hospital treatment in England hit a record six million in November- a rise of nearly 50% since the pandemic started. More than 300,000 patients have been waiting more than a year for treatment after the suspension of routine surgery during certain parts of the pandemic, adding to pressures which were already clear before it began. Mr Johnson warned that waiting lists would increase before they started to fall. Ministers are encouraging those who stayed away from the NHS during the pandemic to come forward for treatment.

This data shows the proportion of ambulance patients who waited 30 minutes or more, in the week shown. It comes from daily situation reports which are published weekly during the winter in England. As this is fast-turnaround data, the NHS says only minimal validation can be carried out but it is considered fit for purpose. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do not publish ambulance queue data. Patients at A&E should be seen within four hours of arrival. This data shows the proportion of patients attending A&E who waited longer than four hours to be treated, discharged or admitted. This data is published monthly for England and Wales and weekly for Scotland. Northern Ireland publishes its data quarterly and Winter 2021 is not yet available. If a patient at A&E needs to be admitted, the wait from decision to admit to being given a bed on a ward is recorded in England. The bed waits figure is the proportion of patients admitted via A&E who waited longer than four hours for a ward bed. In Wales, bed wait data is not published, so the figure shown is the occupancy level in general and acute beds. Scotland and Northern Ireland do not publish bed wait or bed occupancy data.

That target was originally due to have come in last year, but had been delayed because of the pandemic. He also said that by March next year, no-one would wait longer than two months to find out if they have cancer. But that target already exists - and is not for diagnosis, but for treatment within two months. It is understood the commitment was for the NHS to return to pre-pandemic performance by March next year. With Covid in retreat - at least in terms of serious illness and pressure on the NHS - the challenge facing the government is how to get the core services back on track. Whether it is cancer or hospital treatments, the pandemic has had a huge impact. Waiting times have got worse across the board. For hospital treatments ministers need to find a way to increase capacity - the NHS is still doing fewer treatments than it was before the pandemic began. Tough new targets on their own will not be enough without the staff needed to see patients. Much the same is true for cancer - but it is further complicated by the missing cases. The number of diagnoses are down by 34,000 since the pandemic started. Getting those people to come forward for checks and ensuring they get them quickly when they do is essential. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Downing Street was ""embroiled"" in allegations about lockdown parties and ""the price is the government not getting on with the job"". ""When we need a plan we haven't got one from the government and many people on waiting lists will be really dismayed,"" he said. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents the healthcare system, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the delay was ""frustrating"" as the plan had already been agreed with NHS leaders who ""want to get on with the work"". However, with an unknown number of people not included in waiting list figures because they did not come forward for treatment during the pandemic, he warned that ""unrealistic"" targets could end up ""skewing clinical priorities"". Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health trusts, said the parts of the plan being held up included measures to free up clinician time, support for trusts working together, use of the independent sector and how funding would be allocated. Earlier, the government announced a new online platform called My Planned Care, which will allow people needing non-urgent surgery to get information about waiting times. The platform, which will be launched later this month, will also offer advice on prevention services, such as how to stop smoking and exercise plans, to make sure people are fit for surgery.

"Daniel Ek said ""cancelling voices is a slippery slope"". Spotify boss Daniel Ek has said that although he ""strongly"" condemns racial slurs and other comments made by US podcast host Joe Rogan, he is not removing him from the platform. Ek's comments were made in a letter sent to staff, which has been seen by Reuters andHollywood Reporter,external. It followsRogan's apology over the weekendfor his past use of racist language on his popular podcast. Ek said it was Rogan's decision to remove a number of past episodes. It followed discussions with the music streaming platform, along with Rogan's own reflections on some of the content in The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, including the use of racially insensitive language. This video can not be played Ros Atkins looks at the controversy surrounding the US podcast presenter Joe Rogan and his Spotify show Rogan apologised after a widely-shared compilation video showed him repeatedly using the N-word in early episodes of his show, which has been running for over a decade. The 54-year offered his ""deepest"" apologies and called his past use of the slur ""shameful"". He also said sorry for making a racist comment about visiting a predominantly black neighbourhood, saying he ""felt sick"" watching the compilation, and wished he could take his comments back. Ek, who is chief executive officer and co-found of Spotify, said: ""While I strongly condemn what Joe has said... I want to make one point very clear - I do not believe that silencing Joe is the answer."" He believes Spotify should have clear boundaries around the content being published, saying: ""We should have clear lines around content and take action when they are crossed, but cancelling voices is a slippery slope,"" according to Hollywood Reporter, which has published the letter in full. Spotify will also commit $100m (Â£74m) for the licensing, development, and marketing of music and audio content from historically marginalised groups, according to Ek's letter. He said this is aimed at elevating ""all types of creators"". Several artists including Neil Young and Joni Mitchellrecently quit Spotifyin protest at what they allege is Rogan's role in spreading coronavirus misinformation. On the show, the US broadcaster hosts a wide variety of guests who discuss their views on a range of topics - but some episodes have featured false and misleading claims. Much of the controversy regards two recent episodes of Rogan's podcast, which featured the cardiologist Dr Peter McCullough and immunologist/virologist Dr Robert Malone. Both expressed views that were contrary to the information provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Rogan denied trying to spread misinformation, saying he had ""never tried to do anything with this podcast other than just talk to people"". But he also admitted ""absolutely I get things wrong"", and backed Spotify's plan to put a disclaimer at the start of controversial episodes. Four claims from Joe Rogan's podcast fact-checked A week ago Rogan pledged to try harder to offer more balanced views on his podcast, following the criticism. Spotify is thought to have paid more than $100m (Â£74m) for exclusive rights to the podcast in 2020.

"What would get you out of your car? Tricky when you think most journeys in Scotland are made by car, according to Scottish Transport Statistics 2020. But the Scottish government plans to slash car journey distances by 20% by 2030. It's to tackle climate change. Because domestic transport, including car travel, makes up Scotland's biggest chunk of emissions. The plans are in a""route map"",external. So what do you think? What do you want? I've been to southern Scotland to ask just that. And among the ideas and suggestions are win-win solutions, for both people and planet. Improving access to cycling is part of the government proposal. So I've met up with Aneela McKenna. As we cycle the path in Galashiels, she explains it's great that action on climate change is being taken, but people can't be left behind. She describes herself as a diversity campaigner for cycling, working with a number of cycle groups including women, refugees, people of colour and young girls. Aneela McKenna, left, cycles this route regularly but feels unsafe using it when it is dark And she explains one of the barriers to cycling is around safety, which for her is crucial to address to get people out of their cars and on their bikes. Better accessibility and signage too on paths. She says: ""If you look around you and at the surroundings, this path is very narrow, and you can see that there's no lighting. And for me as a woman and a woman of colour, I don't feel safe to use the path when it's dark, and it's at nightâ¦ ""What would make me feel safe is some lighting, some lighting would be fantastic. I'd love to see the path widened as well. So, when you're passing people, again, you feel safe, comfortable. ""And even if you just look at actually brightening up the environment itself, it might bring the communities here."" It's not just cycling -  the Scottish government plans also include investment in bus and train travel. On Biggar high street I met a group of public transport campaigners. These campaigners in Biggar believe much still needs to be done to make alternatives to the car attractive ""Having the ability to travel easily? It's going to be a massive win for anyone that's not able to travel and especially young people who can't or who don't know how to drive yet and don't want to be inconveniencing their parents all the time,"" 17-year-old school student Jake explains to me. For people - such as him and his peers - who are aged under 22, the provision of nationwide free bus travel is part of the plan to get us out of our cars. But Jake doesn't think it solves the whole problem. He says: ""I think it's about regularity to make the buses usableâ¦ a minimum really every hourâ¦ In citiesâ¦ if buses are cancelled or aren't turning up, you've got another one in 20 minutes, if not sooner. Whereas somewhere rural like this, if you're missing a bus that's you having to wait around for a long amount of time."" Improving online services so we don't have to travel so much and having neighbourhoods where your everyday needs are met locally within a 20-minute walk, wheel or cycle from home are also in the proposals. But for Jen Crighton, a mum-of-four, it's all very well if you're in town, but what if you live rurally? ""My ideal scenario, most recently would have been if I had managed to get social housing within Biggar,"" she says. ""I was quite prepared to give my car up at that point because there's better links in Biggar itselfâ¦ Where I live just now my car is an essential. ""So most of my remaining budget, anything at the end of the month has to go on my car and making sure that my car stays on the road. It's not only just school and social aspects, it's medical."" Another part of the action plan is to invest in more active travel routes that are safe to use and accessible. And that includes walking. Thelma Ingram tells me she stopped driving seven years ago because of increasing sight loss. She wants this move for the environment to also work for her and others in similar positions. She says improving accessibility to public transport and walkways would give her more independence. ""I have severe difficulties moving about certain environments here and in Biggar and will have in other towns because we do not have good pavements or crossings,"" she says. ""I would like things to be designed for people who are disabled rather than us being an after-thought which we very often are."" At the moment, to get to hospital appointments, it would take her four hours by public transport there and back, she explains. She puts this down to poor connections. So design for her, from timetabling to vehicles, is crucial. ""I'm a great fan of Edinburgh tram,"" she says. ""And the reason is it's the most easy piece of transport to use. It's level accessâ¦ there are announcements, it's very clear where I'm going. And it is possible to get somewhere very quickly. ""And I think that kind of model needs to be thought about not necessarily a tram, but just basically designing things so that the passenger is accounted for and not just shoved about, as if they were a piece of luggage."" The Scottish government says the ""route map"" contains more than 30 interventions which cover many of the opinions covered, including active travel, accessibility, public transport and 20-minute neighbourhoods. The option to have a say on cutting car travel and climate change is in place until 6 April.

"Police keep a watchful eye on protesters in Ottawa on Sunday The mayor of Canada's capital, Ottawa, has declared a state of emergency in response to more than a week of truckers' protests against Covid restrictions. Jim Watson said the city was ""losing this battle"" and ""completely out of control"". He added the protests posed a threat to residents' safety. There have also been reports of racial attacks. Ottawa's centre has been paralysed, with vehicles and tents blocking roads. The ""Freedom Convoy"" was sparked by the introduction last month of a new rule that all truckers must be vaccinated to cross the US-Canada border, but the protests have morphed into broader challenges to Covid health restrictions. The protesters have since gathered in central Ottawa near Parliament Hill, and their demands have grown to include ending all such mandates nationwide and opposing the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The truckers shutting down Canada's capital How do we know coronavirus vaccines are safe? Which treatments work best against Covid? Speaking to Canadian radio station CFRA, Mr Watson said the protesters were behaving increasingly ""insensitively"" by continuously ""blaring horns and sirens, [setting off] fireworks and turning it into a party"". ""Clearly, we are outnumbered and we are losing this battle,"" he said, adding: ""This has to be reversed - we have to get our city back."" The mayor did not give specific details about what measures he might impose, but police said on Sunday that they would step up enforcement, including possible arrests of those seeking to aid the protesters by bringing them supplies like fuel, toilet paper and food. A state of emergency will give the city additional powers, including access to equipment required by frontline workers and emergency services. This video can not be played The protests began as a movement against vaccination requirements Many Ottawa residents have objected to the demonstrations. Complaints range from idling trucks that impede traffic and makeshift wooden structures in city parks to lost income and fears of harassment and even violence. Police have said they are concerned about how the convoy has attracted far-right and extremist elements, and on Sunday confirmed they were dealing withmore than 60 criminal investigations,external, with alleged offences including ""mischief, thefts, hate crimes and property damage"". ""There have been racist signs, there have been a lot of reports of people being assaulted and harassed if they wear a mask,"" Stephanie Carvon, Ottawa resident and former national security analyst for the Canadian government told the BBC. She added that some organisers of the protest held extremist views, but had ""successfully framed their actions in the name of the pandemic and ending the mandates, so they've earned the sympathy of a lot of Canadians who may not necessarily realise where this has come from"". One demonstrator who drove for hours to join the protest in Ottawa, Kimberly Ball, told the AFP news agency that the protest was ""about our freedom"". ""A couple of people we know, friends, lost their jobs because of these mandates,"" she said, adding she had concerns about the safety and effectiveness of Covid vaccines. Covid-19 vaccines have cut the risk of severe illness in those infected with the virus and serious side effects are extremely rare. More than 80% of the eligible population is fully vaccinated anda recent poll showed a majority of Canadians favoured imposing more restrictions on the unvaccinated.,external A recent opinion poll by Abacus Data suggested 68% of Canadians felt they had ""very little in common"" with the protesters, while 32% said they ""had a lot in common"" with the truckers. By Rachel Schraer, BBC health and disinformation reporter It's a pattern we've seen repeated through the pandemic. Protests frequently bring people together around points of legitimate political debate - how tough or long Covid restrictions should be or whether vaccination should be mandatory. Scratch the surface, though, and you can quickly find more extreme views and misinformation like that shared by the convoy's organisers. Videos from 2019 show organiser Pat King discussing a plot for a ""depopulation of the Caucasian raceâ¦ the ones with the strongest bloodlines"". Meanwhile, online groups with tens of thousands of followers shared posts criticising the police's handling of the convoy alongside false claims the Covid vaccine was ""poison"" and a fake report that New Zealand was planning to introduce the vaccine to its water supply. People joining groups in sympathy with truckers' stated grievances, for example against vaccine mandates, can quickly find themselves exposed to these more fringe or misleading sources of information.

"Boris Johnson is set to make further changes to his Downing Street team this week as he seeks to ease concerns of MPs who are wavering about his future. The shake-up comes amid the fallout fromthe initial findings of the Sue Gray reportinto events at No 10 while Covid restrictions were in place. Several Tory backbenchers have called for Mr Johnson to resign and have submitted letters of no confidence. The PM has promised his MPs there would be a change in how No 10 operates. Asked if he had confidence in the prime minister, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said ""absolutely, 100%"" adding that ""despite the challenges, and of course there are many, this prime minister is delivering"". But Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, Jon Ashworth, said the government was ""in utter chaos"", with Mr Johnson ""more focused on saving his own skin because of the scandals and rule breaking he's been involved in"". Give PM time and space to deliver, says Kwarteng I am target of brutal campaign - Carrie Johnson The Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held On Saturday Mr Johnsonannounced two senior appointmentsto his backroom staff following a string of resignations last week. Cabinet Office minister and Tory MP Steve Barclay is taking over as his chief of staff, while former Johnson aide Guto Harri has started as director of communications. Mr Harri was spotted arriving at No 10 on Monday morning, and asked by reporters what his first task of the day would be, he said he would ""give healthy snacks and mineral waters to staff"", waving a shopping bag at the cameras. There are expected to be new staff appointments, and some ministers will share some of the existing responsibilities of Mr Barclay, who retains his ministerial position. At least one current adviser - Henry Newman - will be moved out of No 10 and into a new role in government. The prime minister is also thought to be looking to appoint a new chief whip - the person in charge of party discipline - and he is understood to have held discussions with senior figures to try to persuade them to take up the post. Senior backbencher Tom Tugendhat, who has said he would run in any contest for the leadership, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the party should wait and see how the changes panned out before making any decisions on Mr Johnson's future. ""This is a decision clearly for 360 or so members of Parliament and let's see where it goes to, but I think the point remains that we've got to be looking at the future,"" he added. ""This is a time when we need to be really focused on what politics is actually here for, and that's helping others and not getting into some sort of personal psychodrama."" But former senior civil servant Jill Rutter said it was ""unclear"" how Mr Barclay's appointment would work in practice, as his three roles may pull him in different directions. Writing for the Times Red Box, she said: ""It's possible that the prime minister has thought this all through in a huge amount of detail and is clear how all these relationships will function. ""Alternatively, it's a panicky stopgap pulled together at short notice to get through the weekend, with no real thought about whether it will make a dysfunctional operation more confused."" Mr Johnson, who spent the weekend at his country retreat, Chequers, called some of his colleagues over the weekend to try to persuade them of the significance of his changes. This video can not be played Watch: A dizzying week for the PM explained in 60 seconds He has faced a turbulent few weeks amid allegations of parties at Downing Street, the Metropolitan Police announcing an investigation into 12 of those and criticism aftermaking a false claim that Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy Savile. The latter led No 10 policy chief Munira Mirza to resign, while four other aides - including his chief of staff and private secretary - also resigned last week. Her replacement in the policy unit, Tory MP Andrew Griffith, has written a piece for theConservative Home website,external, outlining his priorities, including tackling the NHS backlog and dealing with the cost of living crisis. He added: ""So long as [the public] see that we are focussing on them and their needs rather than fighting amongst ourselves, I believe that they will continue to place their trust in us. ""It is time for we Conservatives to unite, to support the prime minister and to get on with the job."" But several Conservative MPs have handed in letters of no confidence in the PM,including former minister Nick Gibb, with 54 needed to trigger a vote on his leadership. It comes as Mr Johnson's wife, Carrie, has said she isthe target of a ""brutal briefing campaign"" by his enemies, after a book alleged she influences the prime minister's decision-making.

"Kirsty says she has found coping mechanisms, but would still like a cure for tinnitus The UK urgently needs abiobank library of human tissue,externalsamples so experts can study and find better treatments, or a cure, for ""ringing in the ears"", says the British Tinnitus Association (BTA). More than seven million adults in the UK are thought to have tinnitus. This stressful and upsetting condition of hearing whooshing, buzzing or other intensely annoying sounds with no external source is poorly understood. For some, it becomes difficult or impossible to lead a normal life. A survey by the charity, carried out in November with 2,600 people with tinnitus, suggests almost one in 10 living with the condition has experienced thoughts about suicide or self-harm in the past two years. One in three thought about their condition every hour - causing them anxiety and sadness. Kirsty Stewart, from Hampshire, was 28 when she developed tinnitus. ""At first, it sounded like a lawn-mower. I thought maybe a neighbour was doing their lawn, but they weren't. It was really bizarre."" Kirsty tried to ignore it, but the sound was persistent and then it changed to something even more distressing for her. ""It became a loud piercing ringing noise. It was so bad and loud that I couldn't escape it. It was constant. It was like torture."" She says it took a massive toll on her wellbeing. ""It sent my whole life crashing in. I stopped eating, seeing friends and family, and I didn't feel able to work because I couldn't concentrate. ""It got so bad that I spoke to my mum about not wanting to be here any more. I was so desperate."" The BTA says other people with tinnitus share similar experiences of feeling isolated, debilitated and stressed. It has published the survey findings in a new report. As one of the respondents confided: ""You don't like telling people, because you think that they will think you are crazy. And you don't want to bring people down with you when you are down and stressed with the noise 24/7."" Another said: ""It has made me feel that large parts of my life were stolen from me. ""From my ability to go to concerts or to enjoy music ever again, to having to give up my daily and nightly meditation practice to being fearful of any and all loud noises."" Kirsty saw a doctor who referred her to a specialist experienced with managing tinnitus. She says she has found ways to cope with the noises she still hears in both ears. Kirsty says counselling and reflexology have helped her adjust. Malcolm Hilton, an ear, nose and throat expert at University of Exeter's Medical School, says a national biobank for tinnitus would be massively beneficial, and might reveal better ways for managing the condition. ""There are many treatments available for tinnitus and it is disappointing that people still come away with the message that they have to 'learn to live with it' without support. The main issue is that there is usually no 'quick fix' and different treatment approaches are needed for different people,"" he said. Head of the BTA, David Stockdale, said: ""We know that developing cures for any condition takes time and so we need to make headway in tinnitus research."" The charity hasinformation, tips and support,externalfor people affected by tinnitus. Things you can try to help cope include: relaxation and meditation playing background sound or music as a distraction finding ways to improve your sleep such as sticking to a bedtime routine, or cutting down on caffeine joining a support group Covid tinnitus increase 'will be catastrophic' Video, 00:02:26Covid tinnitus increase 'will be catastrophic' BBC Two - What can I do about tinnitus?

"The NHS in Scotland reached crisis point because of a ""complete lack of planning"" during the pandemic, opposition politicians have said. Waiting times in A&E are the highest on record,while GPs have warned of unprecedented staff shortages. The Scottish Conservatives and Labour have also claimed that dentists ""are on the brink of mass exodus"". The Scottish government insists the NHS ""has come through the worst"" crisis in its history. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf has also announced Â£82.6m of funding to improve services for patients at GP practices. However, the SNP government has been accused of ""knee-jerk reaction-making"" which has damaged the economy and people's mental health. It comes asthe UK government has also faced criticismas plans to tackle the backlog of patients on hospital waiting lists in England have been delayed. Scottish Labour's health spokesperson Jackie Baillie told the BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that workforce shortages ""haven't been addressed for years"" and the service remains under acute pressure. She said: ""What we have seen is waiting lists getting longer, cancelled operations up and real challenges for people. ""One in nine of the population of Scotland is stuck on a waiting list and there is no sign of catch-up or recovery. ""So whilst we would all want the NHS to keep people safe - and the staff work incredibly hard - remobilising the NHS has to be a key priority. At the moment, that simply isn't happening."" NHS Scotland's 'biggest crisis' in five charts Scottish A&E waiting times worst on record 'Lives being lost' due to ambulance waiting times Plan to tackle England's NHS backlog delayed Dr Sandesh Gulhane, the Scottish Tory health spokesman, told the programme that ambulance waiting times -in some cases up to eight hours- were also a symptom of inaction from the Scottish government. He added: ""What this all points to is no planning, knee-jerk reaction making then not following through. ""At the height of the pandemic, we needed to do things to protect the public and protect our global health. But it has come at a cost. ""We have to understand we were saving lives, but it was coming with unintended consequences of mental health breakdown and also our economy not doing as well. ""As the pandemic progressed, it was quite clear that decisions were being made badly. ""We were very quick to restrict but are very slow here in Scotland to relax and people are beginning to feel the mental health strain of what's going on. ""This isn't all pandemic-made - we have a complete lack of job planning for doctors and nurses."" Dentists are having to deal with a huge backlog of patients Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said the NHS in Scotland had suffered its most intense period ever at the end of December and the beginning of January. But he insisted everything was being done to ensure patients were ""not being left behind"" as hospitals continued to deal with Covid and non-Covid patients. He said: ""While we are through the worst of it, we should also say that there is still significant pressure on the health service. ""That comes from the continued number of patients who are in hospital with Covid. ""It also comes from the accumulative impact of almost two years of a pandemic and having to catch up with a significant backlog."" Mr Yousaf announced the new Â£82.6m of funding for GP practices across the country during a visit to the Dunblane Health Centre. He said it would enable: pharmacy support for repeat prescriptions and medication reviews nursing support for routine tests and wound treatment access to physiotherapy services The health secretary said: ""We have now delivered every penny we committed to health boards and GPs as part of our ongoing commitment to help support practices deliver care. ""The NHS is facing the biggest challenge this winter and this investment will have real benefits for both patients and frontline staff."" Meanwhile, Scottish Labour claimed dental care could become ""the privilege of people who can afford to go private"" unless emergency funding for NHS treatment is ramped up. Practices across Scotland are still operating with full Covid infection controls while dealing with a case backlog. Jackie Baillie said the government must retain emergency NHS payments after 1 April and do more to tackle the problems facing dentistry. She said: ""Dental care is seeing 850,00 fewer patients - a lot of them from deprived communities. ""We would keep the emergency support in place beyond April so they can continue to remobilise. ""There should also be a review of the funding model, which is almost as old as the NHS itself. ""And fund things like outcomes and reward prevention, because dental care cannot become the privilege of the few who can afford to go private. ""The Scottish government needs to tackle the crisis facing dentistry and that's one way of doing so."" The Scottish government said it had invested an additional Â£50m in NHS dental care during the pandemic, while Â£20m had been allocated this month alone to deal with a backlog in children's treatment.

The 17-year-old was among 12 jumpers to advance to Tuesday's final - but compatriot Katie Summerhayes agonisingly missed out in 13th, while James Woods was also eliminated from the men's competition. ""I was really happy to land my first jump, as I had crashed during practice a bit,"" Muir said after scoring 89.25 - the second highest individual tally in qualifying.

Speed skating and short track Simon GleaveHead of sports analysis, Nielsen Gracenote Both Ireen Wust and Ariana
Fontana have moved up the all-time Winter Olympic medal table today, winning
their 12th and 11th medals respectively. Most medals at Winter Olympics: 15 - Marit Bjorgen in cross-country skiing 13 - Ole Einar Bjorndalen in biathlon 12 - Ireen Wustin speed skating 12 - Bjorn DÃ¦hlie in cross-country skiing 10 - Arianna Fontana in

cross-country skiing Now then, Canada's Max Parrot took the Olympic snowboard slopestyle gold with the ""best run of his life"" earlier. It comes three years after the 27-year-old was diagnosed with cancer but there was a huge whiff of controversy over thejudging of his second run,after he seemed to miss a key element of a jump. His second-run score of 90.96 landed him the title, with China's 17-year-old Su Yiming taking silver and Canadian Mark McMorris securing the bronze. ""This is a mistake on the judges' part,"" said BBC commentator Ed Leigh. Speed skating, women's 1500m While we are on the subject of speed skating....

It is a record-extending 12th Olympic speed skating medal for 35-year-old Wust, who is retiring next month.

I am disappointed more about what I have done for the team than myself. It is tough."" Dodds: ""Bruce said it all. We were in control for most of the game. I felt that was the best we played all week so I think it makes it even harder to take. ""We gave ourselves a chance at the end and that is all we could ask for.

"Private car parks will have to display prices more clearly, introduce a fairer system for appeals and give drivers a grace period for lateness as part of a government crackdown. Most fines in England, Scotland and Wales will be capped at Â£50 - down from Â£100 currently - although higher fines will remain for more serious breaches. Operators that do not follow the rules could be barred from collecting fines from motorists, the government said. The AA called the plans ""much needed"". Minister for Levelling Up Neil O'Brien said: ""Private firms issue roughly 22,000 parking tickets every day, often adopting a system of misleading and confusing signage, aggressive debt collection and unreasonable fees designed to extort money from motorists. ""[Our] new Code Of Practice will set out a clear vision with the interests of safe motorists at its heart, while cracking down on the worst offenders."" Under the proposals, the cap on parking fines in private car parks in England, Scotland and Wales will fall by 50% in most cases, benefiting millions, the government says. The plans do not apply to Northern Ireland. Higher fines of Â£70 and Â£100 will remain for serious breaches, such as parking in Blue Badge bays. Motorists will get a 50% discount if they pay within 14 days. The plans, which bring private parking firms more into line with the local authority system for publicly accessible car parks, will also mean that: Excessive debt collection fees for late tickets, which can be as high as Â£70, will be banned Parking firms will have to more clearly display pricing and terms and conditions Firms will have to give motorists a 10-minute grace period before they can issue a late fine They will need to introduce a 5-minute cooling-off period in which a motorist can change their mind about parking. The government also said it planned to make it easier for drivers to challenge their ticket if there are genuine mitigating circumstances. This could include having a valid ticket but failing to display it correctly, or keying in your number plate incorrectly by mistake at a parking machine. Philip Lovell, who faces up to Â£2,000 pounds in private parking charges, knows first hand the frustrations of the current system. He joined a gym in Manchester last year where he is entitled to use the car park for free, but for the first few months he didn't realise he was meant to enter his registration number at the machine and instead entered his postcode. He is now facing eight parking charge notices of Â£170 each, with the threat it could rise to Â£250 each. ""I tried to explain to them what happened but there just to seems to be a ruthless pursuit and inflexibility,"" he told the BBC. ""There's no one to speak to [on the phone], all I can do is write to them which I have done numerous times."" The number of private parking fines issued has jumped in recent years, climbing from around 1 million in 2010 to 8.4 million in 2019-20. RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said: ""The RAC has campaigned for years to end the sharp practices in the private parking sector, so we welcome the new national code that will usher in higher standards. ""This will undoubtedly make drivers' experience of using private car parks fairer while at the same time force rogue operators to clean up their acts once and for all."" AA president Edmund King said: ""For too long, those caught by private parking firms simply pay the charge to get rid of it. Thankfully these days are numbered."" He added: ""Drivers should feel confident that having a single Code of Practice and a new Appeals Charter will give them confidence to appeal and be properly heard."" The government said it had already taken action to tackle private parking firms, including banning wheel clamping and towing and stopping over-zealous parking enforcement by councils. Currently there are two parking trade associations, the British Parking Association (BPA) and the International Parking Community (IPC), each of which has a Code of Practice their members must abide by. However, the government says the lack of a single set of rules leaves motorists ""vulnerable to bad private parking practices such as deliberately poor signage and unfair parking fines"".

"Kirsty says she has found coping mechanisms, but would still like a cure for tinnitus The UK urgently needs abiobank library of human tissue,externalsamples so experts can study and find better treatments, or a cure, for ""ringing in the ears"", says the British Tinnitus Association (BTA). More than seven million adults in the UK are thought to have tinnitus. This stressful and upsetting condition of hearing whooshing, buzzing or other intensely annoying sounds with no external source is poorly understood. For some, it becomes difficult or impossible to lead a normal life. A survey by the charity, carried out in November with 2,600 people with tinnitus, suggests almost one in 10 living with the condition has experienced thoughts about suicide or self-harm in the past two years. One in three thought about their condition every hour - causing them anxiety and sadness. Kirsty Stewart, from Hampshire, was 28 when she developed tinnitus. ""At first, it sounded like a lawn-mower. I thought maybe a neighbour was doing their lawn, but they weren't. It was really bizarre."" Kirsty tried to ignore it, but the sound was persistent and then it changed to something even more distressing for her. ""It became a loud piercing ringing noise. It was so bad and loud that I couldn't escape it. It was constant. It was like torture."" She says it took a massive toll on her wellbeing. ""It sent my whole life crashing in. I stopped eating, seeing friends and family, and I didn't feel able to work because I couldn't concentrate. ""It got so bad that I spoke to my mum about not wanting to be here any more. I was so desperate."" The BTA says other people with tinnitus share similar experiences of feeling isolated, debilitated and stressed. It has published the survey findings in a new report. As one of the respondents confided: ""You don't like telling people, because you think that they will think you are crazy. And you don't want to bring people down with you when you are down and stressed with the noise 24/7."" Another said: ""It has made me feel that large parts of my life were stolen from me. ""From my ability to go to concerts or to enjoy music ever again, to having to give up my daily and nightly meditation practice to being fearful of any and all loud noises."" Kirsty saw a doctor who referred her to a specialist experienced with managing tinnitus. She says she has found ways to cope with the noises she still hears in both ears. Kirsty says counselling and reflexology have helped her adjust. Malcolm Hilton, an ear, nose and throat expert at University of Exeter's Medical School, says a national biobank for tinnitus would be massively beneficial, and might reveal better ways for managing the condition. ""There are many treatments available for tinnitus and it is disappointing that people still come away with the message that they have to 'learn to live with it' without support. The main issue is that there is usually no 'quick fix' and different treatment approaches are needed for different people,"" he said. Head of the BTA, David Stockdale, said: ""We know that developing cures for any condition takes time and so we need to make headway in tinnitus research."" The charity hasinformation, tips and support,externalfor people affected by tinnitus. Things you can try to help cope include: relaxation and meditation playing background sound or music as a distraction finding ways to improve your sleep such as sticking to a bedtime routine, or cutting down on caffeine joining a support group Covid tinnitus increase 'will be catastrophic' Video, 00:02:26Covid tinnitus increase 'will be catastrophic' BBC Two - What can I do about tinnitus?

"Jasmine is a full-time gamer and streamer from Leeds Female gamers who regularly get sexist abuse and rape threats online say more needs to be done to protect them. Women have shared their experiences of sexual harassment while gaming, as part of a report being submitted to MPs. The charity behind the report wants gaming companies to put more controls in place. Jasmine Jada, a full-time streamer from Leeds, says: ""I've had men talk to each other trying to guess what my body's like, guess what I'm wearing."" ""It's always worse when there's more than one,"" the 23-year-old tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""They think it's a bit of fun but they're making playing the game extremely uncomfortable."" Female gamers on rise in 'world capital of gaming' Nintendo condemns alleged abuse among its gamers Jasmine says the harassment women get from playing online multiplayer games with strangers ""has got to a point where girls don't want to have to speak in games anymore"". ""The chances of you getting some sort of sexist comment back when you haven't provoked them puts you off the game you were there to enjoy,"" she adds. Jasmine produces content from her home alongside her dog Bear Jasmine says ""nine out of 10 times"" the things people say to her online will be ""stereotypical sexist remarks, like about being in the kitchen"". ""There's no girl I know that hasn't experienced some sort of sexism or sexual harassment while playing an innocent game,"" she says. Jasmine, who has over 12,000 followers, says the worst games for abuse are shooter games like Call of Duty, Counter-Strike and Valorant. Call of Duty's makers Activision say they've already taken steps to make their game safer for users. Last yearthey banned over 350,000 accounts,externalfor toxic behaviour and created new software to detect offensive messages in chat boxes. Riot Games' Valorant has similar safety filters, and Valve Corporation's Counter-Strike allows users to kick a person out of a game. Jasmine says she often receives abuse whilst playing Call of Duty But Jasmine says a lot more needs to be done by developers to prevent abuse from happening. ""It would be nice to have a way of monitoring what people are actually saying so that if you were to report them for comments that were massively inappropriate it's not just a 'he said/she said',"" she says. ""If someone were to say something to me and I report it there's no evidence to back it up that they've done it."" The report being submitted to a cross-party group of MPs, created by the Young Gamers and Gamblers Education Trust (YGAM), features gamers who have had a similar experience to Jasmine. Mollie Barker, 21, is one of them. She says the ""normality of rape threats"" to young women in the gaming world ""can warp your sense of trust in men or male presenting people"". Mollie worries the fact that some male gamers have turned sexism ""into a joke"" could mean women and girls are deterred from reporting other abusive behaviour they encounter in life outside of gaming. The report includes data from marketing research company Bryter, which suggests 40% of female gamers have experienced abuse from male gamers while playing online multiplayer games and 28% have experienced sexual harassment from male or other gamers. YGAM makes three recommendations on what could be done to prevent sexual harassment in gaming: Inform parents on the behaviour young people could experience when involved in multiplayer games online Educate boys on rape culture and the impact of sexual discrimination Safeguard female gamers and create a safe environment for victims of harassment.

"Australia implemented some of the world's strictest border controls during the pandemic Australia has announced the reopening of its borders to vaccinated tourists and other visa holders for the first time in almost two years. ""If you're double vaccinated, we look forward to welcoming you back,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. The reopening, on 21 February, will be welcome news for many sectors including international education. Australia has had some of the world's strictest border controls throughout the coronavirus pandemic. In March 2020, the government closed the borders. It barred most foreigners from entering the country and put caps on total arrivals to help combat Covid. Some international students and skilled migrants have been permitted to enter the country since last December. The battle to open up 'Fortress Australia' Australia revisited - a country changed by Covid On Monday, Mr Morrison said those entering Australia when the borders fully reopened would need to provide proof of vaccination: ""That's the rule. Everyone is expected to abide by it,"" he said. Unvaccinated travellers who have a medical reason for not being jabbed will still need to apply for a travel exemption and, if successful, will be required to quarantine at a hotel. Melinda de Boer, 44, from Switzerland, told the BBC that she was finally planning to travel to Melbourne to see her mum, who had breast cancer last year. ""Her grandchildren haven't seen her for nearly three years. We are looking to go in the October or December holidays,"" she said. Ms De Boer said she was reluctant to book at the moment and was ""worried about the airlines and masses of people going"". This video can not be played Midnight rush for shops and pubs as Sydney reopens (October 2021) Since the start of the pandemic, Australia has implemented strict measures to help fight the spread of Covid infections - even banning its own people from leaving the country last year. Despite most of the country opening up, the state of Western Australia (WA) still has tight measures. It is currently closed to non-residents, including those from other Australian states, unless they have permission to enter. There had been plans to open WA's borders to interstate and international tourists this month, but that move was postponed indefinitely due to the Omicron variant. Australia has so far reported more than 2.7 million cases of coronavirus and more than 4,240 Covid-related deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Nearly 80% of the population is fully vaccinated. Are you planning to travel to Australia?  Share your stories by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"France won the 2018 World Cup in Russia The UK and Republic of Ireland football associations have agreed not to bid for the 2030 World Cup. They will instead focus on a joint bid to host Euro 2028. The decision comes after the UK government committedÂ£2.8m to a feasibility studyinto the bid. Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee chair Julian Knight had previously described the prospective World Cup bid as a""giant, expensive vanity project"". On Monday he said: ""It's unacceptable that Â£2.8m in taxpayer money was wasted on a pipe dream that was clearly doomed from the start. Football in the UK needs to sort out its reputation at home before we can go after the biggest tournament."" The feasibility study included an analysis of the economic impact, the political football landscape and the likely costs of hosting major international tournaments. Following the study, the football associations of the Republic of Ireland, England, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland will focus on an official bid to host Uefa Euro 2028. A statement said: ""Hosting a Uefa Euro offers a similar return on investment, with the European tournament carrying a far lower delivery cost and the potential of the benefits being realised sooner. ""It would be an honour and a privilege to collectively host Euro 2028 and to welcome all of Europe. ""It would also be a wonderful opportunity to demonstrate the true impact of hosting a world-class football tournament by driving positive change and leaving a lasting legacy across our communities."" The UK government had previously said it would investÂ£550m in grassroots football if the 2030 bid was successful,with Prime Minister Boris Johnson hoping to ""transform lives with a legacy to match the 2012 Olympics"". England failed with a bid - fronted by former captain David Beckham, Prince William and former prime minister David Cameron - to host the 2018 World Cup, which was staged in Russia. Northern Ireland determined to host games should Euros bid be successful Principality Stadium to be Wales' only venue for joint Euro 2028 bid The UK government said it supported the five football associations' decision and added that it remained ""passionate about bringing a World Cup to the UK and Ireland when the time is right"". Mark Bullingham, chief executive of the English FA, identified both bids as ""brilliant"" opportunities but said after assessing the ""winnability"" a decision was made to go for the Euro 2028 bid. He added there was also ""uncertainty"" around future World Cups - football's world governing body Fifa has proposed staging the tournament every two years as part of a revamped calendar. FA of Wales president Stephen Williams also said the impact of a successful bid for Wales would be ""immeasurable"" and would leave a ""long-lasting legacy"". All associations say they will continue to ""collaborate"" with government partners about the next steps.

"New 'greenfield' homes are designed around the car - report Housing developments on former farmland are adding hundreds of thousands of extra car journeys to Englandâs roads, a report has found. It says typical new 'greenfield' homes are designed around the car - with often three parking spaces per home. Essential services such as shops, schools and doctors are often almost impossible to reach on foot or by bike. The government planning department welcomed the report, agreeing new housing should depend less on cars. The Transport Secretary Grant Shappssaid last year: âPublic transport and active travel (walking and cycling) will be the natural first choice for daily activities. ""We will use our cars less."" But the report from Transport for New Homes â backed by the RAC Foundation - says car dependency is actually getting worse. Its researchers conducted field visits to 20 new housing developments across England â three years after a previous survey around the country. They found that greenfield housing has become even more car-based than before. They say the trend for building with the car in mind extended beyond housing, with out-of-town retail, leisure, food outlets and employment orientated around new road systems. They found that planners and construction firms are building in a style they refer to as âcar-park to car-parkâ. This is the opposite of Mr Shapps' stated wishes, they say. It's creating a sedentary lifestyle and isolation for new residents, as well as limited choices for people who donât drive. Despite plans for vibrant communities with local shops, leisure facilities and community services, the visions of developers have not materialised. Equally, the excellent public transport promised was often not in place and in some cases had even been reduced. They say that in practice, greenfield estates planned as âwalkable vibrant communitiesâ were dominated by parking, driveways and roads with easy access to bypasses and major roads. In contrast, 'brownfield' developments on previously built-up land in cities tended to be less car-based, allowing better access to local amenities by foot, cycle and public transport, the report said. Why electric cars will take over sooner than you think Video: Should I buy an electric car? The researchers commended two greenfield developments for being far less car-dependent: Derwenthorpe, near York, and Poundbury in Dorset, which was built according to principles of architecture advocated by the Prince of Wales. They had been designed around walkability and the needs of a local community from start to finish, without compromise. They were also well-positioned to allow residents to easily walk and cycle along overlooked streets to shops and services in their nearby town centres. Jenny Raggett from Transport for New Homes, said: âWe canât go on as we have been, building many hundreds of thousands of new homes in places which are not only impossible to serve with sustainable transport, but actually promote more and more travel by car. âAt a time of climate emergency and with a need to cut congestion on our roads, this is not the way we should be building for the future. We have to do things differently. âSmall shops, cafes and businesses built for local living are just not there in most new greenfield estates. Local parks, community halls, playing fields and other amenities that would take people away from looking at their screens and encourage them to get out and walk or cycle, appear often not to have materialised. âGood public transport often remains aspirational with cuts to services looming. For people who cannot afford a car or cannot drive, they are essentially stuck. This cannot be a healthy vision for how people will live in the future.â Reacting to the report, a spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: ""By 2030, we want half of all journeys in towns and cities to be walked or cycled and are investing Â£3 billion into bus services. ""National Planning Policy is clear that significant development should give priority to pedestrians, cyclists and public transport and we will be updating guidance later this year to promote street design that favours walkways and cycle paths over motor traffic."" But Steve Gooding, head of the RAC Foundation and a former director at the Department for Transport, told BBC News that what seemed like irreconcilable goals within government itself, weren't helping. ""There's long been a disconnect between the ambition of the transport department to promote alternatives to the car and pressure on the housing department to see as many homes as possible built."" Case studies 1.Cranbrook, near Exeter Cranbrook, near Exeter Cranbrook is a new town with up to 2,900 homes and potential for expansion to 6,500. Walkability was part of the master plan but Cranbrook is still waiting for a promised high street, a childrenâs centre and community facilities. Residents must use a car to access many amenities. Researchers say they saw few residents during their visit. 2.Derwenthorpe, York Derwenthorpe, York Derwenthorpe is a development of 481 homes on the outskirts of York, about two miles from the city. Researchers said it had good public transport and safe walking and cycling routes to shops and cafes. It enjoys green spaces and a variety of different-sized homes to cater for a range of ages - not just families. Car parking spaces were limited. The researchers said it felt like a friendly place with a real community.

"People are suffering while plans to tackle record NHS waiting lists in England are delayed, a patients' group warns Details of the scheme were due to be revealed today, but this is now on hold amid reports of a Whitehall disagreement The Treasury says the government is ""united"" in its plan, while Health Secretary Sajid Javid insists there's ""no issue"" around money PM Boris Johnson says new ""tough targets"" around cancer care will be set to tackle the NHS backlog in England In the meantime, a new online service will allow people needing non-urgent surgery to get information about waiting times Boris Johnson is set to make further changes to his Downing Street team this week as the fallout over lockdown parties continues The UK has recorded a further 57,623 Covid cases on Monday, and 45 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Edited by Holly Wallis Thanks for joining us â we're pausing our live coverage now. Your writers were Jeremy Gahagan, Joseph Lee, Victoria Lindrea and Jen Meierhans. The page was edited by Nathan Williams and Holly Wallis. Our live coverage is coming to a close for the evening, so here's a recap of the day's Covid news: Earlier, we told you about how England's exam regulator is planning to grade this summer's GCSEs and A-levels more generously than in  pre-pandemic years. It's one way in which officials are trying to make things fairer as exams resume across the UK for the first time since the pandemic began, amid ongoing disruption to education. In England, most of the exam boards have also published advanced information about most A-level, AS-level and GCSE subjects, giving students a better sense of what topics they need to revise. They list the topics that will be the main focus of assessments, but do not include everything which will be covered in the exams. GCSE English literature, geography, history and ancient history are not included - but they will offer more choice in the exam questions. Other UK nations have their own plans to support students as exams return. Read more about this summer's exams Responding to Labour, health minister Edward Argar has told MPs there is ""undeniably a huge Covid backlog that needs urgent attention"". ""Throughout the pandemic we had to take steps to make sure we could treat those with the greatest clinical need, and make sure that we provided a safe environment for those who needed Covid care,"" he says. ""The number of people waiting for care in England now stands at around six million and we know that this figure will get worse before it gets better."" Argar adds that the ""best current estimate"" suggested about 8.5 million had not come forward for treatment during the pandemic. ""But we are pulling out all stops to help the NHS recover and make sure patients are receiving the right care at the right time."" ""This isn't a Covid backlog, this is a Tory backlog,""
says shadow health secretary Wes Streeting â who has been quizzing the health minister
about the delayed plan to tackle the NHS backlog in England. ""More than a million are waiting for scans and tests used
to diagnose cancer, and the NHS itself is waiting, waiting for the government's
plan to deal with the backlog,"" he says. He says Monday's unexplained delay is like something fromThe
Thick Of Itâ the satirical show about the inner workings of British
government. ""But the reality is worse than fiction. A photo op without
a plan, their own NHS recovery plan just another cancelled operation,"" Streeting
says. He concludes: ""Briefings for the Department for Health and
Social Care claimed the chancellor blocked the plan because, to quote one
government official, it's pretty obvious it's about Treasury reluctance to
rescue the prime minister."" Through the day we've heard from people affected by theongoing backlog to NHS treatment in England. One of the latest to speak to us, Matthew Watkinson, from Scarborough, has been waiting for an operation to repair a hernia in his stomach for more than two years. Matthew, who is 70, says: âI suffer a lot and it doesnât get better."" He tells us a similar delay led to his mother's death when a ruptured hernia caused organ failure. He says he is not expecting waiting lists to shorten and feels forced to consider unaffordable private treatment, costing around Â£3,000, because the NHS is so stretched and ""just can't cope"". Northern Ireland's health minister says he is taking legal advice on how he can ""replace the bulk of remaining Covid-19 restrictions"" with guidance ""this week"". Robin Swann was speaking afterFirst Minister Paul Givanresigned in protest over a Brexit deal known asthe Northern Ireland Protocol. Givan's resignation means Northern Ireland's government cannot meet but it was due to discuss removing remaining Covid restrictions on Thursday. Swann says he is not ""prepared to allow a failure of politics to get in the way of lifting now unnecessary restrictions"". He told a press conference:""We need to start getting normal back."" With the latest stats suggesting Covid cases are continuing to decrease, what are the rules on face coverings? People in England are no longer legally required to wear face
masks in most public spaces â although they are still recommended in some
places. They remain a requirement in healthcare settings, as well as on public
transport in London. Masks are still required in many situations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, including in shops and for secondary school pupils while in school. Read the latest rules, what fines apply and where - and why some governments are still recommending masks are wornhere.  The UK has given a total of138,585,207coronavirus vaccinations. That's52,437,297first doses,48,594,494second doses and37,553,416booster or third doses. It means91.2%of the population aged 12 and over have had their first dose,84.5%have had a second dose and65.3%have had a third or booster jab. You can read more about the UK vaccination programmehere. A further 57,623 coronavirus cases have been recorded in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external There were also 45 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. More on that exams news now. Steve Chalke, founder of Oasis UK - which runs more than 50
primary and secondary schools across England, says it is ""hard to
say"" if advance information about what will appear in this year's GCSEs,
AS and A-level exams will be helpful - to students or teachers. It comes after exam boards in England published details of what
will come up in this summer's exams in most core subjects - including maths,
biology, chemistry and languages. Chalke highlighted the number of children currently struggling
with serious mental health issues and said the UK, like many other countries,
should be dropping GCSEs altogether. ""It strikes me that an opportunity is being lost. We know
that exams don't work, they are unfair."" ""[Exams] measure a particular kind of intelligence - so,
for many kids, with the focus so much on grades, they hold back children from
developing their talents and their passions."" He tells the BBC that exams fail to measure
the ""ability to communicate, or teamwork... or honesty and integrity... and
we know how adrift things can come if you don't get honesty and
integrity"". ""We are one of the only remaining countries that still
examine kids at the age of 16. Let's be more imaginative."" BBC News EducationBBC News Family & Education Toluwa wants to study medicine at university We've also been hearing today aboutplans for school exams to be graded more generouslycompared to pre-pandemic levels - due to the impact of Covid on learning. Details of exam content have been released today in England and Wales, to help pupils revise. There's been a mixed reaction among teachers and students at Wales Comprehensive School in Kiveton, South Yorkshire. Toluwa  Owolabi, 18, says he's feeling ""quite confident"" now that he knows which areas he needs to target in his revision for his biology, chemistry, and computer science exams. Head of science Hannah Feerick adds that the advance information has put her pupils' minds at ease after such a ""fragmented"" couple of years at school. ""Students are looking forward to proving themselves [in exams],"" she says. But A-level student Abby says ""additional help is needed to get those higher grades"". Abby points out that the advance information isn't as detailed in English as it is in other subjects The advance exams information is ""really useful,"" says head of science, Hannah Feerick Abby, 17, is studying English literature. For this subject there will be a greater number of questions on exam papers, rather than detail about which topics will come up. ""In English we've only had limited advance information. The
Handmaid's Tale is a really, really long book so there's still a lot to
revise,"" she says. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst Over to Hong Kong now, as the city expects new curbs after recording
a new daily record number of Covid cases. According to the South China Morning Post newspaper, 614
new cases have been recorded in the last 24 hours and more than 600 preliminary
positive results. The paper calls this a""steep increase"",externalover the 342 cases confirmed on Sunday. This in itself is a significant increase
on earlier daily cases; for the last week, cases in Hong Kong had hovered
around the 100 mark. Officials have been warning people in the city that a large
proportion of cases are untraceable, and urging them to stay at home, as the
Chinese city has azero-Covid strategy. One of the theories is that imported hamsters at pet shops
across the city could have facilitated animal-to-human transmission,although this has been widely critiqued. Hong Kong
is currently under partial lockdown. Last month, bars and gyms were ordered to closed, as
well as schools and nurseries. A 6pm
restaurant curfew was also
introduced. There are currently more than 1,400 people in hospital.
However, at least 80% of Hong Kongâs 7.5m population have received at least one
vaccine dose. Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt has been speaking
to Radio 4's World At One about thedelay to tackling NHS waiting lists in England. Hunt, who is the chair of the Commons health and social care
committee, says ""there does seem to be a Whitehall hold-up"" and every
moment of delay is creating ""more agony and pain for NHS patients"". He also refuses to reveal if he would stand in any
leadership contest should Boris Johnson be forced out of office. We're in a ""very difficult limbo period"" waiting for the
result of a police investigation into Downing Street parties, he adds. If you're just joining us, we've been hearing this afternoon from patients' groups, who've expressed concern that a plan to tackle NHS waiting lists - due to have been published today -has been delayed. Rachel Power, from the Patients' Association, tells BBC Radio 5 live that the government needs to publish its NHS recovery plan so that patients can see it and learn how they're going to start their journey to getting better. Asked what she thinks the plan will include, she says: ""I think it'll show people where they are on the waiting list but will also give advice about that key issue around how to keep well while waiting. ""And hopefully it will have an element of allowing the patient to do some shared decision-making as they prepare for their treatment."" She says one of the key things she wants to see in the plan is how the NHS is going to reach out to patients so they aren't sitting wondering when they are going to have the treatment they need to be able to get on with their lives. Let'stake a look at the latest daily figures on the spread of Covid worldwide. There were 5,729 deaths reported around the world, bringing the global total to 5.7 million since the pandemic began. And with 1.7 million new infections recorded, it means there have been 395.2 million confirmed cases since the virus first emerged. But in many parts of the world, the spike in cases caused by the appearance of the Omicron variant has begun to subside. Cases are now clearly falling in Asia, North America and Latin America. In Europe, where cases are highest, the virus is continuing to spread at a greater rate than at any other time in the pandemic.  In the US, cases have fallen sharply but the number of deaths remains high â averaging nearly 2,500 in the past seven days. Many places in the world are using booster vaccinations to top up immunity and keep the pandemic under control in the face of the Omicron variant. Among larger countries, Chile has the highest proportion of the
population who have had booster jabs, with 67% having had the extra dose. Denmark, which recently lifted all its Covid restrictions, is
second on that list, with 62% having had the booster vaccination. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent With Covid in retreat â at least in terms of serious illness and pressure on the NHS â the challenge facing the government is how to get the core services back on track. Whether it is cancer or hospital treatments, the pandemic has had a huge impact. Waiting times have got worse across the board. For hospital treatments ministers need to find a way to increase capacity â the NHS is still doing fewer treatments than it was before the pandemic began. Tough new targets on their own will not be enough without the staff needed to see patients. Much the same is true for cancer â but it is further complicated by the missing cases. The number of diagnoses are down by 34,000 since the pandemic started. Getting those people to come forward for checks, and ensuring they get them quickly when they do, is essential. We've got a bit more on the PM's comments we
brought you earlier â in which he said he was""working with the NHS to set some tough targets"" for the delayed NHS Recovery Plan. Boris Johnson appeared to confirm a 28-day target for a cancer
diagnosis for three out of four people, and that by March next year no-one
would wait longer than two months to find out if they have cancer. That target was originally due to have come in last year, but had been delayed because of the pandemic. The waiting list for hospital treatment in England hit a record six million in Novemberâ a rise of nearly 50% since the pandemic started. More than 300,000 patients have been waiting more than a year for treatment after the suspension of routine surgery during certain parts of the pandemic, adding to pressures which were already clear before Covid. Sir Keir Starmer has been talkingabout the police's decision to clear him of breaking lockdown rulesafter he was filmed
drinking a beer in an office in April 2021. Asked by broadcasters in south London whether he was
""relieved"" by Durham Constabulary's announcement, the Labour leader
says he was clear throughout that no rules had been broken. ""And here's the contrast - only last Monday we got the
overview from Sue Gray, and 12 cases being referred to the Metropolitan Police
in relation to the prime minister and the goings on in Downing Street,"" he
says. ""Because the Metropolitan Police consider there was
evidence not only of offences, but they were serious enough and flagrant enough
to put aside their usual rule that they won't investigate 12 months after the
event. ""So that's a huge
contrast, as there always was in this case."" Weâve heard from a cancer patientdirectly impacted by the NHS backlog in England. Louise McAllan, who lives in Essex, tells BBC Radio 4's World At One programme she was diagnosed with cancer in February 2020 and didn't receive any treatment for eight months. She says the delay left her ""lost for words"" and her chances of survival have now been compromised. People's lives have been put in ""jeopardy"" by the delays caused during the pandemic, she says.

"Boris Johnson is set to make further changes to his Downing Street team this week as he seeks to ease concerns of MPs who are wavering about his future. The shake-up comes amid the fallout fromthe initial findings of the Sue Gray reportinto events at No 10 while Covid restrictions were in place. Several Tory backbenchers have called for Mr Johnson to resign and have submitted letters of no confidence. The PM has promised his MPs there would be a change in how No 10 operates. Asked if he had confidence in the prime minister, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said ""absolutely, 100%"" adding that ""despite the challenges, and of course there are many, this prime minister is delivering"". But Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, Jon Ashworth, said the government was ""in utter chaos"", with Mr Johnson ""more focused on saving his own skin because of the scandals and rule breaking he's been involved in"". Give PM time and space to deliver, says Kwarteng I am target of brutal campaign - Carrie Johnson The Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held On Saturday Mr Johnsonannounced two senior appointmentsto his backroom staff following a string of resignations last week. Cabinet Office minister and Tory MP Steve Barclay is taking over as his chief of staff, while former Johnson aide Guto Harri has started as director of communications. Mr Harri was spotted arriving at No 10 on Monday morning, and asked by reporters what his first task of the day would be, he said he would ""give healthy snacks and mineral waters to staff"", waving a shopping bag at the cameras. There are expected to be new staff appointments, and some ministers will share some of the existing responsibilities of Mr Barclay, who retains his ministerial position. At least one current adviser - Henry Newman - will be moved out of No 10 and into a new role in government. The prime minister is also thought to be looking to appoint a new chief whip - the person in charge of party discipline - and he is understood to have held discussions with senior figures to try to persuade them to take up the post. Senior backbencher Tom Tugendhat, who has said he would run in any contest for the leadership, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the party should wait and see how the changes panned out before making any decisions on Mr Johnson's future. ""This is a decision clearly for 360 or so members of Parliament and let's see where it goes to, but I think the point remains that we've got to be looking at the future,"" he added. ""This is a time when we need to be really focused on what politics is actually here for, and that's helping others and not getting into some sort of personal psychodrama."" But former senior civil servant Jill Rutter said it was ""unclear"" how Mr Barclay's appointment would work in practice, as his three roles may pull him in different directions. Writing for the Times Red Box, she said: ""It's possible that the prime minister has thought this all through in a huge amount of detail and is clear how all these relationships will function. ""Alternatively, it's a panicky stopgap pulled together at short notice to get through the weekend, with no real thought about whether it will make a dysfunctional operation more confused."" Mr Johnson, who spent the weekend at his country retreat, Chequers, called some of his colleagues over the weekend to try to persuade them of the significance of his changes. This video can not be played Watch: A dizzying week for the PM explained in 60 seconds He has faced a turbulent few weeks amid allegations of parties at Downing Street, the Metropolitan Police announcing an investigation into 12 of those and criticism aftermaking a false claim that Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy Savile. The latter led No 10 policy chief Munira Mirza to resign, while four other aides - including his chief of staff and private secretary - also resigned last week. Her replacement in the policy unit, Tory MP Andrew Griffith, has written a piece for theConservative Home website,external, outlining his priorities, including tackling the NHS backlog and dealing with the cost of living crisis. He added: ""So long as [the public] see that we are focussing on them and their needs rather than fighting amongst ourselves, I believe that they will continue to place their trust in us.

"Environmentalists often accuse corporations of misleading consumers with greenwashing Many of the world's biggest companies are failing to meet their own targets on tackling climate change, according to a study of 25 corporations. They also routinely exaggerate or misreport their progress, the New Climate Institute report says. Google, Amazon, Ikea, Apple and Nestle are among those failing to change quickly enough, the study alleges. Corporations are under pressure to cut their environmental impact as more consumers want green products. Some of the companies told BBC News they disagreed with some of the methods used in the report and said they were committed to taking action to curb climate change. The firms analysed account for 5% of global greenhouse-gas emissions, the report says - which means although they have a huge carbon footprint, they have enormous potential to lead in the effort to limit climate change. ""The rapid acceleration of corporate climate pledges, combined with the fragmentation of approaches, means that it is more difficult than ever to distinguish between real climate leadership and unsubstantiated,"" the study says. Study author Thomas Day told BBC News his team originally wanted to discover good practices in the corporate world, but they were ""frankly surprised and disappointed at the overall integrity of the companies' claims"". Amazon said in its statement: ""We set these ambitious targets because we know that climate change is a serious problem, and action is needed now more than ever. As part of our goal to reach net-zero carbon by 2040, Amazon is on a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025."" And Nestle commented: ""We welcome scrutiny of our actions and commitments on climate change. However, the New Climate Institute's Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor (CCRM) report lacks understanding of our approach and contains significant inaccuracies."" The Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor was conducted by non-profit organisations New Climate Institute and Carbon Market Watch. It looked at firms' publicly stated strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in order to reach net zero. Net zero, a target scientists say the world must reach by 2050 to limit global temperature rises, means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Achieving it means reducing emissions as much as possible, as well as balancing out any that remain by removing an equivalent amount. What is net zero? Seven ways to spot businesses greenwashing Waitrose and Lidl top greenest supermarket ranking Companies set their own targets. For example, Google promises to be carbon-free by 2030, while Ikea pledges to be ""climate-positive"" by 2030. Emissions are created by anything from transporting goods, to energy used in factories or shops. The carbon footprint of growing crops or cutting down trees also counts. The study gave each firm an ""integrity"" rating. It found that some were doing relatively well in reducing emissions but that all corporations could improve. None was given a rating of ""high integrity"". It assessed factors like annually disclosing emissions; giving a breakdown of emission sources; and disclosing information in an understandable way. It concluded that overall, the strategies in place - if implemented - would reduce emissions by 40% at most, not the 100% implied in the term ""net zero"". Just three of the 25 companies are clearly committed to removing 90% of carbon emissions from their production and supply chains, it says. Those are Maersk, Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom. The way that businesses talk about their climate pledges is also a big problem, the study says. There is a large gap between what companies say and the reality, Mr Day says - and consumers are likely to find it difficult to determine the truth. ""Companies' ambitious-sounding headline claims all too often lack real substance,"" he explains. ""Even companies that are doing relatively well exaggerate their actions."" A really simple guide to climate change Mr Day, whose team spent weeks poring over documents, said the average person trying, for example, to choose a piece of furniture, technology or buy food in the supermarket would struggle to make an informed decision. He said one of the most controversial areas was what are known as downstream or upstream emissions - ones that are created by activity indirectly linked to a company. For example, the report says 70% of Apple's climate footprint is created by upstream emissions, including the consumption of electricity by consumers using Apple phones, laptops and other products. Many companies did not include these emissions in their climate plans. Ikea told BBC News it welcomed ""dialogue and scrutiny"" of companies' climate commitments and goals, to ensure that they were ""aligned with the science of 1.5Â°C"". ""The new report by New Climate Institute is a constructive addition to this."" And Unilever commented: ""While we share different perspectives on some elements of this report, we welcome external analysis of our progress and have begun a productive dialogue with the New Climate Institute to see how we can meaningfully evolve our approach. Google told BBC News: ""We clearly define the scope of our climate commitments and regularly report on our progress in our annual Environmental Report, where our energy and greenhouse gas emissions data is assured by Ernst & Young."" Apple did not respond directly to the report but told BBC News it has a plan to reduce its carbon footprint. The Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor will continue to assess companies' pledges, releasing findings annually. The full list of companies analysed is: Maersk, Apple, Sony, Vodafone, Amazon, Deutsche Telekom, Enel, GlaxoSmithKline, Google, Hitachi, Ikea, Vale, Volkswagen, Walmart, Accenture, BMW Group, Carrefour, CVS Health, Deutsche Post DHL, E.On SE, JBS, Nestle, Novartis, Saint-Gobain, Unilever.

"People are suffering while plans to tackle record NHS waiting lists in England are delayed, a patients' group warns Details of the scheme were due to be revealed today, but this is now on hold amid reports of a Whitehall disagreement The Treasury says the government is ""united"" in its plan, while Health Secretary Sajid Javid insists there's ""no issue"" around money PM Boris Johnson says new ""tough targets"" around cancer care will be set to tackle the NHS backlog in England In the meantime, a new online service will allow people needing non-urgent surgery to get information about waiting times Boris Johnson is set to make further changes to his Downing Street team this week as the fallout over lockdown parties continues The UK has recorded a further 57,623 Covid cases on Monday, and 45 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Edited by Holly Wallis Thanks for joining us â we're pausing our live coverage now. Your writers were Jeremy Gahagan, Joseph Lee, Victoria Lindrea and Jen Meierhans. The page was edited by Nathan Williams and Holly Wallis. Our live coverage is coming to a close for the evening, so here's a recap of the day's Covid news: Earlier, we told you about how England's exam regulator is planning to grade this summer's GCSEs and A-levels more generously than in  pre-pandemic years. It's one way in which officials are trying to make things fairer as exams resume across the UK for the first time since the pandemic began, amid ongoing disruption to education. In England, most of the exam boards have also published advanced information about most A-level, AS-level and GCSE subjects, giving students a better sense of what topics they need to revise. They list the topics that will be the main focus of assessments, but do not include everything which will be covered in the exams. GCSE English literature, geography, history and ancient history are not included - but they will offer more choice in the exam questions. Other UK nations have their own plans to support students as exams return. Read more about this summer's exams Responding to Labour, health minister Edward Argar has told MPs there is ""undeniably a huge Covid backlog that needs urgent attention"". ""Throughout the pandemic we had to take steps to make sure we could treat those with the greatest clinical need, and make sure that we provided a safe environment for those who needed Covid care,"" he says. ""The number of people waiting for care in England now stands at around six million and we know that this figure will get worse before it gets better."" Argar adds that the ""best current estimate"" suggested about 8.5 million had not come forward for treatment during the pandemic. ""But we are pulling out all stops to help the NHS recover and make sure patients are receiving the right care at the right time."" ""This isn't a Covid backlog, this is a Tory backlog,""
says shadow health secretary Wes Streeting â who has been quizzing the health minister
about the delayed plan to tackle the NHS backlog in England. ""More than a million are waiting for scans and tests used
to diagnose cancer, and the NHS itself is waiting, waiting for the government's
plan to deal with the backlog,"" he says. He says Monday's unexplained delay is like something fromThe
Thick Of Itâ the satirical show about the inner workings of British
government. ""But the reality is worse than fiction. A photo op without
a plan, their own NHS recovery plan just another cancelled operation,"" Streeting
says. He concludes: ""Briefings for the Department for Health and
Social Care claimed the chancellor blocked the plan because, to quote one
government official, it's pretty obvious it's about Treasury reluctance to
rescue the prime minister."" Through the day we've heard from people affected by theongoing backlog to NHS treatment in England. One of the latest to speak to us, Matthew Watkinson, from Scarborough, has been waiting for an operation to repair a hernia in his stomach for more than two years. Matthew, who is 70, says: âI suffer a lot and it doesnât get better."" He tells us a similar delay led to his mother's death when a ruptured hernia caused organ failure. He says he is not expecting waiting lists to shorten and feels forced to consider unaffordable private treatment, costing around Â£3,000, because the NHS is so stretched and ""just can't cope"". Northern Ireland's health minister says he is taking legal advice on how he can ""replace the bulk of remaining Covid-19 restrictions"" with guidance ""this week"". Robin Swann was speaking afterFirst Minister Paul Givanresigned in protest over a Brexit deal known asthe Northern Ireland Protocol. Givan's resignation means Northern Ireland's government cannot meet but it was due to discuss removing remaining Covid restrictions on Thursday. Swann says he is not ""prepared to allow a failure of politics to get in the way of lifting now unnecessary restrictions"". He told a press conference:""We need to start getting normal back."" With the latest stats suggesting Covid cases are continuing to decrease, what are the rules on face coverings? People in England are no longer legally required to wear face
masks in most public spaces â although they are still recommended in some
places. They remain a requirement in healthcare settings, as well as on public
transport in London. Masks are still required in many situations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, including in shops and for secondary school pupils while in school. Read the latest rules, what fines apply and where - and why some governments are still recommending masks are wornhere.  The UK has given a total of138,585,207coronavirus vaccinations. That's52,437,297first doses,48,594,494second doses and37,553,416booster or third doses. It means91.2%of the population aged 12 and over have had their first dose,84.5%have had a second dose and65.3%have had a third or booster jab. You can read more about the UK vaccination programmehere. A further 57,623 coronavirus cases have been recorded in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external There were also 45 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. More on that exams news now. Steve Chalke, founder of Oasis UK - which runs more than 50
primary and secondary schools across England, says it is ""hard to
say"" if advance information about what will appear in this year's GCSEs,
AS and A-level exams will be helpful - to students or teachers. It comes after exam boards in England published details of what
will come up in this summer's exams in most core subjects - including maths,
biology, chemistry and languages. Chalke highlighted the number of children currently struggling
with serious mental health issues and said the UK, like many other countries,
should be dropping GCSEs altogether. ""It strikes me that an opportunity is being lost. We know
that exams don't work, they are unfair."" ""[Exams] measure a particular kind of intelligence - so,
for many kids, with the focus so much on grades, they hold back children from
developing their talents and their passions."" He tells the BBC that exams fail to measure
the ""ability to communicate, or teamwork... or honesty and integrity... and
we know how adrift things can come if you don't get honesty and
integrity"". ""We are one of the only remaining countries that still
examine kids at the age of 16. Let's be more imaginative."" BBC News EducationBBC News Family & Education Toluwa wants to study medicine at university We've also been hearing today aboutplans for school exams to be graded more generouslycompared to pre-pandemic levels - due to the impact of Covid on learning. Details of exam content have been released today in England and Wales, to help pupils revise. There's been a mixed reaction among teachers and students at Wales Comprehensive School in Kiveton, South Yorkshire. Toluwa  Owolabi, 18, says he's feeling ""quite confident"" now that he knows which areas he needs to target in his revision for his biology, chemistry, and computer science exams. Head of science Hannah Feerick adds that the advance information has put her pupils' minds at ease after such a ""fragmented"" couple of years at school. ""Students are looking forward to proving themselves [in exams],"" she says. But A-level student Abby says ""additional help is needed to get those higher grades"". Abby points out that the advance information isn't as detailed in English as it is in other subjects The advance exams information is ""really useful,"" says head of science, Hannah Feerick Abby, 17, is studying English literature. For this subject there will be a greater number of questions on exam papers, rather than detail about which topics will come up. ""In English we've only had limited advance information. The
Handmaid's Tale is a really, really long book so there's still a lot to
revise,"" she says. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst Over to Hong Kong now, as the city expects new curbs after recording
a new daily record number of Covid cases. According to the South China Morning Post newspaper, 614
new cases have been recorded in the last 24 hours and more than 600 preliminary
positive results. The paper calls this a""steep increase"",externalover the 342 cases confirmed on Sunday. This in itself is a significant increase
on earlier daily cases; for the last week, cases in Hong Kong had hovered
around the 100 mark. Officials have been warning people in the city that a large
proportion of cases are untraceable, and urging them to stay at home, as the
Chinese city has azero-Covid strategy. One of the theories is that imported hamsters at pet shops
across the city could have facilitated animal-to-human transmission,although this has been widely critiqued. Hong Kong
is currently under partial lockdown. Last month, bars and gyms were ordered to closed, as
well as schools and nurseries. A 6pm
restaurant curfew was also
introduced. There are currently more than 1,400 people in hospital.
However, at least 80% of Hong Kongâs 7.5m population have received at least one
vaccine dose. Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt has been speaking
to Radio 4's World At One about thedelay to tackling NHS waiting lists in England. Hunt, who is the chair of the Commons health and social care
committee, says ""there does seem to be a Whitehall hold-up"" and every
moment of delay is creating ""more agony and pain for NHS patients"". He also refuses to reveal if he would stand in any
leadership contest should Boris Johnson be forced out of office. We're in a ""very difficult limbo period"" waiting for the
result of a police investigation into Downing Street parties, he adds. If you're just joining us, we've been hearing this afternoon from patients' groups, who've expressed concern that a plan to tackle NHS waiting lists - due to have been published today -has been delayed. Rachel Power, from the Patients' Association, tells BBC Radio 5 live that the government needs to publish its NHS recovery plan so that patients can see it and learn how they're going to start their journey to getting better. Asked what she thinks the plan will include, she says: ""I think it'll show people where they are on the waiting list but will also give advice about that key issue around how to keep well while waiting. ""And hopefully it will have an element of allowing the patient to do some shared decision-making as they prepare for their treatment."" She says one of the key things she wants to see in the plan is how the NHS is going to reach out to patients so they aren't sitting wondering when they are going to have the treatment they need to be able to get on with their lives. Let'stake a look at the latest daily figures on the spread of Covid worldwide. There were 5,729 deaths reported around the world, bringing the global total to 5.7 million since the pandemic began. And with 1.7 million new infections recorded, it means there have been 395.2 million confirmed cases since the virus first emerged. But in many parts of the world, the spike in cases caused by the appearance of the Omicron variant has begun to subside. Cases are now clearly falling in Asia, North America and Latin America. In Europe, where cases are highest, the virus is continuing to spread at a greater rate than at any other time in the pandemic.  In the US, cases have fallen sharply but the number of deaths remains high â averaging nearly 2,500 in the past seven days. Many places in the world are using booster vaccinations to top up immunity and keep the pandemic under control in the face of the Omicron variant. Among larger countries, Chile has the highest proportion of the
population who have had booster jabs, with 67% having had the extra dose. Denmark, which recently lifted all its Covid restrictions, is
second on that list, with 62% having had the booster vaccination. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent With Covid in retreat â at least in terms of serious illness and pressure on the NHS â the challenge facing the government is how to get the core services back on track. Whether it is cancer or hospital treatments, the pandemic has had a huge impact. Waiting times have got worse across the board. For hospital treatments ministers need to find a way to increase capacity â the NHS is still doing fewer treatments than it was before the pandemic began. Tough new targets on their own will not be enough without the staff needed to see patients. Much the same is true for cancer â but it is further complicated by the missing cases. The number of diagnoses are down by 34,000 since the pandemic started. Getting those people to come forward for checks, and ensuring they get them quickly when they do, is essential. We've got a bit more on the PM's comments we
brought you earlier â in which he said he was""working with the NHS to set some tough targets"" for the delayed NHS Recovery Plan. Boris Johnson appeared to confirm a 28-day target for a cancer
diagnosis for three out of four people, and that by March next year no-one
would wait longer than two months to find out if they have cancer. That target was originally due to have come in last year, but had been delayed because of the pandemic. The waiting list for hospital treatment in England hit a record six million in Novemberâ a rise of nearly 50% since the pandemic started. More than 300,000 patients have been waiting more than a year for treatment after the suspension of routine surgery during certain parts of the pandemic, adding to pressures which were already clear before Covid. Sir Keir Starmer has been talkingabout the police's decision to clear him of breaking lockdown rulesafter he was filmed
drinking a beer in an office in April 2021. Asked by broadcasters in south London whether he was
""relieved"" by Durham Constabulary's announcement, the Labour leader
says he was clear throughout that no rules had been broken. ""And here's the contrast - only last Monday we got the
overview from Sue Gray, and 12 cases being referred to the Metropolitan Police
in relation to the prime minister and the goings on in Downing Street,"" he
says. ""Because the Metropolitan Police consider there was
evidence not only of offences, but they were serious enough and flagrant enough
to put aside their usual rule that they won't investigate 12 months after the
event. ""So that's a huge
contrast, as there always was in this case."" Weâve heard from a cancer patientdirectly impacted by the NHS backlog in England. Louise McAllan, who lives in Essex, tells BBC Radio 4's World At One programme she was diagnosed with cancer in February 2020 and didn't receive any treatment for eight months. She says the delay left her ""lost for words"" and her chances of survival have now been compromised. People's lives have been put in ""jeopardy"" by the delays caused during the pandemic, she says.

"Police keep a watchful eye on protesters in Ottawa on Sunday The mayor of Canada's capital, Ottawa, has declared a state of emergency in response to more than a week of truckers' protests against Covid restrictions. Jim Watson said the city was ""losing this battle"" and ""completely out of control"". He added the protests posed a threat to residents' safety. There have also been reports of racial attacks. Ottawa's centre has been paralysed, with vehicles and tents blocking roads. The ""Freedom Convoy"" was sparked by the introduction last month of a new rule that all truckers must be vaccinated to cross the US-Canada border, but the protests have morphed into broader challenges to Covid health restrictions. The protesters have since gathered in central Ottawa near Parliament Hill, and their demands have grown to include ending all such mandates nationwide and opposing the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The truckers shutting down Canada's capital How do we know coronavirus vaccines are safe? Which treatments work best against Covid? Speaking to Canadian radio station CFRA, Mr Watson said the protesters were behaving increasingly ""insensitively"" by continuously ""blaring horns and sirens, [setting off] fireworks and turning it into a party"". ""Clearly, we are outnumbered and we are losing this battle,"" he said, adding: ""This has to be reversed - we have to get our city back."" The mayor did not give specific details about what measures he might impose, but police said on Sunday that they would step up enforcement, including possible arrests of those seeking to aid the protesters by bringing them supplies like fuel, toilet paper and food. A state of emergency will give the city additional powers, including access to equipment required by frontline workers and emergency services. This video can not be played The protests began as a movement against vaccination requirements Many Ottawa residents have objected to the demonstrations. Complaints range from idling trucks that impede traffic and makeshift wooden structures in city parks to lost income and fears of harassment and even violence. Police have said they are concerned about how the convoy has attracted far-right and extremist elements, and on Sunday confirmed they were dealing withmore than 60 criminal investigations,external, with alleged offences including ""mischief, thefts, hate crimes and property damage"". ""There have been racist signs, there have been a lot of reports of people being assaulted and harassed if they wear a mask,"" Stephanie Carvon, Ottawa resident and former national security analyst for the Canadian government told the BBC. She added that some organisers of the protest held extremist views, but had ""successfully framed their actions in the name of the pandemic and ending the mandates, so they've earned the sympathy of a lot of Canadians who may not necessarily realise where this has come from"". One demonstrator who drove for hours to join the protest in Ottawa, Kimberly Ball, told the AFP news agency that the protest was ""about our freedom"". ""A couple of people we know, friends, lost their jobs because of these mandates,"" she said, adding she had concerns about the safety and effectiveness of Covid vaccines. Covid-19 vaccines have cut the risk of severe illness in those infected with the virus and serious side effects are extremely rare. More than 80% of the eligible population is fully vaccinated anda recent poll showed a majority of Canadians favoured imposing more restrictions on the unvaccinated.,external A recent opinion poll by Abacus Data suggested 68% of Canadians felt they had ""very little in common"" with the protesters, while 32% said they ""had a lot in common"" with the truckers. By Rachel Schraer, BBC health and disinformation reporter It's a pattern we've seen repeated through the pandemic. Protests frequently bring people together around points of legitimate political debate - how tough or long Covid restrictions should be or whether vaccination should be mandatory. Scratch the surface, though, and you can quickly find more extreme views and misinformation like that shared by the convoy's organisers. Videos from 2019 show organiser Pat King discussing a plot for a ""depopulation of the Caucasian raceâ¦ the ones with the strongest bloodlines"". Meanwhile, online groups with tens of thousands of followers shared posts criticising the police's handling of the convoy alongside false claims the Covid vaccine was ""poison"" and a fake report that New Zealand was planning to introduce the vaccine to its water supply. People joining groups in sympathy with truckers' stated grievances, for example against vaccine mandates, can quickly find themselves exposed to these more fringe or misleading sources of information.

"People are suffering while plans to tackle record NHS waiting lists in England are delayed, a patients' group warns Details of the scheme were due to be revealed today, but this is now on hold amid reports of a Whitehall disagreement The Treasury says the government is ""united"" in its plan, while Health Secretary Sajid Javid insists there's ""no issue"" around money PM Boris Johnson says new ""tough targets"" around cancer care will be set to tackle the NHS backlog in England In the meantime, a new online service will allow people needing non-urgent surgery to get information about waiting times Boris Johnson is set to make further changes to his Downing Street team this week as the fallout over lockdown parties continues The UK has recorded a further 57,623 Covid cases on Monday, and 45 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Edited by Holly Wallis Thanks for joining us â we're pausing our live coverage now. Your writers were Jeremy Gahagan, Joseph Lee, Victoria Lindrea and Jen Meierhans. The page was edited by Nathan Williams and Holly Wallis. Our live coverage is coming to a close for the evening, so here's a recap of the day's Covid news: Earlier, we told you about how England's exam regulator is planning to grade this summer's GCSEs and A-levels more generously than in  pre-pandemic years. It's one way in which officials are trying to make things fairer as exams resume across the UK for the first time since the pandemic began, amid ongoing disruption to education. In England, most of the exam boards have also published advanced information about most A-level, AS-level and GCSE subjects, giving students a better sense of what topics they need to revise. They list the topics that will be the main focus of assessments, but do not include everything which will be covered in the exams. GCSE English literature, geography, history and ancient history are not included - but they will offer more choice in the exam questions. Other UK nations have their own plans to support students as exams return. Read more about this summer's exams Responding to Labour, health minister Edward Argar has told MPs there is ""undeniably a huge Covid backlog that needs urgent attention"". ""Throughout the pandemic we had to take steps to make sure we could treat those with the greatest clinical need, and make sure that we provided a safe environment for those who needed Covid care,"" he says. ""The number of people waiting for care in England now stands at around six million and we know that this figure will get worse before it gets better."" Argar adds that the ""best current estimate"" suggested about 8.5 million had not come forward for treatment during the pandemic. ""But we are pulling out all stops to help the NHS recover and make sure patients are receiving the right care at the right time."" ""This isn't a Covid backlog, this is a Tory backlog,""
says shadow health secretary Wes Streeting â who has been quizzing the health minister
about the delayed plan to tackle the NHS backlog in England. ""More than a million are waiting for scans and tests used
to diagnose cancer, and the NHS itself is waiting, waiting for the government's
plan to deal with the backlog,"" he says. He says Monday's unexplained delay is like something fromThe
Thick Of Itâ the satirical show about the inner workings of British
government. ""But the reality is worse than fiction. A photo op without
a plan, their own NHS recovery plan just another cancelled operation,"" Streeting
says. He concludes: ""Briefings for the Department for Health and
Social Care claimed the chancellor blocked the plan because, to quote one
government official, it's pretty obvious it's about Treasury reluctance to
rescue the prime minister."" Through the day we've heard from people affected by theongoing backlog to NHS treatment in England. One of the latest to speak to us, Matthew Watkinson, from Scarborough, has been waiting for an operation to repair a hernia in his stomach for more than two years. Matthew, who is 70, says: âI suffer a lot and it doesnât get better."" He tells us a similar delay led to his mother's death when a ruptured hernia caused organ failure. He says he is not expecting waiting lists to shorten and feels forced to consider unaffordable private treatment, costing around Â£3,000, because the NHS is so stretched and ""just can't cope"". Northern Ireland's health minister says he is taking legal advice on how he can ""replace the bulk of remaining Covid-19 restrictions"" with guidance ""this week"". Robin Swann was speaking afterFirst Minister Paul Givanresigned in protest over a Brexit deal known asthe Northern Ireland Protocol. Givan's resignation means Northern Ireland's government cannot meet but it was due to discuss removing remaining Covid restrictions on Thursday. Swann says he is not ""prepared to allow a failure of politics to get in the way of lifting now unnecessary restrictions"". He told a press conference:""We need to start getting normal back."" With the latest stats suggesting Covid cases are continuing to decrease, what are the rules on face coverings? People in England are no longer legally required to wear face
masks in most public spaces â although they are still recommended in some
places. They remain a requirement in healthcare settings, as well as on public
transport in London. Masks are still required in many situations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, including in shops and for secondary school pupils while in school. Read the latest rules, what fines apply and where - and why some governments are still recommending masks are wornhere.  The UK has given a total of138,585,207coronavirus vaccinations. That's52,437,297first doses,48,594,494second doses and37,553,416booster or third doses. It means91.2%of the population aged 12 and over have had their first dose,84.5%have had a second dose and65.3%have had a third or booster jab. You can read more about the UK vaccination programmehere. A further 57,623 coronavirus cases have been recorded in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external There were also 45 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. More on that exams news now. Steve Chalke, founder of Oasis UK - which runs more than 50
primary and secondary schools across England, says it is ""hard to
say"" if advance information about what will appear in this year's GCSEs,
AS and A-level exams will be helpful - to students or teachers. It comes after exam boards in England published details of what
will come up in this summer's exams in most core subjects - including maths,
biology, chemistry and languages. Chalke highlighted the number of children currently struggling
with serious mental health issues and said the UK, like many other countries,
should be dropping GCSEs altogether. ""It strikes me that an opportunity is being lost. We know
that exams don't work, they are unfair."" ""[Exams] measure a particular kind of intelligence - so,
for many kids, with the focus so much on grades, they hold back children from
developing their talents and their passions."" He tells the BBC that exams fail to measure
the ""ability to communicate, or teamwork... or honesty and integrity... and
we know how adrift things can come if you don't get honesty and
integrity"". ""We are one of the only remaining countries that still
examine kids at the age of 16. Let's be more imaginative."" BBC News EducationBBC News Family & Education Toluwa wants to study medicine at university We've also been hearing today aboutplans for school exams to be graded more generouslycompared to pre-pandemic levels - due to the impact of Covid on learning. Details of exam content have been released today in England and Wales, to help pupils revise. There's been a mixed reaction among teachers and students at Wales Comprehensive School in Kiveton, South Yorkshire. Toluwa  Owolabi, 18, says he's feeling ""quite confident"" now that he knows which areas he needs to target in his revision for his biology, chemistry, and computer science exams. Head of science Hannah Feerick adds that the advance information has put her pupils' minds at ease after such a ""fragmented"" couple of years at school. ""Students are looking forward to proving themselves [in exams],"" she says. But A-level student Abby says ""additional help is needed to get those higher grades"". Abby points out that the advance information isn't as detailed in English as it is in other subjects The advance exams information is ""really useful,"" says head of science, Hannah Feerick Abby, 17, is studying English literature. For this subject there will be a greater number of questions on exam papers, rather than detail about which topics will come up. ""In English we've only had limited advance information. The
Handmaid's Tale is a really, really long book so there's still a lot to
revise,"" she says. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst Over to Hong Kong now, as the city expects new curbs after recording
a new daily record number of Covid cases. According to the South China Morning Post newspaper, 614
new cases have been recorded in the last 24 hours and more than 600 preliminary
positive results. The paper calls this a""steep increase"",externalover the 342 cases confirmed on Sunday. This in itself is a significant increase
on earlier daily cases; for the last week, cases in Hong Kong had hovered
around the 100 mark. Officials have been warning people in the city that a large
proportion of cases are untraceable, and urging them to stay at home, as the
Chinese city has azero-Covid strategy. One of the theories is that imported hamsters at pet shops
across the city could have facilitated animal-to-human transmission,although this has been widely critiqued. Hong Kong
is currently under partial lockdown. Last month, bars and gyms were ordered to closed, as
well as schools and nurseries. A 6pm
restaurant curfew was also
introduced. There are currently more than 1,400 people in hospital.
However, at least 80% of Hong Kongâs 7.5m population have received at least one
vaccine dose. Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt has been speaking
to Radio 4's World At One about thedelay to tackling NHS waiting lists in England. Hunt, who is the chair of the Commons health and social care
committee, says ""there does seem to be a Whitehall hold-up"" and every
moment of delay is creating ""more agony and pain for NHS patients"". He also refuses to reveal if he would stand in any
leadership contest should Boris Johnson be forced out of office. We're in a ""very difficult limbo period"" waiting for the
result of a police investigation into Downing Street parties, he adds. If you're just joining us, we've been hearing this afternoon from patients' groups, who've expressed concern that a plan to tackle NHS waiting lists - due to have been published today -has been delayed. Rachel Power, from the Patients' Association, tells BBC Radio 5 live that the government needs to publish its NHS recovery plan so that patients can see it and learn how they're going to start their journey to getting better. Asked what she thinks the plan will include, she says: ""I think it'll show people where they are on the waiting list but will also give advice about that key issue around how to keep well while waiting. ""And hopefully it will have an element of allowing the patient to do some shared decision-making as they prepare for their treatment."" She says one of the key things she wants to see in the plan is how the NHS is going to reach out to patients so they aren't sitting wondering when they are going to have the treatment they need to be able to get on with their lives. Let'stake a look at the latest daily figures on the spread of Covid worldwide. There were 5,729 deaths reported around the world, bringing the global total to 5.7 million since the pandemic began. And with 1.7 million new infections recorded, it means there have been 395.2 million confirmed cases since the virus first emerged. But in many parts of the world, the spike in cases caused by the appearance of the Omicron variant has begun to subside. Cases are now clearly falling in Asia, North America and Latin America. In Europe, where cases are highest, the virus is continuing to spread at a greater rate than at any other time in the pandemic.  In the US, cases have fallen sharply but the number of deaths remains high â averaging nearly 2,500 in the past seven days. Many places in the world are using booster vaccinations to top up immunity and keep the pandemic under control in the face of the Omicron variant. Among larger countries, Chile has the highest proportion of the
population who have had booster jabs, with 67% having had the extra dose. Denmark, which recently lifted all its Covid restrictions, is
second on that list, with 62% having had the booster vaccination. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent With Covid in retreat â at least in terms of serious illness and pressure on the NHS â the challenge facing the government is how to get the core services back on track. Whether it is cancer or hospital treatments, the pandemic has had a huge impact. Waiting times have got worse across the board. For hospital treatments ministers need to find a way to increase capacity â the NHS is still doing fewer treatments than it was before the pandemic began. Tough new targets on their own will not be enough without the staff needed to see patients. Much the same is true for cancer â but it is further complicated by the missing cases. The number of diagnoses are down by 34,000 since the pandemic started. Getting those people to come forward for checks, and ensuring they get them quickly when they do, is essential. We've got a bit more on the PM's comments we
brought you earlier â in which he said he was""working with the NHS to set some tough targets"" for the delayed NHS Recovery Plan. Boris Johnson appeared to confirm a 28-day target for a cancer
diagnosis for three out of four people, and that by March next year no-one
would wait longer than two months to find out if they have cancer. That target was originally due to have come in last year, but had been delayed because of the pandemic. The waiting list for hospital treatment in England hit a record six million in Novemberâ a rise of nearly 50% since the pandemic started. More than 300,000 patients have been waiting more than a year for treatment after the suspension of routine surgery during certain parts of the pandemic, adding to pressures which were already clear before Covid. Sir Keir Starmer has been talkingabout the police's decision to clear him of breaking lockdown rulesafter he was filmed
drinking a beer in an office in April 2021. Asked by broadcasters in south London whether he was
""relieved"" by Durham Constabulary's announcement, the Labour leader
says he was clear throughout that no rules had been broken. ""And here's the contrast - only last Monday we got the
overview from Sue Gray, and 12 cases being referred to the Metropolitan Police
in relation to the prime minister and the goings on in Downing Street,"" he
says. ""Because the Metropolitan Police consider there was
evidence not only of offences, but they were serious enough and flagrant enough
to put aside their usual rule that they won't investigate 12 months after the
event. ""So that's a huge
contrast, as there always was in this case."" Weâve heard from a cancer patientdirectly impacted by the NHS backlog in England. Louise McAllan, who lives in Essex, tells BBC Radio 4's World At One programme she was diagnosed with cancer in February 2020 and didn't receive any treatment for eight months. She says the delay left her ""lost for words"" and her chances of survival have now been compromised. People's lives have been put in ""jeopardy"" by the delays caused during the pandemic, she says.

"Australia implemented some of the world's strictest border controls during the pandemic Australia has announced the reopening of its borders to vaccinated tourists and other visa holders for the first time in almost two years. ""If you're double vaccinated, we look forward to welcoming you back,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. The reopening, on 21 February, will be welcome news for many sectors including international education. Australia has had some of the world's strictest border controls throughout the coronavirus pandemic. In March 2020, the government closed the borders. It barred most foreigners from entering the country and put caps on total arrivals to help combat Covid. Some international students and skilled migrants have been permitted to enter the country since last December. The battle to open up 'Fortress Australia' Australia revisited - a country changed by Covid On Monday, Mr Morrison said those entering Australia when the borders fully reopened would need to provide proof of vaccination: ""That's the rule. Everyone is expected to abide by it,"" he said. Unvaccinated travellers who have a medical reason for not being jabbed will still need to apply for a travel exemption and, if successful, will be required to quarantine at a hotel. Melinda de Boer, 44, from Switzerland, told the BBC that she was finally planning to travel to Melbourne to see her mum, who had breast cancer last year. ""Her grandchildren haven't seen her for nearly three years. We are looking to go in the October or December holidays,"" she said. Ms De Boer said she was reluctant to book at the moment and was ""worried about the airlines and masses of people going"". This video can not be played Midnight rush for shops and pubs as Sydney reopens (October 2021) Since the start of the pandemic, Australia has implemented strict measures to help fight the spread of Covid infections - even banning its own people from leaving the country last year. Despite most of the country opening up, the state of Western Australia (WA) still has tight measures. It is currently closed to non-residents, including those from other Australian states, unless they have permission to enter. There had been plans to open WA's borders to interstate and international tourists this month, but that move was postponed indefinitely due to the Omicron variant. Australia has so far reported more than 2.7 million cases of coronavirus and more than 4,240 Covid-related deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

"A long-term plan to fix the staffing crisis in the NHS is needed to cut record waiting lists for treatment, the government is being warned. Currently, nearly six million people in England are waiting for routine operations and procedures - many of whom are in pain. A report from MPs says the government needs to address staff shortages - or NHS workers will quit. The government pointed to the extra Â£5.9bn allocated to tackle the issue. There have been repeated warnings over the length of hospital waiting lists in England. As of September 2021, a record 5.8 million patients were waiting for surgery - such as hip or knee replacements - with 300,000 waiting more than a year compared with just 1,600 before the pandemic. Why the NHS is struggling like never before Trusts cancel surgery as NHS Covid pressures mount Emergency patients urged to take lift to hospital 'I went to Sri Lanka for my operation' In the autumn Budget,the government announcedan extra Â£5.9bn for the NHS in England to help clear the backlog. This was on top ofanother funding package in Septemberto create an extra nine million checks, scans and operations. But in its report published on Thursday, the Commons health and social care select committee said the health service was hugely understaffed and was facing an ""unquantifiable challenge"" in tackling the backlog. While it welcomed the government funding, the committee said NHS England was yet to publish ""how it plans to meet its workforce requirements"", despite this being promised by Health Secretary Sajid Javid by the end of November. It said it wanted the government to draw up a recovery plan for services by April. The report said many NHS staff were feeling under pressure and could quit unless they saw the ""light at the end of the tunnel"" of more staff coming. Jeremy Hunt - the former health secretary who now chairs the committee - said the NHS was short of 93,000 workers and there was ""no sign of any plan to address this"". He described the staffing crisis as ""entirely predictable"", adding: ""The current wave of Omicron is exacerbating the problem, but we already had a serious staffing crisis, with a burnt-out workforce. ""Far from tackling the backlog, the NHS will be able to deliver little more than day-to-day firefighting unless the government wakes up to the scale of the staffing crisis facing the NHS."" Matt, Shirley and David have all been impacted by pressures on the NHS Matt Cudworth, 44, needs urgent open heart surgery, but on New Year's Eve he was told his operation - due this week - had been cancelled. ""My whole life's on hold,"" he told BBC Breakfast. He said he feels stuck in a vicious circle: ""One of the things they've said to me is 'don't get stressed, take it easy'... and yet when things like this happen you're naturally more stressed... which creates more problems."" Following successful treatment for an aggressive form of breast cancer, Shirley Cochrane was told she needed check ups every six months, but that hasn't happened and her doctor told her to ""self manage"". She said: ""When you've had cancer, the fear of it returning is massive."" She said she understood the pressures of the pandemic, but the lack of regular contact with her cancer team left her feeling ""abandoned by the NHS"". David Ibbotson has been waiting for a hip replacement for three years - and this week his operation was cancelled for the third time. He struggles with pain while walking and said: ""If I don't get it done soon the joint in the hip will get worse and worse."" Think tank The Health Foundation estimates that nearly 19,000 more nurses and more than 4,000 more doctors are needed in order to get back to the 18-week standard waiting time for treatment. The MPs also want the government to publish an independent assessment of projected staff numbers every two years. It said it had previously recommended something similar - but it had been voted down by the government. The report said without a forecast of future workforce needs it was impossible to know whether enough doctors, nurses or care staff were being trained. It said it was also concerned about the social care workforce, which has about 105,000 vacancies. Doctors have welcomed the report for highlighting the staffing crisis, with the British Medical Association saying it ""clearly lays out what a gargantuan challenge the NHS faces"". ""The biggest barrier to tackling the backlog caused by the pandemic is a severe staffing crisis and our calls for improved workforce planning have thankfully been heard. It's now time for the government to listen too."" The Royal College of Surgeons said the main issue right now was that more than one in 10 NHS staff members were at home ill or self-isolating. It said it supported the committee's call for independent workforce projections, including an assessment of whether enough staff are being trained. And Minesh Patel, head of policy at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ""After years of failing to deliver the long-term funding and planning the NHS needs, the government must now urgently commit the resources required to support and grow the cancer workforce, so that it can tackle the backlog and provide urgent cancer care to everyone who needs it."" The Department of Health and Social Care said in a statement that, alongside the Â£5.9bn, it was investing Â£36bn over three years on checks, scans and for patients. ""We have over 5,100 doctors and nearly 10,000 more nurses in the NHS compared to last year and we're committed to delivering 50,000 more nurses by the end of this Parliament,"" it said. Many NHS trusts are currently struggling to cope amid the Omicron wave and staff shortages, and some hospitals have cancelled operations and declared critical incidents.

"The assembly is still in place despite the collapse of the executive The ex-Northern Ireland secretary who helped restore power-sharing at Stormont in 2020 has described the fresh crisis as ""deeply depressing"". Julian Smith was speaking as MPs approved legislation based on proposals he helped draft two years ago. The bill helps protect the assembly from future collapse. It removes the duty on the government to set a date for an election if the roles of first and deputy first minister are not replaced this week. The bill also allows the assembly to continue without an executive for at least six months. Paul Givan resigned as first minister on Thursdayin protest at the Northern Ireland Protocol. It triggered the collapse of the executive, but the legislation which passed its final hurdle in the House of Commons on Monday allows the assembly to remain in place. TheNI Ministers, Elections and Petitions of Concern Billcould also come into play after the assembly election in Mayif the parties fail to fill the posts of first and deputy first ministers. MPs approved a House of Lords amendment to the bill which allows it to be applied retrospectively, to cover the resignation of Mr Givan. It will now need to receive royal assent by Thursday. Julian Smith was involved in restoring devolution in 2020 Julian Smith was secretary of state for Northern Ireland when thethe New Decade New Approach dealwas signed. It paved the way for the legislation which is now going through parliament to stave off future immediate collapses. He told the Commons: ""The lack of a first minister and deputy first minister and the fall of the executive is really bad news for the majority of men and women who want good governance. ""The majority who want to get on with day-to-day life are held hostage by parallel universe of elements of the Northern Ireland political world."" Mr Smith also questioned whether it was ""just coincidence"" that the retrospective power had been recently added to the bill by peers and said many people may have questions about the level of knowledge the government could have had ahead of the crisis unfolding. But Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson insisted there was ""no question of collusion"" with the government over when it had taken its decision to withdraw from the first minister role. He maintained that unless the government makes changes to the protocol, his party cannot continue to operate within the current structures. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood hit out at the prime minister for being ""nowhere to be seen"" since the crisis had begun. ""If I was a unionist, I would be looking very closely at what this government is doing and how it treats them,"" he added. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the DUP could not stay in government without changes to the NI Protocol Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said parties who walked away from power-sharing did so ""at their peril"", as ultimately there remained no alternative to the Stormont institutions. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis was not present during the debate but his colleague, Northern Ireland minister Conor Burns, responded for the government. He said the ""clear message"" to the DUP was that it should return to government immediately in the interests of stability, and that negotiations with the EU over the protocol would continue until a resolution is found. Mr Burns also said he had spent five nights in Northern Ireland last week speaking to a range of communities and that the government would continue to work for everyone. Earlier on Monday, Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill, who lost her role as deputy first minister when Mr Givan stood down, urged assembly members (MLAs) at Stormont to salvage what they could from the ""chaos"" of Mr Givan's resignation. Highlighting the public apology for victims of institutional abuse which wasto have been made by the first and deputy first ministers in March, Ms O'Neill added the DUP had caused ""real hurt and trauma"". Michelle O'Neill lost her post of deputy first minister after Paul Givan's resignation Afterwards, she told the media she wanted to ""fast-track"" some pieces of legislation, however, there cannot be an agreement now on a draft budget. SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon said her party would ""not be falling into the DUP's trap"" and accused them of a instigating a ""manufactured self-serving political crisis"". The Alliance Party's Andrew Muir said MLAs should not ""knock-off early"" and must work to the end of the mandate. Givan resignation triggers fresh political crisis NI First Minister Paul Givan announces resignation Commons passes Bill to prevent Stormont collapse Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said parties should come together to write to the EU about their concerns over the protocol, adding: ""if the aim is to stand here and just poke each other in the eye for the sake of poking each other in the eye then we will not make this place better for the people here."" Defending his party's action, the former DUP leader Edwin Poots told the assembly he was ""surprised that people couldn't see it coming"", and that there would not be an executive ""to come back to"" while checks exist under the Northern Ireland Protocol. Earlier, Speaker Alex Maskey met party whips to discuss how to progress legislation which is still outstanding. At the start of business on Monday, he said it was his intention the assembly passes ""as much legislation as possible"" in the weeks ahead. He also said he had no contact with the Northern Ireland Office about ending the assembly's mandate at an ""early stage"". On Monday, MLAs passed the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill, which gives parents the right to two weeks' paid statutory leave if they have suffered the loss of a child, including through miscarriage. The bill had initially brought Northern Ireland into line with employment laws in Great Britain, however following an amendment, NI will now be the first jurisdiction in Europe to legislate for miscarriage employment rights, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons said. ""Following a full public consultation, my department will draw up detailed miscarriage leave and pay regulations, with an introduction date following shortly after,"" the minister added. Paul Givan resigned as first minister as part of the DUP's protest against the NI Protocol The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) pulled Mr Givan out of Stormontin protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has saidit will be ""difficult"" for his party to form a government after the upcoming election,if issues around the post-Brexit trading mechanism are not addressed. This has prompted Sinn FÃ©in to call for an early election, after Ms O'Neill was removed as deputy first minister. The roles are joint and one cannot continue without the other. Without the two top positions being filled, the executive - Northern Ireland's government - can no longer meet. Under previous rules, the resignation of the first or deputy first minister would have set in motion a seven-day countdown to re-nominate the roles. If candidates were not successfully re-nominated the Northern Ireland secretary would then be required to set a date for a fresh assembly election and the institutions would immediately collapse. However, when power-sharing was restored at Stormont in January 2020,after three years of deadlock,it was agreed Westminster would change the rules to avoid this.

"Environmentalists often accuse corporations of misleading consumers with greenwashing Many of the world's biggest companies are failing to meet their own targets on tackling climate change, according to a study of 25 corporations. They also routinely exaggerate or misreport their progress, the New Climate Institute report says. Google, Amazon, Ikea, Apple and Nestle are among those failing to change quickly enough, the study alleges. Corporations are under pressure to cut their environmental impact as more consumers want green products. Some of the companies told BBC News they disagreed with some of the methods used in the report and said they were committed to taking action to curb climate change. The firms analysed account for 5% of global greenhouse-gas emissions, the report says - which means although they have a huge carbon footprint, they have enormous potential to lead in the effort to limit climate change. ""The rapid acceleration of corporate climate pledges, combined with the fragmentation of approaches, means that it is more difficult than ever to distinguish between real climate leadership and unsubstantiated,"" the study says. Study author Thomas Day told BBC News his team originally wanted to discover good practices in the corporate world, but they were ""frankly surprised and disappointed at the overall integrity of the companies' claims"". Amazon said in its statement: ""We set these ambitious targets because we know that climate change is a serious problem, and action is needed now more than ever. As part of our goal to reach net-zero carbon by 2040, Amazon is on a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025."" And Nestle commented: ""We welcome scrutiny of our actions and commitments on climate change. However, the New Climate Institute's Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor (CCRM) report lacks understanding of our approach and contains significant inaccuracies."" The Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor was conducted by non-profit organisations New Climate Institute and Carbon Market Watch. It looked at firms' publicly stated strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in order to reach net zero. Net zero, a target scientists say the world must reach by 2050 to limit global temperature rises, means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Achieving it means reducing emissions as much as possible, as well as balancing out any that remain by removing an equivalent amount. What is net zero? Seven ways to spot businesses greenwashing Waitrose and Lidl top greenest supermarket ranking Companies set their own targets. For example, Google promises to be carbon-free by 2030, while Ikea pledges to be ""climate-positive"" by 2030. Emissions are created by anything from transporting goods, to energy used in factories or shops. The carbon footprint of growing crops or cutting down trees also counts. The study gave each firm an ""integrity"" rating. It found that some were doing relatively well in reducing emissions but that all corporations could improve. None was given a rating of ""high integrity"". It assessed factors like annually disclosing emissions; giving a breakdown of emission sources; and disclosing information in an understandable way. It concluded that overall, the strategies in place - if implemented - would reduce emissions by 40% at most, not the 100% implied in the term ""net zero"". Just three of the 25 companies are clearly committed to removing 90% of carbon emissions from their production and supply chains, it says. Those are Maersk, Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom. The way that businesses talk about their climate pledges is also a big problem, the study says. There is a large gap between what companies say and the reality, Mr Day says - and consumers are likely to find it difficult to determine the truth. ""Companies' ambitious-sounding headline claims all too often lack real substance,"" he explains. ""Even companies that are doing relatively well exaggerate their actions."" A really simple guide to climate change Mr Day, whose team spent weeks poring over documents, said the average person trying, for example, to choose a piece of furniture, technology or buy food in the supermarket would struggle to make an informed decision. He said one of the most controversial areas was what are known as downstream or upstream emissions - ones that are created by activity indirectly linked to a company. For example, the report says 70% of Apple's climate footprint is created by upstream emissions, including the consumption of electricity by consumers using Apple phones, laptops and other products. Many companies did not include these emissions in their climate plans. Ikea told BBC News it welcomed ""dialogue and scrutiny"" of companies' climate commitments and goals, to ensure that they were ""aligned with the science of 1.5Â°C"". ""The new report by New Climate Institute is a constructive addition to this."" And Unilever commented: ""While we share different perspectives on some elements of this report, we welcome external analysis of our progress and have begun a productive dialogue with the New Climate Institute to see how we can meaningfully evolve our approach. Google told BBC News: ""We clearly define the scope of our climate commitments and regularly report on our progress in our annual Environmental Report, where our energy and greenhouse gas emissions data is assured by Ernst & Young."" Apple did not respond directly to the report but told BBC News it has a plan to reduce its carbon footprint. The Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor will continue to assess companies' pledges, releasing findings annually. The full list of companies analysed is: Maersk, Apple, Sony, Vodafone, Amazon, Deutsche Telekom, Enel, GlaxoSmithKline, Google, Hitachi, Ikea, Vale, Volkswagen, Walmart, Accenture, BMW Group, Carrefour, CVS Health, Deutsche Post DHL, E.On SE, JBS, Nestle, Novartis, Saint-Gobain, Unilever.

"New 'greenfield' homes are designed around the car - report Housing developments on former farmland are adding hundreds of thousands of extra car journeys to Englandâs roads, a report has found. It says typical new 'greenfield' homes are designed around the car - with often three parking spaces per home. Essential services such as shops, schools and doctors are often almost impossible to reach on foot or by bike. The government planning department welcomed the report, agreeing new housing should depend less on cars. The Transport Secretary Grant Shappssaid last year: âPublic transport and active travel (walking and cycling) will be the natural first choice for daily activities. ""We will use our cars less."" But the report from Transport for New Homes â backed by the RAC Foundation - says car dependency is actually getting worse. Its researchers conducted field visits to 20 new housing developments across England â three years after a previous survey around the country. They found that greenfield housing has become even more car-based than before. They say the trend for building with the car in mind extended beyond housing, with out-of-town retail, leisure, food outlets and employment orientated around new road systems. They found that planners and construction firms are building in a style they refer to as âcar-park to car-parkâ. This is the opposite of Mr Shapps' stated wishes, they say. It's creating a sedentary lifestyle and isolation for new residents, as well as limited choices for people who donât drive. Despite plans for vibrant communities with local shops, leisure facilities and community services, the visions of developers have not materialised. Equally, the excellent public transport promised was often not in place and in some cases had even been reduced. They say that in practice, greenfield estates planned as âwalkable vibrant communitiesâ were dominated by parking, driveways and roads with easy access to bypasses and major roads. In contrast, 'brownfield' developments on previously built-up land in cities tended to be less car-based, allowing better access to local amenities by foot, cycle and public transport, the report said. Why electric cars will take over sooner than you think Video: Should I buy an electric car? The researchers commended two greenfield developments for being far less car-dependent: Derwenthorpe, near York, and Poundbury in Dorset, which was built according to principles of architecture advocated by the Prince of Wales. They had been designed around walkability and the needs of a local community from start to finish, without compromise. They were also well-positioned to allow residents to easily walk and cycle along overlooked streets to shops and services in their nearby town centres. Jenny Raggett from Transport for New Homes, said: âWe canât go on as we have been, building many hundreds of thousands of new homes in places which are not only impossible to serve with sustainable transport, but actually promote more and more travel by car. âAt a time of climate emergency and with a need to cut congestion on our roads, this is not the way we should be building for the future. We have to do things differently. âSmall shops, cafes and businesses built for local living are just not there in most new greenfield estates. Local parks, community halls, playing fields and other amenities that would take people away from looking at their screens and encourage them to get out and walk or cycle, appear often not to have materialised. âGood public transport often remains aspirational with cuts to services looming. For people who cannot afford a car or cannot drive, they are essentially stuck. This cannot be a healthy vision for how people will live in the future.â Reacting to the report, a spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: ""By 2030, we want half of all journeys in towns and cities to be walked or cycled and are investing Â£3 billion into bus services. ""National Planning Policy is clear that significant development should give priority to pedestrians, cyclists and public transport and we will be updating guidance later this year to promote street design that favours walkways and cycle paths over motor traffic."" But Steve Gooding, head of the RAC Foundation and a former director at the Department for Transport, told BBC News that what seemed like irreconcilable goals within government itself, weren't helping. ""There's long been a disconnect between the ambition of the transport department to promote alternatives to the car and pressure on the housing department to see as many homes as possible built."" Case studies 1.Cranbrook, near Exeter Cranbrook, near Exeter Cranbrook is a new town with up to 2,900 homes and potential for expansion to 6,500. Walkability was part of the master plan but Cranbrook is still waiting for a promised high street, a childrenâs centre and community facilities. Residents must use a car to access many amenities. Researchers say they saw few residents during their visit. 2.Derwenthorpe, York Derwenthorpe, York Derwenthorpe is a development of 481 homes on the outskirts of York, about two miles from the city. Researchers said it had good public transport and safe walking and cycling routes to shops and cafes. It enjoys green spaces and a variety of different-sized homes to cater for a range of ages - not just families. Car parking spaces were limited. The researchers said it felt like a friendly place with a real community.

"Ms Peng, seen here at the Australian Open in 2019, insisted she never disappeared from public life Tennis star Peng Shuai says there has been a ""huge misunderstanding"" over a post in which she claimed she was forced into having sexual relations with a former Chinese party leader. The November 2021 social media post was swiftly deleted and Ms Peng disappeared for weeks, sparking global concern. But now, speaking to France's L'Equipe newspaper, Ms Peng says she never alleged she suffered a sexual assault. However, the interview was done in highly controlled circumstances. The BBC's China correspondent Stephen McDonell compared it to a propaganda exercise, saying it left more questions than answers. L'Equipe had to submit questions in advance, and the interview was conducted at the Winter Olympics under the presence of a representative from China's Olympic Committee who also translated her comments from Chinese. Ms Peng told the outlet she was living a normal life - a line which has also been used by Chinese state officials about her previously. She also expressed thanks for the concern directed towards her. ""I would like to know: why such concern?... I never said anyone sexually assaulted me,"" she told L'Equipe. The 36-year-old sporting star also hinted she could retire from professional tennis. ""Considering my age, my multiple surgeries and the pandemic that forced me to stop for so long, I believe it will be very difficult to regain my physical level,"" she told L'Equipe. How China censored a tennis star Peng Shuai: What we know so far Australian Open reverses Peng Shuai T-shirt ban On 2 November, Ms Peng had published a 1,600-word essay on Chinese social platform Weibo where she accused former Chinese Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli of forcing her to have sex with him. The post detailed her relationship with him, but also included accusations that on at least one occasion she had felt coerced into sex. The post was shared widely on Chinese social media before it was removed less than an hour after publication. In the months that followed,Ms Peng denied making the accusations. She told L'Equipe interview the post had ""given rise to a huge misunderstanding from the outside world"". Ms Peng also added that she had deleted the post herself because she ""wanted to"". But she did not elaborate on how the post had been misunderstood. Every attempt by the Communist Party, at times in collusion with the International Olympic Committee (IOC), to play down the Peng Shuai controversy just seems to inflame it, leaving more questions. In this case, French media outlet L'Equipe, in publishing these latest highly controlled comments has been as much involved in a propaganda exercise as in an ""interview"". The paper said it agreed to publish only her answers and not include any commentary at all around them. Peng Shuai is reported to have said that she ""never said anyone had sexually assaulted me"". Well the obvious question is: In that case, what did you mean when you wrote on social media about Zhang Gaoli - former Politburo Standing Committee member - and said to him directly and publicly:  ""å¸¦æå»ä½ å®¶ï¼é¼æåä½ åçå³ç³»"" ? That line could be translated as: ""You took me to your house and raped me"" or ""You took me to your house and forced me to have sex with you"" or ""You took me to your house and pressured me into having sexual relations with you"". Having multiple potential translations has caused confusion. Either way, these are serious allegations about a very senior government figure. We still don't know what the tennis star meant because L'Equipe did not ask her. The interview was granted to the French outlet following permission from the Chinese Olympic Committee. L'Equipe said that despite submitting questions prior to the interview, it was able to ask more on the day. The IOC on Monday also reported that the Chinese athlete had had dinner with its president, Thomas Bach, in the Chinese capital, Beijing, on Saturday, as a follow-up meeting for the pair. Mr Bach had been one of the first authorities to vouch for Peng's welfare after he held a video call with her during the period of concern about her treatment by state authorities. The IOC has been criticised by some rights groups for failing to address China's human rights record in the lead up to and during the Winter Games. The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) led calls for the allegations in the statement to be investigated and pulled all of its events from China in protest. In a statement released on Monday evening, the WTA said the latest in-person interview had done nothing to alleviate its concerns about Ms Peng's wellbeing. ""We have called for a formal investigation into the allegations by the appropriate authorities and an opportunity for the WTA to meet with Peng - privately - to discuss her situation,"" said the body's chief executive, Steve Simon.

"The Prince of Wales has paid tribute to the Queen on her Platinum Jubilee for the ""remarkable achievement"" of reaching 70 years on the throne. Prince Charles welcomed his mother's wish that Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, be known as Queen Consort when he becomes King. He said he and his wife were ""deeply conscious of the honour"". The Queen is the first British monarch to celebrate a Platinum Jubilee, and is spending the day privately. Queen backs Camilla to be Queen Consort on Jubilee Queen holds reception to mark Platinum Jubilee Platinum Jubilee: Queen's life in pictures When did young Elizabeth realise she would one day be Queen? Ina message marking the 70th anniversary of her reign,external, the Queen said it was her ""sincere wish"" that Camilla would have that title. Prince Charles said in a statement: ""The Queen's devotion to the welfare of all her people inspires still greater admiration with each passing year. ""We are deeply conscious of the honour represented by my mother's wish. As we have sought together to serve and support Her Majesty and the people of our communities, my darling wife has been my own steadfast support throughout."" The Queen's reign began when she was 25 years old, following the death of her father, George VI, on 6 February 1952. The monarch said that, 70 years on, the day is one she remembers ""as much for the death of my father, King George VI, as for the start of my reign"". The 95-year-old said in a written message to the nation: ""I would like to express my thanks to you all for your support. I remain eternally grateful for, and humbled by, the loyalty and affection that you continue to give me."" The Jubilee is the monarch's first without the Duke of Edinburgh, her husband of 73 years, who died last year. She reflected on how much she had gained from support given ""unselfishly"" by Prince Philip and thanked the goodwill shown to her by ""all nationalities, faiths and ages in this country"". The Queensigned off the message,external: ""Your servant Elizabeth R."" Since marrying into the Royal Family 17 years ago, Camilla has grown into her role as a senior royal. The path to public acceptance has been at times rocky, and at first Camilla was a controversial figure who was blamed by some for the end of the prince's first marriage to Princess Diana. In 1994, Charles admitted to adultery with Camilla, but said it came after his marriage to Diana had ""irretrievably broken down"". It was not until 1999 when she and Charles went public with their romance, Since then, Camilla has won over a cautious public. She has been praised for championing her own causes and interests, including supporting literacy charities, animal welfare and organisations helping victims of domestic abuse. Read more here. Many have congratulated the Queen on this historic day, including Boris Johnson, Theresa May and David Cameron - three of the 14 British prime ministers to occupy No 10 during her reign. Mr Johnson posted on Twitter: ""I pay tribute to her many years of service and look forward to coming together as a country to celebrate her historic reign in the summer."" His predecessor, Mrs May, described the monarch as ""an extraordinary woman, who has dedicated her life to the service of her people and our family of nations"". Mr Cameron said: ""There can be no finer example of dignified public duty and service."" Leader of the opposition, Sir Keir Starmer, echoed these sentiments, saying he would like to express his ""deepest thanks"" for 70 years of ""unparalleled public service"". The Labour leader added: ""Her Majesty The Queen has been one vital and valued constant in an ever-changing world, representing security and stability for our country, during the ups and downs of the last seven decades."" A message from the White House said the Queen had, over her 70-year reign, ""strengthened the ties of friendship, shared ideals, and faith in democracy that forever unite our countries"". This video can not be played On Saturday, the Queen made jokes as she cut a cake at a reception for her Platinum Jubilee The Queen used the eve of her Jubilee to directly address the unresolved question of Camilla's future title. There had been suggestions Camilla would be known as Princess Consort. The usual precedent would have been for Camilla to automatically become Queen when Charles was King, but because of uncertainty about public opinion it had been suggested that might not be the case.

"What would get you out of your car? Tricky when you think most journeys in Scotland are made by car, according to Scottish Transport Statistics 2020. But the Scottish government plans to slash car journey distances by 20% by 2030. It's to tackle climate change. Because domestic transport, including car travel, makes up Scotland's biggest chunk of emissions. The plans are in a""route map"",external. So what do you think? What do you want? I've been to southern Scotland to ask just that. And among the ideas and suggestions are win-win solutions, for both people and planet. Improving access to cycling is part of the government proposal. So I've met up with Aneela McKenna. As we cycle the path in Galashiels, she explains it's great that action on climate change is being taken, but people can't be left behind. She describes herself as a diversity campaigner for cycling, working with a number of cycle groups including women, refugees, people of colour and young girls. Aneela McKenna, left, cycles this route regularly but feels unsafe using it when it is dark And she explains one of the barriers to cycling is around safety, which for her is crucial to address to get people out of their cars and on their bikes. Better accessibility and signage too on paths. She says: ""If you look around you and at the surroundings, this path is very narrow, and you can see that there's no lighting. And for me as a woman and a woman of colour, I don't feel safe to use the path when it's dark, and it's at nightâ¦ ""What would make me feel safe is some lighting, some lighting would be fantastic. I'd love to see the path widened as well. So, when you're passing people, again, you feel safe, comfortable. ""And even if you just look at actually brightening up the environment itself, it might bring the communities here."" It's not just cycling -  the Scottish government plans also include investment in bus and train travel. On Biggar high street I met a group of public transport campaigners. These campaigners in Biggar believe much still needs to be done to make alternatives to the car attractive ""Having the ability to travel easily? It's going to be a massive win for anyone that's not able to travel and especially young people who can't or who don't know how to drive yet and don't want to be inconveniencing their parents all the time,"" 17-year-old school student Jake explains to me. For people - such as him and his peers - who are aged under 22, the provision of nationwide free bus travel is part of the plan to get us out of our cars. But Jake doesn't think it solves the whole problem. He says: ""I think it's about regularity to make the buses usableâ¦ a minimum really every hourâ¦ In citiesâ¦ if buses are cancelled or aren't turning up, you've got another one in 20 minutes, if not sooner. Whereas somewhere rural like this, if you're missing a bus that's you having to wait around for a long amount of time."" Improving online services so we don't have to travel so much and having neighbourhoods where your everyday needs are met locally within a 20-minute walk, wheel or cycle from home are also in the proposals. But for Jen Crighton, a mum-of-four, it's all very well if you're in town, but what if you live rurally? ""My ideal scenario, most recently would have been if I had managed to get social housing within Biggar,"" she says. ""I was quite prepared to give my car up at that point because there's better links in Biggar itselfâ¦ Where I live just now my car is an essential. ""So most of my remaining budget, anything at the end of the month has to go on my car and making sure that my car stays on the road. It's not only just school and social aspects, it's medical."" Another part of the action plan is to invest in more active travel routes that are safe to use and accessible. And that includes walking. Thelma Ingram tells me she stopped driving seven years ago because of increasing sight loss. She wants this move for the environment to also work for her and others in similar positions. She says improving accessibility to public transport and walkways would give her more independence. ""I have severe difficulties moving about certain environments here and in Biggar and will have in other towns because we do not have good pavements or crossings,"" she says. ""I would like things to be designed for people who are disabled rather than us being an after-thought which we very often are."" At the moment, to get to hospital appointments, it would take her four hours by public transport there and back, she explains. She puts this down to poor connections. So design for her, from timetabling to vehicles, is crucial. ""I'm a great fan of Edinburgh tram,"" she says. ""And the reason is it's the most easy piece of transport to use. It's level accessâ¦ there are announcements, it's very clear where I'm going. And it is possible to get somewhere very quickly. ""And I think that kind of model needs to be thought about not necessarily a tram, but just basically designing things so that the passenger is accounted for and not just shoved about, as if they were a piece of luggage."" The Scottish government says the ""route map"" contains more than 30 interventions which cover many of the opinions covered, including active travel, accessibility, public transport and 20-minute neighbourhoods. The option to have a say on cutting car travel and climate change is in place until 6 April.

"The assembly is still in place despite the collapse of the executive The ex-Northern Ireland secretary who helped restore power-sharing at Stormont in 2020 has described the fresh crisis as ""deeply depressing"". Julian Smith was speaking as MPs approved legislation based on proposals he helped draft two years ago. The bill helps protect the assembly from future collapse. It removes the duty on the government to set a date for an election if the roles of first and deputy first minister are not replaced this week. The bill also allows the assembly to continue without an executive for at least six months. Paul Givan resigned as first minister on Thursdayin protest at the Northern Ireland Protocol. It triggered the collapse of the executive, but the legislation which passed its final hurdle in the House of Commons on Monday allows the assembly to remain in place. TheNI Ministers, Elections and Petitions of Concern Billcould also come into play after the assembly election in Mayif the parties fail to fill the posts of first and deputy first ministers. MPs approved a House of Lords amendment to the bill which allows it to be applied retrospectively, to cover the resignation of Mr Givan. It will now need to receive royal assent by Thursday. Julian Smith was involved in restoring devolution in 2020 Julian Smith was secretary of state for Northern Ireland when thethe New Decade New Approach dealwas signed. It paved the way for the legislation which is now going through parliament to stave off future immediate collapses. He told the Commons: ""The lack of a first minister and deputy first minister and the fall of the executive is really bad news for the majority of men and women who want good governance. ""The majority who want to get on with day-to-day life are held hostage by parallel universe of elements of the Northern Ireland political world."" Mr Smith also questioned whether it was ""just coincidence"" that the retrospective power had been recently added to the bill by peers and said many people may have questions about the level of knowledge the government could have had ahead of the crisis unfolding. But Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson insisted there was ""no question of collusion"" with the government over when it had taken its decision to withdraw from the first minister role. He maintained that unless the government makes changes to the protocol, his party cannot continue to operate within the current structures. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood hit out at the prime minister for being ""nowhere to be seen"" since the crisis had begun. ""If I was a unionist, I would be looking very closely at what this government is doing and how it treats them,"" he added. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the DUP could not stay in government without changes to the NI Protocol Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said parties who walked away from power-sharing did so ""at their peril"", as ultimately there remained no alternative to the Stormont institutions. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis was not present during the debate but his colleague, Northern Ireland minister Conor Burns, responded for the government. He said the ""clear message"" to the DUP was that it should return to government immediately in the interests of stability, and that negotiations with the EU over the protocol would continue until a resolution is found. Mr Burns also said he had spent five nights in Northern Ireland last week speaking to a range of communities and that the government would continue to work for everyone. Earlier on Monday, Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill, who lost her role as deputy first minister when Mr Givan stood down, urged assembly members (MLAs) at Stormont to salvage what they could from the ""chaos"" of Mr Givan's resignation. Highlighting the public apology for victims of institutional abuse which wasto have been made by the first and deputy first ministers in March, Ms O'Neill added the DUP had caused ""real hurt and trauma"". Michelle O'Neill lost her post of deputy first minister after Paul Givan's resignation Afterwards, she told the media she wanted to ""fast-track"" some pieces of legislation, however, there cannot be an agreement now on a draft budget. SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon said her party would ""not be falling into the DUP's trap"" and accused them of a instigating a ""manufactured self-serving political crisis"". The Alliance Party's Andrew Muir said MLAs should not ""knock-off early"" and must work to the end of the mandate. Givan resignation triggers fresh political crisis NI First Minister Paul Givan announces resignation Commons passes Bill to prevent Stormont collapse Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said parties should come together to write to the EU about their concerns over the protocol, adding: ""if the aim is to stand here and just poke each other in the eye for the sake of poking each other in the eye then we will not make this place better for the people here."" Defending his party's action, the former DUP leader Edwin Poots told the assembly he was ""surprised that people couldn't see it coming"", and that there would not be an executive ""to come back to"" while checks exist under the Northern Ireland Protocol. Earlier, Speaker Alex Maskey met party whips to discuss how to progress legislation which is still outstanding. At the start of business on Monday, he said it was his intention the assembly passes ""as much legislation as possible"" in the weeks ahead. He also said he had no contact with the Northern Ireland Office about ending the assembly's mandate at an ""early stage"". On Monday, MLAs passed the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill, which gives parents the right to two weeks' paid statutory leave if they have suffered the loss of a child, including through miscarriage. The bill had initially brought Northern Ireland into line with employment laws in Great Britain, however following an amendment, NI will now be the first jurisdiction in Europe to legislate for miscarriage employment rights, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons said. ""Following a full public consultation, my department will draw up detailed miscarriage leave and pay regulations, with an introduction date following shortly after,"" the minister added. Paul Givan resigned as first minister as part of the DUP's protest against the NI Protocol The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) pulled Mr Givan out of Stormontin protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has saidit will be ""difficult"" for his party to form a government after the upcoming election,if issues around the post-Brexit trading mechanism are not addressed. This has prompted Sinn FÃ©in to call for an early election, after Ms O'Neill was removed as deputy first minister. The roles are joint and one cannot continue without the other. Without the two top positions being filled, the executive - Northern Ireland's government - can no longer meet. Under previous rules, the resignation of the first or deputy first minister would have set in motion a seven-day countdown to re-nominate the roles. If candidates were not successfully re-nominated the Northern Ireland secretary would then be required to set a date for a fresh assembly election and the institutions would immediately collapse. However, when power-sharing was restored at Stormont in January 2020,after three years of deadlock,it was agreed Westminster would change the rules to avoid this.

"Australia implemented some of the world's strictest border controls during the pandemic Australia has announced the reopening of its borders to vaccinated tourists and other visa holders for the first time in almost two years. ""If you're double vaccinated, we look forward to welcoming you back,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. The reopening, on 21 February, will be welcome news for many sectors including international education. Australia has had some of the world's strictest border controls throughout the coronavirus pandemic. In March 2020, the government closed the borders. It barred most foreigners from entering the country and put caps on total arrivals to help combat Covid. Some international students and skilled migrants have been permitted to enter the country since last December. The battle to open up 'Fortress Australia' Australia revisited - a country changed by Covid On Monday, Mr Morrison said those entering Australia when the borders fully reopened would need to provide proof of vaccination: ""That's the rule. Everyone is expected to abide by it,"" he said. Unvaccinated travellers who have a medical reason for not being jabbed will still need to apply for a travel exemption and, if successful, will be required to quarantine at a hotel. Melinda de Boer, 44, from Switzerland, told the BBC that she was finally planning to travel to Melbourne to see her mum, who had breast cancer last year. ""Her grandchildren haven't seen her for nearly three years. We are looking to go in the October or December holidays,"" she said. Ms De Boer said she was reluctant to book at the moment and was ""worried about the airlines and masses of people going"". This video can not be played Midnight rush for shops and pubs as Sydney reopens (October 2021) Since the start of the pandemic, Australia has implemented strict measures to help fight the spread of Covid infections - even banning its own people from leaving the country last year. Despite most of the country opening up, the state of Western Australia (WA) still has tight measures. It is currently closed to non-residents, including those from other Australian states, unless they have permission to enter. There had been plans to open WA's borders to interstate and international tourists this month, but that move was postponed indefinitely due to the Omicron variant. Australia has so far reported more than 2.7 million cases of coronavirus and more than 4,240 Covid-related deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

"The long-running Australian soap has launched the careers of pop stars Jason Donavan and Kylie Minogue Neighbours has been dropped by Channel 5, putting the long-running Australian soap opera's future under threat. The UK network announced on Sunday it would stop showing the programme later this year, after airing it for more than a decade. Singer and former Neighbours star Jason Donovan said the soap ""changed the Australian television landscape"". Australian broadcaster Network 10 said it would look for a new partner to work with to keep it on air. The television network denied filming of the show - which began in 1985 - was being paused. The broadcaster added it was committed to keeping the show going if a new broadcasting partner could be found. Set and filmed in Melbourne, Neighbours was first broadcast in Australia in 1985 and launched on BBC One a year later. It became a huge hit in the UK and in Australia, and helped launch the career of numerous stars, including Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan, Guy Pearce and later Margot Robbie. Channel 5 said it knew the decision to axe the show - which attracts more than one million viewers per day in the UK - would disappoint many, confirming it would no longer air ""beyond this summer"". But it added its ""current focus is on increasing our investment in original UK drama, which has strong appeal for our UK viewers"". Singer Kylie Minogue was one of the first stars to come out of the programme in the 1980s The soap has featured many notable Australian actors, actresses and performers over the years, many of whom have gone on to have glittering careers. Perhaps the most high profile of these stars to make her name on Neighbours is singer Kylie Minogue, who acted in the early years of the soap, playing Charlene between 1986 and 1988. Russell Crowe briefly featured in the soap opera in 1987 Other people to come off the Ramsay Street set include Oscar winner and Gladiator star Russell Crowe, musician Jason Donovan and actor Guy Pearce. More recently, the show featured Suicide Squad star Margot Robbie from 2008 to 2011 and Liam Hemsworth between 2007 and 2008. Margot Robbie starred in the show before launching her Hollywood career Other people to have made their names from appearing on the show over the years include the singers Natalie Imbruglia, Holly Vallance and Delta Goodrem. Actor and singer Donovan, who played Scott Robinson from 1986 to 1989, wrote on Twitter: ""It launched many careers over decades including mine. ""Engaged and entertained audiences for generations. Hoping that it will find a new home with another UK broadcaster and continue to provide opportunity and entertainment."" Former BBC One controller Lord Grade told Radio 4's Today programme that he initially put the soap in ""the wrong slot"" before a conversation with his school-age daughter made him think again. In a statement, Network 10 said: ""As outlined in the email to Neighbours cast and crew, it is our intention to continue our association with Neighbours if another broadcast partner comes forward. ""Network 10 has an ongoing commitment to the show, the cast and crew and is hopeful that Fremantle will find a new production partner. We will provide further updates as they become available."" The soap, which launched in 1985, has been more popular in the UK than in Australia for years - so Channel 5's announcement has thrown its future into doubt. In Australia it has been shown on digital channel 10 Peach since 2011, when it lost a slot following the nightly news on the main Network 10 schedule, leaving it reliant on the UK broadcaster for production costs.

However, in an email to staff, Fremantle Media executive producer Jason Herbison said production would stop indefinitely because of the lack of a broadcast partner to provide financial backing. In the message, seen by theSydney Morning Herald,external, staff were asked to attend a meeting on Monday by Mr Herbison, who added filming would go on until 10 June. The email said: ""Our audience remains steady and Channel Ten would love the show to continue if we could find another broadcast partner to replace [Channel 5]. ""These discussions are ongoing, however there is no new broadcaster at the moment and production must end, effectively resting the show. ""We are so proud of the show, you all and everything that you've achieved. But for now, this chapter is closing and we want to work together to give Neighbours the amazing send-off it deserves."" The soap has featured many guest stars from the UK in recent years, including Amanda Holden, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Ryan Thomas and Janet Street-Porter. In 2016, BBC Newsround had kidsreact to the show's iconic wedding scenebetween Scott and Charlene - played by Donovan and Minogue - from 1988.
