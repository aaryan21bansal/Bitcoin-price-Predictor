"Dame Deborah said Prince William went out of his way to speak to her family Dame Deborah James has thanked Prince William for ""going above and beyond to make a very special memory"" in visiting her family home to confer her damehood. Podcaster Dame Deborah, 40, revealed last week she was receiving end-of-life care for bowel cancer, adding the five days since had been the ""most surreal, mind blowing, humbling"" of her life. She has raised nearly Â£6m for cancer research since revealing her prognosis. ""Can't quite believe im actually a Dame!"" she wrote on social media. Dame Deborah has received widespread praise for her no-nonsense approach to talking about her cancer publicly - particularly as co-presenter on theBBC's You, Me and the Big C podcast- and has shared her experiences of treatment and daily life with her social media followers since her diagnosis in 2016. The Duke of Cambridge visited the mother of two at her parents' home, where she is spending her remaining time with her family, on Friday to present her with the honour. Writing on Instagram, Dame Deborah said: ""My family are being amazing and as emotional as it all is, we are finding so much to smile about in the sadness."" She explained she was ""getting weaker and more tired"" and had been ""running off pure adrenaline"" over the last few days. ""But my word, I always said I wanted to slide in sideways when my time is up, with a massive smile, no regrets and a big glass of champagne! Still my intention!!!"" Are we failing young people with cancer? Deborah James made a dame by William at her home William and Kate praise for Big C's Deborah James All I want is more life, says Big C's Deborah James She launched the fund - to pay for research into personalised medicine for cancer patients and to support campaigns to raise awareness of bowel cancer, on Monday - with an initial goal of Â£250,000. It came after she revealed she did not know how long she had left to live after stopping treatment and moving to hospice-at-home care. After Prince William conferred the damehood on Friday, the former deputy headteacher wrote: she was ""utterly honoured"" at being joined by him for  afternoon tea and champagne, adding he had ""spent a generous amount of time talking to my whole family"". ""It's quite surreal having a royal pop in at home, and yes you can imagine the cleaning antics and preparation went off the scale - but it was all irrelevant because William was so kind and he put us all at ease,"" she added. Prince William is a patron of the Royal Marsden Hospital, a specialist cancer treatment centre that will be one of the main beneficiaries of Dame Deborah's new fund, alongside Cancer Research UK and Bowel Cancer UK. After his visit, she noted the prince was ""clearly passionate"" about improving cancer treatment outcomes a the hospital, adding he was ""welcome back anytime"". Damehoods and knighthoods are usually announced as part of the New Year Honours or the Queen's Birthday Honours. But, in exceptional circumstances, some are announced at other times of the year - as happened with NHS fundraiser Captain Sir Tom Moore's knighthood. The visit by the duke was arranged similarly quickly, as he had just returned from a two-day visit to the west of Scotland with his wife Catherine. William and Catherine - who donated to Dame Deborah's research fund - said earlier this week that her ""tireless efforts"" in raising awareness of cancer were inspirational, and thanked her for ""giving hope"" to those living with the disease. Dame Deborah began co-presenting You, Me and the Big C alongside Lauren Mahon and BBC Radio 5 Live newsreader Rachael Bland in 2018, with the show earning praise for its frank discussion of cancer. They spoke to celebrity guests and addressed practical matters, including hair loss, tips for dealing with finances and telling your nearest and dearest about illnesses. Blanddied at the age of 40, six months after the show launched. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer two years earlier.

"Eurovision favourites Ukraine win after a resounding lead from the public vote Their folk-rap group Kalush Orchestra asks for help for Ukrainian forces in besieged Mariupol, at the end of their song The UK's Sam Ryder comes second in the contest - our highest position in over 20 years Ukraine had been the favourite to win the contest, although the UK was in the lead after the jury vote Some fans have been saying online they wanted to see fewer ballads and more bangers among the 25 entries Switzerland gets zero votes from the public vote, but 78 from the jury Emma Saunders, Helen Bushby, Andree Massiah and Andre Rhoden-Paul Phew! Well, that's it for another year. Thanks for joining us on our rollercoaster ride. It's safe to say we're feeling much more upbeat this year after the UK came second!

This video can not be played The moment Ukraine won the 2022 Eurovision Song Contest.  Sophie WilliamsBBC News, Lviv, Ukraine Here in Ukraine, people have been describing the country's win as a ""victory"". As soon as Kalush Orchestra were announced as the winners, fans flocked to Telegram in order to share their excitement at the news. Many people shared popular phrases such as ""glory to the heroes"". ""We definitely have a victory ahead,"" one person wrote. Others thanked friendly countries for voting and sharing their support for Ukraine. ""Thank you to all who supported. We are waiting and we believe in another victory. Glory to Ukraine!"", one person wrote on Instagram.  Mark SavageMusic correspondent, BBC News Ukraine's win raises a question over who will host next year's Eurovision ceremony. The winning country usually stages the show, but Ukraine is unlikely to have that capability. Its state broadcaster, UA:PBC was targetted in the opening days of the war, and their commentator, Timur Miroshnychenko, had to broadcast his contributions from an underground bunker. In the past, other broadcasters have stepped in when a country is unable or unwilling to host the contest... most recently in 1980, when the Netherlands took over from Israel, who declined to run the show after winning in two consecutive years. Eurovision organisers the EBU have just released a statement saying they will consider all options for 2023. ""Obviously, there are unique challenges involved in hosting next year's competition,"" the statement read. ""However, as in any other year, we look forward to discussing all the requirements and responsibilities involved in hosting the competition with UA:PBC and all other stakeholders to ensure we have the most suitable set-up for the 67th Eurovision Song Contest."" UK entry Sam found fame and a huge fanbase via TikTok after he began posting covers during the first Covid-19 lockdown in 2020. In a statement, Tik Tok said: âFrom Samâs very first TikTok, to
his fantastic result at Eurovison, weâve been fans every step of the way. Our
community always knew his star power, his artistic talent and his phenomenal

"Health campaigners say the government's obesity strategy is ""falling apart"", after it delayed bans on multi-buy deals for junk food and pre-watershed TV advertising for at least a year. Chef Jamie Oliver said banning adverts was vital to protecting child health. Multi-buy deals made ""people spend more on junk, and less on healthy food"", the Children's Food Campaign said. But ministers say they aredeferring the policy to assess its impacton the cost of living crisis. The Department of Health and Social Care said the planned ban - due to be brought in in October - on ""buy one get one free"" deals for food and drinks high in fat, salt or sugar as well as free refills for soft drinks, would be put on hold for 12 months. Plans to restrict TV advertising of junk foods before the 21:00 GMT watershed and paid-for online adverts are also being paused and will not come into force until January 2024, the department added. It added curbs on junk food placement in stores would still go ahead this October. 'Rising prices harder on money than the pandemic' Recession fears grow as rising prices hit spending Why is the cost of living going up? Writing on Twitter, Mr Oliver - who has long campaigned to improve children's access to healthier food - said restricting junk food advertising was crucial. ""This is a wasted opportunity and it starts to erode the whole obesity strategy - which at some point looked progressive and world leading written down, but is falling apart when it comes to acting on these policies,"" he said. ""Parents and kids don't want to hear any more excuses from the government. I really hope the Prime Minister @BorisJohnson proves me wrong and shows real leadership to give young people a healthier and fairer future."" Chef and healthy eating campaigner Jamie Oliver said the government's obesity strategy was being eroded by the delays The delay was also criticised as ""unconservative"" by former health minister Lord Bethall, who said it would be ""extremely difficult"" for the government to come back to the plans before the next election. Lord Bethell, who previously served in Boris Johnson's government, said illnesses caused by excessive junk food consumption were placing a burden on the NHS and the taxpayer. Public healthresearch commissioned by the government,externalshows consumers buy around 20% more junk food than they would ordinarily when it is sold via promotion. It also found that people do not stockpile the extra food and drink, but increase their consumption instead. Astudy released by Cancer Research UK,externalin March has also found ""strong evidence"" of targeted advertising of junk food on social media directly influencing young people aged 11 to 19 into making unhealthy choices. The charity's chief executive, Michelle Mitchell, said she was ""incredibly disappointed"" over the decision to postpone the bans, saying obesity was the second biggest preventable cause of cancer in the UK. About two thirds of adults in England were overweight or obese - with 28% of these considered to be obese - according to theNHS' most recent health survey in 2019,external. Among children aged four to five, 14% are obese, with a further 13% overweight, theNational Child Measurement Programme,externalfound last year. When surveying children aged 10 to 11 years old, this rose to 25.5% obese and 15.4% overweight. These figures showed large increases on the previous year, when 9.9% of children aged four to give and 21% of children aged 10-11 were obese. Source: NHS Digital Barbara Crowther, of the Children's Food Campaign, said ministers should be urgently curbing multi-buy offers. ""Obesity is spiking and millions of families can't afford to put proper food on the table. Multi-buy offers make people spend more on junk, and less on healthy food,"" she said. ""This delay threatens the UK target to halve childhood obesity by 2030. Boris is playing politics with our children's health."" Labour's shadow health minister Andrew Gwynne said: ""Instead of cutting childhood obesity, preventing ill-health and easing pressure on the NHS, this chaotic government is performing another U-turn."" However, public health minister Maggie Throup insisted the government remained committed to tackling the issue of childhood obesity. ""Pausing restrictions on deals like 'buy one get one free' will allow us to understand its impact on consumers in light of an unprecedented global economic situation,"" she added. This video can not be played The costs of the NHS dealing with obesity in the UK are ""vast"" and it was time to ""get a grip on it"", says the PM. The British Retail Consortium said the ban on multi-buy deals was unlikely to make much difference as retailers have ""largely moved away"" from them in recent years. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the consortium, welcomed the delay on adverting rules as ""one less distraction"" for companies looking to focus on keeping prices down. And industry body the Food and Drink Federation argued that it makes sense to delay restrictions on multi-buy deals as families and manufacturers struggle with high inflation. It would also give the industry time to prepare for a change in the law, it said. When the government unveiled the planned curbs, some of the UK's biggest food companies, including Britvic, Kellogg's and Mars,criticised them as disproportionate and lacking evidence. Last month,Kellogg's said it would take the government to courtover the curbs preventing some cereals from being placed in key locations in stores due to their high sugar content. Laws requiring large restaurants, cafes and takeaways to list calories on their menuscame into force last month. What do you think about the delay to banning multi-buy deals for junk food?

"Employees disinfect a Pyongyang supermarket in October last year North Korea's rapidly spreading Covid-19 outbreak is a ""great disaster"" for the country, its leader Kim Jong-un has said, according to state media. Mr Kim called for an all-out battle to tackle the spread of the virus during an emergency meeting on Saturday. It comes after officials announced the first confirmed cases on Thursday - although experts believe the virus has likely been circulating for some time. There are fears a major outbreak could have dire consequences in North Korea. Its population of 25 million is vulnerable due to the lack of a vaccination programme and poor healthcare system. What will the pandemic look like in North Korea? And on Saturday, state media reported that there had been half a million cases of unexplained fever in recent weeks. The country has limited testing capabilities so most Covid cases are not confirmed. That figure marked a major increase on the numbers given on both Friday and Thursday, potentially providing some indication of the scale of North Korea's outbreak. ""The spread of the malignant epidemic is [the greatest] turmoil to fall on our country since the founding,"" the official KCNA news agency quoted Mr Kim as saying. He blamed the crisis on bureaucratic and medical incompetence, and suggested lessons could be learnt from the response of countries like neighbouring China. Kim Jong-un convenes a Covid response meeting on 12 May State media reports that 27 people have died since April after suffering a fever. The reports do not say whether they tested positive for Covid, apart from one death in the capital Pyongyang which was confirmed to be a case of the Omicron variant. Why doesn't North Korea have enough food? How dangerous is the situation in North Korea? The unprecedented admission on Thursday marked the end of two years of North Korean claims to be free of Covid. The secretive country rejected offers from the international community to supply millions of AstraZeneca and Chinese-made jabs last year. Instead, it claimed it had controlled Covid by sealing its borders early in January 2020. It shares land borders with South Korea and China, which have both battled outbreaks. China is now struggling to contain an Omicron wave with lockdowns in its biggest cities. At a meeting outlining new Covid rules on Thursday, Mr Kim was seen wearing a face mask on television for what was believed to be the first time. He ordered ""maximum emergency"" virus controls, which appeared to include orders for local lockdowns and gathering restrictions in workplaces. South Korea has said it offered humanitarian aid after Thursday's announcement, but Pyongyang is yet to respond. This video can not be played A defector tells the BBC about TV choices in North Korea.

"Boris Johnson is to tell Northern Ireland's leaders that any move to change post-Brexit trade rules must also restore power-sharing at Stormont. The prime minister is visiting Northern Ireland on Monday amid a political crisis sparked by tensions over the Northern Ireland Protocol. Following the 5 May election, the anti-protocol Democratic Unionist Party has refused to engage with the assembly. A new administration cannot be formed without them. A spokesperson for No 10 saidMr Johnson would hold private meetings with the partiesand the UK government would ""play its part to ensure political stability"". The prime minister is expected to say there is ""no substitute for strong local leadership"". He will urge members of the Stormont assembly to ""get back to work to deal with the bread-and-butter issues"". But the prime minister will also tell political leaders that ""there will be a necessity to act"" on the protocol if the EU does not change its position. Sinn FÃ©in's President Mary Lou McDonald and vice president Michelle O'Neill say the protocol is going nowhere Mr Johnson's visit coincides with increased speculation that the UK government is poised to introduce legislationto strip away parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol,a part of the UK-EU Brexit dealwhich keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods, puts a trade border in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It was designed to ensure free trade could continue across the Irish land border, but it has been opposed by unionist politicians. The DUP has argued the protocol has eroded the foundations devolution has been built upon and undermined Northern Ireland's position in the UK. The EU has acknowledged that the protocol has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses and it put forward proposals in October to try to ease that burden - it said they would mean a reduction in paperwork and checks on goods entering NI from Great Britain. However, last week the UK rejected these plans saying they would make things worse. On Monday, Mr Johnson will say that the UK and EU's shared objective should be for a reformed protocol to enjoy the broadest possible cross-community support when it faces a consent vote at Stormont in 2024. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem What do voters think of the NI Protocol? How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed The Northern Ireland Assembly election on 5 May cemented a majority for politicians who accept the protocol, including the new largest party, the republican party Sinn FÃ©in. The DUP's move to block the election of a speaker on Friday means the Northern Ireland Assembly cannot function. The party said its actions sent a clear message about its opposition to the protocol. Its leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the prime minister must ""outline what he intends to do"". Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says his party will not support the election of a speaker until there is action taken over the protocol On Saturday, Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald accused the prime minister of being ""in cahoots"" with the DUP. Ms McDonald said the protocol was going nowhere and both she and would-be first minister Michelle O'Neill would be telling Mr Johnson so on Monday. ""The DUP have not simply called a halt to the formation of an executive, they have equally attempted to place a veto on the operation of the assembly,"" she said. ""The British government have assisted the DUP in these blocking tactics."" By refusing to support the election of a speaker, the DUP - previously the largest party in Stormont and holder of the post of first minister - has blocked a government from forming.

"Both Sweden and Finland have increased their military budget in recent years Sweden is now set to join neighbouring Finland as a new Nato member, after Turkey's president withdrew a series of objections. Finland officially joined the Western defensive alliance in April, bringing the number of member states to 31. The two Nordic states have long maintained military neutrality, but that changed in February 2022 when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine - the biggest war on the European continent since World War Two. It was Magdalena Andersson of Sweden and Finland's Sanna Marin who kick-started the countries' bids to join Nato in 2022 Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion shattered a long-standing sense of stability in northern Europe, leaving Sweden and Finland feeling vulnerable. Finnish ex-Prime Minister Alexander Stubb said joining the alliance was a ""done deal"" for his country as soon as Russian troops invaded Ukraine last year. For many Finns, the war brought a haunting sense of familiarity. It was in late 1939 that the Soviets invaded Finland. For more than three months the Finnish army put up fierce resistance, despite being heavily outnumbered. Finland held out until March 1940 but lost its eastern province of Karelia to Russia. They avoided occupation, but ended up losing 10% of their territory. Watching the war in Ukraine unfold was like reliving this history, said Iro Sarkka, a political scientist at the University of Helsinki. Finns were looking at their 1,340km (830 mile) border with Russia, she said, and thinking: ""Could this happen to us?"" Finland held out until March 1940 but lost its eastern province of Karelia to Russia Sweden has also felt endangered in recent years. Sweden's military weakness came into full view in 2013 when Russian bomber planes were able to simulate an attack on Stockholm and Sweden needed Nato help to ward them off. In 2014, Swedes were transfixed by reports that a Russian submarine was lurking in the shallow waters of the Stockholm archipelago. In 2018, every household received army pamphlets titled ""if crisis or war comes"" - the first time they were sent out since 1991. For a population of only 5.5 million, Finland's conscript military is highly trained and potentially large. It trains at least 21,000 conscripts every year and has a reserve force of 900,000, soits wartime strength is estimated at 280,000,external. Sweden's military capacity is far smaller at 57,000. But it brought back conscription at the start of 2018, after suspending it in 2010, and the current number of up to 6,000 conscripts will rise to 8,000 in 2025. From the 1990s Sweden cut back the size of its military and changed its priorities from territorial defence to peacekeeping missions around the world. But that went into reverse with Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014 and its increasing threat in the Baltic region. In some ways, not much. Sweden and Finland became official partners of Nato in 1994 and have since become major contributors to the alliance. They have taken part in several Nato missions since the end of the Cold War. The two countries will for the first time have security guarantees from nuclear states under Nato's Article 5, which views an attack on one member state as an attack on all. Historian Henrik Meinander said Finns were mentally prepared for membership, following a succession of small steps towards Nato since the fall of the Soviet Union. In 1992, Helsinki bought 64 US combat planes. Three years later, it joined the European Union, alongside Sweden, and every Finnish government since then has reviewed the so-called Nato option. Finland has already reached Nato's agreed defence spending target of 2% of GDP, and Sweden has drawn up plans to do so by 2026. Sweden may have been neutral during the Cold War but at the time it kept a force of at least 15,000 soldiers on the Baltic island of Gotland and has recently rebuilt its presence there. It hopes to build up its full-time military as well as its conscript force in the coming years. Is Nato's Nordic expansion a threat or boost to Europe? Russian President Vladimir Putin believes Nato expansion is a direct threat to his country's security - and claimed it was the reason he launched the 2022 war in Ukraine. But his invasion had the opposite effect by only serving to extend Nato's reach. Finland's accession was a particular setback, further extending Nato's influence over the Baltic Sea. And it brought a warning from the Kremlin of unspecified ""military-technical"" measures in retaliation. Russia's foreign ministry said both Sweden and Finland had been warned of the consequences if they did choose to join. Now that Sweden has been given the green light by Turkey to become a member, the Kremlin has said it will respond with the same kind of measures it proposed for Finland. What those measures would be is still vague. Russia says it has moved tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, and they could reach Finland and Sweden. But former Finnish PM Alexander Stubb has warned that Russian cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns and occasional airspace violations are more likely. Under Article Five, Finland has - and Sweden will - soon have the commitment of the entire alliance to come to their aid if they come under attack. Their membership also makes defending the Nordic and Baltic region far more comprehensive. But there is a significant minority, at least in Sweden, who believe membership will have an adverse effect. Deborah Solomon, from the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society, argued that Nato's nuclear deterrence increased tensions and risked an arms race with Russia. This complicated peace efforts, she said, and made Sweden a less safe place. Another fear is that in joining the alliance, Sweden would lose its leading role in global nuclear disarmament efforts. Many of Sweden's Nato-sceptics look back to the period between the 1960s and '80s, when Sweden used its neutrality to position itself as an international mediator. Joining Nato would be abandoning that dream, Ms Solomon said. Finland's neutrality was very different. It came about as a condition of peace imposed by the Soviet Union in a 1948 ""friendship agreement"". It was seen as a pragmatic way of surviving and maintaining the country's independence. If Sweden's neutrality was a matter of identity and ideology, in Finland it was a question of existence, said Henrik Meinander. Part of the reason Sweden could even afford to have a debate about Nato membership was because it used Finland and the Baltics as a ""buffer zone"", he said. Finland abandoned its neutrality after the Soviet Union collapsed. It looked to the West and sought to free itself from the Soviet sphere of influence. Turkey, and to a lesser extent Hungary, initially resisted both applications. Ankara accused the Nordic nations of supporting what it called terrorist organisations, including the Kurdish militant PKK and the Gulen movement, which Turkey blames for an attempted coup in 2016. Kurds make up 15-20% of Turkey's population, and have been persecuted by Turkish authorities for generations. But it was Sweden that triggered most hostility as Kurds have mobilised successfully in politics there over the decades. President Erdogan asked how ""how a country with terrorists on the streets... can contribute to Nato"". His main demand was to end political, financial and ""arms support"" to militants. Sweden updated its terror laws in June 2023 to outlaw taking part in an extremist group in a way that supported it - and weeks later a Kurdish man was jailed for attempting to finance terrorism. But there was some suggestion, denied by Turkey, that its main reason for resisting Sweden's bid was that Ankara was waiting for the US to provide F-16 fighter jets.

Well, that's it for another year. Thanks for joining us on our rollercoaster ride. It's safe to say we're feeling much more upbeat this year after the UK came second!

This video can not be played The moment Ukraine won the 2022 Eurovision Song Contest.  Sophie WilliamsBBC News, Lviv, Ukraine Here in Ukraine, people have been describing the country's win as a ""victory"". As soon as Kalush Orchestra were announced as the winners, fans flocked to Telegram in order to share their excitement at the news. Many people shared popular phrases such as ""glory to the heroes"". ""We definitely have a victory ahead,"" one person wrote. Others thanked friendly countries for voting and sharing their support for Ukraine. ""Thank you to all who supported. We are waiting and we believe in another victory. Glory to Ukraine!"", one person wrote on Instagram.  Mark SavageMusic correspondent, BBC News Ukraine's win raises a question over who will host next year's Eurovision ceremony. The winning country usually stages the show, but Ukraine is unlikely to have that capability. Its state broadcaster, UA:PBC was targetted in the opening days of the war, and their commentator, Timur Miroshnychenko, had to broadcast his contributions from an underground bunker. In the past, other broadcasters have stepped in when a country is unable or unwilling to host the contest... most recently in 1980, when the Netherlands took over from Israel, who declined to run the show after winning in two consecutive years. Eurovision organisers the EBU have just released a statement saying they will consider all options for 2023. ""Obviously, there are unique challenges involved in hosting next year's competition,"" the statement read. ""However, as in any other year, we look forward to discussing all the requirements and responsibilities involved in hosting the competition with UA:PBC and all other stakeholders to ensure we have the most suitable set-up for the 67th Eurovision Song Contest."" UK entry Sam found fame and a huge fanbase via TikTok after he began posting covers during the first Covid-19 lockdown in 2020. In a statement, Tik Tok said: âFrom Samâs very first TikTok, to
his fantastic result at Eurovison, weâve been fans every step of the way. Our

"Finland has increased its military budget in recent years Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned his Finnish counterpart that joining Nato and abandoning Finland's neutral status would be a ""mistake"". He told Sauli NiinistÃ¶ there was no threat to Finland's security. The exchange came during a phone call made by the Finnish president, ahead of a formal request which Finland is expected to announce very soon. Sweden has also indicated its intention to join the Western alliance, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Finland shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border with Russia. Until now, it has stayed out of Nato to avoid antagonising its eastern neighbour. Mr Putin did not make a specific threat of retaliation over Finland's move, but the Russian foreign ministry has indicated there will be retaliation. Russia's decision to suspend electricity supplies to Finland is being seen as an early sign, however. Are Sweden and Finland going from neutral to Nato? What is Nato and could Finland and Sweden join? In its statement, Russian energy supplier RAO Nordic mentioned problems with payments. Finland national grid executive Reima Paivinen told the BBC the Russian suspension had not caused any problems. He said Russian imports accounted for around 10% of national supply, adding that they could be replaced from alternative sources. This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins onâ¦ Finland, Nato and Russia Following the phone call between Mr NiinistÃ¶ and Mr Putin on Saturday, the Kremlin said the Russian leader had stressed the ""end of the traditional policy of military neutrality would be a mistake since there is no threat to Finland's security"". It added: ""Such a change in the country's political orientation can have a negative impact on Russian-Finnish relations developed over years in a spirit of good neighbourliness and co-operation between partners."" Mr NiinistÃ¶ said he had told Mr Putin how recent moves by Russia, along with the invasion of Ukraine, ""have altered the security environment of Finland"". ""The conversation was direct and straight-forward and it was conducted without aggravations. Avoiding tensions was considered important,"" he said. A possible stumbling block to Swedish and Finnish membership of Nato is Turkey, after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused both countries of harbouring ""terrorist organisations"" and said he did not support their applications. It was seen as a reference to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Turkey regards as a terrorist organisation. For decades the PKK has fought with Turkey for a Kurdish homeland. Turkey also objects to a Syrian Kurdish militia called the People's Protection Units (YPG) ,which they say is an extension of the PKK - even though they have been allied with the US in the fight against so-called Islamic State. Both Sweden and Finland have Kurdish communities, and in Sweden's case some parliamentarians have Kurdish origins. President Erdogan did not provide any proof that these communities had links with the PKK. Foreign ministers from Sweden, Turkey and Finland are meeting to try to iron out their differences. Ahead of the talks, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu echoed the comments of his president but signalled a willingness to talk. ""A big majority of the Turkish people are against the membership of those countries who are supporting PKK terrorist organization ... but these are the issues that we need to talk of course with our NATO allies as well as these countries,"" AFP quoted him as saying. Nato, a Western military alliance, was founded in part to ward off threat from the Soviet Union in 1949. President Putin has mentioned Ukraine's intention to join the alliance as one of the reasons for the invasion of its neighbour.

"This video can not be played Watch: Mayor speaks of pain in wake of deadly shooting An 18-year-old white man has shot dead 10 people in a black neighbourhood of New York state in what authorities are calling a racially motivated attack. The man, named as Payton Gendron in court papers, was arrested after a stand-off at the scene - a supermarket in the city of Buffalo. He began firing in the store's car park before entering and continuing his rampage, streaming the attack online. US President Joe Biden condemned what he described as an ""abhorrent"" act. ""We are investigating this incident as both a hate crime and a case of racially-motivated violent extremism,"" said Stephen Belongia, from the FBI's Buffalo office, adding there was evidence of ""racial animosity."" CBS news reported that the attacker shouted racial slurs during the shooting and suggested that he had a racial slur written on his weapon.  He also apparently posted a manifesto online which included racist language and ideas. 'Bodies everywhere - Witnesses tell of Buffalo attack horror FBI hate crime reports spike to 12-year high in 2020 US gun culture in seven charts The suspect is believed to have driven for some 200 miles to reach the predominantly black area of the city. Three people were shot dead in the car park and the other seven were killed inside the supermarket, police said. Most of the victims were black. ""He exited his vehicle. He was very heavily armed.

"This video can not be played Watch: Mayor speaks of pain in wake of deadly shooting An 18-year-old white man has shot dead 10 people in a black neighbourhood of New York state in what authorities are calling a racially motivated attack. The man, named as Payton Gendron in court papers, was arrested after a stand-off at the scene - a supermarket in the city of Buffalo. He began firing in the store's car park before entering and continuing his rampage, streaming the attack online. US President Joe Biden condemned what he described as an ""abhorrent"" act. ""We are investigating this incident as both a hate crime and a case of racially-motivated violent extremism,"" said Stephen Belongia, from the FBI's Buffalo office, adding there was evidence of ""racial animosity."" CBS news reported that the attacker shouted racial slurs during the shooting and suggested that he had a racial slur written on his weapon.  He also apparently posted a manifesto online which included racist language and ideas.

"Ioana Stancu says it is fulfilling to work as a nurse after struggling with her own mental health A woman who became a psychiatric nurse after struggling with her own mental health has said it fulfils her soul. Ioana Stancu, 22, from Newport, went into nursing when her own mental health began to improve following a struggle with depression and anxiety. ""I do my job from the heart and not for the money,"" she said. Ioana now uses TikTok to encourage people to talk openly about their feelings, and reaches out to people so they know they are not alone. To mark Mental Health Awareness Week, BBC Wales spoke to people who use social media to share their own struggles. Better mental health support needed, charity says Crisis concerns for young peoples mental health Has the pandemic affected your mental health? Ioana, who moved to Wales from Romania on her own aged 18, took antidepressants for two years before deciding she wanted to help others. ""The moment I walk through the hospital door, no matter how bad I feel or how bad my day is, I feel happy,"" she said. ""I feel happy to know that I am there and that I am doing something good for my patients. ""Even when I'm not at work I wonder if they ate, how their day is, if they're happy - and all that just because I care so much about them.""

Hana posts her new songs on social media platforms and hopes her lyrics will help others feel less alone. Jamie Tyrell shares his walking videos with inspiring quotes on TikTok Jamie Tyrell, 44, shares his walking stories on TikTok, adding inspiring quotes and thoughts over the videos. Jamie, from Barmouth, Gwynedd, claims he was bullied while serving as a senior aircraftman in the Royal Air Force (RAF) between 2006 and 2008. He said he considered suicide before reaching out to theSamaritans,external. In an effort to help others not to reach the low point he did, Jamie organises walking groups in the area. ""My walks help greatly with my mental health as they allow me to escape any stresses of life and just enjoy what nature provides around us,"" he said.

Emma, from Rhondda Cynon Taf, took up running in 2018 and started blogging about it on TikTok and Instagram during the pandemic. ""Running is a great [form of] escapism, especially if I ever feel anxious and/or stressed,"" she said. ""This is my way of coping with my emotions. It is something I am doing just for me."" Emma runs alone, but said she was supported by running groups and her followers. ""The running community has always been so supportive and engaging. Even though I run alone, the amount of online support I get and at events is second to none.Â ""Everyone within the community has been friendly and approachable. It is so surprising that for someone who started just documenting on Instagram about my goals. I did not think I could engage with so many people.Â ""Within this community, there is a lot of honesty and a lot of people who have had similar experiences. Since opening up more about my own mental health struggles, I have had so much support and participated with events to help talk about it."" Steph and Kayleigh set up a ""non-judgemental"" group for parents Steph Powell, 34, and Kayleigh Morgan, 35, from Caerphilly county, took to Instagram to set up a meet-up group for mothers which could provide a safe place with no judgement. Kayleigh said she struggled withpost-traumatic stress disorder,external(PTSD) after having her first baby but suffered in silence because she was scared how she would be perceived as a mother. ""I had longed to be a mother and really put it on a pedestal. So when it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows I wondered why it wasn't. ""It made me feel ashamed that I wasn't loving every second of motherhood and seeing others take everything in their stride, why couldn't I?"" Due to Covid, the meet-ups had to stop but the pair continued to support one another online. ""The mothers who came told us they don't feel so alone in the motherhood journey,"" Kayleigh said. ""It honestly makes me feel so happy and proud that I've made someone else feel a little less alone, sad or just for them to know I hear you, it's hard. ""Now I know everyone struggles at some point."" Emma Perkins shares her boxing and her feelings on social media Emma Perkins, 23, spent time in care as a child. At 19, she found herself living in different B&Bs before a social worker found her a hostel and, later, her grandparents helped her to find her own home. But Emma, struggling with her past, began to experience anxiety and took up boxing as a release. Emma, from Newport, also creates content on TikTok based around how she feels and runs groups to help others.

"Dame Deborah said Prince William went out of his way to speak to her family Dame Deborah James has thanked Prince William for ""going above and beyond to make a very special memory"" in visiting her family home to confer her damehood. Podcaster Dame Deborah, 40, revealed last week she was receiving end-of-life care for bowel cancer, adding the five days since had been the ""most surreal, mind blowing, humbling"" of her life. She has raised nearly Â£6m for cancer research since revealing her prognosis. ""Can't quite believe im actually a Dame!"" she wrote on social media. Dame Deborah has received widespread praise for her no-nonsense approach to talking about her cancer publicly - particularly as co-presenter on theBBC's You, Me and the Big C podcast- and has shared her experiences of treatment and daily life with her social media followers since her diagnosis in 2016. The Duke of Cambridge visited the mother of two at her parents' home, where she is spending her remaining time with her family, on Friday to present her with the honour. Writing on Instagram, Dame Deborah said: ""My family are being amazing and as emotional as it all is, we are finding so much to smile about in the sadness."" She explained she was ""getting weaker and more tired"" and had been ""running off pure adrenaline"" over the last few days. ""But my word, I always said I wanted to slide in sideways when my time is up, with a massive smile, no regrets and a big glass of champagne! Still my intention!!!"" Are we failing young people with cancer? Deborah James made a dame by William at her home William and Kate praise for Big C's Deborah James All I want is more life, says Big C's Deborah James She launched the fund - to pay for research into personalised medicine for cancer patients and to support campaigns to raise awareness of bowel cancer, on Monday - with an initial goal of Â£250,000. It came after she revealed she did not know how long she had left to live after stopping treatment and moving to hospice-at-home care. After Prince William conferred the damehood on Friday, the former deputy headteacher wrote: she was ""utterly honoured"" at being joined by him for  afternoon tea and champagne, adding he had ""spent a generous amount of time talking to my whole family"". ""It's quite surreal having a royal pop in at home, and yes you can imagine the cleaning antics and preparation went off the scale - but it was all irrelevant because William was so kind and he put us all at ease,"" she added. Prince William is a patron of the Royal Marsden Hospital, a specialist cancer treatment centre that will be one of the main beneficiaries of Dame Deborah's new fund, alongside Cancer Research UK and Bowel Cancer UK. After his visit, she noted the prince was ""clearly passionate"" about improving cancer treatment outcomes a the hospital, adding he was ""welcome back anytime"". Damehoods and knighthoods are usually announced as part of the New Year Honours or the Queen's Birthday Honours. But, in exceptional circumstances, some are announced at other times of the year - as happened with NHS fundraiser Captain Sir Tom Moore's knighthood. The visit by the duke was arranged similarly quickly, as he had just returned from a two-day visit to the west of Scotland with his wife Catherine. William and Catherine - who donated to Dame Deborah's research fund - said earlier this week that her ""tireless efforts"" in raising awareness of cancer were inspirational, and thanked her for ""giving hope"" to those living with the disease. Dame Deborah began co-presenting You, Me and the Big C alongside Lauren Mahon and BBC Radio 5 Live newsreader Rachael Bland in 2018, with the show earning praise for its frank discussion of cancer. They spoke to celebrity guests and addressed practical matters, including hair loss, tips for dealing with finances and telling your nearest and dearest about illnesses. Blanddied at the age of 40, six months after the show launched. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer two years earlier.

"Both Sweden and Finland have increased their military budget in recent years Sweden is now set to join neighbouring Finland as a new Nato member, after Turkey's president withdrew a series of objections. Finland officially joined the Western defensive alliance in April, bringing the number of member states to 31. The two Nordic states have long maintained military neutrality, but that changed in February 2022 when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine - the biggest war on the European continent since World War Two. It was Magdalena Andersson of Sweden and Finland's Sanna Marin who kick-started the countries' bids to join Nato in 2022 Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion shattered a long-standing sense of stability in northern Europe, leaving Sweden and Finland feeling vulnerable. Finnish ex-Prime Minister Alexander Stubb said joining the alliance was a ""done deal"" for his country as soon as Russian troops invaded Ukraine last year. For many Finns, the war brought a haunting sense of familiarity. It was in late 1939 that the Soviets invaded Finland. For more than three months the Finnish army put up fierce resistance, despite being heavily outnumbered. Finland held out until March 1940 but lost its eastern province of Karelia to Russia. They avoided occupation, but ended up losing 10% of their territory. Watching the war in Ukraine unfold was like reliving this history, said Iro Sarkka, a political scientist at the University of Helsinki. Finns were looking at their 1,340km (830 mile) border with Russia, she said, and thinking: ""Could this happen to us?"" Finland held out until March 1940 but lost its eastern province of Karelia to Russia Sweden has also felt endangered in recent years. Sweden's military weakness came into full view in 2013 when Russian bomber planes were able to simulate an attack on Stockholm and Sweden needed Nato help to ward them off. In 2014, Swedes were transfixed by reports that a Russian submarine was lurking in the shallow waters of the Stockholm archipelago. In 2018, every household received army pamphlets titled ""if crisis or war comes"" - the first time they were sent out since 1991. For a population of only 5.5 million, Finland's conscript military is highly trained and potentially large. It trains at least 21,000 conscripts every year and has a reserve force of 900,000, soits wartime strength is estimated at 280,000,external. Sweden's military capacity is far smaller at 57,000. But it brought back conscription at the start of 2018, after suspending it in 2010, and the current number of up to 6,000 conscripts will rise to 8,000 in 2025. From the 1990s Sweden cut back the size of its military and changed its priorities from territorial defence to peacekeeping missions around the world. But that went into reverse with Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014 and its increasing threat in the Baltic region. In some ways, not much. Sweden and Finland became official partners of Nato in 1994 and have since become major contributors to the alliance. They have taken part in several Nato missions since the end of the Cold War. The two countries will for the first time have security guarantees from nuclear states under Nato's Article 5, which views an attack on one member state as an attack on all. Historian Henrik Meinander said Finns were mentally prepared for membership, following a succession of small steps towards Nato since the fall of the Soviet Union. In 1992, Helsinki bought 64 US combat planes. Three years later, it joined the European Union, alongside Sweden, and every Finnish government since then has reviewed the so-called Nato option. Finland has already reached Nato's agreed defence spending target of 2% of GDP, and Sweden has drawn up plans to do so by 2026. Sweden may have been neutral during the Cold War but at the time it kept a force of at least 15,000 soldiers on the Baltic island of Gotland and has recently rebuilt its presence there. It hopes to build up its full-time military as well as its conscript force in the coming years. Is Nato's Nordic expansion a threat or boost to Europe? Russian President Vladimir Putin believes Nato expansion is a direct threat to his country's security - and claimed it was the reason he launched the 2022 war in Ukraine. But his invasion had the opposite effect by only serving to extend Nato's reach. Finland's accession was a particular setback, further extending Nato's influence over the Baltic Sea. And it brought a warning from the Kremlin of unspecified ""military-technical"" measures in retaliation. Russia's foreign ministry said both Sweden and Finland had been warned of the consequences if they did choose to join. Now that Sweden has been given the green light by Turkey to become a member, the Kremlin has said it will respond with the same kind of measures it proposed for Finland. What those measures would be is still vague. Russia says it has moved tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, and they could reach Finland and Sweden. But former Finnish PM Alexander Stubb has warned that Russian cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns and occasional airspace violations are more likely. Under Article Five, Finland has - and Sweden will - soon have the commitment of the entire alliance to come to their aid if they come under attack. Their membership also makes defending the Nordic and Baltic region far more comprehensive. But there is a significant minority, at least in Sweden, who believe membership will have an adverse effect. Deborah Solomon, from the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society, argued that Nato's nuclear deterrence increased tensions and risked an arms race with Russia. This complicated peace efforts, she said, and made Sweden a less safe place. Another fear is that in joining the alliance, Sweden would lose its leading role in global nuclear disarmament efforts. Many of Sweden's Nato-sceptics look back to the period between the 1960s and '80s, when Sweden used its neutrality to position itself as an international mediator. Joining Nato would be abandoning that dream, Ms Solomon said. Finland's neutrality was very different. It came about as a condition of peace imposed by the Soviet Union in a 1948 ""friendship agreement"". It was seen as a pragmatic way of surviving and maintaining the country's independence. If Sweden's neutrality was a matter of identity and ideology, in Finland it was a question of existence, said Henrik Meinander. Part of the reason Sweden could even afford to have a debate about Nato membership was because it used Finland and the Baltics as a ""buffer zone"", he said. Finland abandoned its neutrality after the Soviet Union collapsed. It looked to the West and sought to free itself from the Soviet sphere of influence. Turkey, and to a lesser extent Hungary, initially resisted both applications. Ankara accused the Nordic nations of supporting what it called terrorist organisations, including the Kurdish militant PKK and the Gulen movement, which Turkey blames for an attempted coup in 2016. Kurds make up 15-20% of Turkey's population, and have been persecuted by Turkish authorities for generations. But it was Sweden that triggered most hostility as Kurds have mobilised successfully in politics there over the decades. President Erdogan asked how ""how a country with terrorists on the streets... can contribute to Nato"". His main demand was to end political, financial and ""arms support"" to militants. Sweden updated its terror laws in June 2023 to outlaw taking part in an extremist group in a way that supported it - and weeks later a Kurdish man was jailed for attempting to finance terrorism. But there was some suggestion, denied by Turkey, that its main reason for resisting Sweden's bid was that Ankara was waiting for the US to provide F-16 fighter jets.

"US President-elect Donald Trump has called on Nato's European members to spend 5% of their national incomes on defence. That is more than double the military alliance's current target of 2%. Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte has also told member countries to boost military spending as part of a new ""wartime mindset"". Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - was formed in Washington DC in 1949 by 12 countries: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the UK and the US. Nato was founded in Washington DC in April 1949 Nato'sprimary purpose,externalwas to block expansion in Europe by the former Soviet Union - a group of communist republics which included Russia. Members agree thatif one of them is attacked, the others should help defend it.,external Nato does not have its own army, but member states can take collective military action in response to crises. For instance, the body supported the UN by intervening in the war in the former Yugoslavia between 1992 and 2004. It alsoco-ordinates military plans and carries out joint military exercises.,external Nato has 32 members across Europe and North America - the original 12 founders plus 20 countries which have joined since 1949. After the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, many Eastern European countries became members, including Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Finland - which has a 1,340km (832 mile) land border with Russia - joined in April 2023. Sweden became a member in March 2024. Having been neutral for decades,both applied to Nato in May 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Georgia have also asked to join. Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine becoming a member, fearing it would bring Nato forces too close to its borders. However, in 2008, the alliancesaid that Ukraine could eventually join,external. Former Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg told President Volodymyr Zelensky that Ukraine can join in ""the long-term"" After Russia's invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked for this process to be fast-tracked. Although then Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg reconfirmed Ukraine could join ""in the long term"", he said this would not happen until after the war ended. Nato currently asks every member country to spend at least 2% of national income - also known as GDP - on defence. It is thought that23 countries met that target in 2024, compared to only three in 2014. The countries which spend the largest share of GDP on defence are the US and those close to Russia, such as Poland and the Baltic states. In July 2024, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmersaid the UK will increase its defence spending to 2.5% of GDP. In December 2024, Nato secretary general Rutte said that member stateswould have to ""shift to a wartime mindset"" and spend ""considerably more than 2%"" on defence,external. During his first term as US president, Trump persuaded many Nato members to increase defence spending. In 2018 he said thatall countries in the alliance should be committing 4% of GDP. At a press conference at his Florida home in January 2025,Trump urged Nato's European members to spend 5%,external, telling reporters: ""They can all afford it."" While campaigning for his second presidential term, Trumpsaid he might encourage Russia to attack Nato countries which failed to spend enough, remarks which were strongly condemned by the White House and former Nato chief Stoltenberg. How much do Nato members spend on defence? Nato said Russia's invasion of Ukraine posed the""most significant and direct threat to allies' security"".,external The alliance has not sent troops to Ukraine or enforced a no-fly zone over the country for fear of being pulled into a direct conflict with Russia. However, individual member states have supplied arms and equipment. German research organisationthe Kiel Institute,externalsaid that the US had allocated 59.9bn euros (Â£49.7bn) for military support to Ukraine between February 2022 and October 2024. European Nato members provided 52.6bn euros (Â£43.7bn) over the same period. The US, UK, Germany and Turkey and others have sent anti-tank weapons, missile defence systems such as Patriot, artillery guns, tanks and drones. The US, UK and France have also supplied long-range missiles such as Atacms and Storm Shadow/Scalp. Atacms missiles can reach up to 300km (186 miles) and are hard to intercept due to their high speed In August 2024,Ukraine received two US-made F16 fighter jets- the first of more than 60 pledged by Nato member states. Since November 2024,the US and UK have allowed Ukraine to use their missiles to hit targets within Russian territory. What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?

"Finland has increased its military budget in recent years Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned his Finnish counterpart that joining Nato and abandoning Finland's neutral status would be a ""mistake"". He told Sauli NiinistÃ¶ there was no threat to Finland's security. The exchange came during a phone call made by the Finnish president, ahead of a formal request which Finland is expected to announce very soon. Sweden has also indicated its intention to join the Western alliance, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Finland shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border with Russia. Until now, it has stayed out of Nato to avoid antagonising its eastern neighbour. Mr Putin did not make a specific threat of retaliation over Finland's move, but the Russian foreign ministry has indicated there will be retaliation. Russia's decision to suspend electricity supplies to Finland is being seen as an early sign, however. Are Sweden and Finland going from neutral to Nato? What is Nato and could Finland and Sweden join? In its statement, Russian energy supplier RAO Nordic mentioned problems with payments.

Mr NiinistÃ¶ said he had told Mr Putin how recent moves by Russia, along with the invasion of Ukraine, ""have altered the security environment of Finland"". ""The conversation was direct and straight-forward and it was conducted without aggravations. Avoiding tensions was considered important,"" he said. A possible stumbling block to Swedish and Finnish membership of Nato is Turkey, after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused both countries of harbouring ""terrorist organisations"" and said he did not support their applications. It was seen as a reference to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Turkey regards as a terrorist organisation. For decades the PKK has fought with Turkey for a Kurdish homeland. Turkey also objects to a Syrian Kurdish militia called the People's Protection Units (YPG) ,which they say is an extension of the PKK - even though they have been allied with the US in the fight against so-called Islamic State.

Its state broadcaster, UA:PBC was targetted in the opening days of the war, and their commentator, Timur Miroshnychenko, had to broadcast his contributions from an underground bunker. In the past, other broadcasters have stepped in when a country is unable or unwilling to host the contest... most recently in 1980, when the Netherlands took over from Israel, who declined to run the show after winning in two consecutive years. Eurovision organisers the EBU have just released a statement saying they will consider all options for 2023. ""Obviously, there are unique challenges involved in hosting next year's competition,"" the statement read.

"Employees disinfect a Pyongyang supermarket in October last year North Korea's rapidly spreading Covid-19 outbreak is a ""great disaster"" for the country, its leader Kim Jong-un has said, according to state media. Mr Kim called for an all-out battle to tackle the spread of the virus during an emergency meeting on Saturday. It comes after officials announced the first confirmed cases on Thursday - although experts believe the virus has likely been circulating for some time. There are fears a major outbreak could have dire consequences in North Korea. Its population of 25 million is vulnerable due to the lack of a vaccination programme and poor healthcare system. What will the pandemic look like in North Korea? And on Saturday, state media reported that there had been half a million cases of unexplained fever in recent weeks. The country has limited testing capabilities so most Covid cases are not confirmed. That figure marked a major increase on the numbers given on both Friday and Thursday, potentially providing some indication of the scale of North Korea's outbreak. ""The spread of the malignant epidemic is [the greatest] turmoil to fall on our country since the founding,"" the official KCNA news agency quoted Mr Kim as saying. He blamed the crisis on bureaucratic and medical incompetence, and suggested lessons could be learnt from the response of countries like neighbouring China. Kim Jong-un convenes a Covid response meeting on 12 May State media reports that 27 people have died since April after suffering a fever. The reports do not say whether they tested positive for Covid, apart from one death in the capital Pyongyang which was confirmed to be a case of the Omicron variant. Why doesn't North Korea have enough food? How dangerous is the situation in North Korea? The unprecedented admission on Thursday marked the end of two years of North Korean claims to be free of Covid. The secretive country rejected offers from the international community to supply millions of AstraZeneca and Chinese-made jabs last year. Instead, it claimed it had controlled Covid by sealing its borders early in January 2020. It shares land borders with South Korea and China, which have both battled outbreaks. China is now struggling to contain an Omicron wave with lockdowns in its biggest cities. At a meeting outlining new Covid rules on Thursday, Mr Kim was seen wearing a face mask on television for what was believed to be the first time. He ordered ""maximum emergency"" virus controls, which appeared to include orders for local lockdowns and gathering restrictions in workplaces. South Korea has said it offered humanitarian aid after Thursday's announcement, but Pyongyang is yet to respond. This video can not be played A defector tells the BBC about TV choices in North Korea.

Ms Malone said she was failed by Police Scotland and the Scottish Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers. She said she was still trying to seek ""accountability"" from other organisations, including the Scottish Police Authority. Chief Constable Iain Livingstone has personally apologised to Ms Malone. The Scottish Police Federation said it had a ""long and proud history"" of assisting members in discrimination cases. Police pay out almost Â£1m over sexism case Ex-officer says police federation abandoned her Sexist 'boys' club' culture in armed police unit In a statement published a day after her Â£947,909.07 compensation deal was confirmed, Ms Malone said the last few years had been ""excruciating and torturous"". But she said she hoped her experience of winning a victimisation claim against the force at an employment tribunal would ""benefit many women now and in the future"". Ms Malone began her action against Police Scotland after a senior police officer said he did not want to see two female armed officers deployed together when there were sufficient male staff on duty. The tribunal accepted evidence that there was an ""absolute boys' club"" culture within the armed response vehicle team in the east of Scotland. In its judgment last October, it upheld Ms Malone's claims of victimisation. However, her claim of direct discrimination was dismissed. Ms Malone's statement went on to say she was grateful for the options and opportunities open to her following the payout from Police Scotland. But she said they came at a ""great cost"" to herself, her family and her career. ""I would like it to be known that no amount of compensation would ever make up for the pain or sacrifices I made to hold Police Scotland to account but it will enable me to continue with my quest for holding them and others answerable for their actions,"" she said. And the former firearms officer criticised the actions of both Police Scotland and the Scottish Police Federation for their conduct. ""Both organisations failed me and grossly underestimated my determination for acknowledgment and accountability,"" she said. Rhona Malone was a police firearms officer Ms Malone said the federation withdrew legal support for her case in 2019 when she refused to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and accept a ""derisory"" financial settlement. As a result she was left with costs running into six figures. ""At a time when I was at my most vulnerable and reliant on their support financially and mentally, I was abandoned, ignored, and discarded,"" she said. ""I should not have been put in this position as a fully paid-up member of the federation,"" Ms Malone added. ""Sadly, I know from other female police officers who have reached out to me that my experiences with the federation are not unique."" The federation said it withdrew legal assistance following independent legal advice that the settlement terms were ""unlikely to be better than what a tribunal would award"". It added that the federation continued to support Ms Malone throughout the tribunal, with one official giving evidence on her behalf. ""Ms Malone's claims that she was abandoned, ignored and discarded by the Federation are demonstrably untrue,"" the federation added. ""We are nonetheless pleased that for Ms Malone, this matter has finally been resolved."" Chief Constable Iain Livingstone has personally apologised to Ms Malone for issues highlighted in the tribunal, according to a joint statement issued by Police Scotland and their former employee on Friday. It said the chief constable was committed to ""leading change"" in policing in Scotland to improve the experiences of women. Meanwhile the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) is carrying out a review of the employment tribunal decision, and it is in its final stages. A spokesperson for the Scottish Police Authority said: ""The chief constable has been clear that there is no place for victimisation or misogyny in policing and reinforced his commitment to driving improvement which the authority fully supports. ""We will continue to oversee and seek assurance around the progress and pace of change within policing and consider any recommendations from the PSNI review in due course.""

"An investigation is under way after a spike in the number of newborn baby deaths in Scotland was recorded for the second time in six months. At least 18 babies under four weeks old died in March, a rate of 4.6 per 1,000 births. Infant death rates vary widely from month to month, but the increase is larger than expected from chance alone. It comes after at least 21 babies under four weeks old died in September, a rate of 4.9 per 1,000 births. A preliminary investigation later found the spike was not linked to Covid. The spikes in September and March are the first to be detected since monitoring of this nature began in July 2017. Investigation into spike in newborn baby deaths in Scotland 'No Covid link' to spike in newborn baby deaths The average mortality rate among newborns is just over two per 1,000 births. While all child deaths are investigated,The Herald newspaper reported,externalthat this wider inquiry was triggered when the mortality rate passed an ""upper control"" threshold of 4.4 per 1,000 births. It is designed to pick up abnormal trends in infant deaths. Dr Sarah Stock, an expert in maternal and foetal medicine at the University of Edinburgh told the paper: ""I think the numbers are really troubling, and I don't think we know the reasons why yet. ""What we do know it's not neonatal Covid - the rates of Covid-19 infection in babies are very low and deaths from Covid are thankfully very, very small so this isn't Covid affecting babies."" Dr Stock, who has co-led theCovid-19 in Pregnancy Scotland (COPS) study,external, said it was known the virus can affect pregnant woman and cause complications, like early birth, so further investigation was needed. She stressed the Covid vaccine, which studies have consistently shown to be safe in pregnancy, was not a factor. But she said the wider impacts of the pandemic on the NHS, include on staffing, need to be considered. Steve Turner, a consultant paediatrician at the Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital, said deaths within the first four weeks in Scotland and the UK were ""relatively uncommon"". He believes the increase would not have been caused by Covid as he has seen dozens of children with the virus who have all been well. Mr Turner also told BBC Scotland it was ""highly unlikely"" that pandemic-related pressures on the NHS were responsible. He said parents know to call NHS24 if they are worried about their baby and to attend A&E if they don't get a ring back. He added: ""I don't think Covid is directly or indirectly likely to be linked or related to this spike."" Figures for the number of stillborn babies also increased in March but not beyond the upper warning or control limit. Deaths of newborn babies have fallen steadily in recent decades with the mortality rate per 1,000 births dropping from double figures in the 1970s to 2.1 in 2020. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Every death is a tragedy, and our thoughts are with each of these families. ""We are working with PHS, the Scottish National Neonatal Network and the Maternity and Children Quality Improvement Collaborative to understand any possible contributing factors to ensure we continue to improve the care of the smallest and sickest babies in Scotland."" The spokeswoman added individual reviews of each death are undertaken as part of the Maternity and Neonatal (Perinatal) Adverse Event Review Process for Scotland. It aims to standardise and improve approaches to the review of adverse events in maternity and neonatal settings. Long-term trends show neonatal mortality has reduced by 10.2% in Scotland, from 1.66 per 1,000 live births in 2013 to 1.49 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2019.

"Employees disinfect a Pyongyang supermarket in October last year North Korea's rapidly spreading Covid-19 outbreak is a ""great disaster"" for the country, its leader Kim Jong-un has said, according to state media. Mr Kim called for an all-out battle to tackle the spread of the virus during an emergency meeting on Saturday. It comes after officials announced the first confirmed cases on Thursday - although experts believe the virus has likely been circulating for some time. There are fears a major outbreak could have dire consequences in North Korea. Its population of 25 million is vulnerable due to the lack of a vaccination programme and poor healthcare system. What will the pandemic look like in North Korea? And on Saturday, state media reported that there had been half a million cases of unexplained fever in recent weeks. The country has limited testing capabilities so most Covid cases are not confirmed. That figure marked a major increase on the numbers given on both Friday and Thursday, potentially providing some indication of the scale of North Korea's outbreak. ""The spread of the malignant epidemic is [the greatest] turmoil to fall on our country since the founding,"" the official KCNA news agency quoted Mr Kim as saying. He blamed the crisis on bureaucratic and medical incompetence, and suggested lessons could be learnt from the response of countries like neighbouring China. Kim Jong-un convenes a Covid response meeting on 12 May State media reports that 27 people have died since April after suffering a fever. The reports do not say whether they tested positive for Covid, apart from one death in the capital Pyongyang which was confirmed to be a case of the Omicron variant. Why doesn't North Korea have enough food? How dangerous is the situation in North Korea? The unprecedented admission on Thursday marked the end of two years of North Korean claims to be free of Covid. The secretive country rejected offers from the international community to supply millions of AstraZeneca and Chinese-made jabs last year. Instead, it claimed it had controlled Covid by sealing its borders early in January 2020. It shares land borders with South Korea and China, which have both battled outbreaks. China is now struggling to contain an Omicron wave with lockdowns in its biggest cities. At a meeting outlining new Covid rules on Thursday, Mr Kim was seen wearing a face mask on television for what was believed to be the first time. He ordered ""maximum emergency"" virus controls, which appeared to include orders for local lockdowns and gathering restrictions in workplaces. South Korea has said it offered humanitarian aid after Thursday's announcement, but Pyongyang is yet to respond. This video can not be played A defector tells the BBC about TV choices in North Korea.

"Norway's Subwoolfer have been a huge hit with fans The Eurovision Song Contest reaches its grand final on Saturday night in Turin, with Ukraine, Italy and the UK among the favourites to win. Yes, I said the UK. No, I don't believe it either. But here we are. Sam Ryder, a construction worker turned TikTok star, wowed people so much during rehearsals that bookmakers have been shortening his odds of winning all week. Now, I know what you're going to say: ""But surely Eurovision is all about politics"". And to an extent, you're right. Countries often trade votes with their neighbours. If Greece and Cyprus don't award each other ""douze points"", it would probably provoke a diplomatic incident. But several studies -here's the most recent one,external- show that political voting rarely affects the overall winner. In order to get enough points, you need a broad range of support that's impossible to achieve through favouritism alone. Political votes definitely affect the mid-table results, however, while the last-place positions are reserved for the worst songs. Sam Ryder is hoping to earn the UK its best result in decades Ukraine's rap-folk crossover band Kalush Orchestra were among the favourites even before Russia invaded their country This year, of course, politics are expected to dictate the outcome. Ukraine are the presumptive favourites, as public sympathy soars after Russia's invasion. But some observers are wary even of that suggestion. Is a 17-year-old in Tallinn really considering Vladimir Putin's geopolitical ambitions when they pick up the phone to cast a vote in a song contest, or are they thinking: ""That boy from Belgium looks hot""? Decades of pop history suggest it's the latter. The Eurovision anthem born in a war zone Ireland fail to make Eurovision Song Contest final Sam Ryder is 'ignoring the hype' at Eurovision When a president tried to intervene in Eurovision... Who will win Eurovision? And other questions answered Anyway, the joy of Eurovision isn't about analysing the intricacies of the voting system. It's about revelling in the strange, beautiful, passionate and peculiar performances that the continent (and Australia) puts forward. So here's a quick preview of the moments you should look out for when the Grand Final kicks off on BBC One on Saturday evening. Allow YouTube content?

Norway's Subwoolfer are the oldest act ever to take the Eurovision stage, having formed 4.5 billion years ago on the moon before coming to Earth to dominate pop music. Or so the story goes. Known as Keith and Jim, they hide their identity behind custard yellow masks, and put a modern spin on the Red Riding Hood story over a thumping house beat. ""Before that wolf eats my grandma, give that wolf a banana"", they advise. An ap-peel-ing cross betweenHollaback Girl,externalandWhat Does The Fox Say,external, this one has a British connection, too. One of the wolves is rumoured to be Ben Adams from the 90s boyband A1.... and we spotted his wife outside the Norwegian delegation's hotel on Thursday, so it must be true. Serbia's Konstrakta gives viewers a lesson in good hygiene Serbia's In Corpore Sano is a  song that was clearly written during the pandemic by someone falling down a WebMD rabbit hole in the middle of a nervous breakdown. An ode to personal hygiene, it poses the eternal question: ""What's the secret behind Meghan Markle's healthy hair? I think that deep hydration is what it is"", before spiralling into a feverish examination of personal hygiene, and whether ""dark circles around the eyes indicate liver problems"". You imagine the singer Konstrakta (aka Ana Duric) scrawling these lyrics obsessively on her wall during a particularly dark night of the soul - an image that's only reinforced when she's joined onstage by a choir intoning in Latin. In case that wasn't strange enough, she spends the entire performance washing her hands in a tiny basin. Naturally, it's a favourite among fans in the arena. MÃ¥neskin celebrated their victory in style last year Italian rock band MÃ¥neskin roared into first place at last year's Eurovision with their glam-thrash song Zitti E Buoni, and went on to become a genuine global phenomenon, touring with the Rolling Stones, winning an MTV Award and scoring a billion streams of their hit single, Beggin'. ""How many nights did I spend in my own bed last year? Maybe 10,"" laughs bassist Victoria De Angelis. The quartet will return to the Eurovision stage on Saturday night to play their new single, Supermodel, which was inspired by ""fake people"" they encountered in LA last year. ""I know it's not our deepest song, but it's good,"" says frontman Damiano David. Fans will notice he's a little less mobile than normal, after tearing his ankle shooting a music video. But the band are ready to reclaim the stage that brought them to an international audience. ""I don't know if I'm going to be able to run around, but I'm just going to enjoynotbeing in the competition,"" says David. Spain's Chanel is an established star of stage musicals Under different circumstances, Cuban-Spanish singer Chanel wouldn't be part of the contest. Two years ago, she was one of five actresses on the shortlist to play Anita in Steven Spielberg's remake of West Side Story. The role eventually went to Ariana deBose, but cinema's loss is Eurovision's gain. Chanel's slinky pop song, SloMo, was originally written for Jennifer Lopez, and it has a dance routine worthy of La Lopez herself. To ensure she could carry out the choreography without losing her breath, Chanel trained for Eurovision by singing while running on a treadmill. After three days, she decided the challenge wasn't enough, and started running in heels. Now that's dedication. Mahmood and Blanco are huge stars in Italy This year's contest has spawned a lot of copycat MÃ¥neskins - most of whom were thrown out in the semi-finals - but Italy has gone in the opposite direction. Their entry comes from Mahmood, a runner-up in 2019, who's teamed up with fellow Italian pop star Blanco for a big old ballad and, let me tell you, it's a spine-tingler. Brividi (translated as ""chills"") is a song about how, in love, the fear of being inadequate is a universal experience - regardless of gender, identity or sexuality. ""I'd like to love you, but I'm always wrong"", the duo sing, with just the right blend of pathos and vulnerability, ""and I get chills, chills, chills"". On Spotify, it's currently the most-played song from this year's contest. That's not a guarantee of votes on Saturday night (what if all those plays come from Italians, who can't vote for their own act?) but it's a sign that Ukraine might not have the competition sewn up. If Italy do win, they'll be the first country to have back-to-back victories since Ireland's incredible hat-trick in the early 1990s. Sheldon Riley's costume had to be shipped in one piece, as it can't be dismantled Australia's Sheldon Riley wrote his song, Not The Same, years ago as a message to his younger self, about the struggles of dealing with Asperger's Syndrome and coming to terms with his sexuality in a deeply religious family. He says he's been singing it since he was 15 - but the message has changed from one of despair to hope, as he learned to be proud of his differences. The song's transformation is evident in the staging too. When he won Eurovision - Australia Decides earlier this year, he was dressed in black, surrounded by bleak, industrial sets. Now, he's all in white and bathed in light. And he can barely move. Sheldon's costume weighs 40kg - thanks to the 200,000 Swarovski crystals and 90,000 Swarovski pearls stitched into the fabric. Along with his mask and other accessories, the total weight is 51kg. Imagine his excess baggage charges. Stefan makes full use of the multi-pronged Eurovision stage Believe it or not, when Estonia's Stefan performs on Saturday night, he will only just have woken up. ""Usually, I go to sleep before I go on stage,"" he told Steve Holdenon the Official Eurovison podcast,external. ""I don't know why, but my body tells me, 'you need to rest' and I just go somewhere quiet and take a nap for 15 minutes, and then I wake up like a new person."" There's nothing sleepy about his performance, though, as Stefan bounds around the arena like a little puppy, even taking a daring leap over the stage's built-in waterfall. Let's just hope he remembers to set his alarm. Watch thefirst Eurovision Semi-FinalonBBC iPlayernow. Watch thesecond Eurovision Semi-FinalonBBC iPlayernow.

"The risk of a recession has risen, analysts have warned, after the economy shrank during March just as the UK had recovered from the pandemic. Higher prices are ""beginning to bite"",the UK statistics body said,external, with people spending less and cutting down on car journeys due to high fuel costs. The impact of higher energy bills in April has also yet to be seen. The economy grew by 0.8% over the first three months of the year, but in March it shrank by 0.1% as people cut back. The main boost to the economy came in January, as hospitality and travel industries recovered from coronavirus pandemic restrictions. However, that came before the war in Ukraine and before households began to feel the pinch of higher prices. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the latest figures ""suggest the economy had less momentum than we thought even before the full hit from the cost of living crisis has been felt"". He added that the risk of recession - defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods - ""has just risen"". On Wednesday,the National Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank warnedthat the squeeze on household incomes would cause the UK to fall into recession in the final half of 2022 Last week, the Bank of England forecast that inflation - the rate at which prices rise - could reach more than 10% by the end of the year. The Bank saidhas warned the UK faces a ""sharp economic slowdown"", with prices rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, driven by soaring fuel, food and energy costs. Why are prices rising so quickly? What is GDP and how does it affect me? Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, told the BBC that people had already started spending less with shop sales ""well below expectations"" in March, and people cutting back on ""big ticket, non-essential items"". ""You can see the cost of living really beginning to bite,"" he added. The services sector, which makes up the largest part of the UK economy and is made up of jobs across hospitality, finance and real estate, was the main contributor to the economy contracting in March, the ONS said. The worst performer in the sector was the motor industry which Mr Morgan said was ""very much struggling"" as sales fell. Car trade body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has said March marked the ""weakest"" for new car registrations since 1998, as supply chain problems continued to hamper carmakers. The UK'sFTSE 100 share indexfell 2% following the release of the weaker than expected growth figures. We'll take any growth we can get right now, and on the face of it 0.8% growth in the economy during the first three months of the year is good by any normal standard and better than most of the comparable G7 major economies, some of which are already contracting. It confirms full recovery from the economic losses of the pandemic, though at a slower pace compared to the rest of those G7 countries. But this looks like being old news already, before the cost of living crisis exacerbated by events in Ukraine, tripped up growth. The evidence of the impact of a squeezed economy hit by high prices is already visible in the first quarter's monthly breakdowns. All the growth happened in January, with a flat February and a small contraction in March. Economists fear the economy could be contracting right now, though some of that may be down to an extra bank holiday. With taxes, interest rates, and inflation all hitting disposable income at the same time, the fear is that January could be as good as it gets for the UK economy in 2022. Mr Morgan said a survey by the ONS of 40,000 businesses found over half had seen an increase in the price of wholesale materials and goods, but fewer than half of those firms were passing the costs on. ""They are absorbing those rises and you do have to question how sustainable that is on an ongoing basis,"" he said. Many businesses expect the price of goods to increase further, and ""their big concern is energy prices,"" Mr Morgan added. Mike Whalley and Sue Judd say small businesses are facing multiple challenges Mike Whalley and Sue Judd, who own specialist model and toy shop Everything Dinosaur, said their running costs had increased ""astronomically"". ""It's taking twice as long to get goods as it used to and it's costing twice as much to actually get them here,"" Miss Judd told the BBC. The pair, from Middlewich in Cheshire, have been forced to pass on some of the higher costs on to customers through higher product prices. Mr Whalley said it was also more expensive and more time-consuming to export to Europe now following Brexit. ""We're being attacked from all sides. It's a challenging environment,"" he added. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC he was ""ready to do more"", but did not commit to further action on tackling the rising cost of living. The chancellor would not say whether a recession was likely in the coming months, but did admit that the ""global economy is facing inflationary pressures"", as a result of the war in Ukraine. Mr Sunak has threatened to hit energy companies with aone-off ""windfall"" tax if they do not invest enough in new projects. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said the slowdown in the economy was ""alarming"". It called for an emergency Budget to give firms ""the breathing space they need to raise productivity and strengthen the economy, including reversing the recently introduced National Insurance increase until at least the next financial year"". The CBI business group said businesses and households were ""feeling the pinch"". ""The economy barely kept its head above the water during a volatile start to the year, but times look set to get that bit tougher,"" said Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist.

"Sweden's governing party drops its long opposition to the country joining the Nato alliance in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine The news came hours after Finland formally announced it was seeking to be part of the alliance Russia - whose war in Ukraine has sparked the moves - has warned the expansion of Nato would be a mistake Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg says the doors are open for both countries to join, describing the potential change as ""historic"" On the ground, Russia's offensive in the eastern Donbas region has lost momentum, according to UK military assessment Meanwhile, Ukraine has won the 66th Eurovision song contest - in a symbolic show of public support following the country's invasion Edited by Tom Spender Please join ushere for the latest updates and analysis. And that's all from us today. We're pausing our live page for now but will resume our coverage of Russia's invasion of Ukraine here in the morning. In the meantime you can read our news stories on Sweden and Finland's moves towards joining Natohereand the latest assessments of what's happening on the battlefieldhere. Here's a round-up of today's main events: Putin's warnings to Finland and Sweden not to join Nato have gone unheeded. His invasion of Ukraine has triggered something he does not want: further enlargement of Nato right up to Russiaâs borders. So how could he respond? Military moves For now, President Putin has his hands full in Ukraine so he is unlikely to make any sudden moves in Finland or Swedenâs direction. Russian troops close to the 800-mile(1300km) border with Finland have been redeployed south. In time though, he is likely to move both troops and missiles nearer to Finlandâs border and mount aggressive air and naval patrols Hybrid warfare Cyber-attacks and cyber-espionage have been going on for some time, aimed at most European states. These can now be expected to be directed specifically at Finland and Sweden if they join Nato, accompanied by the usual official denials of culpability. Subversion Putin likes to play a long game and he may well decide that these two Nordic countriesâ historic neutrality means any decision to join Nato can be reversed. In time, he may opt to try to shape public opinion against Nato with the help of online bots and fake accounts. As we've been reporting, Sweden's ruling party has confirmed it is in favour of applying to join Nato. The party's decision came a few hours after Finland also confirmed it was seeking to be part of the alliance. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson addressed reporters soon afterwards: Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent If Sweden joins Nato, it'll represent a return to
strategic significance for its largest island, Gotland. Lying just 200 miles from Kaliningrad, headquarters of Russiaâs Baltic
fleet, the island had been likened to an unsinkable aircraft carrier. An ideal
spot, during the Cold War, from which to defend Sweden and project power over
the Baltic. There was a time when as many as 20,000 troops were stationed there. But Gotland's last military units stood down in 2005 and Gotland fell
into military obscurity. Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, and its subsequent sponsorship of
separatist fighters in the Donbas led Sweden to reconsider. On a visit to the island in 2016, I saw preparations for the return of a
garrison. Michael BydÃ©n, Sweden's Supreme Commander, told me it was all about
sending a message to Russia. ""If you come here, it will hurt."" But it was also about making sure that Sweden - which was already
experiencing regular Russian military incursions into its airspace and
submarine activity close to the capital Stockholm - was not taken by surprise. The Gotland Regiment was reactivated in 2018. Last month, the government announced plans to spend $163m boosting the
islandâs defences. Back in 2016, a
decision to join Nato was still some way off, but listening at the time to
Swedish airforce communications â all in English â was just one of many signs
that when the time came, ""interoperability"" with Nato forces would
not be a problem. Sweden and Finland are supported in their moves towards Nato membership by almost all Nato members - only Turkey has expressed reservations. Ankara accuses both countries of having given support to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has been waging an armed struggle against the Turkish government for decades. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Sweden and Finland must stop supporting terrorists in their countries, provide clear security guarantees and lift export bans on Turkey. But he later added that Turkey was not threatening anybody or seeking leverage. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Nato officials and Swedish and Finnish politicians all say they are confident any concerns can be addressed. Ukraine needs heavy weapons from the West and a ""real oil embargo"" on Russia to defeat the latter by the end of the year, senior Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak says. ""Ukraine is not interested in a protracted war with Russia, same as the whole world. ""We can't beat month this month [as published], but we can do it this year. ""The recipe for victory is simple: real oil embargo + tanks, aircraft and artillery.  Let's end it together,"" he tweets in English. Sweden stopped being neutral ""when we entered the EU in 1995"", the countryâs former prime minister Carl Bildt has told the BBC. The country has not been in a military conflict in over 200 years. If both Sweden and Finland join Nato, Bildt said, it would be possible to ""solidify and unify the defence and security arrangements for the entire northern European area"". Although formalising membership might take some time after application, both countries could formally join a Nato summit taking place in Madrid in June, he said. ""I think it's very important to have the support particularly from the US - that's key,"" he added. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier that his country strongly supported both countries' bids for Nato membership. On the battlefield in Ukraine, Nato's secretary general says Russia's war is not going to plan. Speaking at a meeting of Nato foreign ministers, Jens Stoltenberg said Russia was not achieving ""its strategic objectives"". ""They failed to take Kyiv, they are pulling back from around Kharkiv, their major offensive in Donbas has stalled,"" he added. Mr Stoltenberg also saidUkraine could win the conflict. His comments come as Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD) estimates Russia has lost about a third of its ground combat force since the war began in February. In its assessment, the MoD's estimate of Russia's losses cover men killed or wounded and equipment destroyed or captured. Ukrainian forces were counterattacking in the city of Izyum, regional governor Oleh Sinegubov said, something that could complicate Russian plans to capture the Donbas. However Ukraine's military also acknowledged setbacks in its latest updates, saying Russia was advancing in several areas in the region. Sweden's decision to apply join Nato will end 200 years of military non-alignment. In Finland, which today also confirmed it will put in a Nato bid, polls carried out by Finnish broadcaster Yle showed 76% of the population would support the countryâs membership. But in Sweden joining the alliance is a less popular stance. Recent polls suggest that about half of the population are in favour of joining the defensive military alliance. Although this proportion is far higher than it was before Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine, the countryâs ruling party had previously been split on the issue. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson says her country's decision to apply for Nato membership is ""not something against Russia"" but something that is best for Sweden. She previously said the decision to join the alliance would help Sweden achieve more security and contribute to more security. Andersson confirms her party hopes to synchronise Sweden's membership application with Finland's as much as possible. Russian President Vladimir Putin previously described Finland's intention to join Nato as a mistake. Sweden's Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson says she will go to parliament tomorrow aiming to secure support for an application to join Nato. She also says there's a good chance Turkey's reported doubts about Finland and Sweden's potential membership can be solved. As we reported, on Saturday Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said it was ""unacceptable and outrageous"" that the prospective new members supported the outlawed Kurdish militant group PKK. But on Sunday Nato's Deputy Secretary-General Mircea Geoana said he was confident the concerns could be addressed. Announcing Finland's intention to join Nato earlier, the country's Prime Minister Sanna Marin said her nation's decision would also have to go through parliament but she trusted the Finnish parliament would debate ""this historic decision with determination and responsibility"", while President Sauli Niinisto said he was confused by reports of Turkish concerns.  Finland and Sweden both look like they are a step closer to joining Nato after their announcements today. But what military capabilities will the two nations bring to the alliance? Finland has many more troops at its disposal than its neighbour to the west but the vast majority of those are its huge number of reservists, which it could call up in the event of war. In contrast Sweden has more than five times as many helicopters as Finland. Magdalena Andersson says as a member of Nato Sweden will ""only achieve"" more security and contribute to more security. ""Sweden will be a security provider,"" the Swedish prime minister adds. But she says Sweden will be vulnerable during the application process - before it gets the full backing of other countries a Nato member would have. Magdalena Andersson has also just told reporters that if Sweden was the only country in the Baltic region that did not join Nato ""we would be in a very vulnerable position"". As we've been reporting, Sweden has confirmed its intention to formally apply to join the alliance. The announcement being made by the ruling Social Democrats comes a few hours after Finland announced it was seeking to be part of the alliance. Sweden's Prime Minister Magdalena
Andersson is currently speaking at a press conference. She says Sweden needs the formal security guarantees that come with membership of Nato. She is addressing reporters as Sweden has just announced it intends to apply to join the Nato alliance in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  If you're just joining us, here's a round-up of what's been happening so far today. Sweden'sruling party has just said it backs the country joining Nato. We're expecting to hear more about this in a news conference shortly. The comes hours afterFinlandformally announced it
wants to join the military alliance. Its bid needs to be discussed by its
parliament â but the president and prime minister have both spoken in favour of
joining. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenbergsays the two nations joining would be a historic moment. The people ofUkrainehave had some welcome positive news, with the country's resounding win at the Eurovision Song Contest. The victory was based largely on the votes of the international public, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying it shows the world is impressed with Ukrainian courage. And on the battlefield, Russia's offensive in the easternDonbasregion has lost momentum, according to an assessment from the UK military. Maddy SavageReporting from Stockholm The Social Democrats
chose to announce their decision to back Nato membership with a low-key
statement, half an hour before a scheduled news conference. But their decision
is monumental, paving the way for Sweden to move away from a position of
military neutrality for the first time in two centuries. For political analysts in Sweden the announcement isnât surprising. Social Democrat ministers backed
the findings of a cross-party report on Friday which concluded that membership
would increase security in northern Europe and would be unlikely to trigger an
armed attack from Russia. Meanwhile public support for formally joining Nato has grown steadily since Russia invaded Ukraine. Most opposition parties are in
favour, with just months to go until Swedenâs next general election. Still there are some
within the Social Democrats - and in the opposition Left and Green parties - who are anxious about joining. Not everyoneâs convinced it makes military
aggression from Russia less likely. Others are already
mourning the loss of a national identity as a neutral, peaceful nation thatâs
used to staying out of major global conflicts. We've got more now on the decision of Sweden's ruling party to back the country joining Nato. A statement says: ""The Social Democrats' party board has decided that the party will work for Sweden to apply for membership in Nato."" But it does not want nuclear weapons or Nato bases in Sweden. ""The Social Democrats will thus work to ensure that Sweden, if the application is approved by Nato, expresses unilateral reservations against the deployment of nuclear weapons and permanent bases on Swedish territory,"" the statement continues. Swedish leader Magdalena Andersson and other senior ministers from her party will speak in a news conference in about half an hour. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Ms Malone won an employment tribunal case against Police Scotland A former firearms officer awarded Â£1m from Police Scotland says no amount of compensation will ""ever make up for the pain and sacrifices"" she made. Rhona Malone was victimised while working for the force, an employment tribunal ruled last year. It found evidence of a sexist culture in her armed policing unit. Ms Malone said she was failed by Police Scotland and the Scottish Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers. She said she was still trying to seek ""accountability"" from other organisations, including the Scottish Police Authority. Chief Constable Iain Livingstone has personally apologised to Ms Malone. The Scottish Police Federation said it had a ""long and proud history"" of assisting members in discrimination cases. Police pay out almost Â£1m over sexism case Ex-officer says police federation abandoned her Sexist 'boys' club' culture in armed police unit In a statement published a day after her Â£947,909.07 compensation deal was confirmed, Ms Malone said the last few years had been ""excruciating and torturous"". But she said she hoped her experience of winning a victimisation claim against the force at an employment tribunal would ""benefit many women now and in the future"". Ms Malone began her action against Police Scotland after a senior police officer said he did not want to see two female armed officers deployed together when there were sufficient male staff on duty. The tribunal accepted evidence that there was an ""absolute boys' club"" culture within the armed response vehicle team in the east of Scotland. In its judgment last October, it upheld Ms Malone's claims of victimisation. However, her claim of direct discrimination was dismissed. Ms Malone's statement went on to say she was grateful for the options and opportunities open to her following the payout from Police Scotland. But she said they came at a ""great cost"" to herself, her family and her career. ""I would like it to be known that no amount of compensation would ever make up for the pain or sacrifices I made to hold Police Scotland to account but it will enable me to continue with my quest for holding them and others answerable for their actions,"" she said. And the former firearms officer criticised the actions of both Police Scotland and the Scottish Police Federation for their conduct. ""Both organisations failed me and grossly underestimated my determination for acknowledgment and accountability,"" she said. Rhona Malone was a police firearms officer Ms Malone said the federation withdrew legal support for her case in 2019 when she refused to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and accept a ""derisory"" financial settlement. As a result she was left with costs running into six figures. ""At a time when I was at my most vulnerable and reliant on their support financially and mentally, I was abandoned, ignored, and discarded,"" she said. ""I should not have been put in this position as a fully paid-up member of the federation,"" Ms Malone added. ""Sadly, I know from other female police officers who have reached out to me that my experiences with the federation are not unique."" The federation said it withdrew legal assistance following independent legal advice that the settlement terms were ""unlikely to be better than what a tribunal would award"". It added that the federation continued to support Ms Malone throughout the tribunal, with one official giving evidence on her behalf. ""Ms Malone's claims that she was abandoned, ignored and discarded by the Federation are demonstrably untrue,"" the federation added. ""We are nonetheless pleased that for Ms Malone, this matter has finally been resolved."" Chief Constable Iain Livingstone has personally apologised to Ms Malone for issues highlighted in the tribunal, according to a joint statement issued by Police Scotland and their former employee on Friday. It said the chief constable was committed to ""leading change"" in policing in Scotland to improve the experiences of women. Meanwhile the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) is carrying out a review of the employment tribunal decision, and it is in its final stages. A spokesperson for the Scottish Police Authority said: ""The chief constable has been clear that there is no place for victimisation or misogyny in policing and reinforced his commitment to driving improvement which the authority fully supports. ""We will continue to oversee and seek assurance around the progress and pace of change within policing and consider any recommendations from the PSNI review in due course.""

Andersson confirms her party hopes to synchronise Sweden's membership application with Finland's as much as possible. Russian President Vladimir Putin previously described Finland's intention to join Nato as a mistake. Sweden's Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson says she will go to parliament tomorrow aiming to secure support for an application to join Nato. She also says there's a good chance Turkey's reported doubts about Finland and Sweden's potential membership can be solved. As we reported, on Saturday Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said it was ""unacceptable and outrageous"" that the prospective new members supported the outlawed Kurdish militant group PKK. But on Sunday Nato's Deputy Secretary-General Mircea Geoana said he was confident the concerns could be addressed. Announcing Finland's intention to join Nato earlier, the country's Prime Minister Sanna Marin said her nation's decision would also have to go through parliament but she trusted the Finnish parliament would debate ""this historic decision with determination and responsibility"", while President Sauli Niinisto said he was confused by reports of Turkish concerns.  Finland and Sweden both look like they are a step closer to joining Nato after their announcements today. But what military capabilities will the two nations bring to the alliance? Finland has many more troops at its disposal than its neighbour to the west but the vast majority of those are its huge number of reservists, which it could call up in the event of war. In contrast Sweden has more than five times as many helicopters as Finland. Magdalena Andersson says as a member of Nato Sweden will ""only achieve"" more security and contribute to more security. ""Sweden will be a security provider,"" the Swedish prime minister adds. But she says Sweden will be vulnerable during the application process - before it gets the full backing of other countries a Nato member would have. Magdalena Andersson has also just told reporters that if Sweden was the only country in the Baltic region that did not join Nato ""we would be in a very vulnerable position"". As we've been reporting, Sweden has confirmed its intention to formally apply to join the alliance. The announcement being made by the ruling Social Democrats comes a few hours after Finland announced it was seeking to be part of the alliance. Sweden's Prime Minister Magdalena
Andersson is currently speaking at a press conference. She says Sweden needs the formal security guarantees that come with membership of Nato. She is addressing reporters as Sweden has just announced it intends to apply to join the Nato alliance in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  If you're just joining us, here's a round-up of what's been happening so far today. Sweden'sruling party has just said it backs the country joining Nato. We're expecting to hear more about this in a news conference shortly. The comes hours afterFinlandformally announced it
wants to join the military alliance. Its bid needs to be discussed by its
parliament â but the president and prime minister have both spoken in favour of
joining. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenbergsays the two nations joining would be a historic moment. The people ofUkrainehave had some welcome positive news, with the country's resounding win at the Eurovision Song Contest. The victory was based largely on the votes of the international public, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying it shows the world is impressed with Ukrainian courage. And on the battlefield, Russia's offensive in the easternDonbasregion has lost momentum, according to an assessment from the UK military. Maddy SavageReporting from Stockholm The Social Democrats
chose to announce their decision to back Nato membership with a low-key
statement, half an hour before a scheduled news conference. But their decision
is monumental, paving the way for Sweden to move away from a position of
military neutrality for the first time in two centuries. For political analysts in Sweden the announcement isnât surprising. Social Democrat ministers backed
the findings of a cross-party report on Friday which concluded that membership
would increase security in northern Europe and would be unlikely to trigger an
armed attack from Russia. Meanwhile public support for formally joining Nato has grown steadily since Russia invaded Ukraine. Most opposition parties are in
favour, with just months to go until Swedenâs next general election. Still there are some
within the Social Democrats - and in the opposition Left and Green parties - who are anxious about joining. Not everyoneâs convinced it makes military
aggression from Russia less likely. Others are already
mourning the loss of a national identity as a neutral, peaceful nation thatâs
used to staying out of major global conflicts. We've got more now on the decision of Sweden's ruling party to back the country joining Nato. A statement says: ""The Social Democrats' party board has decided that the party will work for Sweden to apply for membership in Nato."" But it does not want nuclear weapons or Nato bases in Sweden. ""The Social Democrats will thus work to ensure that Sweden, if the application is approved by Nato, expresses unilateral reservations against the deployment of nuclear weapons and permanent bases on Swedish territory,"" the statement continues. Swedish leader Magdalena Andersson and other senior ministers from her party will speak in a news conference in about half an hour. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Vicki, pictured with her partner Michael, says she uses a pawnbroker because her only alternative source of credit would be door step lending or loan sharks ""Basically so we can buy food and just survive,"" says Vicki. The 36-year-old from Chester is explaining how she used the money she got from pawning a games console. As the cost of living rises, a new report suggests people on low incomes are pawning their possessions to pay for everyday essentials. The National Pawnbrokers Association (NPA) says it will meet with the UK's finance watchdog next week to discuss the research. The NPA is worried banks are shutting down pawnbroker accounts because of money laundering concerns and it wants the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to work with banks to resolve the issue. The number of pawnbrokers has fallen from more than 2,000 in 2014 to fewer than 900 last year. The report from independent think tank the Social Market Foundation,external, which was paid for by the NPA, says pawnbroking is an ""essential source of credit for some customers, who feel they have no alternative ways to borrow"". Why are prices rising so quickly? 'My tears over pawned jewellery' Pawnbroker warns probe could spark loan shark rush Vicki, who describes herself as long-term disabled and receives around Â£480 a month in benefits, agrees. If she wasn't able to use pawnbrokers she says the only alternatives would be doorstep lending or loan sharks - illegal moneylenders who often charge very high interest rates. It's something Vicki has been forced to use before but never wants to do again. ""I used a loan shark for Â£100. I fell behind on one of the payments and the people came to my door and I was threatened,"" she says. ""For that Â£100 I ended up paying Â£700 back... because I missed one payment [so] I'd much rather use a pawnbrokers than a loan shark because you know what you're dealing with and I know I'm safe."" The NPA says the most common items pawned are electrical goods (phones, laptops and games consoles) and jewellery, with the average loan being around Â£300. Across the industry about 85% of items are redeemed by customers. A pawnbroker is an individual person or shop which offers secured loans against people's personal possessions - most often items like electronics or jewellery. The customer and pawnbroker agree an amount that can be loaned against the item and how much interest will be charged on the loan. The customer then has up to six months to redeem the item and pay the agreed interest or, if it's not redeemed, the pawnbroker has the legal right to sell the item to recoup the original loan and interest. Any surplus money earned from such a sale should be given to the customer. More information is available from theNational Pawnbrokers Association,external. Consumer advice on pawnbroking is available fromCitizens Advice,externaland theMoney and Pensions Service,external Critics of pawnbrokers point out the high interest rates and low valuation of people's possessions as reasons why they're not a good source of finance for people on low incomes. Around 10% a month interest is typical but it is charged by the day and the average length of a loan is four months. Debt charity StepChange says it would rather have more alternatives available to people than high-cost credit but that pawnbroking can be a lot safer than many of the alternatives. Paul Smit owns 20 pawnbrokers across the UK Paul Smit, a former president of the National Pawnbrokers Association, will take part in the meeting with the FCA next week. He says the Social Market Foundation report ""highlights the societal role that pawnbrokers play in providing finance to those who would otherwise be excluded from legitimate finance and would be left with no alternative than illegal, unregulated loan sharks"". ""We hope and believe that, once the FCA appreciate that the loss of access to pawnbroking services would have a devastating effect on these people, that the FCA will work with the pawnbroking and banking industries, both of which they regulate, to agree an approach that will stop the closure of pawnbrokers' bank accounts by banks,"" he adds. UK Finance, which represents the banking industry, said it recognised the ""valuable role"" played by pawnbrokers in providing credit. ""All banks must follow strict regulations to deal with the risks of money laundering and financial crime,"" it said in a statement. ""Any decision to close an account is only taken after extensive review on a case-by-case basis."" Update: This article has been amended to remove a case study for editorial reasons.

Due to Covid, the meet-ups had to stop but the pair continued to support one another online. ""The mothers who came told us they don't feel so alone in the motherhood journey,"" Kayleigh said.

"Sweden's governing party drops its long opposition to the country joining the Nato alliance in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine The news came hours after Finland formally announced it was seeking to be part of the alliance Russia - whose war in Ukraine has sparked the moves - has warned the expansion of Nato would be a mistake Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg says the doors are open for both countries to join, describing the potential change as ""historic"" On the ground, Russia's offensive in the eastern Donbas region has lost momentum, according to UK military assessment Meanwhile, Ukraine has won the 66th Eurovision song contest - in a symbolic show of public support following the country's invasion Edited by Tom Spender Please join ushere for the latest updates and analysis. And that's all from us today. We're pausing our live page for now but will resume our coverage of Russia's invasion of Ukraine here in the morning. In the meantime you can read our news stories on Sweden and Finland's moves towards joining Natohereand the latest assessments of what's happening on the battlefieldhere. Here's a round-up of today's main events: Putin's warnings to Finland and Sweden not to join Nato have gone unheeded. His invasion of Ukraine has triggered something he does not want: further enlargement of Nato right up to Russiaâs borders. So how could he respond? Military moves For now, President Putin has his hands full in Ukraine so he is unlikely to make any sudden moves in Finland or Swedenâs direction. Russian troops close to the 800-mile(1300km) border with Finland have been redeployed south. In time though, he is likely to move both troops and missiles nearer to Finlandâs border and mount aggressive air and naval patrols Hybrid warfare Cyber-attacks and cyber-espionage have been going on for some time, aimed at most European states. These can now be expected to be directed specifically at Finland and Sweden if they join Nato, accompanied by the usual official denials of culpability. Subversion Putin likes to play a long game and he may well decide that these two Nordic countriesâ historic neutrality means any decision to join Nato can be reversed. In time, he may opt to try to shape public opinion against Nato with the help of online bots and fake accounts. As we've been reporting, Sweden's ruling party has confirmed it is in favour of applying to join Nato. The party's decision came a few hours after Finland also confirmed it was seeking to be part of the alliance. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson addressed reporters soon afterwards: Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent If Sweden joins Nato, it'll represent a return to
strategic significance for its largest island, Gotland. Lying just 200 miles from Kaliningrad, headquarters of Russiaâs Baltic
fleet, the island had been likened to an unsinkable aircraft carrier. An ideal
spot, during the Cold War, from which to defend Sweden and project power over
the Baltic. There was a time when as many as 20,000 troops were stationed there. But Gotland's last military units stood down in 2005 and Gotland fell
into military obscurity. Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, and its subsequent sponsorship of
separatist fighters in the Donbas led Sweden to reconsider. On a visit to the island in 2016, I saw preparations for the return of a
garrison. Michael BydÃ©n, Sweden's Supreme Commander, told me it was all about
sending a message to Russia. ""If you come here, it will hurt."" But it was also about making sure that Sweden - which was already
experiencing regular Russian military incursions into its airspace and
submarine activity close to the capital Stockholm - was not taken by surprise. The Gotland Regiment was reactivated in 2018. Last month, the government announced plans to spend $163m boosting the
islandâs defences. Back in 2016, a
decision to join Nato was still some way off, but listening at the time to
Swedish airforce communications â all in English â was just one of many signs
that when the time came, ""interoperability"" with Nato forces would
not be a problem. Sweden and Finland are supported in their moves towards Nato membership by almost all Nato members - only Turkey has expressed reservations. Ankara accuses both countries of having given support to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has been waging an armed struggle against the Turkish government for decades. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Sweden and Finland must stop supporting terrorists in their countries, provide clear security guarantees and lift export bans on Turkey. But he later added that Turkey was not threatening anybody or seeking leverage. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Nato officials and Swedish and Finnish politicians all say they are confident any concerns can be addressed. Ukraine needs heavy weapons from the West and a ""real oil embargo"" on Russia to defeat the latter by the end of the year, senior Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak says. ""Ukraine is not interested in a protracted war with Russia, same as the whole world. ""We can't beat month this month [as published], but we can do it this year. ""The recipe for victory is simple: real oil embargo + tanks, aircraft and artillery.  Let's end it together,"" he tweets in English. Sweden stopped being neutral ""when we entered the EU in 1995"", the countryâs former prime minister Carl Bildt has told the BBC. The country has not been in a military conflict in over 200 years. If both Sweden and Finland join Nato, Bildt said, it would be possible to ""solidify and unify the defence and security arrangements for the entire northern European area"". Although formalising membership might take some time after application, both countries could formally join a Nato summit taking place in Madrid in June, he said. ""I think it's very important to have the support particularly from the US - that's key,"" he added. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier that his country strongly supported both countries' bids for Nato membership. On the battlefield in Ukraine, Nato's secretary general says Russia's war is not going to plan. Speaking at a meeting of Nato foreign ministers, Jens Stoltenberg said Russia was not achieving ""its strategic objectives"". ""They failed to take Kyiv, they are pulling back from around Kharkiv, their major offensive in Donbas has stalled,"" he added. Mr Stoltenberg also saidUkraine could win the conflict. His comments come as Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD) estimates Russia has lost about a third of its ground combat force since the war began in February. In its assessment, the MoD's estimate of Russia's losses cover men killed or wounded and equipment destroyed or captured. Ukrainian forces were counterattacking in the city of Izyum, regional governor Oleh Sinegubov said, something that could complicate Russian plans to capture the Donbas. However Ukraine's military also acknowledged setbacks in its latest updates, saying Russia was advancing in several areas in the region. Sweden's decision to apply join Nato will end 200 years of military non-alignment. In Finland, which today also confirmed it will put in a Nato bid, polls carried out by Finnish broadcaster Yle showed 76% of the population would support the countryâs membership. But in Sweden joining the alliance is a less popular stance. Recent polls suggest that about half of the population are in favour of joining the defensive military alliance. Although this proportion is far higher than it was before Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine, the countryâs ruling party had previously been split on the issue. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson says her country's decision to apply for Nato membership is ""not something against Russia"" but something that is best for Sweden. She previously said the decision to join the alliance would help Sweden achieve more security and contribute to more security. Andersson confirms her party hopes to synchronise Sweden's membership application with Finland's as much as possible. Russian President Vladimir Putin previously described Finland's intention to join Nato as a mistake. Sweden's Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson says she will go to parliament tomorrow aiming to secure support for an application to join Nato. She also says there's a good chance Turkey's reported doubts about Finland and Sweden's potential membership can be solved. As we reported, on Saturday Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said it was ""unacceptable and outrageous"" that the prospective new members supported the outlawed Kurdish militant group PKK. But on Sunday Nato's Deputy Secretary-General Mircea Geoana said he was confident the concerns could be addressed. Announcing Finland's intention to join Nato earlier, the country's Prime Minister Sanna Marin said her nation's decision would also have to go through parliament but she trusted the Finnish parliament would debate ""this historic decision with determination and responsibility"", while President Sauli Niinisto said he was confused by reports of Turkish concerns.  Finland and Sweden both look like they are a step closer to joining Nato after their announcements today. But what military capabilities will the two nations bring to the alliance? Finland has many more troops at its disposal than its neighbour to the west but the vast majority of those are its huge number of reservists, which it could call up in the event of war. In contrast Sweden has more than five times as many helicopters as Finland. Magdalena Andersson says as a member of Nato Sweden will ""only achieve"" more security and contribute to more security. ""Sweden will be a security provider,"" the Swedish prime minister adds. But she says Sweden will be vulnerable during the application process - before it gets the full backing of other countries a Nato member would have. Magdalena Andersson has also just told reporters that if Sweden was the only country in the Baltic region that did not join Nato ""we would be in a very vulnerable position"". As we've been reporting, Sweden has confirmed its intention to formally apply to join the alliance. The announcement being made by the ruling Social Democrats comes a few hours after Finland announced it was seeking to be part of the alliance. Sweden's Prime Minister Magdalena
Andersson is currently speaking at a press conference. She says Sweden needs the formal security guarantees that come with membership of Nato. She is addressing reporters as Sweden has just announced it intends to apply to join the Nato alliance in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  If you're just joining us, here's a round-up of what's been happening so far today. Sweden'sruling party has just said it backs the country joining Nato. We're expecting to hear more about this in a news conference shortly. The comes hours afterFinlandformally announced it
wants to join the military alliance. Its bid needs to be discussed by its
parliament â but the president and prime minister have both spoken in favour of
joining. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenbergsays the two nations joining would be a historic moment. The people ofUkrainehave had some welcome positive news, with the country's resounding win at the Eurovision Song Contest. The victory was based largely on the votes of the international public, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying it shows the world is impressed with Ukrainian courage. And on the battlefield, Russia's offensive in the easternDonbasregion has lost momentum, according to an assessment from the UK military. Maddy SavageReporting from Stockholm The Social Democrats
chose to announce their decision to back Nato membership with a low-key
statement, half an hour before a scheduled news conference. But their decision
is monumental, paving the way for Sweden to move away from a position of
military neutrality for the first time in two centuries. For political analysts in Sweden the announcement isnât surprising. Social Democrat ministers backed
the findings of a cross-party report on Friday which concluded that membership
would increase security in northern Europe and would be unlikely to trigger an
armed attack from Russia. Meanwhile public support for formally joining Nato has grown steadily since Russia invaded Ukraine. Most opposition parties are in
favour, with just months to go until Swedenâs next general election. Still there are some
within the Social Democrats - and in the opposition Left and Green parties - who are anxious about joining. Not everyoneâs convinced it makes military
aggression from Russia less likely. Others are already
mourning the loss of a national identity as a neutral, peaceful nation thatâs
used to staying out of major global conflicts. We've got more now on the decision of Sweden's ruling party to back the country joining Nato. A statement says: ""The Social Democrats' party board has decided that the party will work for Sweden to apply for membership in Nato."" But it does not want nuclear weapons or Nato bases in Sweden. ""The Social Democrats will thus work to ensure that Sweden, if the application is approved by Nato, expresses unilateral reservations against the deployment of nuclear weapons and permanent bases on Swedish territory,"" the statement continues. Swedish leader Magdalena Andersson and other senior ministers from her party will speak in a news conference in about half an hour. Â© 2025 BBC.
