"One cabinet minister, in particular, has been saying privately to me for two years, and probably to anyone else that would listen, that the deal with the EU will only be done at the eleventh minute, in the eleventh hour, on the eleventh day, at the so on and so on and so on and so on - you get the picture. That's, according to them, how the EU always works, and it is only at that last dreaded moment that there will be enough urgency for everyone around the table to forget their differences and get the thing done. If you follow along with that analogy, tonight's change of plan is playing out exactly according to that script. Some may even argue that resistance from EU countries like France and Spain, especially over fishing rights, will only help the Prime Minister in her attempt to sell the deal once (if) it's signed off. Look Brexiteers, look how hard I had to fight! I have annoyed the French - hurrah! (As my Brussels colleagues point out too, these jitters play well in other European countries too where leaders often succumb to the same temptation as UK politicians - complaining sometimes, loudly, about the strictures of the EU that, claims that can help them out politically at home). UK still expects Brexit deal this weekend Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict There are real issues at stake, over Gibraltar, over fish, over the EU's distaste for the UK's preferred model of the ""common rule book"" - it comes down to the same argument about the UK being a friend with benefits, and not enough of the obligations that comes along with the goodies. But the sense tonight, which of course could change very quickly, from Number 10 at least, is that these are last minute squeals rather than brand new problems that could see the whole thing implode. Even so, Theresa May will fight anything that makes it harder for the package to get through Parliament. And if we stick to that cabinet minister's script for a moment, the bigger challenge than herding the continental cats, will be getting enough MPs on board. Goodness knows, with dozens of Tory MPs on the record saying they will vote against the deal, the opposition parties lining up to condemn it, it is extremely hard right now to see the deal passing through. Senior figures in Number 10 believe it is still possible, with a change in dynamic once the thing is signed, and no doubt, enormous political pressure from inside and outside the Tory Party brought on their MPs. Cabinet ministers are split on whether it can happen. Two in the last day or so have told me the deal might just about make it in the final vote, pencilled in for somewhere around the 10th, 11th or 12th of December. That might sound crazy now, but I also can't emphasise enough how we cannot right now imagine ourselves in the minds of MPs in a fortnight's time. But in that same twenty four hours two cabinet ministers have said the total opposite privately that there is simply no way it can pass. And another member of Cabinet, admittedly not the deal's most ardent fan, suggested that Number 10 have become blinkered to reality saying, it's like Downing Street is ""a couple stuck in a bad marriage"". ""They are the only people who can't see that it isn't working and they should just admit it and split up. When they do they say to everyone they know, 'why didn't you tell us?' That means that government figures are discussing the possibility of a second vote on the deal. Not another referendum, but having another go in Parliament. There is discussion about this in Number 10, I'm told, and one minister told me ""we are looking at this as a possible way out"". The thinking is that it would be easier in particular for Labour MPs to come on board. In other words, protest first time round, but then come on side to choose a deal, rather than no deal, when a similar question is put. But despite chatter about this being some kind of preferred option for the government, because the turmoil the deal's rejection might unleash could be the ""proof"" required to get it through a second time, I'm told categorically that ""no one is looking at this with any enthusiasm"". Deluded or not, there is still a hope, if not a conviction in some parts of government, that the deal might (just) be able to pass.

"This is the first time the US top court's leader has spoken out against President Trump US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has taken the extraordinary step of rebuking President Donald Trump's criticism of a federal judge. Mr Trump on Tuesday called a jurist who ruled against his asylum policy an ""Obama judge"". The president's gibe provoked a stern statement from the head of America's highest court. Mr Trump has defended his comments, saying Chief Justice Roberts is wrong. It is the first time the chief justice has spoken against Mr Trump. ""We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,"",externalChief Justice Roberts told the Associated Press. ""What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them."" Speaking on the eve of America's Thanksgiving holiday, he said an ""independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for"". Mr Trump responded on Twitter on Wednesday, saying the top justice was wrong and that ""Obama judges... have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country"".

It is extremely rare for a senior member of the judiciary to clash with a US president. Chief Justice Roberts' Supreme Court colleague Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been a far more outspoken critic of Mr Trump. Why half of America panics when this woman falls ill Why US top court is more political than UK's Confidence in US judiciary 'diminishing' In 2016, the liberal judgeapologised for calling Mr Trump a ""faker""in an interview after coming under fire for commenting on a candidate as a jurist. Mr Trump has previously lambasted federal judges for ruling against his policies.  In 2017, he calleda federal jurist who reversed his controversial travel bana ""so-called judge"" with a ""ridiculous"" opinion. Chief Justice Roberts (right) is not the first jurist to speak out against Mr Trump Chief Justice Roberts - who was appointed to lead the court in 2005 by President George W Bush - was responding to the news agency's request for reaction to Mr Trump's remark a day earlier. The Republican president had spoken out following US District Judge Jon Tigar's ruling against a presidential executive order denying illegal migrants the right to seek asylum, calling the 9th Circuit ""a disgrace"". ""I'm going to put in a major complaint because you cannot win - if you're us - a case in the 9th Circuit and I think it's a disgrace,"" Mr Trump told reporters outside the White House. ""This was an Obama judge. And I'll tell you what, it's not going to happen like this anymore."" Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News Members of the Supreme Court - in fact, the whole of the federal judiciary- like to think of themselves as above and apart from the tumult of American politics. For some time, however, such an idea has been honoured more in the breach than the observance, with courts often becoming mired in fiercely partisan matters. The politicisation of the judiciary is now reaching a crescendo, as Donald Trump repeatedly questions the impartiality and motives of judges. The president is, with his comments, seemingly chipping away at the authority of a co-equal branch of government. That may be why the president's latest fusillade against an ""Obama judge"" prompted a rare and direct rebuke from the head of the judiciary, John Roberts. The pointed statement seems destined to set off another round of criticism directed at the chief justice, who - after his 2012 ruling upholding the constitutionality of Obamacare - many Trump supporters feel is insufficiently loyal to their cause. The president was very quick, via Twitter, to call recent lower-court decisions suspending his immigration policies ""dangerous and unwise"". That the normally cautious jurist felt compelled to speak out underscores just how fraught the current situation has become. This video can not be played Border vigilante Ken Lester says all migrants from Central America are ""invaders"" This most recent feud with the judiciary relates to the large group of Central American migrants making their way to the US-Mexico border. Mr Trump had ramped up his rhetoric around the ""caravan"" of migrants during the mid-term election season, calling the group ""an invasion"". Judge halts Trump's asylum ban He signed a proclamation on 9 November saying that anyone who wants to claim asylum in the US has to come in through official points of entry - and their cases will not be heard if they enter illegally. A statement at the time said: ""We are using the authority granted to us by Congress to bar aliens who violate a presidential suspension of entry or other restriction from asylum eligibility."" Mr Trump deployed military troops to help secure the US-Mexico border at the end of last month. On Wednesday, Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said he had been given authority to use military force to protect border officials if necessary. Speaking with reporters,Mr Mattis also said that military police armed with batons and shields could be given powers to temporarily detain migrants for ""minutes""if, for example, someone was ""beating on a border patrolman"". He added that these officers would not carry firearms or have the power to carry out arrests. What is the migrant caravan heading to US? A river of people: The migrant caravan in pictures About 3,000 members of the caravan have so far arrived in Tijuana, the Mexican city bordering the US, and authorities expect numbers to reach 10,000 in coming weeks. On Tuesday, the Pentagon released a report to Congress saying the deployment of around 5,900 active-duty troops would cost about $72m (Â£56m), plus the $138m (Â£108m) already spent on 2,100 National Guard troops on border missions since April. In addition, more than $80m (Â£62m) has been spent to process thousands of migrant children separated from parents under the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" crackdown earlier this year, report US media. Mr Trump eventually backed downon the policy that saw over 2,000 migrant children taken away from adults at the US-Mexico border between May and June. Around 140 children remain in government custody as of this week. Who are the justices on the US Supreme Court? What is the US Supreme Court?

"The ad was posted months after the real-life murder of a woman in similar circumstances A French court has ruled that posters showing a woman tied to train tracks did not promote violence against women. The posters were put up around the town of BÃ©ziers last December to celebrate the arrival of high-speed TGV trains. They carried the caption: ""With the TGV, she would have suffered less."" The ads faced a legal challenge from a number of feminist groups and criticism by France's equality minister. But the court said they were legal, despite the questionable humour. The posters were launched four months after 34-year-old Emilie Hallouin died when she was tied to TGV tracks by her husband and hit by a train in a murder-suicide in northern France. Many Twitter users, including French Senator Laurence Rossignol, drew parallels between the posters and the tragic news story. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Why do we have so many potholes? Highways England has blamed the Beast from the East storm for the number of pothole compensation claims against it more than doubling in 2017/18. There were 528 successful claims relating to vehicle damage caused by potholes last year, up from 212 in 2016/17 and 187 in 2015/16. Over the same period, the cost to Highways England of settling the claims rose from Â£54,301 to Â£164,341. The organisation said in a statement: ""Safety is our top priority."" The data, which waspublished following a Freedom of Information request,external, showed the increase in claims came despite the body filling almost 6,000 more potholes last year than in the previous 12 months.

"This video can not be played James Cordier apologised to his investors The boss of a Florida-based financial firm has made a tearful video apology to clients after bad bets on oil and natural gas prices wiped out their investments. James Cordier blamed a recent bout of market volatility for the losses, which are set to destroy his firm. ""I truly invested your funds like you were family,"" he said in the10-minute video posted on YouTube,external. ""I'm sorry that this rogue wave capsized our boat."" Natural gas prices enjoyed their biggest one-day percentage gain in eight years on Wednesday last week, only to suffered their largest one-day loss in 15 years the very next day. Meanwhile, oil prices have also fallen sharply. Mr Cordier is president of OptionSellers.com, based in Tampa, and co-wrote a book called The Complete Guide to Option Selling. The company managed money for wealthy investors and specialised in options, which give investors the right to buy or sell at a pre-determined price. OptionSellers said the losses were its ""clients' private business. We are in communication with them."" It was not clear how much money the firm managed or the size of the losses. Mr Cordier said in his video that he had 290 clients. However, the losses could total more than $150m, according to Ohio lawyer Jason Albin, who has been in contact with about 80 clients. Mr Albin said he thought the trades, which in some cases involved retirement accounts, should not have been permitted because of the risk involved. He is looking at taking legal action against INTL FCStone, the brokerage that cleared the bets on behalf of Mr Cordier's company. INTL FCStone declined to comment on the claims. The firm said accounts managed by Optionsellers.com were liquidated after ""unprecedented volatility"" in the oil and gas markets last week. ""Although well collateralized, accounts managed by a commodities trading advisor, Optionsellers.com, had to be liquidated as a result of these moves,"" the company said.

"The couple have until 7 December to decide whether to pay Â£300 costs and accept cautions A couple who had to go to court for taking their child out of school to go on their honeymoon have ""no regrets"". Janine and Shane Scott, from Stockton, on Teesside, took Elissa, seven, to New York for five days believing it was an ""exceptional circumstance"". But when they returned they were given fixed penalty notices by St John's Church of England Primary School. They refused to pay but magistrates backed the school and ordered the couple to pay its costs. The school said the couple had booked the trip without ""prior discussion"".

They now have until 7 December to decide whether to pay Â£300 towards the school's costs and accept a caution, or to fight the case and risk criminal convictions if they lose. Mrs Scott said: ""I don't regret taking Elissa on our honeymoon - it was definitely in her best interests, but in hindsight I'd request permission in writing from the school. ""I do now also regret that decision to phone up; it was short notice.""

Mrs Scott denies ringing the school from New York to report her daughter's absence, adding: ""I wouldn't have spent money phoning up the school from New York. ""That didn't happen. I do accept though that it was really short notice when we phoned the school. ""I still believe now in the five days she was there she got a lot more education than she would [have] in the five days if she was at school."" The parents of seven-year-old Elissa said the trip was educational Mr Scott, a 27-year-old bus driver, said he had four weeks holiday allowance a year and was unable to take any of it during the school holidays. Mrs Scott, 28, also said their honeymoon was educational for Elissa with trips to the 9/11 memorial, Broadway, the National History Museum and Wall Street. A statement from the school said: ""What is particularly disappointing in this case is that the holiday was booked without prior discussion with the school. ""The school was then informed when the holiday had already started.

"Mannose is available as a supplement but is also found naturally in fruits such as cranberries A nutritional supplement may be able to slow the development of some cancers and enhance the effects of treatment, a study in mice suggests. Mice with pancreatic, lung or skin cancer were given mannose, a sugar also found in cranberries and other fruits. It significantly slowed the growth of their tumours, with no obvious side-effects, researchers found. However, patients are being told not to start supplementing with mannose because of the risk of side-effects. Scientists hope to test the supplement in people soon. Mannose, which can be bought in health food shops and is sometimes used to treat urinary tract infections, is thought to interfere with the ability of tumours to use glucose to grow. The hospitals that fail to treat patients on time Early risers have lower breast cancer risk Scientists also looked at how mannose might affect cancer treatment by giving it to mice that had been treated with two of the most widely used chemotherapy drugs, cisplatin and doxorubicin. They found it enhanced the effects of chemotherapy, slowing the growth of tumours and reducing their size. It also increased the lifespan of some mice. In further tests, cells from other types of cancer, including leukaemia, osteosarcoma (bone cancer), ovarian and bowel cancer were exposed to mannose in the laboratory. Some cells responded well, while others did not. How well the cells responded appeared to depend on the levels they had of an enzyme that breaks down mannose. Lead author Prof Kevin Ryan, from the Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, said his team had found a dosage of mannose that ""could block enough glucose to slow tumour growth in mice but not so much that normal tissues were affected"". Bodies require glucose for energy but cancerous tumours also use it to fuel their growth. ""This is early research but it is hoped that finding this perfect balance means that, in the future, mannose could be given to cancer patients to enhance chemotherapy without damaging their overall health,"" he said. One advantage of mannose is that it is cheaper than drugs produced by pharmaceutical companies. And Prof Ryan said he hoped tests in people could begin soon. However, he and other experts warn that the findings do not mean people with cancer should start supplementing with mannose. Martin Ledwick, Cancer Research UK's head nurse, said: ""Although these results are very promising for the future of some cancer treatments, this is very early research and has not yet been tested in humans. ""Patients should not self-prescribe mannose, as there is a real risk of negative side-effects that haven't been tested for yet. ""It's important to consult with a doctor before drastically changing your diet or taking new supplements."" Prof Ryan said his team would next seek to investigate why mannose worked in some cancer cells and not others, so they could work out which patients might benefit the most.

"Daniela Tejada previously said her husband Matthew Hedges was being held in ""inhumane and degrading"" conditions A British PhD student has been sentenced to life in prison in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for spying. Matthew Hedges, 31, of Durham University, has said he is innocent, and that he had been researching the country's security strategy. Prosecutors say he admitted the charges in an Abu Dhabi court, which found him guilty of ""spying for or on behalf of"" the UK government. The PM said the UK was urgently seeking talks with the Emirati government. Theresa May said Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was ""seeking a call with Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed"". Mr Hunt said he was ""deeply shocked and disappointed"" by the verdict. He said he had raised the case with the ""highest levels of the UAE government"", adding the verdict was ""not what we expect from a friend and trusted partner of the United Kingdom, and runs contrary to earlier assurances"". This video can not be played Theresa May is asked about the fate of Matthew Hedges at PMQs In a statement, Hedges' family said that during the first six weeks of his detention he was interrogated without a lawyer and consular access was unavailable. During this time he was made to sign a document in Arabic which transpired to be a confession, they said. ""Matthew does not speak or read Arabic,"" the family added. Hedges' wife Daniela Tejada, who was present during the brief hearing earlier, said she was in ""complete shock"". Daniela Tejada has repeatedly rejected suggestions her husband, Matthew Hedges, is a spy She said: ""Matthew is innocent. The Foreign Office know this and have made it clear to the UAE authorities that Matthew is not a spy for them. ""This whole case has been handled appallingly from the very beginning with no-one taking Matthew's case seriously."" She said the British government ""must take a stand now"" and the UAE authorities ""should feel ashamed for such an obvious injustice"". Does UAE stability come at a price? United Arab Emirates profile Click here for live updates Ms Tejada said her husband shook his head as the verdict was delivered, adding: ""I am very scared for Matt. ""I don't know where they are taking him or what will happen now. Our nightmare has gotten even worse."" At prime minister's questions, Tory MP Crispin Blunt told Mrs May she should make clear to the UAE that ""if he is not released, I don't see why we should be committed to their defence"". BBC diplomatic correspondent I was confidently expecting that we would hear some good news today because all the indications through private channels, and things I understood the family had been hearing, that the Foreign Office had been hearing, that MPs had been hearing, was that the UAE was frankly a little embarrassed about this case and wanted it over with. So no-one was expecting the sentence of life imprisonment that has absolutely stunned everyone. According to Abu Dhabi newspaper The National, alife sentence means a maximum of 25 years,externalin jail, after which Hedges would be deported. Hedges, who is also liable for the costs of the case, has 30 days to appeal during which time he will be held in custody, the paper reports. Attorney General Dr Hamad Saif Al Shamsi confirmed the sentence was not final and said Hedges had the right to appeal before the Federal Supreme Court for retrial. He said: ''The defendant confessed in detail to his crimes during investigations whereby he was accorded his full rights and assurances as per the UAE constitution and state laws to fair and transparent trial."" Dr Al Shamsi said Hedges had appeared in court with British embassy representatives. This video can not be played ""They're doing this to send a signal, that's pretty clear"" says MP Bob Seely, on the sentencing of Matthew Hedges by the UAE Meanwhile, Mr Hunt urged the UAE to reconsider the case. ""Our consular officials have been in close contact with Matthew Hedges and his family,"" he said. ""We will continue to do everything possible to support him."" Matthew Hedges was detained at Dubai Airport in May Hedges is said to be in a poor state of mental health, the BBC understands, and Ms Tejada has previouslycriticised the lack of treatmenthe has received in prison. His family allege his physical and mental health ""seriously deteriorated"" during solitary confinement and he was fed a ""cocktail of medication"" by guards that caused him to vomit on a daily basis. WATCH: Detained student 'is not a spy' Free 'spy' student, academics demand Vice-Chancellor of Durham University, Professor Stuart Corbridge, said the conditions Hedges was being held in ""breached his human rights"". ""[And] this judgement has been delivered in the absence of anything resembling due process or a fair trial,"" he said. ""There has been no information given on what basis Matt was handed this sentence and no reason to believe that Matt was conducting anything other than legitimate academic research. ""We are committed to doing what we can to get Matt home safely and swiftly.""

"The parents of a girl sexually assaulted at the age of six by boys in her school playground have won compensation from the local authority. The council has not accepted liability but the undisclosed five-figure settlement could set a precedent. The BBC understands this is the first time the High Court has approved a settlement in a case of sexual assaults involving primary school pupils. The child's mother says she now has ""a broken little girl"". The girl, called Bella to protect her true identity, disclosed the repeated sexual assaults to her mother only when she could no longer sit down because of the discomfort. In the following days and months, her parents found there was no help available for their daughter, although steps had been taken to support the boys. Mothers want action over sexual assaults Child-on-child sex offence reports up Speaking exclusively to BBC News, her mother said: ""We had a broken little girl who had been seriously sexually assaulted repeatedly over a number of weeks in school, feeling unsafe in school and she had nothing."" Bella's parents had to pay for her to have the counselling she needed. Since the assaults, she has had nightmares, become extremely anxious and is afraid of leaving her home. In their court action, Bella's parents argued the school had failed to prevent the assaults, or to adequately train staff to recognise the warning signs. A member of staff had seen their daughter with her underwear partly removed, one of the boys standing behind her. The local authority has not admitted any liability but has paid a five-figure sum, which will be used to help Bella now and in the future. Her parents have been told she may need further counselling as she goes through puberty and has her first boyfriend. Bella's mother said pursuing the legal action was partly about creating a precedent but most of all so that Bella had some tangible redress. ""It matters for her I think when she's older. She can make some sense of how she could be so seriously sexually assaulted so many times in a place where she should have been safe."" She hopes it will give her daughter a sense that some action was taken. ""When she finds out that not only were the boys not prosecuted, not punished, but also the people who were responsible for keeping her safe didn't even write an apology to say yes, we know we got it wrong and we're sorry."" The family hopes by talking about the court action they will draw attention to the lack of support for children sexually assaulted by other pupils at school. Where an assault is carried out by a child younger than 10 years old, they cannot be held criminally responsible and in the past the police have often been reluctant to record incidents. Figures for peer-on-peer assaults involving children on school premises are not recorded consistently by the 43 police forces in England and Wales. Fifteen forces told BBC News they had recorded a total of 593 allegations of sex offences on school premises last year involving under-18-year-olds as both perpetrator and victim. This included 71 allegations of rape. Among the allegations, were 203 offences where the victim was under the age of 13. Just 13 forces could provide specific information about alleged sex assaults by children aged 10 or under. They recorded 54 last year. Solicitor Andrew Lord, from Leigh Day, says several other families are actively considering legal action. ""In my experience, I've had a dozen families coming forward, a number of those involving primary school age children. ""It's not a problem going away any time soon and it does need more recognition."" Since BBC News first highlighted the scale of sexual assaults, including rape, in England's schools, some things have changed. The government has updated the guidelines for schools in England on keeping children safe. For the first time, these include specific reference to peer-on-peer sex abuse. Ministers also point to Â£8m of funding for the counselling service Childline over four years, although that covers all issues troubling children. Rachel Krys,  from the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said Bella's case showed more still needed to be done not just to prevent sexual violence but to respond adequately when it happened. ""Girls have a right to be safe in school and parents rightly expect that policies are in place and staff are trained to recognise when a girl is being sexually assaulted and move quickly to stop it. ""Safeguarding girls from anyone who hurts them, including other children, has to be a priority. ""Schools can't continue to turn a blind eye or minimise the harm done like they did in Bella's case."" The campaign is calling for a national strategy on sexual violence in schools.

The retailer was blasted for its""vomit-inducing"" shopfrontin Nottingham, which included a menswear showcase of ""outfits to impress"". M&S said its festive windows were routinely updated and any changes would not be due to the backlash. It also told the BBC it would not be altering its nationwide ad campaign. The commercials follow the theme of ""must-haves"" for men and women and feature model David Gandy doing the washing up.

"This video can not be played James Cordier apologised to his investors The boss of a Florida-based financial firm has made a tearful video apology to clients after bad bets on oil and natural gas prices wiped out their investments. James Cordier blamed a recent bout of market volatility for the losses, which are set to destroy his firm. ""I truly invested your funds like you were family,"" he said in the10-minute video posted on YouTube,external. ""I'm sorry that this rogue wave capsized our boat."" Natural gas prices enjoyed their biggest one-day percentage gain in eight years on Wednesday last week, only to suffered their largest one-day loss in 15 years the very next day. Meanwhile, oil prices have also fallen sharply. Mr Cordier is president of OptionSellers.com, based in Tampa, and co-wrote a book called The Complete Guide to Option Selling. The company managed money for wealthy investors and specialised in options, which give investors the right to buy or sell at a pre-determined price. OptionSellers said the losses were its ""clients' private business. We are in communication with them."" It was not clear how much money the firm managed or the size of the losses. Mr Cordier said in his video that he had 290 clients. However, the losses could total more than $150m, according to Ohio lawyer Jason Albin, who has been in contact with about 80 clients. Mr Albin said he thought the trades, which in some cases involved retirement accounts, should not have been permitted because of the risk involved.

"Is Theresa May facing a dramatic showdown with EU leaders on Sunday? Why is Theresa May rushing to Brussels on Wednesday when she has a fair few political headaches to contend with back home, and when she's due back here in just a few days for the seal-the-deal Brexit summit of EU leaders? The answer: the prime minister wants to show she is fighting until the very last moment to get the best Brexit deal possible out of the EU. Her Wednesday afternoon visit to see Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, provides her with a floodlit platform to do so. Now, the plan had been for the two leaders to discuss a draft text of the political declaration on post-Brexit EU-UK relations. Mrs May wanted to push for even closer trade ties than the EU has been willing to concede so far without the UK staying in the single market. Essentially she is very, very keen for her Chequers proposal for Brexit (viewed in EU circles as cherry-picking non plus ultra) to be reflected in the document. What to look for in the Brexit declaration However, the Brexit process has now got a lot more complicated - meaning that the draft text on EU-UK future relations hasn't been finished in time for the prime minister to pick over. You see, it's no longer just a matter of Mrs May wanting more from the EU. A number of EU countries are suddenly pushing for a lot more from the British prime minister. For France, it's about fishing rights;for Spain, it's about the status of Gibraltar. Others, meanwhile, such as the Netherlands and Denmark, think she should be getting a whole lot less when it comes to the UK-wide customs union, envisaged as part of the backstop for the Irish border. They want the UK to be tied tighter to EU environment regulations, for example, to avoid UK business having a competitive advantage over Europeans. As for the PM's Chequers plan for trade and security (much maligned back in the UK, too, of course), Germany has said loud and clear it won't allow the political declaration on future EU-UK relations to be a means of what Berlin describes as ""Chequers by the back door"". It is highly unlikely that all this can be sorted out in just one meeting between Mrs May and the European Commission chief. So the big question is: will the draft text on EU-UK future relations be ready by the end of the week to give EU leaders at least one day to digest it? Or are the stars aligning for a dramatic showdown between those leaders and the UK prime minister at their Sunday summit? A brief guide to where we are with Brexit One EU diplomat predicted possible similarities with a nail-biting, marathon summit at the height of the Greek debt crisis. During the all-night meeting, Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was invited to make his case to eurozone leaders on a number of occasions, before being sent out of the room to allow those leaders to decide the economic fate of his country amongst themselves. EU rules do not allow Mrs May to negotiate Brexit with EU leaders directly. If a number of issues remain open on Sunday, their Brexit summit could turn out to be a lot, lot longer than the two-hour signing session and photo op originally envisaged. The last question I'm going to ask in this post now is: could this all be more about optics than nitty-gritty politics? Grumbling aside, no-one in European circles seriously thinks any EU country will refuse to sign up to the Brexit deal by end of play this weekend. Reality Check: When is the crunch time? They're all keen to avoid a no-deal scenario and they want to help Mrs May get the Brexit texts through a vote in the House of Commons. Engaging in last-minute political fisticuffs with the EU is arguably advantageous for her. A high-drama, climactic Brexit summit ending in a late night/early morning bleary-eyed but triumphant resolution with EU leaders would allow Mrs May to claim that the final text of the deal was hard fought and hard wonâ¦ in the fervent hope that will soften the stance of some of her many critics at home. Brexit: EU gives May space to 'spin' draft deal Brexit text agreed in talks breakthrough Agreement is in Downing Street's grasp May's huge gamble over Brexit agreement A guide to where we are with Brexit May says Brexit deal still 'achievable' Voters 'split over post-Brexit economy' Brexit talks hit 'real problem' Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"Gatwick airport: Brexit's impact will be felt at UK borders The EU and UK are poised to complete the document that will spell out the shape of their future post-Brexit relationship and pave the way for a trade deal. The Political Declaration on the future framework will sit alongside the Withdrawal Agreement that settles the terms of the UK's departure, but the declaration will not be legally binding. A seven-page outline has been published. BBC Brussels Reporter Adam Fleming explains what to look for in the final version. Discussions in Brussels about how many pages will be in the document are like a game of bingo. ""50! 14! 16! 20!"" Whatever the length, it has to be detailed enough to satisfy the UK and the EU. It has to offer the UK a vision of the future that will convince MPs to accept the divorce-related part of the deal. For the EU, it has to provide guidance to steer the negotiations about the future relationship, which will begin in earnest after Brexit. Their watchword is ""precision"". Expect it to cover a lot of sectors, such as trade, aviation, financial services, energy, crime. The EU's original plan was to publish the outline in October and then spend a month filling in the details with the UK, while consulting the member states. The timetable slipped, so that's now happening in about a week instead. A guide to where we are with Brexit Spain threatens to vote against Brexit deal The withdrawal agreement - what it all means Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop This video can not be played Theresa May: ""We will be fully in control of who comes here."" Last week the EU's top negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the biggest areas of disagreement were trade and security. Britain is said to be asking for the political declaration to reflect Prime Minister Theresa May's plan for a UK/EU free trade area in goods, with a common rulebook. Some EU countries think that's too similar to being a member. The EU also isn't prepared - so far - to continue the status quo on security. This includes co-operation on extradition and access to European databases. Language is being sought to ensure everyone can claim they got what they wanted. Both sides have agreed that the EU will apply its existing system for judging whether the financial services regulations of other countries are as good as its own, known as ""equivalence"". We might find out if the UK has succeeded in getting some additional safeguards in the equivalence regime that could help out the City of London. Or we might not. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. In the last few days the other 27 member states have raised concerns about some areas and asked for clarification. France leads a group of countries that want more clarity on the so-called ""level-playing field"" - measures that would put constraints on the UK in return for easy access to the single market, such as compliance with EU competition, environmental and social law. Belgium, Denmark, Portugal and others want to reinforce the EU's policy that European trawlers should have continued access to British waters in return for the UK being allowed to sell its fish in Europe. The Spanish government wants reassurance about the extent to which the future relationship will apply to Gibraltar. Some of these issues may be addressed in documents that accompany the political declaration, for example in the minutes of the meeting of EU leaders. Yes, more documents! Michel Barnier is representing the interests of 27 member states One sentence in the outline version caught my eye. It said the ""extent of the UK's commitments on customs and regulatory co-operation, including with regard to the alignment of rules, to be taken into account in the application of checks and controls at the border."" This is code for a sliding scale of frictionless trade. The message is: ""Apply EU rules and sign up to something that looks like a customs union, then there will be many fewer checks on the millions of trucks that go through Calais."" It means the internal argument the UK has had about rules, regulations and customs will continue well into the negotiations on the future. This section is called ""institutional arrangements"". It proposes that the UK/EU relationship is managed via a series of ministerial meetings and prime ministerial summits. Yes, a bit like the EU. It will also contain clues about how the next phase of talks will unfold. For me, it's the most important part because it will decide what I'll be doing for at least the next three years.

"Kim Jong-yang had been acting Interpol chief since the last president's disappearance in September Interpol has elected South Korean Kim Jong-yang as its president, rejecting the controversial Russian frontrunner. Mr Kim was chosen by Interpol's 194 member states at a meeting of its annual congress in Dubai. He beat Russia's Alexander Prokopchuk, who has been accused of using Interpol's arrest warrant system to target critics of the Kremlin. Russia blamed the outcome of the voting on ""unprecedented pressure and interference"". The election follows the disappearance of Interpol's former president Meng Hongwei, who vanished on a trip to China in September.Beijing has since confirmed he has been detainedand is being investigated for allegedly taking bribes. Mr Kim, 57, beat Mr Prokopchuk, also 57, by 101 votes to 61 at Interpol's General Assembly meeting on Wednesday, media reports say. Interpol confirmed the South Korean's victory,,externalwithout revealing the breakdown of the results. Mr Kim is a former South Korean police officer who once served as head of police in Gyeonggi, the country's most populous province. He was already senior vice-president of Interpol and had been serving as acting president since Mr Meng's disappearance. He will serve out the remaining two years of Mr Meng's term. Although his role as president is largely ceremonial - the day-to-day running of Interpol is led by Secretary-General JÃ¼rgen Stock - it does wield influence. Upon his election, Mr Kim said: ""Our world is now facing unprecedented changes which present huge challenges to public security and safety. ""To overcome them, we need a clear vision: we need to build a bridge to the future."" Mr Prokopchuk is a Russian general who worked for many years with Russia's interior ministry. Russian Alexander Prokopchuk was widely considered the frontrunner for the post While he was Interpol's Moscow bureau chief, he was accused of abusing the so-called red notice system - international arrest warrants - to target those who were critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin. No such accusations have been levelled at him while he has been one of Interpol's four vice-presidents. Moscow said Mr Prokopchuk would remain an Interpol vice-president representing Europe and ""focus on strengthening the position of Interpol in the international police community and increasing the efficiency of the organisation's work"". There had been growing fears among Russian human rights groups and officials from other countries that Moscow would use his position as president to target its political opponents. A bipartisan group of US senators said electing Mr Prokopchuk would be ""akin to putting a fox in charge of the henhouse"", while a prominent Kremlin critic said it would be like ""putting the mafia in charge"". This prompted a furious response from Moscow, who said such comments amounted to a ""certain kind of interference in the electoral process of an international organisation"". Both the UK foreign office and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo threw their weight behind Kim Jong-yang's candidacy. Lithuania and Ukraine had threatened to withdraw from Interpol if Mr Prokopchuk was elected. Two British-based prominent critics of the Kremlin - financier Bill Browder andex-oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky- say they plan to launch a legal bid to have Russia suspended by Interpol. This video can not be played Bill Browder: Russian Interpol candidate 'most inappropriate' Bill Browder, who was held in Spain earlier this year after a Russian Interpol request, has been a thorn in the Kremlin's side, being widely credited with the creation ofthe Magnitsky Act, a 2012 range of sanctions from the United States on top Russian officials accused of corruption. He welcomed the rejection of Mr Prokopchuk saying: ""Reason prevails in this dark world."" ""The clear next step is to suspend Russia from Interpol for its consistent and serial abuse of the Red Notice and diffusion system for political purposes,"" he added. By BBC Reality Check team Most of them are not made public, so tracking is difficult. It's also highly subjective as to whether notices have been issued for only political reasons. But looking at Interpol's published database on Red Notices, we can draw some interesting insights. First, of the cases publicly declared by individual countries, Interpol's data shows that 160 individuals are wanted by Russia. This is also the number wanted by the US. One person is wanted by the UK and 44 by China. This is not a complete picture as countries can restrict details of the notice to law enforcement. We do, however, know the total number of notices issued by all countries, and this shows a significant rise over the past decade. In 2006, Interpol issued fewer than 3,000, according to statistics gathered by Fair Trial (from collated Interpol data), an organisation that campaigns against abuses of Interpol. The number has steadily increased and in 2017, when Interpol published about 13,000 Red Notices. There were a total of about 85,000 notices in circulation at the end of 2016. Countries can also request other colour-coded notices to help locate suspects or warn member countries of criminal activity. By BBC Monitoring Kremlin-controlled media said the vote was further evidence of ""a veritable information war"" against Mr Prokopchuk The Kremlin-controlled media are casting Mr Prokopchuk's defeat as the victory of a ""Russophobic lobby"". A newsreader on national state TV channel Rossiya 1 accused the West of mounting a ""veritable information war"" against the Russian candidate. On the country's tightly-controlled daytime political talk shows, the mood was that the vote was yet another example of the wall of hostility apparently encircling Russia. Presenters stressed that Moscow was in fact not really that interested in the Interpol job, and that this was a fight started out of nothing by its enemies, especially US politicians and the British media.

This, and the declaration on future relations, are due to be finalised at an EU summit next Sunday.

At least 48 letters have been sent to the chair of the 1922 Committee, triggering a vote. The Irish PM says the DUP is focused on a Brexit deal that respects the integrity of ""the precious union"". Another episode of Brexit drama unfolded in Westminster and Brussels. It started with thenew work and pensions secretary Amber Ruddsaying a no-deal Brexit would not get through Parliament, apparently undermining Theresa May's insistence that that was an option if MPs didn't back her Brexit plan. It continued with Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn locking horns over Brexit atPrime Minister's Questions. It ended with Theresa Maybooking another return ticket to Brussels as she said she would come back for further talks on Saturday in a bid to clinch a final deal ahead of a key summit of European leaders 24 hours later. As it stands, Sunday's meeting to sign both the withdrawal and declaration agreements is still due to take place despite last-minute hitches, including Spanish concerns over how future trade relations will apply to Gibraltar. The arrangement is ""not just about money"" but also ""making sure the union is secure"", warns the DUP leader. BBC Europe Editor tweets... Allow Twitter content?

The EU is in a race against time to complete the text of its declaration on future relations with the UK, amid concerns from several member states. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has indicated she will not attend Sunday's meeting of European leaders - which has been called to approve the draft terms of the UK's withdrawal - unless the text on future co-operation is agreed in advance. After an hour of talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Mrs May sought to strike an upbeat note but signalled talks were set to continue until the eve of Sunday's summit. ""We've made further progress and as a result we have given sufficient direction to our negotiators, I hope, for them to resolve the remaining issues and that work will start immediately,"" she said.

Mr Varadkar added that the withdrawal agreement should not be seen by unionists as a threat to the UK. ""It shouldn't be seen as any effort to separate Northern Ireland from Great Britain,"" he said.

Jeremy Corbyn asks Theresa May at Prime Minister's Questions if she agrees with colleagues that ""there are no circumstances under which Britain will leave the EU with no deal?"" Caroline Lucas calls for another Brexit vote at Prime Minister's Questions, saying the ""will of the people has changed"", but Theresa May says this is ""absolutely ridiculous"". An official from HM Revenue and Customs has told MPs it will take two years to have a fully operational customs system at the UK border if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Senior official Jim Harra told the Treasury Select Committee they were ready to have a functioning border from 29 March, but it would be a ""clearly sub-optimal customs border"". He added: ""There would likely be some fiscal risk attached to that depending on what tariff decisions are. ""I think we are looking at a minimum of two years from the no deal to get to a point where you can say we have a steady-state system where we are comfortable that we can manage all the fiscal risks in a way we would like and trade can flow in the way we would like"". The chief executive of HMRC, Jon Thompson, also told MPs: ""The date for putting in an optimal customs system for the UK in the event of no deal was passed months ago.""  Kevin Connolly, BBC Europe CorrespondentBBC Radio 4's PM Angela Merkel has been quoted as saying she wonât come to the EU summit on Sunday unless there is a document to sign. The idea of these summits is the leaders donât
come to haggle or horse trade - they come to clinch the deal, sign off on it, to
make it a public piece of history. So that is why they say if it is not finished they wont be here. But people in Brussels who have been around a long time will say that, in the end, there is always a deal. This is only about making a framework for
talks on a future relationship between the UK and EU, which will start once the UK is no longer a UK
state â after 29 March 2019. It ought to be possible by massaging the wording to keep
everyone, if not happy, then at
least on-board. My suspicion is that as things stand tonight, that will still happen, but it is also still possible that things will continue to slip.  Allow Twitter content?

In other developments: DUP leader Arlene Fostersaid her party's parliamentary pact with the Conservatives was ""not dead"" despite it withdrawing its support in recent years Labour could take poweras a minority government if the Conservatives found themselves unable to govern, shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said Before heading for Brussels, Mrs May came under fire from every Brexit faction in the House of Commons at a noisy Prime Minister's Questions - from those who want another referendum, to those who want Britain to leave the EU without a deal. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn zeroed in on comments by new work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd, who said MPs would prevent a no-deal Brexit, apparently putting her at odds with the PM's ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" stance. What to look for in the Brexit political declaration The withdrawal agreement - what it all means Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop He asked: ""Does the prime minister agree there are no circumstances under which Britain would leave with no-deal?"" Mrs May replied ""no"" and said the alternative to her deal would ""either be more uncertainty, more division or"", in what looks like the emerging new emphasis from her government, ""it could risk no Brexit at all"". Mr Corbyn said that ""if the government can't negotiate an alternative then it should make way for those who can and will"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Has PM ruled out no-deal Brexit? Mrs May replied: ""He is opposing a deal he hasn't read, he's promising a deal he can't negotiate, he's telling Leave voters one thing and Remain voters another - whatever (Mr Corbyn) will do, I will act in the national interest."" Mrs May also rejected a call from the SNP's Ian Blackford to renegotiate her Brexit deal to keep the UK in the single market and customs union, saying it would ""frustrate the vote of the British people"". And she branded Green MP Caroline Lucas's call for another referendum, on the grounds that public opinion had shifted since the 2016 referendum, ""absolutely ridiculous,"" saying the public had given this Parliament ""an instruction"" to leave the EU. Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict The 585-page document, which prompted two cabinet members to resign in mid-November, focuses on the terms of the UK's departure. It includes how much money the UK must pay to the EU as a settlement (often dubbed the divorce bill), details of the transition period and citizens' rights. It also covers the so-called ""backstop"", a last-resort option to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event the UK leaves the EU without securing a trade deal. It would avoid the need for bringing back physical border checks. The backstop would involve a temporary single customs territory, encompassing Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union - until both the EU and UK agree that it is no longer necessary. Critics fear the UK would continue to follow EU rules for an indefinite time without having any say over them. As well as the ministers who quit, others are believed to be trying to change the wording of the draft. There has been speculation over whether a confidence vote in Theresa May's leadership could be triggered. The EU will consider the agreement, alongside a declaration on its future relations with the UK, at a summit on 25 November. But neither has yet been approved by Parliament. Mrs May appears to have faced down the threat of a challenge to her position from Brexiteer critics of the deal, for the time being at least. However, Tory MPs unhappy with Mrs May's handling of Brexit negotiations want much more clarity on the terms of the UK's future co-operation with the EU if they are to back the final deal. All sides in the Commons have warned of a ""blind Brexit"" in which the UK signs up to a series of legally-binding commitments in the draft withdrawal agreement, without similar guarantees over future trading arrangements. This video can not be played Tory Remainer Ken Clarke MP tells Newsnight he will support the prime minister's Brexit deal to get us ""to the transition"". The withdrawal deal was agreed in principle by both Mrs May and the EU last week. It includes a Â£39bn ""divorce bill"" and the controversial customs ""backstop"" which keeps the UK temporarily in the EU customs union as a way of preventing the return of manned customs posts at the Irish border. However, the joint political declaration on future relations - still being drafted - would only set out the shape of the UK's trading relationship with the remaining 27-nation bloc, without any legal commitments. Any binding trade deal would still have to be thrashed out in the 21-month transition period after Britain leaves the EU on 29 March 2019.

"Facebook has appealed against a fine imposed on it by the UK's data watchdog after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The social network says that because the regulator found no evidence that UK users' personal data had been shared inappropriately, the Â£500,000 penalty was unjustified. Last month, the watchdog said Facebook's failure to make suitable checks on apps and developers amounted to a ""serious breach of the law"". It has acknowledged the appeal. This was the last day on which the US firm could challenge the Information Commissioner's ruling. The affair stems from the discovery that an academic at the University of Cambridge - Dr Aleksandr Kogan - used a personality quiz to harvest up to 87 million Facebook users' details. Some of this was subsequently shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which used it to target political advertising in the US. It was initially reportedthat about 1.1 million UK-based users had had their details exposed. But Cambridge Analytica said it had only ever licensed data belonging to about 30 million people, and a probe by the Information Commissioner's Office found no evidence that UK citizens were among them. Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data breach Facebook ads urge its staff to leak secrets Facebook accused of dark PR tactics Even so, the ICO imposed the maximum penalty possible on Facebookon the basis that UK members,externalhad been put at risk and the tech firm had not done enough to address this after learning of the problem. ""The ICO's investigation stemmed from concerns that UK citizens' data may have been impacted by Cambridge Analytica, yet they now have confirmed that they have found no evidence to suggest that information of Facebook users in the UK was ever shared by Dr Kogan with Cambridge Analytica, or used by its affiliates in the Brexit referendum,"" said a statement from Facebook's lawyer Anna Benckert. ""Therefore, the core of the ICO's argument no longer relates to the events involving Cambridge Analytica. Instead, their reasoning challenges some of the basic principles of how people should be allowed to share information online, with implications which go far beyond just Facebook, which is why we have chosen to appeal. ""For example, under the ICO's theory people should not be allowed to forward an email or message without having agreement from each person on the original thread. ""These are things done by millions of people every day on services across the internet, which is why we believe the ICO's decision raises important questions of principle for everyone online which should be considered by an impartial court based on all the relevant evidence."" An independent body, known as a General Regulatory Chamber tribunal, will consider the challenge. If it is unhappy with the decision, Facebook can subsequently take the case to the Court of Appeal. ""Any organisation issued with a monetary penalty notice by the Information Commissioner has the right to appeal the decision to the First-tier Tribunal,"" said a spokesman for the ICO. ""The progression of any appeal is a matter for the tribunal. We have not yet been notified by the tribunal that an appeal has been received."" The appeal risks dragging out an affair that has undermined the public and politicians' trust in Facebook. However, the BBC understands that the US firm was concerned that the ICO's ruling would form the basis for decisions taken by other regulators, which could prove more damaging still. The ICO has itself noted that the Â£500,000 fine would be ""significantly higher"" had the EU's General Data Protection Regulation been in force earlier. The move has not, however, changed chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's mind about rejecting an invitation to be cross-examined by MPs. The stakes are high for both Facebook's chief and the UK's Information Commissioner Facebook's decision to appeal against this fine is a move that Sir Humphrey, the civil servant in Yes Minister, would describe as ""brave"". At a time when the social media firm is under fire and accused of using dodgy tactics to combat its critics, picking a fight with the UK regulator over an issue which was beginning to fade into the background seems reckless. After all, the social media giant admits that it got a whole lot of things wrong in the Cambridge Analytica affair, in particular allowing the data of friends of people who took part in a personality quiz to be scraped. But Facebook feels that the Information Commissioner's Office moved the goalposts halfway through its investigation, deciding that one million UK users had suffered harm and then finding that the researcher Dr Aleksandr Kogan did not pass their data on to Cambridge Analytica. Some data protection experts think the company has a point. Mark Zuckerberg and his company appear determined to fight back against what they see as a flawed process but the appeal is a gamble. The stakes are also high for the Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham. She made the unusual decision to go public with her intention to impose a fine before receiving representations from the company. If Facebook's appeal succeeds, her authority as a regulator will be seriously undermined.

"Mannose is available as a supplement but is also found naturally in fruits such as cranberries A nutritional supplement may be able to slow the development of some cancers and enhance the effects of treatment, a study in mice suggests. Mice with pancreatic, lung or skin cancer were given mannose, a sugar also found in cranberries and other fruits. It significantly slowed the growth of their tumours, with no obvious side-effects, researchers found. However, patients are being told not to start supplementing with mannose because of the risk of side-effects. Scientists hope to test the supplement in people soon. Mannose, which can be bought in health food shops and is sometimes used to treat urinary tract infections, is thought to interfere with the ability of tumours to use glucose to grow. The hospitals that fail to treat patients on time Early risers have lower breast cancer risk Scientists also looked at how mannose might affect cancer treatment by giving it to mice that had been treated with two of the most widely used chemotherapy drugs, cisplatin and doxorubicin. They found it enhanced the effects of chemotherapy, slowing the growth of tumours and reducing their size. It also increased the lifespan of some mice. In further tests, cells from other types of cancer, including leukaemia, osteosarcoma (bone cancer), ovarian and bowel cancer were exposed to mannose in the laboratory. Some cells responded well, while others did not. How well the cells responded appeared to depend on the levels they had of an enzyme that breaks down mannose. Lead author Prof Kevin Ryan, from the Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, said his team had found a dosage of mannose that ""could block enough glucose to slow tumour growth in mice but not so much that normal tissues were affected"". Bodies require glucose for energy but cancerous tumours also use it to fuel their growth. ""This is early research but it is hoped that finding this perfect balance means that, in the future, mannose could be given to cancer patients to enhance chemotherapy without damaging their overall health,"" he said. One advantage of mannose is that it is cheaper than drugs produced by pharmaceutical companies. And Prof Ryan said he hoped tests in people could begin soon. However, he and other experts warn that the findings do not mean people with cancer should start supplementing with mannose. Martin Ledwick, Cancer Research UK's head nurse, said: ""Although these results are very promising for the future of some cancer treatments, this is very early research and has not yet been tested in humans. ""Patients should not self-prescribe mannose, as there is a real risk of negative side-effects that haven't been tested for yet. ""It's important to consult with a doctor before drastically changing your diet or taking new supplements."" Prof Ryan said his team would next seek to investigate why mannose worked in some cancer cells and not others, so they could work out which patients might benefit the most.

"Gone in 60 minutes - the speedy celebration was over quickly A teenager managed to lose his driver's licence just 49 minutes after getting it, German police said. The 18-year-old was returning from his successful driving test when officers in the town of Hemer checked his car with a laser speed gun. He was clocked travelling almost twice the speed limit - at 95km/h (60mph) in a 50km/h (30mph) zone. ""Some things last for ever - others not for an hour,"" German police wrote in their statement. The young man had four friends in the car with him, regional police in MÃ¤rkischer Kreis said - and speculated that perhaps he was trying to impress with his driving skills. Tiny town catches 58k speeders in two weeks Austrian caught speeding 42 times in a row Instead, he now faces a hefty punishment. He has been formally banned for four weeks, but police said he would only get his licence back after ""expensive retraining"".

"The parents of a girl sexually assaulted at the age of six by boys in her school playground have won compensation from the local authority. The council has not accepted liability but the undisclosed five-figure settlement could set a precedent. The BBC understands this is the first time the High Court has approved a settlement in a case of sexual assaults involving primary school pupils. The child's mother says she now has ""a broken little girl"". The girl, called Bella to protect her true identity, disclosed the repeated sexual assaults to her mother only when she could no longer sit down because of the discomfort. In the following days and months, her parents found there was no help available for their daughter, although steps had been taken to support the boys. Mothers want action over sexual assaults Child-on-child sex offence reports up Speaking exclusively to BBC News, her mother said: ""We had a broken little girl who had been seriously sexually assaulted repeatedly over a number of weeks in school, feeling unsafe in school and she had nothing."" Bella's parents had to pay for her to have the counselling she needed. Since the assaults, she has had nightmares, become extremely anxious and is afraid of leaving her home. In their court action, Bella's parents argued the school had failed to prevent the assaults, or to adequately train staff to recognise the warning signs. A member of staff had seen their daughter with her underwear partly removed, one of the boys standing behind her. The local authority has not admitted any liability but has paid a five-figure sum, which will be used to help Bella now and in the future. Her parents have been told she may need further counselling as she goes through puberty and has her first boyfriend. Bella's mother said pursuing the legal action was partly about creating a precedent but most of all so that Bella had some tangible redress. ""It matters for her I think when she's older. She can make some sense of how she could be so seriously sexually assaulted so many times in a place where she should have been safe."" She hopes it will give her daughter a sense that some action was taken. ""When she finds out that not only were the boys not prosecuted, not punished, but also the people who were responsible for keeping her safe didn't even write an apology to say yes, we know we got it wrong and we're sorry."" The family hopes by talking about the court action they will draw attention to the lack of support for children sexually assaulted by other pupils at school. Where an assault is carried out by a child younger than 10 years old, they cannot be held criminally responsible and in the past the police have often been reluctant to record incidents. Figures for peer-on-peer assaults involving children on school premises are not recorded consistently by the 43 police forces in England and Wales. Fifteen forces told BBC News they had recorded a total of 593 allegations of sex offences on school premises last year involving under-18-year-olds as both perpetrator and victim. This included 71 allegations of rape. Among the allegations, were 203 offences where the victim was under the age of 13. Just 13 forces could provide specific information about alleged sex assaults by children aged 10 or under. They recorded 54 last year. Solicitor Andrew Lord, from Leigh Day, says several other families are actively considering legal action. ""In my experience, I've had a dozen families coming forward, a number of those involving primary school age children. ""It's not a problem going away any time soon and it does need more recognition."" Since BBC News first highlighted the scale of sexual assaults, including rape, in England's schools, some things have changed. The government has updated the guidelines for schools in England on keeping children safe. For the first time, these include specific reference to peer-on-peer sex abuse. Ministers also point to Â£8m of funding for the counselling service Childline over four years, although that covers all issues troubling children. Rachel Krys,  from the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said Bella's case showed more still needed to be done not just to prevent sexual violence but to respond adequately when it happened. ""Girls have a right to be safe in school and parents rightly expect that policies are in place and staff are trained to recognise when a girl is being sexually assaulted and move quickly to stop it. ""Safeguarding girls from anyone who hurts them, including other children, has to be a priority. ""Schools can't continue to turn a blind eye or minimise the harm done like they did in Bella's case."" The campaign is calling for a national strategy on sexual violence in schools.

"Charlotte Higman was finally refunded by RBS A Royal Bank of Scotland customer had more than Â£4,300 stolen from her account by a fraudulent caller who answered one of her security questions wrongly, BBC Watchdog Live has found. For more than a year, the bank insisted Charlotte Higman had been aware of the transaction and refused to refund her. The Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) backed RBS after the initial complaint. But earlier this month, RBS apologised and issued Charlotte a full refund, after Watchdog Live's investigation. Charlotte, from Totnes in Devon, believes that RBS repeatedly failed to pick up on evidence, including warnings raised in its own security processes. In a recording of the fraudulent phone call obtained by Watchdog Live, a woman can be heard incorrectly answering a security question relating to Charlotte's occupation. Despite this, a transaction of Â£4,318 is approved by the bank and it is only after the caller requests a second transaction, and is unable to answer additional security questions, that a warning is raised on Charlotte's account. The bank's own records show that the phone call, in January 2017, was marked as a ""potential account takeover"" and the caller failed the bank's voice recognition checks. Despite this, the initial transaction was not reversed. After reporting the call to the police, Charlotte discovered her phone line was diverted on the day of the call, explaining why the bank believed they were speaking to her at her home address. ""I just feel really angry that someone's been able to do it that easily,"" Charlotte told Watchdog. ""The bank said that the person was in the home, they did the transactions from the home and they passed all the security questions correctly - and that's why they believed that I'd done it."" Watchdog presenter Steph McGovern and lawyer Arun Chauhan Charlotte's case pre-dates a new voluntary code of conduct on such scams which most of the banks have signed up to. In essence, the code says that if a customer - or the bank - has failed to heed warning signs, they will be liable for any subsequent loss. Under the code, RBS would have been obliged to pay up. The industry is still consulting on the issue, and the code is expected to be finalised next year. Fraud lawyer Arun Chauhan told the programme: ""I have a lot of sympathy for Charlotte, ""You can hear what [the caller has] tried to do is put together two transactions for the full balance of the account and the bank just don't pick it up as a warning sign. ""They know at the end this is fraud, but they've done nothing about the first transaction and that's why Charlotte should be so critical of the bank."" Name checks to begin on bank payments Ulster Bank manager's pride after Â£20,000 fraud prevented New bank scheme 'has prevented fraud worth Â£1.5m' According to fraud prevention service Cifas, facility takeover fraud -when a fraudster abuses personal data to hijack someone's existing account or services,external- rose 7% last year to more than 24,000 reported cases. Bank accounts remain the most targeted product for fraudsters, with more than 100,000 reported cases in the UK last year. This is how the fraud on Charlotte was carried out: Bank records show the fraudster initially calls the bank, posing as Charlotte, and asks for her account to be reset for security reasons. Staff follow the bank's usual security protocol and call Charlotte's landline number, unaware the call has been diverted to a mobile phone The security reset is processed despite the caller answering a security question incorrectly. The caller then requests that more than Â£4,300 should be transferred to another account and the bank allows the transfer During the same 23-minute call, the caller requests a second transfer of a similar amount is made to a different account. This time security questions are flagged as being answered incorrectly and the transfer is denied, but the bank does not ask for the original transfer to be recalled The bank maintained that because it had called Charlotte's home phone number to verify her identity, it was clear she was aware of the transactions. Following an investigation by Devon and Cornwall Police, it was discovered that the fraudster had made a call to Charlotte's landline provider to fraudulently divert the number to a mobile phone number in a different part of the UK The FOS warned banks earlier this yearthat customers should not automatically be blamed for money lost through scams. It added that fraudsters' growing sophistication meant it was wrong to assume losses were because of customer carelessness. The FOS aims to resolve issues for customers relating to financial services including bank accounts, insurance, loans, credit and debit cards and investments. Last year, it was contacted by more than two million people. A FOS spokesperson said: ""We have made it clear to the banks that it's not fair to automatically blame a customer when they've lost money due to a scam, especially given the sophisticated way criminals exploit banks' security systems. ""When we look at complaints, we have to carefully weigh up the evidence provided by both parties to decide what we think is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. ""We're pleased that Charlotte's complaint has now been resolved, and she's got her money back. If you've been the victim of a scam, and you feel your bank should have done more to help, please get in touch with us."" After being contacted by Watchdog Live, an RBS spokesperson said: ""We would like to apologise to Mrs Higman that the service provided fell short of the high standards we expect. ""On review of Mrs Higman's case, and in light of new information provided to us, we have refunded Mrs Higman in full for her loss.""

"The Sentinelese have always resisted outside contact An American man has been killed by an endangered tribe in India's Andaman and Nicobar islands. Fishermen who took the man to North Sentinel island say tribespeople shot him with arrows and left his body on the beach. He has been identified as John Allen Chau, a 27 year old from Alabama. Contact with the endangered Andaman tribes living in isolation from the world is illegal because of the risks to them from outside disease. Estimates say the Sentinelese, who are totally cut off from civilisation, number only between 50 and 150.

On 21 October, @johnachau posted that he was travelling to the region Local media have reported that Chau may have wanted to meet the tribe to preach Christianity to them. But on social media the young man presented himself as a keen traveller and adventurer. Who was US man killed in remote islands? ""Police said Chau had previously visited North Sentinel island about four or five times with the help of local fishermen,"" journalist Subir Bhaumik, who has been covering the islands for years, told BBC Hindi. ""The number of people belonging to the Sentinelese tribe is so low, they don't even understand how to use money. It's in fact illegal to have any sort of contact with them."" In 2017, the Indian government also said taking photographs or making videos of the aboriginal Andaman tribes would be punishable with imprisonment of up to three years. The Sentinelese stand guard on an island beach in 2005 The AFP news agency quoted a source as saying that Chau had tried and failed to reach the island on 14 November. But then he tried again two days later. ""He was attacked by arrows but he continued walking. ""The fishermen saw the tribals tying a rope around his neck and dragging his body. They were scared and fled,"" the report added. Chau's body was spotted on 20 November. According to the Hindustan Times, his remains have yet to be recovered. ""It's a difficult case for the police,"" says Mr Bhaumik. ""You can't even arrest the Sentinelese."" Few images of the endangered tribe exist Two Indian fisherman fishing illegally off North Sentinel Island were also killed by the tribe in 2006. Geeta Pandey, BBC News, Delhi I first heard of the Sentinelese in 2004 just after the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami. I was at the daily press briefing by the authorities a few days later when we were told that the members of the isolated tribes had survived. A navy helicopter on patrol had flown over the North Sentinel island of the archipelago where the Sentinelese live to check on them. As they descended a bit to take a closer look, members of the tribe began firing arrows at them. ""So we knew that they were safe,"" the pilot told us. Eyewitness: Andaman tragedy,external An aerial shot shows North Sentinel Island that the tribe inhabit Global organisations like London-based Survival International have been campaigning to protect the indigenous tribes living in the Andamans. The tribe live on their own island, roughly the size of Manhattan, but most of what is known about them comes from viewing them from a distance. The group's international director, Stephen Corry, called the incident a ""tragedy"" that ""should never have been allowed to happen"". ""The Sentinelese have shown again and again that they want to be left alone, and their wishes should be respected,"" he said. ""The British colonial occupation of the Andaman Islands decimated the tribes living there, wiping out thousands of tribespeople, and only a fraction of the original population now survive. So the Sentinelese fear of outsiders is very understandable."" First Andaman dictionary a 'linguistic treasure trove' India arrests Burmese fishermen for endangering tribes Battle over resort 'threatening Andamans tribe',external The two endangered aboriginal Andaman tribes - the Jarawa and the Sentinelese - are hunter-gatherers, and contact with the outside world would put them at risk of contracting disease. The Sentinelese are particularly vulnerable: their complete isolation means they are likely to have no immunity to even common illnesses such as flu and measles. ""It's not impossible that the Sentinelese have just been infected by deadly pathogens to which they have no immunity, with the potential to wipe out the entire tribe,"" said Mr Corry. Groups have also voiced concern about the Jarawa - a tribe that has some contact with the outside world, including a road that cuts through their territory that is used by some tourists for ""safari"" trips.

"Nedim Yasar became a mentor for young people after leaving a life of crime A former Danish gang leader who produced a memoir detailing how he left a life of crime has been fatally shot just a day before his book's release. Nedim Yasar, 31, was targeted as he left a book launch on Monday in the Danish capital, Copenhagen. The gunman fled the scene on foot, police said. Yasar was taken to hospital but died of his injuries. His memoir, entitled Roots, was published on Tuesday. He had reported that he was the victim of an attempted assault last year. In the incident on Monday, which was reported shortly after 19:30 local time (18:30 GMT), a suspect dressed in dark clothing fired ""at least two shots"" at Yasar, the Copenhagen Police Department said in a statement. An investigation is under way and police are ""seeking witnesses"" to shed light on the matter, the statement added. The scene of the shooting following the book launch event in Copenhagen Yasar, who was born in Turkey and arrived in Denmark at the age of four, had led the Copenhagen-based criminal gang Los Guerreros - a notorious gang with links to the drugs trade, according to police. He quit the gang in 2012 to join an exit programme after he discovered that he was going to be a father, Danish news agency Ritzau reported. Yasar's memoir Roots: A Gangster's Way Out was released on Tuesday He then became a mentor for young people and made a name for himself with a show on local radio station Radio24syv. Following news of Yasar's death on Tuesday, the station tweeted an image of its office building with the Danish flag at half mast in tribute, along with a message that reads: ""Farewell Nedim Yasar, and thanks for everything.""

"Gone in 60 minutes - the speedy celebration was over quickly A teenager managed to lose his driver's licence just 49 minutes after getting it, German police said. The 18-year-old was returning from his successful driving test when officers in the town of Hemer checked his car with a laser speed gun. He was clocked travelling almost twice the speed limit - at 95km/h (60mph) in a 50km/h (30mph) zone. ""Some things last for ever - others not for an hour,"" German police wrote in their statement.

"Denise Coates was awarded a CBE in 2012 for services to the community and business The UK's best-paid boss, co-founder of online gambling firm Bet365 Denise Coates, has received another bumper pay rise. The firm's accounts,externalshow compensation, for the firm's ""highest paid director"" rising to Â£265m including dividends. That was Â£48m higher than the total she received last year as the popularity of online gambling continues to grow. However the industry is facingmounting criticismfor not doing enough to deal with problem gambling and addiction. The privately held company is owned jointly by Ms Coates and members of her direct family, including her brother John who is joint chief executive and her father Peter, the firm's chairman. Last year Ms Coates' pay and dividends were reported to total Â£217m. In the year to the end of March her basic pay rose from Â£199m to Â£220m. The firm paid out Â£90m in dividends in the same year, half of which are thought to have gone to Ms Coates, as the owner of half of Bet365's shares. Listen: Denise Coates profile Number of child gamblers quadruples Labour calls for ban on gambling ads during live events Ms Coates earned a first class degree in econometrics - the application of statistical methods to economic data - from Sheffield University before joining the High Street betting firm, run by her father. She identified the potential of online gambling in 2000 and invested in the domain name Bet365.com so that she could drive the family business in that direction. Bet365, now the largest private sector employer in Stoke, has millions of customers worldwide. It offers sports betting, poker, casino, games, and bingo. The accounts showed that the firm's revenues grew by 25% in the year to the end of March and operating profit was up by 31%. While the online gambling sector has ballooned in recent years, it has also come in for increasing criticism over its impact on some customers who have become addicted or accrued large debts. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson recently described gambling as a ""public health emergency"". Bet365 said it was continuing to develop strategies to identify gamblers at risk and to ""help customers bet responsibly"". However, Luke Hildyard, spokesman for the High Pay Centre, which campaigns against excessive executive remuneration, said ""betting companies are not exactly a force for good in the world"". ""There is an increasing perception that big business only serves the interests of an elite few - a billionaire taking hundreds of millions more from a company that profits, in part, from other people's addictions does nothing to dispel that perception,"" he said. Ms Coates, 51, lives in Cheshire with her husband, Richard Smith, who also serves as the firm's property director, and their children. The group owns Stoke City Football Club, which made a loss of Â£21m and in 2017 the group paid Â£75m into its charitable fund, set up in Ms Coates' name. Who are the world's richest women?

"The number of children classed as having a gambling problem has quadrupled to more than 50,000 in just two years, a report has claimed. The Gambling Commission study suggests that 450,000 children aged 11 to 16 bet regularly, more than those who have taken drugs, smoked or drunk alcohol. Bets with friends, slot machines, and scratchcards, were most popular. A campaigner on the issue, Bishop of St Albans Right Reverend Alan Smith, called it a ""generational scandal"". ""Today's findings by the Gambling Commission makes worrying reading and serves as a warning to parents,"" he said. The Young People and Gambling report,externalfound: Over the past 12 months, 39% of 11-16 year olds have spent their own money on gambling and 14% in the previous week Young people who have gambled in the past week spent an average of Â£16 6% had gambled online using a parent or guardian's account 60% of young people think their parents would prefer them not to gamble at all, however only 19% said their parents set strict rules about gambling Some admitted using betting shops or online gambling sites despite them being illegal for under-18s The analysis also suggests one in seven boys followed betting brands on social media. Most pubs 'don't stop children gambling' Teenagers 'bombarded by gambling ads' Government backtracks on gaming machines The commission also raised concerns that close to a million young people had been exposed to gambling through ""loot boxes"" in video games or on smartphone apps. These can involve a player paying money for an item that is only revealed after purchasing. Liz Ritchie's son began gambling as a teenager - and took his life aged 24 The report was based on an Ipsos Mori study of 2,865 11 to 16-year-olds carried out between February and July. It comes amid increasing worries about gambling, especially fixed-odds betting machines and the number of betting ads during the showing of sport on television. Last week, a Gambling Commission report saidthat only 10% of pubs intervene to stop children gambling on their premises. Liz Ritchie's son was a gambling addict who took his own life a year ago this week, aged 24. She told the BBC she blamed government deregulation of the betting industry for allowing the growth of, for example, fixed odds betting machines, dubbed the crack cocaine of the industry. ""It was because of deregulation that these machines came on the High Street so that Jack and his friends were able to gamble in their lunch hour,"" she told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. She blamed advertising for helping to normalise gambling among the young, and urged the government to ban it. At the moment, she said, it was being left to parents and teachers to teach about the dangers of betting. Gambling Commission executive director Tim Miller called for a ""joined-up approach"" to keep children safe. ""There's no doubt that today's figures on children and gambling should make people sit up and listen,"" he said. ""But while discussions about children gambling might conjure up images of kids sneaking into bookies or sitting alone on their iPad gambling on an online casino, our latest research paints a more complex picture. ""The most common activities that children gamble on are not licensed casinos, bingo providers or bookies. ""Instead we found children preferred to gamble in informal environments, out of sight of regulation - private bets between friends or playing cards with their mates for money.""

"Children under the age of five are at greater risk of death from severe malnutrition An estimated 85,000 children under the age of five may have died from acute malnutrition in three years of war in Yemen, a leading charity says. The number is equivalent to the entire under-five population in the UK's second largest city of Birmingham, Save the Children adds. The UN warned last month that up to 14m Yemenis are on the brink of famine. It is trying to revive talks to end a three-year war which has caused the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Yemen has been devastated by the conflict. Fighting escalated in 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition launched an air campaign against the Houthi rebel movement which had forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Why is there a war in Yemen? Ending Yemenâs never-ending war At least 6,800 civilians have been killed and 10,700 injured in the war, according to the UN. The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition have also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that has affected 1.2 million people. It is difficult to get an exact number of deaths. Aid workers in Yemen say many go unreported because only half of the country's health facilities are functioning and many people are too poor to access the ones that remain open. Save the Children says it based its figures on mortality rates for untreated cases of Severe Acute Malnutrition in children under five from data compiled by the UN. According to conservative estimates, it calculated that around 84,700 children may have died between April 2015 and October 2018. This video can not be played Yemen: Where children rummage through rubbish for food Rising food prices and the falling value of the country's currency as a result of a civil war are putting more families at risk of food insecurity. The UK-based charity blames the blockade for putting more people at risk of famine, with continued heavy fighting around the principal lifeline port of Hudaydah further exacerbating the situation. The rebel-held port, through which the country has traditionally imported 90% of its food, has seen commercial imports fall by more than 55,000 metric tonnes a month, the charity says. This is enough to meet the needs of 4.4m people, including 2.2m children, it adds. Save the Children said it had been forced to bring supplies for the north of Yemen through its southern port of Aden, which has significantly slowed down aid deliveries. Nusair, a 13-month-old boy, is among the children suffering from severe acute malnutrition who is being closely monitored by Save the Children. He was treated in August but by October his health had deteriorated again. 13-month-old Nusair By that time he and his mother had been forced to relocate to a remote area due to increased fighting near their home and were unable to make the long trip to hospital. ""I can't go to sleep, it is torturing, and I am worried about my children. I couldn't live if any harm came to them,"" his mother, Suad, told the charity. Yemen's conflict in 400 words Why battle for Yemen's Hudaydah matters The charity says that based on historical studies, if acute malnutrition is left untreated, around 20-30% of children will die each year. ""For every child killed by bombs and bullets, dozens are starving to death and it's entirely preventable,"" its Yemen director, Tamer Kirolos, says. ""Children who die in this way suffer immensely as their vital organ functions slow down and eventually stop. Their immune systems are so weak they are more prone to infections with some too frail to even cry. ""Parents are having to witness their children wasting away, unable to do anything about it."" He further warned that an estimated 150,000 children's lives were endangered in Hudaydah with ""a dramatic increase"" in air strikes over the city in recent weeks. Not yet - but it's getting close. Just last month, the UN warned thathalf the population of the war-torn country was facing ""pre-famine conditions"". This video can not be played The UN says Yemen is on the brink of the world's worst famine in 100 years if the war continues A country has to meet the following criteria to be declared in famine: At least one in five households faces an extreme lack of food More than 30% of children under five are suffering from acute malnutrition At least two people out of every 10,000 are dying every day The UN said - based on assessments from a year ago - the first two thresholds had either been exceeded or was dangerously close in 107 of Yemen's 333 districts. But the third threshold about numbers of deaths was more difficult to confirm. The organisation is currently repeating the assessments. UN envoy Martin Griffiths arrived in the Yemeni capital Sanaa on Wednesday for talks with the Houthi rebels in a bid to lay the groundwork for peace talks in Sweden. It comes after a lull in violence was broken on Tuesday, with intense fighting erupting between the Saudi-led coalition and Houthi rebels in Hudaydah. On Monday, the UK presented a draft resolution to the UN urging an immediate truce in the port city and giving both sides of the conflict a two-week deadline to remove all barriers to humanitarian aid. Separately, Saudi Arabia and its ally, the UAE, have pledged $500m (Â£390m; â¬440m) in food aid, and say it is intended to reach 10 to 12 million Yemenis.

"Theresa May is to return to Brussels for Brexit talks on Saturday She faced Brexit criticism from all sides at Prime Minister's Questions UK and EU are seeking to finalise text of declaration on future relations France (fishing) and Spain (Gibraltar) have issues with the current draft Tory Brexiteers' efforts to force no confidence vote seem to have failed, for now The PM published the 585 page draft withdrawal agreement last week. This, and the declaration on future relations, are due to be finalised at an EU summit next Sunday. Jennifer Scott and Alex Hunt A simple interactive guide to what could happen next as the UK leaves the European Union. At least 48 letters have been sent to the chair of the 1922 Committee, triggering a vote. The Irish PM says the DUP is focused on a Brexit deal that respects the integrity of ""the precious union"". Another episode of Brexit drama unfolded in Westminster and Brussels. It started with thenew work and pensions secretary Amber Ruddsaying a no-deal Brexit would not get through Parliament, apparently undermining Theresa May's insistence that that was an option if MPs didn't back her Brexit plan. It continued with Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn locking horns over Brexit atPrime Minister's Questions. It ended with Theresa Maybooking another return ticket to Brussels as she said she would come back for further talks on Saturday in a bid to clinch a final deal ahead of a key summit of European leaders 24 hours later. As it stands, Sunday's meeting to sign both the withdrawal and declaration agreements is still due to take place despite last-minute hitches, including Spanish concerns over how future trade relations will apply to Gibraltar. The arrangement is ""not just about money"" but also ""making sure the union is secure"", warns the DUP leader. BBC Europe Editor tweets... Allow Twitter content?

Theresa May is to return to Brussels for last-ditch Brexit talks on Saturday as the two sides try to do a deal in time for a summit of European leaders. The PM said progress had been made during discussions with EU officials on Wednesday and work would continue on outstanding issues. She said she hoped to reach a deal soon ""in the interests of all our people"". Talks over future relations have been held up by concerns over fishing rights and the future of Gibraltar. The EU is in a race against time to complete the text of its declaration on future relations with the UK, amid concerns from several member states. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has indicated she will not attend Sunday's meeting of European leaders - which has been called to approve the draft terms of the UK's withdrawal - unless the text on future co-operation is agreed in advance. After an hour of talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Mrs May sought to strike an upbeat note but signalled talks were set to continue until the eve of Sunday's summit. ""We've made further progress and as a result we have given sufficient direction to our negotiators, I hope, for them to resolve the remaining issues and that work will start immediately,"" she said. ""I now plan to rerun for further meetings on Saturday to discuss how we can bring to a conclusion this process and bring it to a conclusion in the interests of all our people.""

Leo Varadkar has said the DUP has put the integrity of the ""precious union"" ahead of everything else, even if it leads to a ""lesser world"". The Irish Taoiseach said the party - which is in a confidence and supply agreement with the Conservatives - did not want the ""best of both worlds"" from Brexit. He told the Irish parliament: ""The DUP holds very firm to this view that the most important thing is the integrity of the UK, the integrity of the precious union, and, if that means a lesser world, that's acceptable provided that the integrity of the union is upheld."" Mr Varadkar added that the withdrawal agreement should not be seen by unionists as a threat to the UK. ""It shouldn't be seen as any effort to separate Northern Ireland from Great Britain,"" he said.

Jeremy Corbyn asks Theresa May at Prime Minister's Questions if she agrees with colleagues that ""there are no circumstances under which Britain will leave the EU with no deal?"" Caroline Lucas calls for another Brexit vote at Prime Minister's Questions, saying the ""will of the people has changed"", but Theresa May says this is ""absolutely ridiculous"". An official from HM Revenue and Customs has told MPs it will take two years to have a fully operational customs system at the UK border if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.

make it a public piece of history. So that is why they say if it is not finished they wont be here. But people in Brussels who have been around a long time will say that, in the end, there is always a deal. This is only about making a framework for

"Children under the age of five are at greater risk of death from severe malnutrition An estimated 85,000 children under the age of five may have died from acute malnutrition in three years of war in Yemen, a leading charity says. The number is equivalent to the entire under-five population in the UK's second largest city of Birmingham, Save the Children adds. The UN warned last month that up to 14m Yemenis are on the brink of famine. It is trying to revive talks to end a three-year war which has caused the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Yemen has been devastated by the conflict. Fighting escalated in 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition launched an air campaign against the Houthi rebel movement which had forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Why is there a war in Yemen? Ending Yemenâs never-ending war At least 6,800 civilians have been killed and 10,700 injured in the war, according to the UN. The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition have also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that has affected 1.2 million people. It is difficult to get an exact number of deaths. Aid workers in Yemen say many go unreported because only half of the country's health facilities are functioning and many people are too poor to access the ones that remain open. Save the Children says it based its figures on mortality rates for untreated cases of Severe Acute Malnutrition in children under five from data compiled by the UN. According to conservative estimates, it calculated that around 84,700 children may have died between April 2015 and October 2018. This video can not be played Yemen: Where children rummage through rubbish for food Rising food prices and the falling value of the country's currency as a result of a civil war are putting more families at risk of food insecurity. The UK-based charity blames the blockade for putting more people at risk of famine, with continued heavy fighting around the principal lifeline port of Hudaydah further exacerbating the situation. The rebel-held port, through which the country has traditionally imported 90% of its food, has seen commercial imports fall by more than 55,000 metric tonnes a month, the charity says. This is enough to meet the needs of 4.4m people, including 2.2m children, it adds. Save the Children said it had been forced to bring supplies for the north of Yemen through its southern port of Aden, which has significantly slowed down aid deliveries. Nusair, a 13-month-old boy, is among the children suffering from severe acute malnutrition who is being closely monitored by Save the Children. He was treated in August but by October his health had deteriorated again. 13-month-old Nusair By that time he and his mother had been forced to relocate to a remote area due to increased fighting near their home and were unable to make the long trip to hospital. ""I can't go to sleep, it is torturing, and I am worried about my children. I couldn't live if any harm came to them,"" his mother, Suad, told the charity. Yemen's conflict in 400 words Why battle for Yemen's Hudaydah matters The charity says that based on historical studies, if acute malnutrition is left untreated, around 20-30% of children will die each year. ""For every child killed by bombs and bullets, dozens are starving to death and it's entirely preventable,"" its Yemen director, Tamer Kirolos, says. ""Children who die in this way suffer immensely as their vital organ functions slow down and eventually stop. Their immune systems are so weak they are more prone to infections with some too frail to even cry. ""Parents are having to witness their children wasting away, unable to do anything about it."" He further warned that an estimated 150,000 children's lives were endangered in Hudaydah with ""a dramatic increase"" in air strikes over the city in recent weeks. Not yet - but it's getting close. Just last month, the UN warned thathalf the population of the war-torn country was facing ""pre-famine conditions"". This video can not be played The UN says Yemen is on the brink of the world's worst famine in 100 years if the war continues A country has to meet the following criteria to be declared in famine: At least one in five households faces an extreme lack of food More than 30% of children under five are suffering from acute malnutrition At least two people out of every 10,000 are dying every day The UN said - based on assessments from a year ago - the first two thresholds had either been exceeded or was dangerously close in 107 of Yemen's 333 districts. But the third threshold about numbers of deaths was more difficult to confirm. The organisation is currently repeating the assessments. UN envoy Martin Griffiths arrived in the Yemeni capital Sanaa on Wednesday for talks with the Houthi rebels in a bid to lay the groundwork for peace talks in Sweden. It comes after a lull in violence was broken on Tuesday, with intense fighting erupting between the Saudi-led coalition and Houthi rebels in Hudaydah. On Monday, the UK presented a draft resolution to the UN urging an immediate truce in the port city and giving both sides of the conflict a two-week deadline to remove all barriers to humanitarian aid. Separately, Saudi Arabia and its ally, the UAE, have pledged $500m (Â£390m; â¬440m) in food aid, and say it is intended to reach 10 to 12 million Yemenis.

"This video can not be played Bodycam video: Venus Williams after crash Venus Williams has settled a wrongful death lawsuit with the family of a man who died as a result of a car crash in Florida involving the US tennis star. Ms Williams and the family of Jerome Barson reached a settlement last week, court documents show. Further details were not included. Mr Barson, 78, suffered ""massive"" fatal injuries from the collision in Palm Beach Gardens city on 9 June 2017. Police had previously cleared Ms Williams of wrongdoing over the crash. Mr Barson's wife Linda, who was driving the couple's vehicle through an intersection when the collision happened, was also earlier cleared by police investigators. US tennis star Venus Williams described the incident last year as ""devastating"" A report into the incident says that an unidentified third vehicle illegally crossed Ms Williams's path as she tried to move through a busy main road on a green light near her home. This, the report said, set off a chain of events that ended with the vehicle driven by Linda slamming into the passenger side of Ms Williams's SUV, the Associated Press reports. Venus Williams breaks down in news conference Mr Barson was subsequently taken to hospital but died two weeks later from his injuries. Police said in an initial report that factors such as drugs, alcohol or mobile phone distractions were not being investigated. Ms Williams, a seven-time Grand Slam champion, reportedly told police at the time that she had not seen the couple's car and had been driving slowly.

"The Mexican tetra fish that lives in the rivers of Northern Mexico can heal its heart, while its cave-dwelling relative cannot A fish that can repair its heart may hold clues for future treatments in people, according to a study. Scientists studying the Mexican tetra fish found three areas of the fish genome were involved in its ability to regenerate heart tissue. One gene appeared to play a particularly key role in the process. Researchers hope theirstudy,externalwill one day make it possible to heal heart muscle in patients who have had a heart attack. Do you know your heart age? Middle-aged 'can reverse heart risk' Research to reverse heart failure Hundreds of thousands of people in the UK live with heart failure, often as a result of a heart attack. Because it is not possible for humans to regenerate their damaged, scarred heart muscle, people either have to live with the condition or may require a heart transplant. For this study, funded by the British Heart Foundation, Dr Mathilda Mommersteeg and her team at the University of Oxford studied two types of Mexican tetra fish - river-dwellers that are able to self-heal their heart tissue, and cave-dwellers that cannot. The cave fish, who once lived in the rivers of Northern Mexico, were washed into caves by floodwaters about 1.5 million years ago and evolved, losing their sight and colour because of living in perpetual darkness. Comparing the two types of tetra fish, researchers found two genes - lrrc10 and caveolin - were much more active in the river fish following heart injury. Having discovered this, they switched off the lrrc10 gene in a different species of fish with self-healing abilities, the zebrafish. With this gene no longer working properly, the zebrafish became unable to fully repair its heart without scarring. Scar tissue stops the heart muscle from contracting properly and reduces the heart's ability to pump blood around the body. Both of these genes are present in humans, and lrrc10 is known to be linked to a heart condition called dilated cardiomyopathy. Dr Mathilda Mommersteeg and a colleague in the cave where the fish live The study authors say their findings suggest it will one day be possible to regenerate damaged hearts in people by artificially modifying how these and other genes function. This could be done either with drugs or through gene-editing techniques, where DNA is modified, deleted or replaced, using tools like Crispr-Cas9. Dr Mommersteeg, who's associate professor of developmental and regenerative medicine, said: ""I do believe that this fish can tell us, at some point, how we can really repair the human heart... ""It's early days but we're incredibly excited about these remarkable fish and the potential to change the lives of people with damaged hearts."" But she said more work is needed to find other key genes that may be involved in the heart regenerating. Prof Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""Survival rates for heart failure have barely changed over the last 20 years, and life expectancy is worse than for many cancers. ""Breakthroughs are desperately needed to ease the devastation caused by this dreadful condition."" The study has been published in Cell Reports. Follow Alex on Twitter,external.

"Theresa May is to return to Brussels for Brexit talks on Saturday She faced Brexit criticism from all sides at Prime Minister's Questions UK and EU are seeking to finalise text of declaration on future relations France (fishing) and Spain (Gibraltar) have issues with the current draft Tory Brexiteers' efforts to force no confidence vote seem to have failed, for now The PM published the 585 page draft withdrawal agreement last week. This, and the declaration on future relations, are due to be finalised at an EU summit next Sunday. Jennifer Scott and Alex Hunt A simple interactive guide to what could happen next as the UK leaves the European Union. At least 48 letters have been sent to the chair of the 1922 Committee, triggering a vote. The Irish PM says the DUP is focused on a Brexit deal that respects the integrity of ""the precious union"". Another episode of Brexit drama unfolded in Westminster and Brussels. It started with thenew work and pensions secretary Amber Ruddsaying a no-deal Brexit would not get through Parliament, apparently undermining Theresa May's insistence that that was an option if MPs didn't back her Brexit plan. It continued with Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn locking horns over Brexit atPrime Minister's Questions. It ended with Theresa Maybooking another return ticket to Brussels as she said she would come back for further talks on Saturday in a bid to clinch a final deal ahead of a key summit of European leaders 24 hours later. As it stands, Sunday's meeting to sign both the withdrawal and declaration agreements is still due to take place despite last-minute hitches, including Spanish concerns over how future trade relations will apply to Gibraltar. The arrangement is ""not just about money"" but also ""making sure the union is secure"", warns the DUP leader. BBC Europe Editor tweets... Allow Twitter content?

Theresa May is to return to Brussels for last-ditch Brexit talks on Saturday as the two sides try to do a deal in time for a summit of European leaders. The PM said progress had been made during discussions with EU officials on Wednesday and work would continue on outstanding issues. She said she hoped to reach a deal soon ""in the interests of all our people"". Talks over future relations have been held up by concerns over fishing rights and the future of Gibraltar. The EU is in a race against time to complete the text of its declaration on future relations with the UK, amid concerns from several member states. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has indicated she will not attend Sunday's meeting of European leaders - which has been called to approve the draft terms of the UK's withdrawal - unless the text on future co-operation is agreed in advance. After an hour of talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Mrs May sought to strike an upbeat note but signalled talks were set to continue until the eve of Sunday's summit. ""We've made further progress and as a result we have given sufficient direction to our negotiators, I hope, for them to resolve the remaining issues and that work will start immediately,"" she said.

The Irish Taoiseach said the party - which is in a confidence and supply agreement with the Conservatives - did not want the ""best of both worlds"" from Brexit. He told the Irish parliament: ""The DUP holds very firm to this view that the most important thing is the integrity of the UK, the integrity of the precious union, and, if that means a lesser world, that's acceptable provided that the integrity of the union is upheld."" Mr Varadkar added that the withdrawal agreement should not be seen by unionists as a threat to the UK. ""It shouldn't be seen as any effort to separate Northern Ireland from Great Britain,"" he said.

"Labour could form the next government without a general election if MPs don't back Theresa May's Brexit deal, John McDonnell has suggested. The shadow chancellor said Labour should be offered the chance to form a minority administration if Mrs May keeps losing Commons votes. The party would then seek to get majority for its version of Brexit. Failing that, he said, there should be a general election and the final option would be another EU referendum. Theresa May is heading to Brussels for talks with EU leaders and is hoping they will finalise the Brexit withdrawal agreement on Sunday. MPs will then get a vote on the deal. Live: Theresa May and Brexit latest Brexit scramble as May heads to Brussels Can May get Brexit deal through Commons? As things stand, it appears there is no majority for Mrs May's deal in the Commons - but ministers hope enough MPs will swing behind it to get it through because the only alternative is no deal or ""no Brexit"". Labour and the other opposition parties are trying to find a way to present MPs with other options. Mr McDonnell said there could be a series of votes and it was ""very difficult to predict"" what the final outcome would be - but, echoing Conservative cabinet minister Amber Rudd, he said he did not think there was a majority for a no-deal Brexit. Speaking at Reuters event in London, he said it was ""difficult to see"" how there could be a general election - which Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has long insisted is his preferred option - at the moment because it would require two-thirds of MPs to back it under the Fixed Term Parliament Act. He said: ""My own view is we haven't explored sufficiently, neither has the media, these concepts, the constitution, our custom and practice, ""If it's a minority government and they can't obtain a majority in parliament, usually it's then the right, the duty of the Monarch to offer to the Opposition the opportunity to form a government and that would be a minority government, and see if they can secure a majority in parliament. ""I think we can secure a majority in parliament for some of the proposals we're putting forward."" This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon on working with Labour to fight Brexit deal He said opposition parties were normally asked to form a government when a minority government was losing votes in the House of Commons. This was already happening as the Democratic Unionist Party withdrew its support for Mrs May in Budget votes in protest at her EU withdrawal agreement, he said. ""However, I think the test is whether the government is losing consistent votes on the issue of the deal itself,"" he argued. In that case, he argued, Labour should be given a chance to try and get a majority for its plans. ""Failing that I think a general election is the route we need, and obviously, if we can't secure that then a further referendum."" At the moment Labour was working an amendments to the meaningful vote, that will give MPs an ""opportunity to avoid no deal at all costs - and I think there is a vast majority of MPs that would support that"". He said he hoped ""to demonstrate over the next couple of weeks that there is a consensus in Parliament for a new approach"". The shadow chancellor was sceptical about the chances of Brexit being stopped by another referendum, as some of his party's own MPs in the People's Vote campaign are hoping. ""My fear is that if we did have another referendum, we might get the same or similar result and the country will still be divided. Somehow we have got to try and bring the country back together again."" If there was another referendum, putting the option of staying in the EU on the ballot paper should be ""part of the discussion"", he told the event. He said Labour would seek to negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which he said would remove the need for a Northern Ireland ""backstop"" that has caused so much controversy.

That's partly because they seem to believe the conversations happening around the edges of cabinet at the moment, seeking out ways of carrying out nips and tucks to the agreement, are real. Don't get stuck with May, Rees-Mogg warns One of those involved joked on tonight (Tuesday) that the attorney general was working 24/7 on ""oxygen and vitamin drips"" so that he can find a solution. Another minister close to it all suggested ""a lot can be done with schedules, or addenda, or clarifications"". As far as unhappy Brexiteers are concerned, there is still clearly mileage for a few tweaks and tucks to the whole shebang, even though that's not really the sense coming out of Number 10, or more to the point, Brussels. Cynical I know, but if nothing else, creating a sense that even tiny changes could be on the table has made it possible for unhappy ministers to stay on. With so much at stake, maybe even throwing them the tiniest of bones to keep the new-look cabinet round the table is a purpose on its own. In a few days when the actual final documents emerge on Sunday, we'll know if this was just political management or a real process after all.

Food products that are high in fat, salt and / or sugar are known as HFSS. Under the Code of Advertising Practice (CAP), HFSS product advertisements must not appear in a medium or context in which 25% of the audience is under the age of 16.

"Is Theresa May facing a dramatic showdown with EU leaders on Sunday? Why is Theresa May rushing to Brussels on Wednesday when she has a fair few political headaches to contend with back home, and when she's due back here in just a few days for the seal-the-deal Brexit summit of EU leaders? The answer: the prime minister wants to show she is fighting until the very last moment to get the best Brexit deal possible out of the EU. Her Wednesday afternoon visit to see Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, provides her with a floodlit platform to do so. Now, the plan had been for the two leaders to discuss a draft text of the political declaration on post-Brexit EU-UK relations. Mrs May wanted to push for even closer trade ties than the EU has been willing to concede so far without the UK staying in the single market. Essentially she is very, very keen for her Chequers proposal for Brexit (viewed in EU circles as cherry-picking non plus ultra) to be reflected in the document. What to look for in the Brexit declaration However, the Brexit process has now got a lot more complicated - meaning that the draft text on EU-UK future relations hasn't been finished in time for the prime minister to pick over. You see, it's no longer just a matter of Mrs May wanting more from the EU. A number of EU countries are suddenly pushing for a lot more from the British prime minister. For France, it's about fishing rights;for Spain, it's about the status of Gibraltar. Others, meanwhile, such as the Netherlands and Denmark, think she should be getting a whole lot less when it comes to the UK-wide customs union, envisaged as part of the backstop for the Irish border. They want the UK to be tied tighter to EU environment regulations, for example, to avoid UK business having a competitive advantage over Europeans. As for the PM's Chequers plan for trade and security (much maligned back in the UK, too, of course), Germany has said loud and clear it won't allow the political declaration on future EU-UK relations to be a means of what Berlin describes as ""Chequers by the back door"". It is highly unlikely that all this can be sorted out in just one meeting between Mrs May and the European Commission chief. So the big question is: will the draft text on EU-UK future relations be ready by the end of the week to give EU leaders at least one day to digest it? Or are the stars aligning for a dramatic showdown between those leaders and the UK prime minister at their Sunday summit? A brief guide to where we are with Brexit One EU diplomat predicted possible similarities with a nail-biting, marathon summit at the height of the Greek debt crisis. During the all-night meeting, Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was invited to make his case to eurozone leaders on a number of occasions, before being sent out of the room to allow those leaders to decide the economic fate of his country amongst themselves. EU rules do not allow Mrs May to negotiate Brexit with EU leaders directly. If a number of issues remain open on Sunday, their Brexit summit could turn out to be a lot, lot longer than the two-hour signing session and photo op originally envisaged. The last question I'm going to ask in this post now is: could this all be more about optics than nitty-gritty politics? Grumbling aside, no-one in European circles seriously thinks any EU country will refuse to sign up to the Brexit deal by end of play this weekend. Reality Check: When is the crunch time? They're all keen to avoid a no-deal scenario and they want to help Mrs May get the Brexit texts through a vote in the House of Commons. Engaging in last-minute political fisticuffs with the EU is arguably advantageous for her. A high-drama, climactic Brexit summit ending in a late night/early morning bleary-eyed but triumphant resolution with EU leaders would allow Mrs May to claim that the final text of the deal was hard fought and hard wonâ¦ in the fervent hope that will soften the stance of some of her many critics at home.

"Accountancy firm Grant Thornton is being investigated over its auditing of Patisserie Holdings. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said it is investigating audits by Grant Thornton for three years - 2015, 2016 and 2017. Last month Chris Marsh, former finance director at the cafe chain Patisserie Valerie, was arrested after accounting irregularities were uncovered. Mr Marsh is also being investigated by the FRC. Mr Marsh is an accountant and member of the accountancy body the ICAEW. The FRC said that under its rules Mr Marsh would be investigated for misconduct while the investigation into Grant Thornton would cover breaches of its rules. A spokesman for Grant Thornton confirmed it had received a letter from the FRC about the decision to start an investigation. ""We will, of course, fully cooperate in this matter,"" the spokesman said. It is the first time that the focus had been put on three years of the company's accounts. The company has previously said it is trying to understand why executive share options relating to 2015 and 2016 were not appropriately disclosed and accounted for in its financial statements. In October the Serious Fraud Office said it had opened an investigation into an individual, assumed to be Mr Marsh. Mr Marsh, who has not been charged, was initially suspended and resigned shortly afterwards. Big auditors face competition investigation Grant Thornton fined Â£3m for misconduct over audits Patisserie Holdings was saved from collapse when Luke Johnson, who owns 37% of the company, offered up to Â£20m in loans to the struggling chain. Shareholders in the 206-store chain approved the rescue plan earlier this month despite complaining about the terms being offered to them. Last week, Paul May, the chief executive of the company, which also owns Druckers, Philpotts, Baker & Spice and Flour Power City, was replaced by Stephen Francis. The market for auditing is currently beingscrutinised by the Competition and Markets Authority. It wants to establish if there is a lack of competition among the big four accountancy firms, which could be hurting the quality of audits. Grant Thornton is a rival to the big four auditors of Deloitte, KPMG, EY and PwC. Grant Thornton was recently fined Â£4m after four of its senior employees admitted misconduct in handling the financial audits of Vimto-maker Nichols and the University of Salford.

The men, reportedly armed with rifles, ""fired indiscriminately"" before taking the 23-year-old volunteer from a trading centre in Kilifi County. Five people, including three children, were wounded and taken to hospital. The reason for the attack and the identity of the attackers has not yet been established, police said. The organisation she was working for, Africa Milele Onlus, hasposted a short statement on its website,externalsaying: ""There are no words to comment on what is happening. Silvia, we are all with you."" She has been named in Italian media as Silvia Costanza Romano. Kenyan police say they were treating the incident, which occurred at about 20:00 local time (17:00 GMT) on Tuesday, as a terror attack. This is the first foreigner to be kidnapped in Kenya sincethe country had a spate of abductions threaten its tourism resurgence in 2011. Allow Twitter content?

Another witness told news agency Reuters that he tried to help Ms Romano but one of the attackers hit him with a club. ""I saw them taking the lady down towards the riverside, they were asking her for money. ' We need money, we need money, we are not going to hurt you'"", another witness said. The attack happened at the guesthouse where the aid worker was staying Police described the five injured as aged between 10 and 23 years of age - the youngest suffering a bullet in the eye. The Italian foreign ministry said on Wednesday it was aware of the reports of the abduction and it was looking into the situation. Police have not confirmed any links to Islamist militants from al-Shabab, who are blamed for several deadly attacks on Kenyan soldiers in recent months in Lamu County, north of Kilifi. Al-Shabab, who are based in neighbouring Somalia, attacked a shopping mallin the capital Nairobi in 2013, killing 67 people. The al Qaeda-linked group are also thought to be responsible for killing a British manand kidnapping his wife from a resort island in 2011. A few weeks later,a disabled French woman was taken from her homeon the Lamu archipelago and reportedly died while in captivity.

"The Mexican tetra fish that lives in the rivers of Northern Mexico can heal its heart, while its cave-dwelling relative cannot A fish that can repair its heart may hold clues for future treatments in people, according to a study. Scientists studying the Mexican tetra fish found three areas of the fish genome were involved in its ability to regenerate heart tissue. One gene appeared to play a particularly key role in the process. Researchers hope theirstudy,externalwill one day make it possible to heal heart muscle in patients who have had a heart attack. Do you know your heart age? Middle-aged 'can reverse heart risk' Research to reverse heart failure Hundreds of thousands of people in the UK live with heart failure, often as a result of a heart attack. Because it is not possible for humans to regenerate their damaged, scarred heart muscle, people either have to live with the condition or may require a heart transplant. For this study, funded by the British Heart Foundation, Dr Mathilda Mommersteeg and her team at the University of Oxford studied two types of Mexican tetra fish - river-dwellers that are able to self-heal their heart tissue, and cave-dwellers that cannot. The cave fish, who once lived in the rivers of Northern Mexico, were washed into caves by floodwaters about 1.5 million years ago and evolved, losing their sight and colour because of living in perpetual darkness. Comparing the two types of tetra fish, researchers found two genes - lrrc10 and caveolin - were much more active in the river fish following heart injury. Having discovered this, they switched off the lrrc10 gene in a different species of fish with self-healing abilities, the zebrafish. With this gene no longer working properly, the zebrafish became unable to fully repair its heart without scarring. Scar tissue stops the heart muscle from contracting properly and reduces the heart's ability to pump blood around the body. Both of these genes are present in humans, and lrrc10 is known to be linked to a heart condition called dilated cardiomyopathy. Dr Mathilda Mommersteeg and a colleague in the cave where the fish live The study authors say their findings suggest it will one day be possible to regenerate damaged hearts in people by artificially modifying how these and other genes function. This could be done either with drugs or through gene-editing techniques, where DNA is modified, deleted or replaced, using tools like Crispr-Cas9. Dr Mommersteeg, who's associate professor of developmental and regenerative medicine, said: ""I do believe that this fish can tell us, at some point, how we can really repair the human heart... ""It's early days but we're incredibly excited about these remarkable fish and the potential to change the lives of people with damaged hearts."" But she said more work is needed to find other key genes that may be involved in the heart regenerating. Prof Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""Survival rates for heart failure have barely changed over the last 20 years, and life expectancy is worse than for many cancers. ""Breakthroughs are desperately needed to ease the devastation caused by this dreadful condition."" The study has been published in Cell Reports. Follow Alex on Twitter,external.

"This video can not be played Why do Trump's Saudi job numbers keep growing? US President Donald Trump has been asked to ascertain whether Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman played a role in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Republican and Democratic leaders of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday sent a letter demanding a second investigation. Mr Trump earlier defended US ties with Saudi Arabia despite international condemnation over the incident. Khashoggi was killed on 2 October inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. In a statement on Tuesday, Mr Trump acknowledged that the crown prince ""could very well"" have known about Khashoggi's brutal murder, adding: ""Maybe he did and maybe he didn't!"" He later stated that the CIA had not made a ""100%"" determination on the killing. The journalist who vanished into a consulate The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Following the president's comments, Republican Senator Bob Corker and Democrat Bob Menendez issued a statement on behalf of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In it they called on Mr Trump to focus a second investigation specifically on the crown prince so as to ""determine whether a foreign person is responsible for an extrajudicial killing, torture or other gross violation"" of human rights.

Saudi Arabia has blamed Khashoggi's death on rogue agentsbut denied claims that the crown prince had knowledge of the operation. US media have reported thatthe CIA believes Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder. In an interview on Sunday,Mr Trump told Fox News that he had refused to listen to a recording of Khashoggi's murder provided by Turkey, calling it ""a suffering tape"". By the BBC's chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, in Riyadh For Saudis, and especially Saudi leaders, there will be a sigh of relief. But, it's also what they expected, and what they've always said about President Trump - he will be a true friend of the Kingdom. Both sides want to draw a line under this major crisis - and global outcry. But as Mr Trump acknowledged, and Saudis know, it won't go away. Not for many in the US Congress, as well as for many others, including countries who will continue to call for greater clarity. Many Saudis say they don't believe their country's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, would have ordered such a despicable act. Many, who'd long been hoping to see their country move forward, have been shaken by this shocking murder, and regret it will cast a dark shadow for many years to come. In the words of one prominent Saudi: ""It has brought Saudi Arabia 10 steps back."" Meanwhile, Lindsey Graham, a senator from Mr Trump's Republican Party, has predicted strong bipartisan support in Congress for sanctions against Saudi Arabia ""including appropriate members of the royal family"".

Mike Pompeo backed Mr Trump, saying ""it's a mean, nasty world out there"" The statement also stresses Saudi investment pledges and arms purchases.

His release on the death of Jamal Khashoggi is remarkable for many reasons, and not just its blunt language. The president quickly tries to change the subject to Iran. He dismisses reports that Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder with a maybe-he-did, maybe-he-didn't shrug. He cites the economic impact of $450bn in investment and arms sales to the Saudis, although much of that is little more than paper promises. Perhaps most jarring is his casual observation that the Saudis viewed Khashoggi - a permanent US resident - as an ""enemy of the state"" with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. Mr Trump has distilled his ""America First"" worldview down to its very essence. Morality and global leadership take a back seat to perceived US economic and military security. Read more from Anthony What the take-away will be in the Middle East and beyond is a serious issue, says BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus. US policy in the region is so closely aligned with that of two key individuals - Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia and PM Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel - that it is increasingly hard to see how the US can play a role as an independent arbiter, our correspondent says. Mr Trump's narrow, interests-based approach will further dismay Washington's allies in the West, he argues, reinforcing those in Moscow and Beijing who are already applying a ""Russia First"" and a ""China First"" approach in international affairs. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted his disgust at the Trump statement, calling it disgraceful. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Gatwick airport: Brexit's impact will be felt at UK borders The EU and UK are poised to complete the document that will spell out the shape of their future post-Brexit relationship and pave the way for a trade deal. The Political Declaration on the future framework will sit alongside the Withdrawal Agreement that settles the terms of the UK's departure, but the declaration will not be legally binding. A seven-page outline has been published. BBC Brussels Reporter Adam Fleming explains what to look for in the final version. Discussions in Brussels about how many pages will be in the document are like a game of bingo. ""50! 14! 16! 20!"" Whatever the length, it has to be detailed enough to satisfy the UK and the EU. It has to offer the UK a vision of the future that will convince MPs to accept the divorce-related part of the deal. For the EU, it has to provide guidance to steer the negotiations about the future relationship, which will begin in earnest after Brexit. Their watchword is ""precision"". Expect it to cover a lot of sectors, such as trade, aviation, financial services, energy, crime. The EU's original plan was to publish the outline in October and then spend a month filling in the details with the UK, while consulting the member states. The timetable slipped, so that's now happening in about a week instead. A guide to where we are with Brexit Spain threatens to vote against Brexit deal The withdrawal agreement - what it all means Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop This video can not be played Theresa May: ""We will be fully in control of who comes here."" Last week the EU's top negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the biggest areas of disagreement were trade and security. Britain is said to be asking for the political declaration to reflect Prime Minister Theresa May's plan for a UK/EU free trade area in goods, with a common rulebook. Some EU countries think that's too similar to being a member. The EU also isn't prepared - so far - to continue the status quo on security. This includes co-operation on extradition and access to European databases. Language is being sought to ensure everyone can claim they got what they wanted. Both sides have agreed that the EU will apply its existing system for judging whether the financial services regulations of other countries are as good as its own, known as ""equivalence"". We might find out if the UK has succeeded in getting some additional safeguards in the equivalence regime that could help out the City of London. Or we might not. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. In the last few days the other 27 member states have raised concerns about some areas and asked for clarification. France leads a group of countries that want more clarity on the so-called ""level-playing field"" - measures that would put constraints on the UK in return for easy access to the single market, such as compliance with EU competition, environmental and social law. Belgium, Denmark, Portugal and others want to reinforce the EU's policy that European trawlers should have continued access to British waters in return for the UK being allowed to sell its fish in Europe. The Spanish government wants reassurance about the extent to which the future relationship will apply to Gibraltar. Some of these issues may be addressed in documents that accompany the political declaration, for example in the minutes of the meeting of EU leaders. Yes, more documents! Michel Barnier is representing the interests of 27 member states One sentence in the outline version caught my eye. It said the ""extent of the UK's commitments on customs and regulatory co-operation, including with regard to the alignment of rules, to be taken into account in the application of checks and controls at the border."" This is code for a sliding scale of frictionless trade. The message is: ""Apply EU rules and sign up to something that looks like a customs union, then there will be many fewer checks on the millions of trucks that go through Calais."" It means the internal argument the UK has had about rules, regulations and customs will continue well into the negotiations on the future. This section is called ""institutional arrangements"". It proposes that the UK/EU relationship is managed via a series of ministerial meetings and prime ministerial summits. Yes, a bit like the EU. It will also contain clues about how the next phase of talks will unfold. For me, it's the most important part because it will decide what I'll be doing for at least the next three years.

"The small peninsula of Gibraltar has been a British territory since 1713 Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez has said Spain will reject the draft Brexit withdrawal deal without a clarification of the text on future talks on the status of Gibraltar. Spain maintains a claim to the peninsula, ceded to the British crown under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. It wants to ensure that future EU talks with the UK do not cover Gibraltar. ""As things stand today if there are no changes regarding Gibraltar, Spain will vote no on Brexit,"" said Mr SÃ¡nchez. Throughout the Brexit negotiations, Spain - along with Ireland and Cyprus - has conducted separate talks with the UK about specific border issues. On Monday Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said that the draft Brexit deal had failed to make clear that talks on Gibraltar were ""separate negotiations"" and not part of future talks between the UK and EU. Mr SÃ¡nchez added his weight to those remarks on Tuesday at a forum in Madrid, emphasising that any future negotiations on Gibraltar had to be bilateral. ""As a country we cannot assume that whatever happens in the future with Gibraltar would be negotiated by the UK and EU - it will have to be negotiated between Spain and the UK,"" he said. Article 184 of the draft Brexit deal says the EU and the UK will seek to ""negotiate rapidly the agreements governing their future relationship"" between the official day of withdrawal on 29 March 2019 and the end of a transition period in December 2020. This video can not be played Spain claims Gibraltar is a part of the country because of its location on the Iberian peninsula But Spain believes the article in question is ambiguous and wants to ensure that this does not apply to the future of Gibraltar. It insists on its future right to discuss the status of the peninsula bilaterally with the UK, and is seeking clarity that this draft deal will allow it to do so. Asked about the Spanish objection to Article 184, a European Commission spokesman said they were aware of Spain's concerns. He saidthe EU's position on Gibraltar had been made clear in April 2017 guidelines,external, that after Brexit no agreement between the EU and UK could apply to Gibraltar without the agreement of the UK and Spain. What to look for in Brexit declaration? Spain hopeful of Gibraltar deal by summer Gibraltar angered by Spain's EU 'veto' Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo accused Spain of adopting a ""well-known tactic"" of raising issues at the last minute.

What will Brexit mean for Britain's overseas territories? Pictures of life on the Rock Read more about Gibraltar here A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Theresa May said the draft deal covered Gibraltar as well as ""the other overseas territories and the crown dependencies"". ""We will get a deal that works for the whole UK family."" By Gavin Lee, Europe reporter Spain and Britain have been running parallel negotiations over the future of Gibraltar, alongside the main EU-UK Brexit negotiations. Those talks have led to a ""protocol"" being agreed and three Spanish-British committees being set up to tackle tobacco smuggling, oversee cross-border workers rights, and co-operate on environmental protection and border control. There seemed to be no drama on the horizon and the Spanish prime minister told me a few weeks ago he had ""no significant concerns over Gibraltar"", that the ""behaviour of the British government was good"" and an agreement could be reached. So what has changed? The Spanish government says that its ""bone of contention"" is with one specific article in the draft Withdrawal Agreement that was only added last week, just before it was signed off by the European Commission, and wasn't seen by Spanish negotiators. A senior Spanish diplomat told me that Spain wanted the following words (or similar) added to Article 184: ""This does not apply to Gibraltar, which will be subject to bilateral talks between the UK and Spain."" Underlying all of this is the fact that Spain still disputes that Gibraltar as a British overseas territory. Spanish officials refer to the rock as a ""British colony"" and, although the Spanish government isn't seeking to use the Brexit talks to push that claim, it is making it clear that any decision over the future of Gibraltar can only happen with the approval of Madrid. Though Spain ceded the peninsula under the 1713 treaty, it has tried several times to regain control over it. A referendum in the territory in 1967 saw 99.6% of residents vote to remain British. A proposal for joint sovereignty was also decisively rejected by Gibraltarians in a 2002 vote. Spain closed its border with Gibraltar after the 1967 vote and did not fully reopen it until 1985, the year before Spain joined the European Economic Community - the forerunner of the EU. Gibraltar has a population of 33,600,externaland 7.7 million visitors a year Financial services and online gaming make up about 40% of the economy and account for nearly a quarter of jobs there It has its own tax system and attracts businesses with low tax rates Although there are exceptions, the general corporate tax rate in Gibraltar is 10%, while in Spain it is 25% Gibraltar has a considerably higher GDP per capita,externalthan either the UK or Spain.

"Karen Hales was murdered 25 years ago and her killer has still not been found A woman whose mother was killed in front of her when she was a toddler has said how sad she is that her baby son will grow up without his grandmother. Emily Hales was just 18 months old when her mother Karen was murdered at their home in Ipswich 25 years ago. Karen, 21, was stabbed multiple times and her body set on fire on 21 November 1993. Her killer has never been found. Miss Hales was saved from the fire by her grandparents. She said she still thought of her mum every day. Now 26, she said having a baby of her own had been ""really difficult"" without her mum by her side. She said: ""I think of the things we would do together, you know, just normal life and she's missing out on Tommy. ""He's lovely, he's nine-and-a-half months and turning into a right little character."" Karen Hales's daughter Emily was only 18 months old when her mother was killed in front of her Miss Hales said it would ""mean everything to us"" to know who killed her mother and why. ""There must be someone who knows something and if you do know anything, then please tell the police,"" she said. Karen Hales's mother Geraldine said Tommy, who would have been her daughter's first grandchild, was a ""gorgeous little boy"", and ""this evil person took that away from her"". Graham and Geraldine Hales said they ""desperately"" want to find their daughter's killer On the day she was killed, Karen Hales was alone with daughter Emily at home in Lavenham Road. Her fiance Peter Ruffles, Emily's father, had left at 15:50 GMT to go to work. Shortly before 16:40, her parents, Graham and Geraldine Hales, called in at the house and entered through the unlocked front door. They were confronted with smoke and flames and found their daughter had been stabbed and an attempt made to set her alight. 'I wish I could remember the killer' Reward offer to find 1993 killer,external Other stories from Suffolk Renewing its appeal for information 25 years on from Karen Hales's murder, Suffolk Police said it ""was not giving up"" searching for her killer. Det Supt Andy Smith said it was one of the biggest murder investigations the force had ever launched, with 50 officers involved at the time. He said they had thousands of lines of inquiries, hundreds of witnesses spoken to and more than 300 items seized. Det Supt Smith said it was ""not through a lack of trying"" the killer had not yet been caught. He said it was ""immensely disappointing"" knowing they had not brought the murderer or murderers to justice. ""Words fail me as to how despicable this crime was, it's certainly one of the worst crimes I've experienced in my 25 years,"" he said. He said he thought it was a targeted attack and urged the person responsible to come forward and ""end the torment and suffering"" caused to the Hales family. On the day Ms Hales was murdered there was at least two inches of snow on the ground. Police found her purse was missing, as were two Laser knives. The murder featured on the BBC's Crimewatch UK in 1994 and aÂ£50,000 reward was co-ordinated by the then Evening Star newspaper,externalin 2005, but neither appeal provided a breakthrough. Karen Hales was killed at home on Lavenham Road, Ipswich Mr and Mrs Hales, who have been married for 54 years, said they still desperately wanted to know what happened to their daughter, who they described as ""bubbly"" and ""full of life"". Mr Hales, 72, said: ""It's hard to live with it. You never forget, I go over and over in my mind, it's hard to talk about it."" His wife, with whom he has two other daughters, Jacqui and Angie, added: ""Whoever it was is out there living a life, 25 years, and they've deprived Karen of her life.

"Russian Alexander Prokopchuk is the frontrunner to become the next Interpol chief A Russian official is expected to become the new head of Interpol, despite concerns that Moscow has used the agency to target its opponents. Alexander Prokopchuk, a veteran of the country's interior ministry, is favourite to be elected president at a meeting of Interpol's annual congress. He is currently one of four vice-presidents of Interpol. The election follows the disappearance of Interpol's former president Meng Hongwei in September. China has since confirmed he has been detained and is being investigated for allegedly taking bribes. Representatives from Interpol's 194 member states are meeting in Dubai for the vote. They will decide between Mr Prokopchuk and another vice-president, South Korea's Kim Jong Yang, but the Russian is considered the favourite. Although the role of president is largely ceremonial, it still wields influence and the election of Mr Prokopchuk would be seen as a major success for Russia. But there is growing criticism of his candidacy from human rights groups and officials from other countries who fear his election could lead to an escalation in Russia's attempts to pursue its critics. Mr Prokopchuk has been accused of abusing Interpol's so-called red notice system - international arrest warrants - to target critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin, while serving as Interpol's Moscow bureau chief. One group of US senators said electing him would be ""akin to putting a fox in charge of the henhouse"", while a prominent Kremlin critic said it would be like ""putting the mafia in charge"". The UK says it is backing Kim Jong Yang, and has been urged by some British MPs to consider withdrawing from Interpol if Mr Prokopchuk is elected. ""Putting a senior representative of one of the most criminalised governments on Earth in charge of Interpol makes a mockery of the organisation in principle,"" said Conservative lawmaker Bob Seely. Lithuania, which regained its independence from Russia during the collapse of the Soviet Union and is now a member of both Nato and the European Union, has threatened to leave Interpol if Mr Prokopchuk is elected.

"Kevin Hassett, chairman of President Trump's Council of Economic Advisers One of President Trump's top economic advisers has suggested there could be a case for ""evicting China"" from the World Trade Organisation (WTO). In a BBC interview, Kevin Hassett chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers said China had ""misbehaved"" as a member of the WTO. He also claimed that the US had been failed by the organisation. But Mr Hassett said that what he called the President's hardball strategy on international trade is working. On the WTO, President Trump's administration has taken an approach that many others see as disruptive. It poses a significant challenge to the WTO's ability to settle disputes between member countries about alleged breaches of its rules. The World Trade Organization was established in 1995, when it took over from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), which came into force in 1948 Based in Geneva, it has 164 members which it says represents 98% of world trade It deals with the rules of trade between nations and its purpose is to promote international commerce WTO agreements are lengthy but aim to stop countries discriminating against each other It aims to reduce barriers to free trade such as tariffs or quotas Countries can also use the WTO to handle trade disputes A key element in the WTO disputes system is a body which considers appeals against initial rulings by dispute panels. The US has obstructed new appointments when members' terms expire and that is making it increasingly difficult for the body to function. Dr Hassett said the WTO played a very important historic role in helping modernise the world. But he also thought that it had failed the US in many ways. He said the US generally wins the cases it brings to the WTO but ""it takes five or six years and then the damage is done"". He said the WTO needs to be better able to deal with countries that don't obey the rules and are willing to lose at the WTO because the penalties are so low. President Trump and China's President Xi Jinping met last year but are engaged in a trade war One country has featured prominently in President Trump's trade agenda, and Kevin Hassett continued with that theme: ""We never really envisioned that a country would enter the WTO and then behave the way that China has.  It's a new thing for the WTO to have a member that is misbehaving so much."" The question he argued is whether that can fixed through bilateral negotiation, by reform of the WTO or even, by removing China from the WTO. The last of those is a not official US policy. It was the final, least preferred, of three options that Dr Hassett listed and he expressed it as a question: ""Should we pursue evicting China from the WTO?"" It might not even be possible. But it is a startling suggestion to hear from a senior figure in the US administration. It is certainly in keeping with a general approach to international trade has been much more assertive- many say confrontational - than that of President Trump's predecessors. In his first two years he has imposed tariffs - import taxes - on steel and aluminium and on a swathe of goods from China. He pulled the US out of one trade agreement, the Transpacific Partnership, and embarked on the renegotiation of another, the North American Free Trade Agreement, (NAFTA), which concluded earlier this year. Many of President Trump's critics see much of this as protectionism. But Dr Hassett says that President Trump wants to see barrier-free trade with every country on earth. When he took office, the US had opened up to other countries ""no questions asked"". The US, he said, found itself in a situation where it has lower barriers to trade than its partners. He said Presidents Clinton, Obama and the two Bushes had all wanted to improve that situation and had failed. President Trump came into the White House with what Dr Hassett called a very hardball strategy, but he said ""I think it is clearly working"". He pointed to the replacement for NAFTA and said the US is in negotiations with virtually all its trading partners now. ""That's an enormous amount of progress"". He didn't accept the idea that the new tariffs are bad for Americans. Another former economic adviser to President Trump, Gary Cohn, has described them as a tax on consumers Dr Hassett said that on China specifically the tariffs have been designed to cause minimum harm at home and put maximum pressure on China. He said that has been very effective and the Chinese are now coming to the table.

"Children under the age of five are at greater risk of death from severe malnutrition An estimated 85,000 children under the age of five may have died from acute malnutrition in three years of war in Yemen, a leading charity says. The number is equivalent to the entire under-five population in the UK's second largest city of Birmingham, Save the Children adds. The UN warned last month that up to 14m Yemenis are on the brink of famine. It is trying to revive talks to end a three-year war which has caused the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Yemen has been devastated by the conflict. Fighting escalated in 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition launched an air campaign against the Houthi rebel movement which had forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Why is there a war in Yemen? Ending Yemenâs never-ending war At least 6,800 civilians have been killed and 10,700 injured in the war, according to the UN. The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition have also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that has affected 1.2 million people. It is difficult to get an exact number of deaths. Aid workers in Yemen say many go unreported because only half of the country's health facilities are functioning and many people are too poor to access the ones that remain open. Save the Children says it based its figures on mortality rates for untreated cases of Severe Acute Malnutrition in children under five from data compiled by the UN. According to conservative estimates, it calculated that around 84,700 children may have died between April 2015 and October 2018. This video can not be played Yemen: Where children rummage through rubbish for food Rising food prices and the falling value of the country's currency as a result of a civil war are putting more families at risk of food insecurity. The UK-based charity blames the blockade for putting more people at risk of famine, with continued heavy fighting around the principal lifeline port of Hudaydah further exacerbating the situation. The rebel-held port, through which the country has traditionally imported 90% of its food, has seen commercial imports fall by more than 55,000 metric tonnes a month, the charity says. This is enough to meet the needs of 4.4m people, including 2.2m children, it adds. Save the Children said it had been forced to bring supplies for the north of Yemen through its southern port of Aden, which has significantly slowed down aid deliveries. Nusair, a 13-month-old boy, is among the children suffering from severe acute malnutrition who is being closely monitored by Save the Children. He was treated in August but by October his health had deteriorated again. 13-month-old Nusair By that time he and his mother had been forced to relocate to a remote area due to increased fighting near their home and were unable to make the long trip to hospital. ""I can't go to sleep, it is torturing, and I am worried about my children. I couldn't live if any harm came to them,"" his mother, Suad, told the charity. Yemen's conflict in 400 words Why battle for Yemen's Hudaydah matters The charity says that based on historical studies, if acute malnutrition is left untreated, around 20-30% of children will die each year. ""For every child killed by bombs and bullets, dozens are starving to death and it's entirely preventable,"" its Yemen director, Tamer Kirolos, says. ""Children who die in this way suffer immensely as their vital organ functions slow down and eventually stop. Their immune systems are so weak they are more prone to infections with some too frail to even cry. ""Parents are having to witness their children wasting away, unable to do anything about it."" He further warned that an estimated 150,000 children's lives were endangered in Hudaydah with ""a dramatic increase"" in air strikes over the city in recent weeks. Not yet - but it's getting close. Just last month, the UN warned thathalf the population of the war-torn country was facing ""pre-famine conditions"". This video can not be played The UN says Yemen is on the brink of the world's worst famine in 100 years if the war continues A country has to meet the following criteria to be declared in famine: At least one in five households faces an extreme lack of food More than 30% of children under five are suffering from acute malnutrition At least two people out of every 10,000 are dying every day The UN said - based on assessments from a year ago - the first two thresholds had either been exceeded or was dangerously close in 107 of Yemen's 333 districts. But the third threshold about numbers of deaths was more difficult to confirm. The organisation is currently repeating the assessments. UN envoy Martin Griffiths arrived in the Yemeni capital Sanaa on Wednesday for talks with the Houthi rebels in a bid to lay the groundwork for peace talks in Sweden. It comes after a lull in violence was broken on Tuesday, with intense fighting erupting between the Saudi-led coalition and Houthi rebels in Hudaydah. On Monday, the UK presented a draft resolution to the UN urging an immediate truce in the port city and giving both sides of the conflict a two-week deadline to remove all barriers to humanitarian aid. Separately, Saudi Arabia and its ally, the UAE, have pledged $500m (Â£390m; â¬440m) in food aid, and say it is intended to reach 10 to 12 million Yemenis.

"The Mexican tetra fish that lives in the rivers of Northern Mexico can heal its heart, while its cave-dwelling relative cannot A fish that can repair its heart may hold clues for future treatments in people, according to a study. Scientists studying the Mexican tetra fish found three areas of the fish genome were involved in its ability to regenerate heart tissue. One gene appeared to play a particularly key role in the process. Researchers hope theirstudy,externalwill one day make it possible to heal heart muscle in patients who have had a heart attack. Do you know your heart age? Middle-aged 'can reverse heart risk' Research to reverse heart failure Hundreds of thousands of people in the UK live with heart failure, often as a result of a heart attack. Because it is not possible for humans to regenerate their damaged, scarred heart muscle, people either have to live with the condition or may require a heart transplant. For this study, funded by the British Heart Foundation, Dr Mathilda Mommersteeg and her team at the University of Oxford studied two types of Mexican tetra fish - river-dwellers that are able to self-heal their heart tissue, and cave-dwellers that cannot. The cave fish, who once lived in the rivers of Northern Mexico, were washed into caves by floodwaters about 1.5 million years ago and evolved, losing their sight and colour because of living in perpetual darkness. Comparing the two types of tetra fish, researchers found two genes - lrrc10 and caveolin - were much more active in the river fish following heart injury. Having discovered this, they switched off the lrrc10 gene in a different species of fish with self-healing abilities, the zebrafish. With this gene no longer working properly, the zebrafish became unable to fully repair its heart without scarring. Scar tissue stops the heart muscle from contracting properly and reduces the heart's ability to pump blood around the body. Both of these genes are present in humans, and lrrc10 is known to be linked to a heart condition called dilated cardiomyopathy. Dr Mathilda Mommersteeg and a colleague in the cave where the fish live The study authors say their findings suggest it will one day be possible to regenerate damaged hearts in people by artificially modifying how these and other genes function. This could be done either with drugs or through gene-editing techniques, where DNA is modified, deleted or replaced, using tools like Crispr-Cas9. Dr Mommersteeg, who's associate professor of developmental and regenerative medicine, said: ""I do believe that this fish can tell us, at some point, how we can really repair the human heart... ""It's early days but we're incredibly excited about these remarkable fish and the potential to change the lives of people with damaged hearts."" But she said more work is needed to find other key genes that may be involved in the heart regenerating. Prof Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""Survival rates for heart failure have barely changed over the last 20 years, and life expectancy is worse than for many cancers. ""Breakthroughs are desperately needed to ease the devastation caused by this dreadful condition."" The study has been published in Cell Reports. Follow Alex on Twitter,external.

"A group of unidentified gunmen have abducted an Italian woman working for an aid organisation in south-east Kenya, police said on Wednesday. The men, reportedly armed with rifles, ""fired indiscriminately"" before taking the 23-year-old volunteer from a trading centre in Kilifi County. Five people, including three children, were wounded and taken to hospital. The reason for the attack and the identity of the attackers has not yet been established, police said. The organisation she was working for, Africa Milele Onlus, hasposted a short statement on its website,externalsaying: ""There are no words to comment on what is happening. Silvia, we are all with you."" She has been named in Italian media as Silvia Costanza Romano. Kenyan police say they were treating the incident, which occurred at about 20:00 local time (17:00 GMT) on Tuesday, as a terror attack. This is the first foreigner to be kidnapped in Kenya sincethe country had a spate of abductions threaten its tourism resurgence in 2011. Allow Twitter content?

""I saw them taking the lady down towards the riverside, they were asking her for money. ' We need money, we need money, we are not going to hurt you'"", another witness said. The attack happened at the guesthouse where the aid worker was staying Police described the five injured as aged between 10 and 23 years of age - the youngest suffering a bullet in the eye. The Italian foreign ministry said on Wednesday it was aware of the reports of the abduction and it was looking into the situation. Police have not confirmed any links to Islamist militants from al-Shabab, who are blamed for several deadly attacks on Kenyan soldiers in recent months in Lamu County, north of Kilifi. Al-Shabab, who are based in neighbouring Somalia, attacked a shopping mallin the capital Nairobi in 2013, killing 67 people. The al Qaeda-linked group are also thought to be responsible for killing a British manand kidnapping his wife from a resort island in 2011. A few weeks later,a disabled French woman was taken from her homeon the Lamu archipelago and reportedly died while in captivity.

"Patrick Ward denies he was one of the offenders caught on CCTV stealing items at the brewery The leader of a 100-strong group of travellers who illegally occupied a brewery demanded ""twenty grand or the place is ours"", a court was told. A convoy of 25 vehicles set up camp at Thwaites Brewery in Blackburn on 26 May, Preston Crown Court heard. Thomas Ward, 43, of Leigh, Wigan, has pleaded guilty to blackmailing, conspiracy to burgle and conspiracy to commit criminal damage. The group later went on the rampage causing extensive damage, jurors heard. Jurors heard Thomas Ward, of Aspull Common, told the brewery he wanted Â£20,000 to leave within the hour after gate locks were broken at the site in Lancashire. After some negotiation, Mr Ward agreed to take payment for his demand at noon the next day - 27 May - provided no damage was caused. But prosecutors say travellers went on a wrecking spree and ransacked the office building later that afternoon after Mr Ward became convinced he had been duped. Staff and police finally gained full access to the brewery two days later and Thwaites chief executive Richard Bailey said he was greeted by a scene of ""utter devastation"", with damage estimated at Â£300,000, the court heard. The presence of the travellers at the site led to 1,700 pints of beer being poured away in case of contamination. John Ward has admitted conspiracy offences Mr Ward has pleaded guilty to blackmail and conspiracy offences while his co-accused John Ward, 33, also of Aspull Common, and a 17-year-old male, who cannot be named because of his age, also admitted the conspiracy offences. A fourth defendant, Patrick Ward, 32, of Aspull Common, who has pleaded not guilty to the same conspiracy offences, is on trial in his absence. The court heard CCTV - which also showed young children playing in the yard - stopped recording when the power was cut on site shortly before 18:00 on 27 May. Kimberley Obrusik, prosecuting, said Patrick Ward from Aspull Common was one of the offenders caught on CCTV stealing items at the brewery. Jurors were told he denies it was him, although he accepts he was in the area at nearby Morrison's supermarket and Gala Bingo on the same day. The trial continues.

"Neither leader said anything as they posed for the cameras Theresa May has met EU officials as the two sides scramble to finalise a Brexit deal in time for Sunday's summit of European leaders. The EU is in a race against time to complete the text of its declaration on future relations with the UK, amid concerns from several member states. Contentious issues include fishing rights in British waters and Gibraltar. The European Commission said ""very good progress"" had been made at Wednesday's meeting but work was continuing.

In other developments: DUP leader Arlene Fostersaid her party's parliamentary pact with the Conservatives was ""not dead"" despite it withdrawing its support in recent years Labour could take poweras a minority government if the Conservatives found themselves unable to govern, shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said Before heading for Brussels, Mrs May came under fire from every Brexit faction in the House of Commons at a noisy Prime Minister's Questions - from those who want another referendum, to those who want Britain to leave the EU without a deal. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn zeroed in on comments by new work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd, who said MPs would prevent a no-deal Brexit, apparently putting her at odds with the PM's ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" stance. What to look for in the Brexit political declaration The withdrawal agreement - what it all means Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop He asked: ""Does the prime minister agree there are no circumstances under which Britain would leave with no-deal?"" Mrs May replied ""no"" and said the alternative to her deal would ""either be more uncertainty, more division or"", in what looks like the emerging new emphasis from her government, ""it could risk no Brexit at all"". Mr Corbyn said that ""if the government can't negotiate an alternative then it should make way for those who can and will"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Has PM ruled out no-deal Brexit? Mrs May replied: ""He is opposing a deal he hasn't read, he's promising a deal he can't negotiate, he's telling Leave voters one thing and Remain voters another - whatever (Mr Corbyn) will do, I will act in the national interest."" Mrs May also rejected a call from the SNP's Ian Blackford to renegotiate her Brexit deal to keep the UK in the single market and customs union, saying it would ""frustrate the vote of the British people"". And she branded Green MP Caroline Lucas's call for another referendum, on the grounds that public opinion had shifted since the 2016 referendum, ""absolutely ridiculous,"" saying the public had given this Parliament ""an instruction"" to leave the EU. Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict The 585-page document, which prompted two cabinet members to resign in mid-November, focuses on the terms of the UK's departure. It includes how much money the UK must pay to the EU as a settlement (often dubbed the divorce bill), details of the transition period and citizens' rights. It also covers the so-called ""backstop"", a last-resort option to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event the UK leaves the EU without securing a trade deal. It would avoid the need for bringing back physical border checks. The backstop would involve a temporary single customs territory, encompassing Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union - until both the EU and UK agree that it is no longer necessary. Critics fear the UK would continue to follow EU rules for an indefinite time without having any say over them. As well as the ministers who quit, others are believed to be trying to change the wording of the draft. There has been speculation over whether a confidence vote in Theresa May's leadership could be triggered. The EU will consider the agreement, alongside a declaration on its future relations with the UK, at a summit on 25 November. But neither has yet been approved by Parliament. Mrs May appears to have faced down the threat of a challenge to her position from Brexiteer critics of the deal, for the time being at least. However, Tory MPs unhappy with Mrs May's handling of Brexit negotiations want much more clarity on the terms of the UK's future co-operation with the EU if they are to back the final deal. All sides in the Commons have warned of a ""blind Brexit"" in which the UK signs up to a series of legally-binding commitments in the draft withdrawal agreement, without similar guarantees over future trading arrangements. This video can not be played Tory Remainer Ken Clarke MP tells Newsnight he will support the prime minister's Brexit deal to get us ""to the transition"". The withdrawal deal was agreed in principle by both Mrs May and the EU last week. It includes a Â£39bn ""divorce bill"" and the controversial customs ""backstop"" which keeps the UK temporarily in the EU customs union as a way of preventing the return of manned customs posts at the Irish border. However, the joint political declaration on future relations - still being drafted - would only set out the shape of the UK's trading relationship with the remaining 27-nation bloc, without any legal commitments.

"Jacob Rees-Mogg has warned fellow Tory MPs that if they don't ditch Theresa May now she will lead them into the next election, scheduled for 2022. Few Tories thought this was a ""good idea"", the Brexiteer MP suggested. Mr Rees-Mogg wants to oust the PM over her EU withdrawal agreement but has so far failed to get enough colleagues to back his call for a no confidence vote. Meanwhile, ministers have had to accept Labour amendments to the Finance Bill after the DUP withdrew its backing. Labour said the government was ""falling apart in front of us"" after ministers accepted a series of technical changes to the bill to pass the Budget. They were made after it became clear the Democratic Unionists, on whom Theresa May relies for her Commons majority, again said they would not support the Tories. Brexit Live: Rolling updates on developments Spain demands Gibraltar veto in Brexit deal What to look for in Brexit declaration Backlash over May's 'queue jumping' comment Mr Rees-Mogg said he had not given up hope of getting the 48 letters of no confidence in the PM needed to trigger a vote. ""What we are seeing from this government is a deliberate decision not to deliver a proper Brexit,"" he told reporters at a Westminster news conference. ""We have a government led by Remainers who want to keep us tied into the EU as tightly as possible."" He said the 48 letter threshold might be reached next month when MPs get a ""meaningful vote"" on the withdrawal agreement. But he added: ""I think (the time) is now, or the prime minister will lead the Conservatives into the next election. Mrs May's allies insist she would win a no confidence vote and under Conservative rules she would then be immune from a challenge for 12 months. The PM says her Brexit deal is the best the UK can get from Brussels and it will allow the country to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"". This video can not be played Sammy Wilson, DUP: ""The government had broken one of the fundamental agreements they had with us... we had to do something."" In other developments: Downing Street said at a meeting of the cabinet earlier, the first since a spate of Brexit resignations last week, ministers had discussed possible alternative arrangements to keep the border open, that could involve ""technological solutions"". In a sign of tension on the EU side, Spain has said it will not agree to the draft Brexit withdrawal deal without clarity over how talks on the future status of Gibraltar should be handled. Ministers from the remaining 27 EU countries met in Brussels to work on the political declaration setting out their future relationship with the UK.

Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Tory-DUP relationship 'broken over Europe' The importance of being unionist Downing Street said that,during talks with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the PM had emphasised that the draft Brexit terms would give Scottish businesses the ""clarity and certainty they need to protect jobs and living standards and see us take back control of our waters"". The SNP leader also met Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn earlier to discuss tactics ahead of the Commons vote. This video can not be played In full: Nicola Sturgeon interview with Laura Kuenssberg on Brexit Ms Sturgeon held a separate meeting with Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, Green MP Caroline Lucas and Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Roberts, who all back another EU referendum. She told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg she wanted to form a ""coalition of opposition"" to Mrs May's Brexit plans, and that momentum for another referendum was growing. She described her talks with Mr Corbyn as ""exploratory"" and said she did not know whether he would back a referendum. But she said they both agreed that the PM's Brexit deal is a bad one and that no-deal should not be the only alternative presented to MPs. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. A Labour spokesman said: ""They discussed their common opposition to Theresa May's botched Brexit deal and determination to work across Parliament to prevent a disastrous no-deal outcome."" As it stands, thereappears to be a majority in Parliament against the deal. Sturgeon has 'constructive' Corbyn talks Work with Plaid on Brexit, Labour urged And Mrs May is coming under growing pressure from the DUP, whose 10 MPs keep her government in power. This video can not be played Theresa May tells  Laura Kuenssberg: ""Don't just listen to the politicians."" The DUP abstained in Monday night's Budget votes as a warning shot over what they say are her broken promises on Brexit. After the DUP indicated they would abstain again on further votes on Tuesday, ministers accepted Labour and SNP amendments in order to avoid likely defeat. These will require the government to conduct a review into the public health impact of gaming, a report into the impact of Brexit on international tax enforcement and a review into the impact of tax avoidance measures on income inequality and child poverty. Under the terms of their House of Commons deal, agreed after Mrs May lost her Commons majority in last year's general election, the DUP is supposed to back the government on Budget matters and on confidence votes. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said their refusal to do so now was ""absolutely staggering"", adding that the Conservatives were ""in office but not in power"".

"This video can not be played Duke talks of being 'tipped over the edge' Prince William has told how ""very traumatic"" callouts involving children took him ""over the edge"" while he was working for the air ambulance. The Duke of Cambridge served as a pilot at the East Anglian Air Ambulance until last summer, after moving from the RAF. The prince, 36, said having his own children - George, Charlotte and Louis - deepened his feelings when sent to distressing jobs. ""I got very sad and very down about this particular family,"" he said. Prince William worked alongside doctors and paramedics providing emergency medical cover across Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk, as well as Essex and Hertfordshire at night. ""I worked several times on very traumatic jobs involving children,"" he said. ""After I had my own children, I think the relation between the job and the personal life was what really took me over the edge, and I started feeling things that I have never felt before. ""Talking was really important, but even that wasn't quite enough for one particular incident for me.""

"In one house, water would ""cascade"" from the upstairs bathroom into the kitchen, where part of the ceiling was missing Less than a quarter of state-run accommodation for asylum seekers in the UK is compliant with standards, amuch-delayed report has found.,external The Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration cited evidence of damp, dirty and vermin-infested properties. Some of the accommodation was found to be unsuitable for vulnerable groups, including survivors of torture or domestic violence. The Home Office said it was ""committed to improving"" the service. Chief inspector David Bolt, who sent his report to ministers four months ago, also criticised the government for failing to have a ""grip"" on the number of pregnant asylum seekers or those who had just given birth. Refugees seeking asylum in the UK are eligible for financial support or help with housing from the Home Office, if they can prove they are destitute. Accommodation for asylum seekers is managed in six regions by three private providers operating under a Home Office contract. Mr Bolt said the inspection ""proved more challenging than most"" because of ""several reasons, not least the difficulty of extracting evidence from the Home Office."" ""My report is likely to please no-one,"" he added. ""It is clear from the Home Office's response to the draft report that this topic touches a nerve."" According to the report, Home Office contract officers - whose job it is to check accommodation meets the requirement of the contract - inspected 8,313 properties in 22 months and declared 3,567 (43%) as ""not fit for purpose"" or needing ""urgent"" repairs. Only 24% were found to be ""compliant"" with standards. Inside a mother and baby unit there were blocked drains, an infestation of rodents, damp and mould The chief inspector said much of the evidence focused on ""poor property standards"" with ""frequent"" references to defects, damp, dirt and vermin. Examples included: The ventilation in one flat so bad that a three-year-old boy began suffering health problems ""Blocked drains, an infestation of rodents, damp and mould"" in a mother and baby unit for seven women with children under the age of two Young people with high levels of trauma being placed in houses shared with older men with alcohol and drug problems In some cases, asylum cases were told not to touch fixtures - meaning one new mother waited a month for someone to put together a cot, and others waited a fortnight for a light bulb to be changed. Some of the housing was assessed as unsuitable for vulnerable groups, including survivors of torture and victims of domestic violence. A three-year-old boy, who lived with his parents in a basement flat, developed health problems after poor ventilation, leaking water and damp Some asylum seekers saved up from their weekly allowance to buy a vacuum cleaner, or scrubbed the dirt from carpets when they first moved in Mr Bolt also expressed concern about the way information on pregnant women and new mothers was recorded and shared. He said: ""An overall grip on the numbers and distribution of pregnant and post-partum women within the asylum accommodation system is not a 'nice to have', but is essential to a proper understanding of whether the present policies and practices are meeting the needs of this particularly vulnerable group."" The report concluded that the Home Office was ""too accepting"" of the limitations of the current contracts, which are due to be replaced or renewed in September 2019, saying there was ""much more"" that the department should do to bring about improvements. ""The system will always rely on collaboration, but it is the Home Office that holds most of the keys,"" said Mr Bolt. What is it like when an asylum centre opens near you? Reality Check: Where have the Syrian refugees gone? Scrap 'tens of thousands' target, MPs urge The Home Office said: ""Our comprehensive action plan will support customers in raising issues with their accommodation and ensure vulnerable people receive a more tailored service. ""In addition, we have restructured our routine inspections so that our approach to managing the contracts and accommodation standards is more consistent nationally."" The head of advocacy at the Refugee Council, Andy Hewett, said the charity was ""deeply concerned"" by some of the report's findings, but said they were not new ""by any stretch"". And Gary Christie, head of policy at the Scottish Refugee Council, said they have dealt with many issues around poor standards of housing for asylum seekers. ""One recent case involved a young mother and her daughter,"" he said. ""Whilst her flat was overall in a satisfactory state, the close was filthy, ridden with litter, and urine-filled with a disgusting odour. ""It had a standing sofa that blocked entry to the backdoor, rubbish bins and safe exit in the event of a fire. There was race hate graffiti on a wall."" Earlier on Tuesday, the Home Affairs Select Committee heard from regional representatives across the UK as part of a new inquiry examining asylum accommodation contracts. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham told MPs the current arrangements were ""not fair to the people arriving needing support, not fair to the host communities, not fair to the local authorities"". ""The only people the current arrangements work for are the Home Office and the contract providers,"" he said. What is it like when an asylum centre opens near you?

"Charlotte Higman was finally refunded by RBS A Royal Bank of Scotland customer had more than Â£4,300 stolen from her account by a fraudulent caller who answered one of her security questions wrongly, BBC Watchdog Live has found. For more than a year, the bank insisted Charlotte Higman had been aware of the transaction and refused to refund her. The Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) backed RBS after the initial complaint. But earlier this month, RBS apologised and issued Charlotte a full refund, after Watchdog Live's investigation. Charlotte, from Totnes in Devon, believes that RBS repeatedly failed to pick up on evidence, including warnings raised in its own security processes. In a recording of the fraudulent phone call obtained by Watchdog Live, a woman can be heard incorrectly answering a security question relating to Charlotte's occupation. Despite this, a transaction of Â£4,318 is approved by the bank and it is only after the caller requests a second transaction, and is unable to answer additional security questions, that a warning is raised on Charlotte's account. The bank's own records show that the phone call, in January 2017, was marked as a ""potential account takeover"" and the caller failed the bank's voice recognition checks. Despite this, the initial transaction was not reversed. After reporting the call to the police, Charlotte discovered her phone line was diverted on the day of the call, explaining why the bank believed they were speaking to her at her home address. ""I just feel really angry that someone's been able to do it that easily,"" Charlotte told Watchdog. ""The bank said that the person was in the home, they did the transactions from the home and they passed all the security questions correctly - and that's why they believed that I'd done it."" Watchdog presenter Steph McGovern and lawyer Arun Chauhan Charlotte's case pre-dates a new voluntary code of conduct on such scams which most of the banks have signed up to. In essence, the code says that if a customer - or the bank - has failed to heed warning signs, they will be liable for any subsequent loss. Under the code, RBS would have been obliged to pay up. The industry is still consulting on the issue, and the code is expected to be finalised next year. Fraud lawyer Arun Chauhan told the programme: ""I have a lot of sympathy for Charlotte, ""You can hear what [the caller has] tried to do is put together two transactions for the full balance of the account and the bank just don't pick it up as a warning sign. ""They know at the end this is fraud, but they've done nothing about the first transaction and that's why Charlotte should be so critical of the bank."" Name checks to begin on bank payments Ulster Bank manager's pride after Â£20,000 fraud prevented New bank scheme 'has prevented fraud worth Â£1.5m' According to fraud prevention service Cifas, facility takeover fraud -when a fraudster abuses personal data to hijack someone's existing account or services,external- rose 7% last year to more than 24,000 reported cases. Bank accounts remain the most targeted product for fraudsters, with more than 100,000 reported cases in the UK last year. This is how the fraud on Charlotte was carried out: Bank records show the fraudster initially calls the bank, posing as Charlotte, and asks for her account to be reset for security reasons. Staff follow the bank's usual security protocol and call Charlotte's landline number, unaware the call has been diverted to a mobile phone The security reset is processed despite the caller answering a security question incorrectly. The caller then requests that more than Â£4,300 should be transferred to another account and the bank allows the transfer During the same 23-minute call, the caller requests a second transfer of a similar amount is made to a different account. This time security questions are flagged as being answered incorrectly and the transfer is denied, but the bank does not ask for the original transfer to be recalled The bank maintained that because it had called Charlotte's home phone number to verify her identity, it was clear she was aware of the transactions. Following an investigation by Devon and Cornwall Police, it was discovered that the fraudster had made a call to Charlotte's landline provider to fraudulently divert the number to a mobile phone number in a different part of the UK The FOS warned banks earlier this yearthat customers should not automatically be blamed for money lost through scams. It added that fraudsters' growing sophistication meant it was wrong to assume losses were because of customer carelessness. The FOS aims to resolve issues for customers relating to financial services including bank accounts, insurance, loans, credit and debit cards and investments. Last year, it was contacted by more than two million people. A FOS spokesperson said: ""We have made it clear to the banks that it's not fair to automatically blame a customer when they've lost money due to a scam, especially given the sophisticated way criminals exploit banks' security systems. ""When we look at complaints, we have to carefully weigh up the evidence provided by both parties to decide what we think is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. ""We're pleased that Charlotte's complaint has now been resolved, and she's got her money back. If you've been the victim of a scam, and you feel your bank should have done more to help, please get in touch with us."" After being contacted by Watchdog Live, an RBS spokesperson said: ""We would like to apologise to Mrs Higman that the service provided fell short of the high standards we expect. ""On review of Mrs Higman's case, and in light of new information provided to us, we have refunded Mrs Higman in full for her loss.""
