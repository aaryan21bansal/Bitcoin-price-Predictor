"This video can not be played Greek police fire tear gas at migrants Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says 18,000 migrants have crossed Turkish borders into Europe after the country ""opened the doors"" for them to travel. The number is expected to hit 25,000 to 30,000 in the coming days, he said. Turkey could no longer deal with the amount of people fleeing Syria's civil war, he added. Greece says it has blocked thousands of migrants from entering ""illegally"" from Turkey. Greek authorities fired tear gas to attempt to disperse the crowds. Turkey's decision followed a deadly attack on Turkish troops by Syrian government forces in northern Syria this week. At least 33 Turkish soldiers were killed in a bombardment in Idlib, the last Syrian province where Syrian rebel groups hold significant territory. Turkey continued retaliatory strikes on Saturday, killing 26 Syrian government troops with drone strikes, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group. Syria, supported by Russia, has been trying to retake Idlib from jihadist groups and Turkish-backed rebel factions. Turkey lets refugees exit towards Europe Brutal endgame in Idlib risks spilling over Why does the battle for Idlib matter? Turkey is hosting 3.7 million Syrian refugees, as well as migrants from other countries such as Afghanistan - but had previously stopped them from leaving for Europe under an aid-linked deal with the EU. But Mr Erdogan accused the EU of breaking promises. Turkey says up to 30,000 could cross into the EU in the coming days ""We said months ago that if it goes on like this, we will have to open the doors. They did not believe us, but we opened the doors yesterday,"" President Erdogan said in Istanbul on Saturday. He said that some 18,000 refugees had ""pressed on the gates and crossed"" into Europe by Saturday morning. He did not provide evidence of these numbers. ""We will not close these doors in the coming period and this will continue. Why? The European Union needs to keep its promises. We don't have to take care of this many refugees, to feed them,"" he said. Brussels had not given full financial aid agreed in the 2018 Turkey-EU refugee deal, he said. Greece says it stopped 4,000 attempts to enter its border Greece said it had averted more than 4,000 attempts to cross into the country. There were further clashes between migrants and Greek police on Saturday. ""The government will do whatever it takes to protect its borders,"" government spokesman Stelios Petsas told reporters. The Turkish president also said that he had asked Russian President Vladimir Putin - a close ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad - to stand aside and let Turkey ""do what is necessary"" with the Syrian government by itself. Russia and Turkey are backing opposing sides in the civil war. Turkey is opposed to the government of Bashar al-Assad and supports some rebel groups.

"The World Health Organization has raised its global risk assessment to the highest level Three more people from England have tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of UK cases to 23. Two of the patients had recently returned from Italy, while the other had come back from Asia, chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said. The cases are from Gloucestershire, Hertfordshire and Berkshire. An infant school in Berkshire has issued a statement saying one of its members of staff had tested positive for the virus. Willowbank Infant School, in Woodley,tweeted:,external""We understand that this will worry many of you, and can reassure you that we have taken advice from Public Health England. It added: ""The school will be shut for some days to allow for a deep clean and to ensure that the risks of infection remain low."" How is the UK getting ready for coronavirus? How deadly is the coronavirus? 'I've been waiting four days for NHS 111 to call' It comes as health officials try to discover howa man from Surrey caught the virus,after he became the first person to be infected within the UK. The man, who is being treated at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital in central London, had not been abroad recently - unlike the other cases in the UK. Officials are trying to trace people who had contact with him. Haslemere Health Centre, which he had attended, has now reopened after ""deep cleaning"". A pub in Haslemere, called the Prince of Wales, also closed for a deep clean as ""a precautionary measure"". A sign outside the pub said that ""a customer who visited us has tested positive for coronavirus"". Ten more cases of the virus in the UK in just over two days might raise eyebrows, but health officials say all but one can be easily explained because the patients have travelled from the most affected countries, including Northern Italy and Iran. Since the first UK cases were confirmed in York - two Chinese nationals - positive tests have been recorded in the south of England, Derbyshire, south Wales and Northern Ireland. Of potential concern is the case in Surrey, a man who had not travelled abroad. Public health officials are tracing his contacts to see if his infection can be explained by another individual who has arrived in the UK from abroad. The government is next week expected to publish emergency legislation to help tackle the virus. The package of measures would be designed to help the public sector - such as the NHS and schools - cope with a serious rise in cases. There are few details about what the measures could involve - but school class sizes in England is one area which would be addressed. They would be permitted to rise above statutory limits, in the event of widespread teacher absences. Health minister Edward Argar told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""any responsible government"" would have ""contingency planning"" in place, but added the government was ""entirely focused on making containment work"". He said the contingency plans ""are not needed at the moment"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said the virus outbreak was now a top priority, will chair a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee on Monday. He had faced criticism from Labour, who said he needed to ""get a grip"" on the situation and questioned why he was waiting until next week to hold the meeting. Downing Street said the prime minister had spoken to Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Prof Whitty, the chief medical officer, on Saturday and was receiving regular updates. ""Everything possible is being done to limit the spread and make sure government departments and public services are prepared,"" Downing Street added. Haslemere Health Centre in Surrey closed temporarily for cleaning on Friday As of 09:00 GMT on Saturday, more than 10,000 people in the UK had been tested for coronavirus. In other recent developments: The Foreign Office has called on Iran to ""immediately allow"" health officials to examine Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - a British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said he suspected she had the virus but said prison staff were refusing to test her Meanwhile, conspiracy theories and false medical adviceare becoming a problem in Iran- the country has seen more fatalities than anywhere else outside China The Republic of Ireland hasconfirmed its first case.Health officials said the man, from the eastern part of the country, was associated with travel from an affected area in northern Italy People who had been in close contact with the first person to test positive for the virus in Northern Ireland have all been notified,officials say ""Drive-through"" test centres for the virus haveopened in AntrimandEdinburgh Fear of the viruswiped Â£200bn off UK firms' valueas London's FTSE 100 share index saw one of its worst weeks since the 2008 financial crisis Online supermarket Ocado has seen a spike in demand.

This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Best advice is to wash our hands properly Of the case in Surrey, the Department of Health said the virus was passed on in the UK but the original source was ""unclear"" and there was no ""immediately identifiable link"" to overseas travel. Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from King's College London, told the Today programme it was ""alarming"" because it becomes more difficult to contain the virus when it is not clear who patients have been infected by. But she added the government's ""worst case scenario"" planning should not be a source of concern. ""It's important that we all prepare for the worst but that we don't necessarily panic and assume the worst,"" she said.

He is one of a group of Italian holidaymakers from which the first four cases at the Costa Adeje Palace emerged. Those cases led the hotel togo into lockdown earlier this week. At least six British guests are among 53 guests to have left the hotel after days of isolation. The guests were considered ""low risk"" because they arrived after infected people had left the hotel. Some 700 guests were confined to the Costa Adeje Palace in Tenerife after four Italian guests tested positive for the virus The BBC's Fiona Trott said some of the other Britons at the hotel have received a letter from the Foreign Office telling them they will be tested for Covid-19. The letter added British travellers at the hotel were assessed to be low risk, following a visit by Public Health England.

"University leaders say the value of higher education should be measured in more than just earning power Higher pay still makes it financially beneficial to go to university for most students in England, saysresearch from the Institute for Fiscal Studies,external. But 20% are worse off after paying for courses, says the study commissioned by the Department for Education. Over their working lives, male graduates on average gain by Â£130,000 and female graduates by Â£100,000. Universities Minister Michelle Donelan says students and taxpayers needed to get value from their ""investment"". The government has promised to tackle ""low quality"" courses. But university leaders say there can be other forms of social and personal ""value"" from higher education, as well as measurements of graduate earnings. Value for money review of university subjects University tuition fees should be cut to Â£7,500, says review Universities warned on 'low value' courses The study on projected earnings, based on tax data, shows wide variations in the financial winners and losers between different subjects. For women, the financial gains of studying creative arts and languages are ""close to zero"" Medicine will bring an extra Â£340,000 for women, economics Â£270,000 and Â£260,000 for law Men studying creative arts subjects are projected to lose Â£100,000, compared to their counterparts who did not go to university For men in the top-earning subject areas of medicine and economics, the likely gain is Â£500,000 For both men and women there are low financial returns for graduates in English and biology Individual universities are not identified, but more selective universities tend to lead to bigger earnings These gains and losses are counted after the cost of going to university has been deducted. This includes Â£9,250 per year in tuition fees, loans for living costs, interest charged on loans and lost potential earnings from studying rather than being in jobs. The average student graduates with about Â£50,000 in debt. More women go to university than men - and a higher proportion of women, 85%, compared with 75% of men, will get a positive financial return. But female graduates have lower lifetime earnings, which the analysis says is likely to reflect women taking time off or reducing hours when they have children. The gender gap in earnings opens when graduates are in their 30s - although the data does not distinguish between part-time and full-time work so part-time could look like lower pay. The study will raise questions about which subjects should be funded But for 70,000 students each year the costs of going to university - such as fees, loans and lost earnings while they studied - will be greater than any extra money they make in earnings, so they make less than their counterparts who went to work straight after A-levels. Ben Waltmann, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the public finances gained on average from higher education, ""because high-earning graduates go on to pay an awful lot of tax"". That still meant that government finances had to subsidise almost half of individual graduates - with the biggest losses concentrated in subjects such as creative arts. There have been suggestions that funding could be restricted for degrees offering poor value to students. And these findings are published as the government prepares its response to Philip Augar's review of student finance. Graduates with economics degrees are among the highest earners This recommended that tuition fees should be cut to Â£7,500 and that students needed better value for money. The higher education watchdog, the Office for Students, is also carrying out a review into how funding grants should be prioritised between different subjects. But the UCU lecturers' union has warned against making simplistic links between the quality of a course and future salaries. ""Earnings potential is also heavily impacted by factors such as an individual's background, their parents' jobs, their gender, where they are from and where they live after graduating,"" says union leader Jo Grady. And she said decisions about the value of courses needed to reflect ""the wider benefits that education brings to individuals and to society"". Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students, said it was crucial that university applicants had ""clear and factual information"" and ""data on earnings potential is an important part of that picture"". Others argued that apprenticeships were better value. ""This analysis is fresh evidence of how the current university model is broken,"" said Euan Blair, co-founder of apprenticeship provider WhiteHat. ""Young people are being pressured to go to university without any consideration given to whether the experience will be positive or if they'll be equipped to pursue the career they want,"" he said. But even when earnings might be relatively low, graduates might be working in sectors making ""vital contributions to the wider economy and society"", said Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK. He said it was important to recognise that the ""benefits of a degree stretch far beyond salary outcomes"". Universities Minister Michelle Donelan also highlighted the ""unquantifiable experiences and friendships"" of university. But she said the reputation of the university sector depended on ""quality"" and that had to be safeguarded so that ""students and the taxpayer are getting the value they would expect for their investment"".

"Protective masks are selling fast in parts of California Officials on the US West Coast have reported three unexplained coronavirus cases, raising concerns the virus could be spreading within the community. The patients - in California, Oregon and Washington State - have no known connection to a badly hit country.

"A respiratory infection originating in China and known as the ""new coronavirus"" is now spreading faster outside the country than inside. More than 80 countries have been affected, including the UK. With further infections now likely, here are five graphics and the latest practical advice on what to do - based on information from the World Health Organization, Public Health England and the UK National Health Service (NHS). It is not yet known exactly how coronavirus spreads from person to person. However, similar viruses are spread via respiratory droplets, such as those produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Therefore, there are things you can do to minimise your risk of catching it. The NHS advises you, among other things, to wash your hands regularly, cover your mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean. You only need to stay away from public places if advised to by the NHS's specialist 111online coronavirus service,externalor by a medical professional. There is currently no evidence that you can catch coronavirus from parcels and letters or from food. Viruses like coronavirus cannot live for very long outside the body. NHS advice,external How to wash your hands thoroughly In the UK, the country's chief medical officers have raised the public risk level from low to moderate. But, the NHS says,the risk to individuals remains low.,external However, there are some countries and areas where there's a higher chance of coming into contact with someone with coronavirus. Therefore, there isextra advice for UK travellers,external, including those who have returned from affected areas, including China, Italy and Iran. But even if you do get it, you are likely to experience mild symptoms and recover. Scientists currently think the proportion of people dying from the disease is low (between 1% and 2%) and evidence suggests those who have died were elderly or had pre-existing conditions. But with the virus in its early stages, and many milder cases not yet counted, the figures are still unreliable. What are the chances of dying from coronavirus? How close are we to a pandemic? Government foreign travel advice,external The new coronavirus -  often referred to as Covid-19 - seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. But these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. The symptoms are similar to other viruses that are much more common, such as colds and flu. In more severe cases of Covid-19, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) are more likely to become severely ill. What are the symptoms? If there's a chance you could have coronavirus, you are advised not to go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. Instead, the NHS says you should contact its dedicated 111online coronavirus service,external, operating in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of Wales, which can tell you if you need medical help and advise you what to do next. You should contact the NHS 111 service if: You think you might have the virus You've been toCambodia, China, Hong Kong,northernItaly, Iran, Japan, Laos, Macau, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, ThailandorVietnamin the past 14 days You've been in close contact with someone with coronavirus As a result, you may be asked to stay away from other people (self-isolate). You may also be passed onto your local health protection team for testing. NHS 111 online coronavirus service,external Northern Ireland coronavirus advice,external You only need to be tested for coronavirus if you have been tocertain affected areas within a certain time period,externalor you have been in close contact with someone with confirmed coronavirus. But if health professionals think you could have coronavirus, you will be put in touch with your local health protection team and directed to a testing location. Here, health professionals will take some samples. This may include: Mucus from your nose, throat or lungs Blood Faeces Coronavirus pod at The John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford Samples will then be sent to specialist testing laboratories. Results may be available on the same working day. While you await your test results, you may be asked to stay at home andfollow advice for ""self-isolation"",external.

This means you should: Stay at home Not go to work, school or public areas Not use public transport like buses, trains, tubes or taxis Avoid visitors to your home Ask friends, family members or delivery services to carry out errands for you - such as getting groceries, medication or other shopping You should make sure any items delivered are left outside, or in the porch, or as appropriate for your home. If you live with other people, you may have to takeextra measures to reduce the chances of onward infection,,externalsuch as staying in a separate room and regularly cleaning shared kitchens and bathrooms.

"The World Health Organization has raised its global risk assessment to the highest level Three more people from England have tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of UK cases to 23. Two of the patients had recently returned from Italy, while the other had come back from Asia, chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said. The cases are from Gloucestershire, Hertfordshire and Berkshire. An infant school in Berkshire has issued a statement saying one of its members of staff had tested positive for the virus. Willowbank Infant School, in Woodley,tweeted:,external""We understand that this will worry many of you, and can reassure you that we have taken advice from Public Health England. It added: ""The school will be shut for some days to allow for a deep clean and to ensure that the risks of infection remain low."" How is the UK getting ready for coronavirus? How deadly is the coronavirus? 'I've been waiting four days for NHS 111 to call' It comes as health officials try to discover howa man from Surrey caught the virus,after he became the first person to be infected within the UK. The man, who is being treated at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital in central London, had not been abroad recently - unlike the other cases in the UK. Officials are trying to trace people who had contact with him. Haslemere Health Centre, which he had attended, has now reopened after ""deep cleaning"". A pub in Haslemere, called the Prince of Wales, also closed for a deep clean as ""a precautionary measure"". A sign outside the pub said that ""a customer who visited us has tested positive for coronavirus"". Ten more cases of the virus in the UK in just over two days might raise eyebrows, but health officials say all but one can be easily explained because the patients have travelled from the most affected countries, including Northern Italy and Iran. Since the first UK cases were confirmed in York - two Chinese nationals - positive tests have been recorded in the south of England, Derbyshire, south Wales and Northern Ireland. Of potential concern is the case in Surrey, a man who had not travelled abroad. Public health officials are tracing his contacts to see if his infection can be explained by another individual who has arrived in the UK from abroad. The government is next week expected to publish emergency legislation to help tackle the virus. The package of measures would be designed to help the public sector - such as the NHS and schools - cope with a serious rise in cases. There are few details about what the measures could involve - but school class sizes in England is one area which would be addressed. They would be permitted to rise above statutory limits, in the event of widespread teacher absences. Health minister Edward Argar told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""any responsible government"" would have ""contingency planning"" in place, but added the government was ""entirely focused on making containment work"". He said the contingency plans ""are not needed at the moment"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said the virus outbreak was now a top priority, will chair a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee on Monday. He had faced criticism from Labour, who said he needed to ""get a grip"" on the situation and questioned why he was waiting until next week to hold the meeting. Downing Street said the prime minister had spoken to Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Prof Whitty, the chief medical officer, on Saturday and was receiving regular updates. ""Everything possible is being done to limit the spread and make sure government departments and public services are prepared,"" Downing Street added. Haslemere Health Centre in Surrey closed temporarily for cleaning on Friday As of 09:00 GMT on Saturday, more than 10,000 people in the UK had been tested for coronavirus. In other recent developments: The Foreign Office has called on Iran to ""immediately allow"" health officials to examine Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - a British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said he suspected she had the virus but said prison staff were refusing to test her Meanwhile, conspiracy theories and false medical adviceare becoming a problem in Iran- the country has seen more fatalities than anywhere else outside China The Republic of Ireland hasconfirmed its first case.Health officials said the man, from the eastern part of the country, was associated with travel from an affected area in northern Italy People who had been in close contact with the first person to test positive for the virus in Northern Ireland have all been notified,officials say ""Drive-through"" test centres for the virus haveopened in AntrimandEdinburgh Fear of the viruswiped Â£200bn off UK firms' valueas London's FTSE 100 share index saw one of its worst weeks since the 2008 financial crisis Online supermarket Ocado has seen a spike in demand.

Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from King's College London, told the Today programme it was ""alarming"" because it becomes more difficult to contain the virus when it is not clear who patients have been infected by. But she added the government's ""worst case scenario"" planning should not be a source of concern.

At least six British guests are among 53 guests to have left the hotel after days of isolation. The guests were considered ""low risk"" because they arrived after infected people had left the hotel. Some 700 guests were confined to the Costa Adeje Palace in Tenerife after four Italian guests tested positive for the virus The BBC's Fiona Trott said some of the other Britons at the hotel have received a letter from the Foreign Office telling them they will be tested for Covid-19.

"This video can not be played Greek police fire tear gas at migrants Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says 18,000 migrants have crossed Turkish borders into Europe after the country ""opened the doors"" for them to travel. The number is expected to hit 25,000 to 30,000 in the coming days, he said. Turkey could no longer deal with the amount of people fleeing Syria's civil war, he added. Greece says it has blocked thousands of migrants from entering ""illegally"" from Turkey. Greek authorities fired tear gas to attempt to disperse the crowds. Turkey's decision followed a deadly attack on Turkish troops by Syrian government forces in northern Syria this week. At least 33 Turkish soldiers were killed in a bombardment in Idlib, the last Syrian province where Syrian rebel groups hold significant territory. Turkey continued retaliatory strikes on Saturday, killing 26 Syrian government troops with drone strikes, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group. Syria, supported by Russia, has been trying to retake Idlib from jihadist groups and Turkish-backed rebel factions. Turkey lets refugees exit towards Europe Brutal endgame in Idlib risks spilling over Why does the battle for Idlib matter? Turkey is hosting 3.7 million Syrian refugees, as well as migrants from other countries such as Afghanistan - but had previously stopped them from leaving for Europe under an aid-linked deal with the EU. But Mr Erdogan accused the EU of breaking promises. Turkey says up to 30,000 could cross into the EU in the coming days ""We said months ago that if it goes on like this, we will have to open the doors. They did not believe us, but we opened the doors yesterday,"" President Erdogan said in Istanbul on Saturday. He said that some 18,000 refugees had ""pressed on the gates and crossed"" into Europe by Saturday morning. He did not provide evidence of these numbers. ""We will not close these doors in the coming period and this will continue. Why? The European Union needs to keep its promises. We don't have to take care of this many refugees, to feed them,"" he said. Brussels had not given full financial aid agreed in the 2018 Turkey-EU refugee deal, he said. Greece says it stopped 4,000 attempts to enter its border Greece said it had averted more than 4,000 attempts to cross into the country. There were further clashes between migrants and Greek police on Saturday. ""The government will do whatever it takes to protect its borders,"" government spokesman Stelios Petsas told reporters. The Turkish president also said that he had asked Russian President Vladimir Putin - a close ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad - to stand aside and let Turkey ""do what is necessary"" with the Syrian government by itself. Russia and Turkey are backing opposing sides in the civil war. Turkey is opposed to the government of Bashar al-Assad and supports some rebel groups.

"A lack of male role models is a key factor behind the increase in knife crime and gang violence, a senior police officer has suggested. Bedfordshire Assistant Chief Constable Jackie Sebire said some young people who do not have the ""protective factor"" of a father figure instead look up to drug dealers and gangsters. She said it was ""too easy"" to blame police cuts, social media and drugs. The government said early intervention projects were a focus of its efforts. ACC Sebire, who leads on serious violence for the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), said an absence of father figures affects children in affluent areas as well as those from disadvantaged backgrounds. ""We don't talk enough"" about the issue, she added. What is knife crime like in your area? The key facts about rising knife crime Knife possession offences reach record high A report published last year estimated thatabout 27,000 children in England considered themselves to be in a gang. ACC Sebire is a former Scotland Yard detective with more 25 years' experience However, a much lower figure of 6,560 children were actually known by youth offending teams or children's services to be involved in gangs. Sheldon Thomas, founder of Gangsline, which provides support to young people involved or at risk of gang activity, said ""bad parenting, absent fathers and bad male role models"" are among the biggest problems when tackling gang violence. This video can not be played Michael Carver is the Lead Nurse for Violence Reduction at The Royal London Hospital. Mr Thomas, who speaks of his own experience as a gang member in the 1970s, said that if parents do not spend time with their children, then their child ""is more likely to end up down the wrong road"". ACC Sebire said: ""Where you do have positive male role models, they are potentially the drug dealers, or the exploiters or the organised criminal networks - they become the positive male role model."" The ""worst thing"", she said, was when both parents refused to attend a police station after their children had been arrested. ""That's for me, one of the saddest things that I see... because actually they [the parents] can't be bothered."" But speaking to reporters at the NPCC conference in Westminster this week, ACC Sebire acknowledged a number of factors contributed to the problem of knife crime. In 2018 the Home Office said drugs, and in particular a surge in the supply of cocaine, was the main ""driver"" behind the rise in serious violence. Other possible factors were said to be the growth of social media and an increase in school exclusions and children in care. But there were only two passing references to ""role models"" in the department's 114-page strategy document and no mention of how the absence of such father figures might lead young people down the path towards drug dealing and violent crime. Discussions about ways to reduce violent crime have also tended to focus on other issues, such as resources, stop-and-search powers and sentencing. It has been left largely to youth workers, mentors and former gang members to highlight the importance of positive role models, which is why the comments of Jackie Sebire, a former Scotland Yard detective with over 25 years' experience in policing, are so significant. Patrick Green, chief executive officer of anti-knife charity the Ben Kinsella Trust, said ACC Sebire was  ""absolutely right"" to cite the role of positive male models. ""When this is absent, young boys tend to be more vulnerable to negative influences."" However, he added there is ""no single answer"" and stressed the need for other root causes such as poverty, deprivation and inequality to be tackled. A government spokesperson highlighted plans to recruit extra police officers over the next three years and initiatives to tackle the root causes of serious violence. They added: ""We recognise the role trusted role models have to play and to steer young people away from crime and to stop young people being exploited by gangs, we are investing heavily in community-based early intervention projects.""

"University leaders say the value of higher education should be measured in more than just earning power Higher pay still makes it financially beneficial to go to university for most students in England, saysresearch from the Institute for Fiscal Studies,external. But 20% are worse off after paying for courses, says the study commissioned by the Department for Education. Over their working lives, male graduates on average gain by Â£130,000 and female graduates by Â£100,000. Universities Minister Michelle Donelan says students and taxpayers needed to get value from their ""investment"". The government has promised to tackle ""low quality"" courses. But university leaders say there can be other forms of social and personal ""value"" from higher education, as well as measurements of graduate earnings. Value for money review of university subjects University tuition fees should be cut to Â£7,500, says review Universities warned on 'low value' courses The study on projected earnings, based on tax data, shows wide variations in the financial winners and losers between different subjects.

This includes Â£9,250 per year in tuition fees, loans for living costs, interest charged on loans and lost potential earnings from studying rather than being in jobs. The average student graduates with about Â£50,000 in debt. More women go to university than men - and a higher proportion of women, 85%, compared with 75% of men, will get a positive financial return. But female graduates have lower lifetime earnings, which the analysis says is likely to reflect women taking time off or reducing hours when they have children. The gender gap in earnings opens when graduates are in their 30s - although the data does not distinguish between part-time and full-time work so part-time could look like lower pay. The study will raise questions about which subjects should be funded But for 70,000 students each year the costs of going to university - such as fees, loans and lost earnings while they studied - will be greater than any extra money they make in earnings, so they make less than their counterparts who went to work straight after A-levels. Ben Waltmann, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the public finances gained on average from higher education, ""because high-earning graduates go on to pay an awful lot of tax"". That still meant that government finances had to subsidise almost half of individual graduates - with the biggest losses concentrated in subjects such as creative arts. There have been suggestions that funding could be restricted for degrees offering poor value to students. And these findings are published as the government prepares its response to Philip Augar's review of student finance. Graduates with economics degrees are among the highest earners This recommended that tuition fees should be cut to Â£7,500 and that students needed better value for money. The higher education watchdog, the Office for Students, is also carrying out a review into how funding grants should be prioritised between different subjects. But the UCU lecturers' union has warned against making simplistic links between the quality of a course and future salaries. ""Earnings potential is also heavily impacted by factors such as an individual's background, their parents' jobs, their gender, where they are from and where they live after graduating,"" says union leader Jo Grady. And she said decisions about the value of courses needed to reflect ""the wider benefits that education brings to individuals and to society"". Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students, said it was crucial that university applicants had ""clear and factual information"" and ""data on earnings potential is an important part of that picture"". Others argued that apprenticeships were better value. ""This analysis is fresh evidence of how the current university model is broken,"" said Euan Blair, co-founder of apprenticeship provider WhiteHat. ""Young people are being pressured to go to university without any consideration given to whether the experience will be positive or if they'll be equipped to pursue the career they want,"" he said. But even when earnings might be relatively low, graduates might be working in sectors making ""vital contributions to the wider economy and society"", said Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK.

"Priti Patel told a crime conference she would be ""unapologetic"" about holding police to account There must be ""no excuses"" for not cutting crime, Home Secretary Priti Patel has told senior police officers. Speaking at a conference in central London, Ms Patel signalled the return of national targets, saying ""outcomes"" in key areas would be measured. The home secretary added she would be ""unapologetic"" about holding police to account. It came as ministers continued to dismiss allegations of bullying in the Home Office. 'More than 50,000 new police officers needed' Recruitment of 20,000 police to begin 'in weeks' Have police numbers dropped? Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to recruit 20,000 new police officers in England and Wales within three years - almost reversing the reduction in numbers since the Conservatives came to power in 2010. Speaking at the the National Police Chiefs' Council and Association of Police and Crime Commissioners summit in Westminster, Ms Patel said she expected people to be able to see a difference when the new officers were in post, such as less crime and safer streets. She said success would be measured against a set of national policing outcomes, with priorities including reducing murders, serious violence and neighbourhood crime. Ms Patel said she was ""unequivocal"" in her support for officers, but added: ""We need to pull out all the stops to deliver the decline in crime that people want to see. There must be no weak spots. ""These outcomes will be non-negotiable and I will be unapologetic about holding you to account."" Priti Patel's message to the police was blunt: we're investing in you, now you must deliver. This will have come as little surprise to the chief constables gathered at the conference - a government which has made law and order a priority expects results. But the means by which ministers will gauge success - national ""outcomes"", or targets in all but name - are likely to cause concern. The last time national crime indicators were brought in, under Tony Blair's Labour administration, they had a series of unintended consequences, as certain serious offences, which were not being measured, weren't given the attention they should have been. The three-year deadline for reductions in crime set by the home secretary is also hugely ambitious. But the clear goal she has set is likely to be welcomed by the public, which, as she acknowledged in her speech, has lost confidence in the criminal justice system. Ms Patel's speech came as ministers continued todismiss allegations of bullying in the Home Officeafter claims she clashed with senior officials, belittled colleagues and is distrusted by intelligence chiefs. Ms Patel and permanent secretary Sir Philip Rutnam released a joint statement denying reports of a deep rift at the top of the department, while allies described her as a ""demanding"" boss but not a bully. Earlier, police minister Kit Malthouse insisted there was ""glutinous harmony"" in the department and he had not witnessed bullying by his boss. The reports of feuding prompted the head of the Civil Service, Sir Mark Sedwill, to order an end to media leaks in a missive to government staff. Ministers have continued to dismiss allegations Ms Patel bullied her staff Also in her speech, Ms Patel announced Â£41.5m of funding for forces in 18 areas worst affected by serious violence, and launched an eight-week consultation on plans to enshrine a police covenant in law. The plan, first mooted in the Conservative Party's general election manifesto, pledges to back the rights of serving or ex-police officers, staff and their families, recognise the responsibility and risks officers take, and introduce a code of ethics. The Police Federation of England and Wales welcomed the plans. National chairman John Apter said: ""Policing is a dangerous and unpredictable job and it's essential that there is something in place that ensures that police officers, staff, retired colleagues and their families receive the support they deserve. ""This consultation is an opportunity to help shape what a police covenant will look like. This is something I feel extremely passionate about and it's great to see this taking a step closer to becoming a reality.""

"The World Health Organization has raised its global risk assessment to the highest level Three more people from England have tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of UK cases to 23. Two of the patients had recently returned from Italy, while the other had come back from Asia, chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said. The cases are from Gloucestershire, Hertfordshire and Berkshire. An infant school in Berkshire has issued a statement saying one of its members of staff had tested positive for the virus. Willowbank Infant School, in Woodley,tweeted:,external""We understand that this will worry many of you, and can reassure you that we have taken advice from Public Health England. It added: ""The school will be shut for some days to allow for a deep clean and to ensure that the risks of infection remain low."" How is the UK getting ready for coronavirus? How deadly is the coronavirus? 'I've been waiting four days for NHS 111 to call' It comes as health officials try to discover howa man from Surrey caught the virus,after he became the first person to be infected within the UK. The man, who is being treated at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital in central London, had not been abroad recently - unlike the other cases in the UK. Officials are trying to trace people who had contact with him. Haslemere Health Centre, which he had attended, has now reopened after ""deep cleaning"". A pub in Haslemere, called the Prince of Wales, also closed for a deep clean as ""a precautionary measure"". A sign outside the pub said that ""a customer who visited us has tested positive for coronavirus"". Ten more cases of the virus in the UK in just over two days might raise eyebrows, but health officials say all but one can be easily explained because the patients have travelled from the most affected countries, including Northern Italy and Iran. Since the first UK cases were confirmed in York - two Chinese nationals - positive tests have been recorded in the south of England, Derbyshire, south Wales and Northern Ireland. Of potential concern is the case in Surrey, a man who had not travelled abroad. Public health officials are tracing his contacts to see if his infection can be explained by another individual who has arrived in the UK from abroad. The government is next week expected to publish emergency legislation to help tackle the virus. The package of measures would be designed to help the public sector - such as the NHS and schools - cope with a serious rise in cases. There are few details about what the measures could involve - but school class sizes in England is one area which would be addressed. They would be permitted to rise above statutory limits, in the event of widespread teacher absences. Health minister Edward Argar told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""any responsible government"" would have ""contingency planning"" in place, but added the government was ""entirely focused on making containment work"". He said the contingency plans ""are not needed at the moment"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said the virus outbreak was now a top priority, will chair a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee on Monday. He had faced criticism from Labour, who said he needed to ""get a grip"" on the situation and questioned why he was waiting until next week to hold the meeting. Downing Street said the prime minister had spoken to Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Prof Whitty, the chief medical officer, on Saturday and was receiving regular updates. ""Everything possible is being done to limit the spread and make sure government departments and public services are prepared,"" Downing Street added. Haslemere Health Centre in Surrey closed temporarily for cleaning on Friday As of 09:00 GMT on Saturday, more than 10,000 people in the UK had been tested for coronavirus. In other recent developments: The Foreign Office has called on Iran to ""immediately allow"" health officials to examine Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - a British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said he suspected she had the virus but said prison staff were refusing to test her Meanwhile, conspiracy theories and false medical adviceare becoming a problem in Iran- the country has seen more fatalities than anywhere else outside China The Republic of Ireland hasconfirmed its first case.Health officials said the man, from the eastern part of the country, was associated with travel from an affected area in northern Italy People who had been in close contact with the first person to test positive for the virus in Northern Ireland have all been notified,officials say ""Drive-through"" test centres for the virus haveopened in AntrimandEdinburgh Fear of the viruswiped Â£200bn off UK firms' valueas London's FTSE 100 share index saw one of its worst weeks since the 2008 financial crisis Online supermarket Ocado has seen a spike in demand.

Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from King's College London, told the Today programme it was ""alarming"" because it becomes more difficult to contain the virus when it is not clear who patients have been infected by. But she added the government's ""worst case scenario"" planning should not be a source of concern.

He is one of a group of Italian holidaymakers from which the first four cases at the Costa Adeje Palace emerged. Those cases led the hotel togo into lockdown earlier this week. At least six British guests are among 53 guests to have left the hotel after days of isolation. The guests were considered ""low risk"" because they arrived after infected people had left the hotel. Some 700 guests were confined to the Costa Adeje Palace in Tenerife after four Italian guests tested positive for the virus The BBC's Fiona Trott said some of the other Britons at the hotel have received a letter from the Foreign Office telling them they will be tested for Covid-19. The letter added British travellers at the hotel were assessed to be low risk, following a visit by Public Health England.

"Protective masks are selling fast in parts of California Officials on the US West Coast have reported three unexplained coronavirus cases, raising concerns the virus could be spreading within the community. The patients - in California, Oregon and Washington State - have no known connection to a badly hit country. A total of 59 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the US, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Meanwhile South Korea, which has the highest number of cases outside China, mobilised the army on Saturday. Soldiers are disinfecting large parts of Daegu, the south-eastern city that has been at the centre of the country's coronavirus outbreak. South Korea on Saturday reported a sharp rise in the number of cases of the Covid-19 disease. It now stands at 3,150. The respiratory illness has killed 17 people in the country so far. How deadly is the coronavirus? A visual guide to the outbreak How worried should we be? On Friday health officials in California's Santa Clara County said an older woman with chronic health conditions had been diagnosed with Covid-19. Officials say she is not known to have travelled to a country badly affected by the virus or been in contact with a person who had. ""This new case indicates that there is evidence of community transmission but the extent is still not clear,"" said Dr Sara Cody, director of the Santa Clara County Public Health Department.

"One in five of the top 350 UK companies have been warned about the lack of gender diversity at senior levels. A government-backed review has written to 63 firms asking them how they plan to improve gender balance. The Hampton-Alexander Review,externalwants a third of board-level and leadership positions at the UK's top firms to be filled by women by the end of the year. Figures show many are nowhere near the target - although the 100 top companies have passed one of the benchmarks. The review was set up in 2016 by the former chair of RBS Sir Philip Hampton and the late CBI president Dame Helen Alexander. It monitors the progress of women in leadership across FTSE 350 firms - the companies which make up the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 stock market indexes. Earlier this month,figures showed many companies had made good progresstowards the review's target with women now holding one in three board positions at FTSE 100 firms. But the review has singled out 24 FTSE 250 companies which only have one woman on their board and 35 FTSE 350 firms which have all-male executive committees. Another four FTSE 250 companies failed to meet both targets - they had an all-male executive committee and only one woman on the board. 'All the good women have been snapped up' 'People of colour seem to be superglued to the floor' Of the firms warned that they had all-male executive committees, four of them were FTSE 100 firms: Ashtead Group Plc; Fresnillo Plc; Melrose Industries Plc; and Spirax-Sarco Engineering Plc. The review worked alongside the Investment Association which represents major pension funds managing Â£8tn. ""Diversity results in better decision-making and plays an essential role in a company's long-term success,"" said Chris Cummings, CEO of the Investment Association. The review's chief executive, Denise Wilson, said: ""Despite moving in the right direction, too many companies are not making progress quickly enough. ""If every FTSE 350 company achieved at least 33% women's representation on their board and in senior leadership by the end of 2020, this would be a major milestone. ""Increasing the representation of women in leadership and ensuring diversity in the widest sense, is a fundamental foundation to building a truly inclusive culture - where everyone can thrive."" Since 2011, two government-backed reviews have focused on boosting women's representation on the boards of UK-listed companies. The Davies Review,which ran from 2011 to 2015, increased the proportion of women serving on FTSE 100 boards from 12% to 25%.

At the end of that review,Lord Davies recommended,externala new target of 33% of women board members at FTSE 350 firms by 2020. Its successor, the Hampton-Alexander Review, adopted this target - it wants FTSE 350 companies to meet a 33% target by the end of 2020.

"University leaders say the value of higher education should be measured in more than just earning power Higher pay still makes it financially beneficial to go to university for most students in England, saysresearch from the Institute for Fiscal Studies,external. But 20% are worse off after paying for courses, says the study commissioned by the Department for Education. Over their working lives, male graduates on average gain by Â£130,000 and female graduates by Â£100,000. Universities Minister Michelle Donelan says students and taxpayers needed to get value from their ""investment"". The government has promised to tackle ""low quality"" courses. But university leaders say there can be other forms of social and personal ""value"" from higher education, as well as measurements of graduate earnings. Value for money review of university subjects University tuition fees should be cut to Â£7,500, says review Universities warned on 'low value' courses The study on projected earnings, based on tax data, shows wide variations in the financial winners and losers between different subjects. For women, the financial gains of studying creative arts and languages are ""close to zero"" Medicine will bring an extra Â£340,000 for women, economics Â£270,000 and Â£260,000 for law Men studying creative arts subjects are projected to lose Â£100,000, compared to their counterparts who did not go to university For men in the top-earning subject areas of medicine and economics, the likely gain is Â£500,000 For both men and women there are low financial returns for graduates in English and biology Individual universities are not identified, but more selective universities tend to lead to bigger earnings These gains and losses are counted after the cost of going to university has been deducted. This includes Â£9,250 per year in tuition fees, loans for living costs, interest charged on loans and lost potential earnings from studying rather than being in jobs. The average student graduates with about Â£50,000 in debt. More women go to university than men - and a higher proportion of women, 85%, compared with 75% of men, will get a positive financial return. But female graduates have lower lifetime earnings, which the analysis says is likely to reflect women taking time off or reducing hours when they have children. The gender gap in earnings opens when graduates are in their 30s - although the data does not distinguish between part-time and full-time work so part-time could look like lower pay. The study will raise questions about which subjects should be funded But for 70,000 students each year the costs of going to university - such as fees, loans and lost earnings while they studied - will be greater than any extra money they make in earnings, so they make less than their counterparts who went to work straight after A-levels. Ben Waltmann, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the public finances gained on average from higher education, ""because high-earning graduates go on to pay an awful lot of tax"". That still meant that government finances had to subsidise almost half of individual graduates - with the biggest losses concentrated in subjects such as creative arts. There have been suggestions that funding could be restricted for degrees offering poor value to students. And these findings are published as the government prepares its response to Philip Augar's review of student finance. Graduates with economics degrees are among the highest earners This recommended that tuition fees should be cut to Â£7,500 and that students needed better value for money. The higher education watchdog, the Office for Students, is also carrying out a review into how funding grants should be prioritised between different subjects. But the UCU lecturers' union has warned against making simplistic links between the quality of a course and future salaries. ""Earnings potential is also heavily impacted by factors such as an individual's background, their parents' jobs, their gender, where they are from and where they live after graduating,"" says union leader Jo Grady. And she said decisions about the value of courses needed to reflect ""the wider benefits that education brings to individuals and to society"". Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students, said it was crucial that university applicants had ""clear and factual information"" and ""data on earnings potential is an important part of that picture"". Others argued that apprenticeships were better value. ""This analysis is fresh evidence of how the current university model is broken,"" said Euan Blair, co-founder of apprenticeship provider WhiteHat. ""Young people are being pressured to go to university without any consideration given to whether the experience will be positive or if they'll be equipped to pursue the career they want,"" he said. But even when earnings might be relatively low, graduates might be working in sectors making ""vital contributions to the wider economy and society"", said Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK. He said it was important to recognise that the ""benefits of a degree stretch far beyond salary outcomes"". Universities Minister Michelle Donelan also highlighted the ""unquantifiable experiences and friendships"" of university. But she said the reputation of the university sector depended on ""quality"" and that had to be safeguarded so that ""students and the taxpayer are getting the value they would expect for their investment"".

"The global market for omega-3 supplements has been estimated to be worth around $33bn (Â£25.6bn) Taking omega-3 supplements offers ""little to no"" benefit against cancer, say experts. Consumption of fish oil supplements is promoted as having a wide range of positive impacts on health. These are purported to include lowering the risk of strokes, as well as diseases such as cancer and dementia. But researchers at University of Anglia (UEA) found taking daily supplements will likely have no significant impact on a person's health. The research relates specifically to supplements, rather than omega-3 derived from eating fish, with experts still suggesting the latter is good for the heart, as well as general health. More than 100,000 participants were randomised to either consume more omega-3 fats in supplement form, or maintain their usual intake, for at least a year. Researchers found that if 1000 people took supplements for approximately four years, the actual effects on their health, both positively or negatively, would be minimal at best. Omega-3 is a family of fats that includes: ALA (alpha-linolenic acid) - which the body can't make for itself but is found in vegetable oils, brussels sprouts, nuts and seeds and is good source for those on vegan diets EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) - which the body can make from ALA but are also present in oily fish and fish oils, including cod liver oil They are readily available as over-the-counter supplements The global market for omega-3 supplements was estimated to be worth around $33bn (Â£25.6bn) in 2018,according to the NHS,external. Dr Lee Hooper, from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said that the study - funded by the World Health Organisation (WHO) - adds to mounting evidence that omega-3 supplements are failing to offer consumers the benefits they advertise. ""Our previous research has shown that long-chain omega 3 supplements, including fish oils, do not protect against conditions such as anxiety, depression, stroke, diabetes or death,"" he said. ""In fact, we found that they may very slightly increase cancer risk, particularly for prostate cancer."" More than 80 studies in 2019found no evidence that omega-3 offers health benefits to those with type 2 diabetes. Similar studies have also suggested that supplementsoffer little to no protection against heart disease. With the harmful environmental factors associated with over-fishing, Dr Hooper added that it seems ""unhelpful"" for people to continue taking supplements that give"" little or no benefit"". Dr Hooper added that the environmental damage associated with decreasing fish stocks is not comparative with the minimal health benefits associated with supplements. The NHS says people should try to eat two portions of fish per week, one of which should be oily fish, such as salmon, fresh tuna or mackerel, to get enough ""good"" fats. Some fish contain small amounts of chemicals that may be harmful if eaten in large amounts.

"Animal rescue groups say they are seeing an increasing number of animals abandoned across the country Volunteers in China say they're struggling to keep up with the number of animals being abandoned as the country battles the virus outbreak. More than 2,000 people in China have died and more than 78,000 infections have been reported in the country. Pet owners who fall sick or are caught up in quarantine can't take their animals with them, and despite reassurance from the World Health Organization that animals can't carry the virus, others are being dumped. ""I have rescued lots of dogs this month, most have been abandoned by their owners,"" one volunteer from Furry Angels Heaven in Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, told the BBC. ""One animal's owner has coronavirus and was sent to quarantine. Fortunately a policeman sent her to me."" The volunteer didn't want to reveal her name because of fears of official repercussions. She said she has 35 dogs and 28 cats in her apartment in addition to the animal rescue centre she helps operate. Dogs found abandoned in a box in Wuhan by rescuers from Furry Angels Heaven ""It's a bad situation here. We are not allowed to go outside and I am afraid my dogs and cats will be out of food soon. I am worried if I or my family get infected with the virus then all of the dogs and cats could be killed by policemen."" Without income from its regular paid work at the moment, she fears the animal centre's savings could be used up soon. ""It's expensive to rescue these animals"", she said. As soon as the lockdown is over, the animals will be available for adoption. Coronavirus: Fake news is spreading fast Coronavirus: Chinese workers offered free transport The coronavirus outbreak began in late December, but it worsened as people went away for Chinese New Year in January. Many people went to visit family in other cities, leaving food behind for their pets thinking they would only be away for a few days. But then the lockdown was introduced. More than 60 million people in Hubei province were placed under travel restrictions. People were unable to return to their homes and the food they had left for their pets had started to run out. One volunteer has 35 dogs and 28 cats inside her apartment Panicked pet owners used social media site Weibo to plead for help. ""Help! I live in Ezhou City and my cat is trapped,"" wrote one woman from a town near Wuhan. ""I'm asking a caring person nearby to help me feed the cat. I am willing to pay for it, thank the caring person and everyone else, please share."" The empty streets of Wuhan during the lockdown One volunteer, who gave his name as Lao Mao, is part of a group that provides assistance to people who cannot access their animals. So far his group has helped to rescue more than 1,000 pets. Video footage posted on social media accounts show Lao Mao's team entering properties, feeding animals and providing them with medical care. ""There are more animals needing help these days,"" he told the BBC. He said that the situation now for animals is ""very dangerous"". ""So many of them have starved to death, only a few of them can reach me for help. There's nothing much I can do but I will save as many as I can."" How could coronavirus harm asthmatics, and other questions How China is keeping busy during quarantine It's not just animal rescuers in Wuhan that are feeling the strain. Animal groups across China told the BBC that they were struggling to deal with the current situation and strict quarantine measures. Animal Rescue Shanghai told the BBC that the situation is a ""nightmare"". ""It is high season during Chinese New Year which means a lot of dogs are kicked out and due to coronavirus, a lot of flights have been cancelled. We now have over 350 dogs for a place sized for 120,"" said, Nana, who works at the shelter. We are really desperate."" An experienced rescuer in Shenzhen who did not want to give her name also said Chinese New Year was a busy time of year for animal abandonments, but that she has never encountered one every single day. One rescuer said because of the lockdown, businesses are not feeding stray animals ""Businesses are closed so there is no-one to feed the strays. It started being very common to see roaming cats and dogs and hear them fighting and barking and meowing much more than usual."" She said at one point, she saw a partially eaten mother dog with her puppies still around her. But she said that as the situation has intensified, volunteers have joined forces like never before to handle the amount of animals in need. ""Community support has been really heart-warming, many people help, volunteer, support and share or decide to adopt or foster. ""Both Chinese people and foreigners have united to help each other help animals.""

"At least 621 people were infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan A British man has become the first UK citizen to die from coronavirus after being infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. He is the sixth passenger to die from Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, Japan's health ministry said. Another person has tested positive for the virus in England, which they caught in the UK. The total number of coronavirus cases in the UK now stands at 20. Confirming the latest UK case, Professor Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said: ""It is not yet clear whether they contracted it directly or indirectly from an individual who had recently returned from abroad."" The patient has been transferred to a specialist NHS infection centre at Guy's and St Thomas' in London. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is due to chair an emergency Cobra committee meeting on Monday, said preparing for an outbreak in the UK was now the government's ""top priority"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson makes statement on coronavirus Speaking from Downing Street on Friday evening, Mr Johnson offered his condolences to the family of the British man who died from Covid-19. When asked if the government should have acted sooner for Britons on the cruise ship, he said it had been following the ""best medical advice"" about not repatriating people unless it is certain there will not be a spread to the UK. Mr Johnson has also faced criticism from Labour for waiting until Monday to hold the government Cobra meeting. But he said he had been working behind the scenes, meeting with the health secretary and chief medical officers to discuss the NHS's preparations. Hundreds of people on board the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship became infected while it was held in quarantine off the port of Yokohama earlier this month. A group of 30 British nationals and two Irish citizens were flown back to the UK from the cruise liner last Saturday. They were taken on coaches to Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral, where they are spending two weeks in isolation. Sally and David Abel are being treated at a Japanese hospital after both testing positive for coronavirus However, some UK passengers were critical of the Foreign Office's ""slow"" response, and said the wait for repatriation had been ""frustrating"". Among them were David and Sally Abel, from Northamptonshire, who were not on the evacuation flight after testing positive for the coronavirus. They were part of a group of at least four Britons taken to hospital in Japan for treatment. A family member confirmed the couple are ""doing well and fighting fit"", adding: ""They are getting stronger every day.""

Two new patients in England contracted the virus while in Iran,the Department of Health and Social Care said.,external Public Health Wales said it was working to identify close contacts of the Welsh patient, who is believed to be from the Swansea area and was infected in northern Italy before returning to the UK. Northern Ireland also confirmed its first case on Thursday. Authorities said they havecontacted passengers who sat near the woman on a flight from northern Italy to Dublin. Can coronavirus harm breastfed babies, and other questions EasyJet and British Airways warn over virus impact How is the UK getting ready for coronavirus? Following the UK national's death in Japan, a Foreign Office spokesperson said:Â ""We are supporting the family ofÂ aÂ BritishÂ man who has died in Japan and are in contact with local authorities. ""Our sympathies and thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.""Â A spokeswoman for Princess Cruises, which operates the Diamond Princess ship, also offered the company's ""sincere condolences"". The first death of a Brit from the coronavirus is, sadly, not a surprise. This outbreak has killed around 2,800 people, most of them in China. As the number of people infected with the virus increases, so too will the number of deaths. That is why attention continues to be on China, Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan. Each of those countries still has full-blown outbreaks of the coronavirus and their efforts to contain it will be crucial. Other countries are already feeling the ripple effects of these outbreaks. The latest cases in the UK are connected to either Iran or Italy. For now there is no coronavirus outbreak in the UK, but further imported cases are almost inevitable for as long as other countries have large numbers of infections. The cruise liner, which had 3,711 passengers on board, was put under quarantine in Yokohama in early February after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was found to have the virus. At least 621 people on the ship later tested positive for coronavirus. On Friday, the World Health Organization raised its global risk assessment of the virus to ""very high"" because of the continued emergence of cases and new countries being affected. But Dr Michael Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization Health Emergencies Programme, reiterated that the outbreak is not a pandemic. He told a press conference: ""If we say there is a pandemic of coronavirus we are essentially accepting every human on the planet will be exposed to that virus and the data does not support that as yet."" In other developments: Globally, more than 80,000 people have been infected. About 2,800 have died - the majority in China's Hubei province TheUK's FTSE 100 share index has been hit by the biggest one-week fall since the 2008 financial crisis amid coronavirus fears. Newcastle and West Ham football clubs havebanned handshakes at their training grounds in an attempt to stop the virus' spread.

"The WHO has raised the risk but data shows there is not yet a global pandemic The World Health Organization (WHO) has upgraded the global risk of the coronavirus outbreak to ""very high"" - its top level of risk assessment. But the UN body said there was still a chance of containing the virus if its chain of transmission were broken. WHO head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also stressed that fear and misinformation were the biggest challenges to overcome. More than 50 countries have now reported cases of coronavirus. And sources within Iran's healthcare systemtold BBC Persian that, as of Thursday evening, at least 210 people had diedfrom the virus. This is more than six times higher than the official government figure. At a press conference in Geneva, Dr Tedros said that most cases could still be traced, and there was no evidence of the virus ""spreading freely in communities"". Coronavirus: A visual guide to the outbreak Coronavirus: How worried should we be? His colleague, Dr Mike Ryan, head of the WHO's Emergency Health Programme, said that the risk level was intended to serve as a ""reality check"" for governments, since healthcare systems were still unprepared. ""You have a duty to your citizens, you have a duty to the world to be ready,"" said Dr Ryan. WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said fear was still the biggest challenge Globally, more than 80,000 people have been infected. About 2,800 have died - the vast majority in China's Hubei province. China confirmed another 327 cases - the lowest daily increase for a month - along with 44 deaths Switzerland suspended all events with more than 1,000 participants until 15 March, including the Geneva International Motor Show Iceland, Nigeria, Mexico, New Zealand, Belarus and the Netherlands all reported their first cases The first British death from Covid-19 was announced- a passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan Fear about the virus has continued to hit global markets.Shares have shed almost 13% of their value this week on London's FTSE, wiping Â£210bn ($267bn) from the value of companies on the index Dr Ryan also stressed that current data information does not suggest the virus has become a global pandemic. ""If we say there's a pandemic of coronavirus, we're essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed,"" he said. ""The data does not support that as yet and China has clearly shown that that's not necessarily the natural outcome of this event if we take action."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: Five countries, five responses Dr Tedros reiterated that the spread had the potential to become a pandemic, but cautioned against unnecessary panic. ""Our greatest enemy right now is not the virus itself, it's fear, rumours and stigma,"" he said. The WHO has said proper containment, with the help of an ""all government, all society approach"" will help slow down rates of infection, break chains of infection and take pressure off healthcare systems around the world.
