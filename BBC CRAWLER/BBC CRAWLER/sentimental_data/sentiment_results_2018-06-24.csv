"This video can not be played Greg Hands: 'I made an unequivocal pledge' on Heathrow Opposition MPs shouted ""Where's Boris?"" as a Tory MP who resigned from government over Heathrow expansion urged colleagues to join him in opposing a third runway. Ex-trade minister Greg Hands said it was a ""debate about being true to your word and to your election pledges"". Boris Johnson - who also opposes a third runway - has come under fire for travelling to Afghanistan and missing a vote to approve a new Â£14bn runway. MPs are expected to back expansion. Protesters against a third runway staged a protest in central lobby at the Houses of Parliament, a few metres from where MPs are debating the decision. About a dozen demonstrators from Vote No Heathrow lay down on the floor with their arms outstretched before being ejected from Parliament by police. Parliament Live: MPs debate runway plan Johnson Afghan talks focused on security Minister quits to oppose Heathrow plan Conservative MPs have been ordered to back a third runway, the SNP will abstain and Labour have been given a free vote, with up to 40 of them expected to back the government, meaning it will almost certainly become law. Mr Johnson has said following Mr Hands' example and quitting the government to vote against Heathrow would ""achieve absolutely nothing"". Mr Hands raised concerns over issues including flight paths and night flights and the impact on air quality, before telling the Commons: ""I think this proposal is fundamentally flawed."" To shouts of ""where's Boris?"" from some on the Labour benches, Mr Hands said: ""It's also a debate about being true to your word and to your election pledges."" This video can not be played John McDonnell makes an impassioned plea to halt Heathrow expansion In an impassioned speech, Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned that villages that had existed for 1,000 years will be ""wiped off the face of the earth"" to enable a company to maximise its profits. He told MPs to remember the name of Harmondsworth resident Armelle Thomas, whose late husband Tommy arrived in the UK during World War Two to ""fight for this country against fascism"" by flying planes for the RAF. Mr McDonnell said: ""His home that he built up with Armelle is in the centre of what will be the runway itself. ""There are human costs to this decision that this House needs to recognise and contemplate before they vote tonight to worry and blight my community once again on a programme that will never - pardon the pun - take off."" His speech was backed by Richmond Park Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith and Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who represents Twickenham, both of whom raised concerns about the environment, the cost and alleged financial benefits of the scheme. Conservative former transport secretary Justine Greening said the story of Heathrow was one of ""broken promises, broken politics and broken economics"". Labour's shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald earlier outlined his party's official opposition to Heathrow expansion, criticising Transport Secretary Chris Grayling for making ""a complete shambles of a vital national project"". He said the government's case for expansion was ""riddled with gaps and fundamentally flawed"". SNP MP Alan Brown said the government had failed to give sufficient assurances that its Heathrow expansion plan would benefit Scotland's economy and ""connectivity"". A new runway, which was approved by ministers earlier this month, would increase Heathrow's annual capacity from 85.5 million passengers to 130 million. Opening debate in the House of Commons, Mr Grayling said Heathrow was ""full"" and a new runway was needed to secure ""a clear path to our future as a global nation in the post-Brexit world."" Heathrow runway to 'change lives forever' How do you build a runway over a motorway? Grounded: UK airport expansion plans In pictures: Heathrow airport As MPs prepare to debate Heathrow's future, Mr Johnson was holding talks with Afghan minister Hekmat Karzai Analysis by BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg The mystery of his whereabouts was solved, but not yet the mystery of the purpose. Afghanistan is not exactly an easy place to head for a quick hello. Several sources in Westminster tonight suggest there was a serious reason. My colleague Jonathan Bealereported last month,externalthat the government was considering sending about 400 more troops to Afghanistan to join the 600 or so already there helping train Afghan forces. Sources suggest tonight that the National Security Council will discuss the proposal tomorrow afternoon, with the government potentially approving the move, and a possible announcement in the coming days. The soldiers would not be involved in combat, but helping the Afghans provide more security in Kabul. Read Laura's full blog Last week, Downing Street said Mr Johnson, the ex-mayor of London, would be missing Monday's vote. His exact whereabouts, previously a matter of confusion, were revealed on Monday when the Afghan ministry of foreign affairs posted a picture on Twitter of its deputy foreign minister Hekmat Karzai meeting Mr Johnson in Kabul.

His absence has been mocked by other anti-runway campaigners in his party, including Justine Greening. When he was elected MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip in west London in 2015, Mr Johnson pledged to lie in front of bulldozers to stop expansion. Before leaving for Afghanistan earlier on Monday, he wrote to constituents saying the ""very considerable difficulties"" facing the third runway meant it would be ""a very long time before we have to make good on that pledge"".

But Mr Johnson, who has long promoted a scheme for a new airport in the Thames estuary, suggested it would be a futile gesture for him to resign over the issue. ""I have long been an opponent of a third runway at Heathrow and that is why I am not voting for it tonight,"" he wrote. ""It is clear from what is likely to be a large majority of MPs who are in favour of a third runway that my resignation would have achieved absolutely nothing."" The government has pledged the airport will be built at no cost to the taxpayer, will create 100,000 jobs and will benefit the entire country, through guaranteed internal flights to the rest of the UK. Ministers also insist the project will have built-in environmental protections, with the ability to fine Heathrow or ground aircraft if promises on night flights and other contentious issues are broken. An independent review in 2015 recommended a new runway at Heathrow as the best option to address the need for extra capacity in the south of England. The Department for Transport has previously said no expansion would mean London's five airports would be full by 2034.

"Mr Trump has called for ""strength and security at the border"" in a series of tweets US President Donald Trump has called for speedy deportations that bypass any judicial process in a tweet on Sunday. ""When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came,"" Mr Trump wrote. His comments come days afterMr Trump reversed a policy to separate migrant children from their parentsfollowing fierce backlash at home and abroad. More than 2,300 children were separated from their parents in May and June. As of May, all migrants who cross the US border illegally face criminal prosecution under the ""zero tolerance"" policy.

The president did not make the distinction between economic migrants and those seeking asylum. Mr Trump has faced criticism, including from his own Republican Party, for his choice of language on Twitter. When he earlier said illegal immigrants threatened ""to pour into and infest our Country"",Republican congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen tweeted back at him,externalsaying his ""baseless rhetoric"" was ""repugnant"" and dehumanised those looking for a better life.

This video can not be played Zero-tolerance: The US policy dividing families and opinion On 20 June, Mr Trump backed down from his support for the policy and signed an executive order ending the practice of separating families. He said at the time:""I did not like the sight or feeling of families being separated."" Mr Trump's directive allows for long-term detention of immigrant children (albeit with their parents), which violatesfederal law that limits child detention to 20 days.,external Chris Buckler, BBC Washington Correspondent A public outcry over migrant children being separated from their parents, forced Donald Trump to soften his immigration policy. But since then, in a series of speeches, he has called for tougher laws - and claimed America's current legislation is laughed at by the rest of the world. His latest comments on Twitter go even further. He says that everyone found illegally trying to cross the border should be returned to their own country immediately - without involving judges or holding court cases. Political opponents will be furious that that's even been suggested but President Trump clearly believes his supporters back his hardline stance. Following Mr Trump's election in 2016, the numbers of migrants held or detained entry while crossing the border had dropped significantly. However, since February 2018, the number of migrants crossing the border illegally is up, with arrests last month more than double those in May 2017.

"At a garden party for the Queen's birthday, Prince William hailed Jordan's support for refugees Prince William has begun a five-day tour of the Middle East, including the first official royal visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories. The Duke of Cambridge is scheduled to meet both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. He arrived in Jordan on Sunday, meeting Crown Prince Al-Hussein bin Abdullah II in Amman. Kensington Palace said the ""historic nature"" of the tour was ""important"". The trip comes as Israel celebrates the 70th anniversary of its foundation, and amid a rise in tensions between Palestinians and Israelis. Israeli forces launched air strikes on Palestinian militant positions in the Gaza Stripon Wednesday after rockets and mortars were fired into Israel. Prince William is expected to visit Jerusalem's Old City During his visit to Israel, the Duke of Cambridge will visit the World Holocaust Remembrance Centre and lay a wreath where ashes of victims of the Holocaust are buried. He is expected to visit Jerusalem's Old City and the grave of Princess Alice of Greece, his great-grandmother and the Duke of Edinburgh's mother. Prince Phillip visited the grave in 1994 when a ceremony honoured her for saving Greek Jews during the Second World War. After visiting a technology lab in the capital, Amman, Prince William attended a garden party marking the Queen's birthday. He told an audience of prominent Jordanians: ""I greatly admire the resilience you in Jordan have shown in the face of the many security and humanitarian challenges that have confronted you as a result of conflicts in this region. ""The way in which you opened your doors to hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, not to mention your longstanding commitments to Palestinian refugees, is remarkable."" By Jonny Dymond, royal correspondent The Duke of Cambridge is embarking upon an historic tour of the Middle East - visiting both Israel and the Palestinian territories - in a trip in which ironies and sensitivities will abound. The Royal Family is keenly aware of its own history. Prince William is this week visiting a region that rarely forgets its past. When Palestine slipped from the hands of an exhausted and broken post-war Britain in 1948, the Prince's great-grandfather George VI was on the throne. Read more from Jonny Dymond here. The duke will also visit Ramallah in the West Bank, where he will focus on issues facing refugee communities, as well as meeting Mr Abbas. A Kensington Palace spokesman said: ""The historic nature of this tour is of course important and the duke considers it a great privilege to be undertaking the first ever official royal tour of Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and to be able to help further strengthen the friendship between Jordan and the United Kingdom."" Prince William was welcomed by Jordan's Crown Prince Al-Hussein bin Abdullah II Prince William, who is president of the Football Association, missed England's high-scoring match against Panama for the trip. He later watched the game with the Jordanian Crown Prince, who had recorded the match. He successfully avoided finding out the score after asking reporters not to update him on the result.

"Italy has urged a shared EU response to the issue of migration The European zone of border-free travel could be in danger if no solution is found to the issue of migration, Italy's prime minister has warned. At an informal meeting of 16 EU leaders in Brussels, Giuseppe Conte called for shared EU responsibility for rescued migrants and penalties for countries refusing to accept quotas. The meeting comes ahead of a full EU summit on migration next week. In recent days, Italy has refused to accept two migrant rescue ships. Can the EU reach a new deal on migrants? In a document presented at the talks, Mr Conte advocated for migrant ""protection centres"" to be established in other EU countries to relieve the burden on Italy, which has received over 600,000 migrants over the past four years. ""Whoever lands in Italy lands in Europe.... Schengen is at risk,"" the document said. The Schengen zone of passport-free travel covers most of the EU and some other European countries. Italy's new populist coalition government, which was formed earlier this month, has taken a hard line on migration and says it wants to deport half a million undocumented migrants. Last week it refused to accept 630 migrantsaboard the charity rescue ship Aquarius, which was eventually diverted to Spain.Another vessel, Lifeline, is now strandedwith around 230 people on board after both Italy and Malta denied it permission to dock. Sunday's meeting was called for by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who indicated that bilateral and trilateral agreements could be necessary if next week's summit fails to reach an EU-wide agreement. She also urged a shared response to the issue of illegal migration, saying: ""Everybody is responsible for everything. Wherever possible, we want European solutions. Where this is not possible, we want to bring together those who are willing and find a common framework for action."" Can the EU reach a new deal on migrants?

"Taxi app firm Uber has told a court it accepted its London operating licence should not have been renewed last year over safety concerns, but says there has been ""wholesale change"" since then. Westminster Magistrates' Court is considering if Uber is ""fit and proper"" to hold a licence in the capital. Last September, Transport for London refused to renew Uber's licence on grounds of public safety and security. Uber has been able to operate normally during the appeal process. The court hearing began on Monday and is expected to last several days. Tom de la Mare QC, representing Uber, told the court the firm had taken the ""unusual"" stance of not opposing TfL's reasons for not renewing the licence. He said: ""We accept TfL's decision in September was the right decision on the evidence at the time."" However, Mr de la Mare argued TfL's last three inspections showed a ""perfect record of compliance"" and said three non-executive board members were now in place to ensure ""total compliance to the letter and spirit"" of regulatory obligations. Uber to limit drivers' hours Uber to report crimes directly to police According to the firm, 3.6 million passengers regularly use its app in London and it has 45,000 drivers in the city. The original reasons for the refusal wereoutlined in a 21-page document,external. Various media outlets have quoted a memo reportedly sent by Uber to Transport for London, in which it said that as many as 1,148 London-licensed Uber drivers had been accused of ""category A"" offences such as sexual incidents, stalking and dangerous driving. Since being denied a licence to operate in London, Uber has implemented a number of changes. Uber now reports crimes directly to the police - previously it had logged criminal complaints with Transport for London, which caused delays. Drivers are now only allowed to use the app in the region they hold a private hire licence. The working hours of its drivers are also more tightly regulated. A licensed driver on its app must take an uninterrupted six-hour break after 10 hours of driving with a passenger or travelling to a pick up. The company has also revamped its leadership. Three independent non-executives have been appointed to its UK board. A kinder, gentler and humbler Uber - that is the image the taxi app company hopes to project in court this week as it battles for its future in what is one of its most important markets. It will stress that a lot has changed at a business that once prided itself on confronting local regulators in a whirlwind of creative disruption. A new boss, Dara Khosrowshahi, came to London and actually said sorry, and in February new measures were announced to co-operate with the police over allegations of driver misconduct - Transport for London's main concern when it refused a new licence. The fact that Uber is seeking a new licence for just 18 months, rather than the full five years it expected last autumn - and that it appears to have been agreeing with TfL a list of conditions it will have to meet - shows that it accepts it is still on probation. Rory's technology blog Uber has also had difficulties getting licences in Brighton, York and Sheffield. In a separate case in 2016, Uber lost a legal battle over the status of its drivers. A London employment tribunal ruled that its drivers were workers, rather than self-employed. It meant drivers would be entitled to holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the national minimum wage.

"Birmingham and Hyndburn in Lancashire are the UK's worst areas for food hygiene for the second year, consumer watchdog Which? has said. It looked at areas including the number of high and medium-risk food businesses which kept to hygiene standards and the number of interventions carried out. But Birmingham City Council said Which? had failed to engage with local authorities and Hyndburn Council said the data was out of date. Erewash in Derbyshire was rated top. Data from 390 local authorities for 2016-17 was used, including information from the Local Authority Monitoring System collected by the Food Standards Agency. Which? said Birmingham City Council had a poor record for carrying out inspections within 28 days of a food business opening. It found that 16% of the city's more than 8,000 food businesses were yet to be rated and 43% of the city's high and medium-risk food businesses did not meet food compliance standards. Hyndburn Borough Council in Lancashire was the second worst area in the UK for food hygiene. Which? said that 98% of the area's businesses had been rated for risk, but just two in five of its medium and high-risk food businesses met hygiene standards. 'Scores on the doors' call on food hygiene Mark Croxford, of Birmingham City Council, said: ""I am surprised and disappointed to see Which? have made the same mistake as they have done in previous years, in failing to engage with local authorities to produce a meaningful report."" He said that the same data showed council officers had inspected the second highest number of premises, undertaken more prosecutions, closed more food premises and suspended more approved manufacturers than any other English local authority in 2016/17. Mr Croxford said more than 1,000 new food businesses were registered in Birmingham in 2016-17, presenting a ""significant challenge"". He added that the council's officers had 8,341 premises to inspect across Birmingham - second only to Cornwall with 8,652. Hyndburn Council's deputy leader Paul Cox said the findings were ""not a true reflection of the current picture in Hyndburn"", saying the statistics used were 13 months out of date. He said ""significant strides"" had been taken to improve food hygiene performance and there had been a ""big improvement"". ""We've completed 100% of inspections for the past two years and our most recently submitted figures to the FSA for 17-18 shows the true picture that 92.5% of food businesses in Hyndburn are compliant,"" he said. Erewash Borough Council was rated top for the second year in a row, ahead of Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council in Hampshire. Erewash Basingstoke and Deane Sunderland North Dorset South Kesteven Brentwood West Dorset Staffordshire and Moorlands Conwy Orkney Islands Birmingham Hyndburn Camden Croydon Isles of Scilly Falkirk Glasgow Edinburgh Lewisham Waltham Forest Alex Neill, of Which?, said the UK's enforcement regime was ""under huge strain, just as Brexit threatens to add to the responsibilities of struggling local authorities"". ""Effective food enforcement must be a government priority, including robust checks on imports as well as co-operation with the EU and other countries on food risks, "" she said. Councillor Simon Blackburn, chairman of the Local Government Association's safer and stronger communities board, said councils worked ""extremely hard"" to maintain and improve food hygiene standards. ""Ultimately it is the responsibility of food businesses to ensure the products they produce and premises they serve from comply fully with food safety law and pose no risk, but councils continue to do everything possible to maintain checks in this area despite severe budgetary pressures,"" he said.

"The art school was seriously damaged by the fire A fire suppression system was close to being activated when fire tore through the Glasgow School of Art earlier this month, according to a trade body. The British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association said huge pumps needed for the water mist system had arrived on site the day before the blaze. But the body said it would have taken weeks to complete the installation. The iconic Mackintosh building was gutted by the blaze a week ago last Friday. Keith MacGillivray, chief executive of the British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association, told BBC Scotland: ""The pumps for the fire suppression system were there at the school of art the day before the fire. ""They are very large pumps so they were delivered in component parts. ""It would have taken some weeks to reassemble the pumps and connect up the pipe work and obviously the water tanks would have had to be connected and put in place as well. ""Everything would also would have had to be tested thoroughly before being made operational."" Building control officers have warned people to stay away from the site of the art school fire. They revealed concerns about the end walls of the building, which could fall into the street ""without warning"". Local residents have expressed anger and frustration at being unable to return to their homes since a safety cordon was put in place in the vicinity of the building. Some claimed there had been a lack of communication from the council and other bodies over when they might be able to go back. Michael Argent, who lives close to the art school, said: ""The most difficult thing is not knowing how long it is going to  be."" Another local resident, Christopher Bowen, said: ""It is beyond frustrating because the communication has been awful. We have more or less been left to our own devices."" A Glasgow City Council spokesman said: ""This has been an incredibly difficult situation for businesses and residents and the fact that there is no real change in the information we're able to give them is incredibly frustrating for people. ""We've so far been able to find accommodation for everyone who has told us they need it. ""However, people's circumstances change regularly and if they find themselves becoming effectively homeless then they can meet with our staff who are based in the dental hospital or call our helpline on 0141 287 0416.

"More than half of councils now charge for green waste collection UK councils are charging almost Â£74m a year between them for garden waste collection, BBC research has suggested. Data collected by BBC One'sRip Off Britainrevealed that more than half of councils had introduced charges. Residents' green waste was previously paid for through the council tax bymost local authorities. The Local Government Association said councils were forced to charge because they face a Â£5bn shortfall in funding from central government. Rip Off Britain gathered responses under the Freedom of Information Act from 322 of the 326 UK local authorities responsible for waste collection. It found that 172 charged to pick up garden waste. The total charges for green waste collection have risen from Â£42.3m in 2014-15 to Â£56.9m in 2015-16, the data showed. And in 2016-17, the charges hit a total of Â£73.9m. Presenter Gloria Hunniford said: ""While clearly some of our viewers are unhappy their garden waste is no longer taken away for free, the results of our survey show it's unlikely that's going to change any time soon. ""And with further councils set to introduce such charges, even more of us will need to get used to paying to have our grass clippings taken away."" A spokesman for the Local Government Association said that local councils had been forced to introduce charges because ofcuts to funding by central government. ""Councils in England face an overall funding gap that will exceed Â£5bn by 2020,"" he said. ""Some councils were able to provide free garden waste services when they were first introduced but are now having to charge to reflect the growing cost of providing a collection service."" The charges for green waste collection represent an average cost to residents of Â£42.40 a year. But the programme found that prices vary hugely. Harlow in Essex had the highest average cost at Â£96 a year, followed by Arun in West Sussex at Â£86 a year. The lowest average costs were Â£18 a year in Monmouthshire and Â£22 a year in Richmond, North Yorkshire. The programme features residents of one particular street in Trafford, Greater Manchester, which is divided between two councils. One charges for garden waste, while the other does not. Resident Ian Billington said: ""When we first got a letter saying they were introducing it, I was shocked - because it was something that you have always had included in your council tax.""

"Zsa Zsa has an underbite and a tongue that almost touches the floor - but these are qualities that won over judges at The World's Ugliest Dog Competition in Petaluma, California on 23 June. The nine-year-old English bulldog walked away with the 2018 title. The competition saw 14 canines compete for prize money of $1,500 (Â£1,130), including Himisaboo, a Chinese crested wiener dog mix, seen here with his owner Heather Wilson. While the competition highlights unattractive pooches, organisers say it is actually a celebration of the dogs, many of whom were rescued from shelters or puppy farms. Here is Wild Thang, a Pekingese, who was a strong contender. Tee Tee, a Chinese crested, was also among the competitors. The annual event is intended to promote pet adoption. Mandarina flashes a toothy smile to the camera as she walks across the stage. The event is held annually at the Sonoma-Marin Fair. Rascal Deux, a Chinese crested, channelled his inner John Lennon, but it was not enough to win the contest. Last year's World's Ugliest Dog Competition winner Martha, a Neapolitan mastiff, took to the stage before his successor was crowned.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt: Airbus is ""completely inappropriate to make these kind of threats"" Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said that ""threats"" by business over Brexit are ""completely inappropriate"". He was responding to warnings by Airbus and BMW that investments in the UK could be jeopardised by Brexit uncertainty. Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show, Mr Hunt said Brexit discussions were at ""critical moment"" and needed unity. He also refused to rule out scrapping cuts to corporation tax in order to fund extra spending on the NHS. Last week,Airbus warned it could leavethe UK if Britain were to exit the single market and customs union without a transition deal. BMW followed the warning by saying that clarity over Brexit is needed by the end of the summer. In response Mr Hunt said: ""It's completely inappropriate for businesses to be making these kinds of threats. ""We are in an absolutely critical moment in the Brexit discussions and what that means is that we need to get behind Theresa May to deliver the best possible Brexit. ""The more that we undermine Theresa May the more likely we are to end up with a fudge, which would be an absolute disaster for everyone."" Brexit: All you need to know Stay in customs union, says Siemens boss CBI chief: Industry sectors face extinction But Edwin Morgan, director of policy at the Institute of Directors, said: ""Business leaders have every right to speak up about their needs and concerns as we approach incredibly significant negotiations for the future of this country. ""Firms think very carefully before sticking their heads above the parapet, so they should be listened to by politicians, not dismissed. Companies have to honestly assess the risks they face, and spelling them out should never be brushed off as a 'threat'."" Last week BMW UK boss Ian Robertson said he needed to know within months what the government's preferred position was on customs and trade post Brexit. ""If we don't get clarity in the next couple of months we have to start making those contingency plans...  which means making the UK less competitive than it is in a very competitive world right now,"" he said. ""That is a decisive issue that ultimately could damage this industry."" BMW makes the Mini and Rolls Royce and employs about 8,000 people in the UK. The customs union brings together the EU's 28 members in a duty-free area, in which they pay the same rate of duty on non-EU goods. Prime Minister Theresa May has ruled out staying in the customs union after the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019. Airbus,in its Brexit ""risk assessment"" published on Thursday,external, said if the UK left the EU next year without a deal - leaving both the single market and customs union immediately without any agreed transition - it would ""lead to severe disruption and interruption of UK production"". The European plane-maker said the warning was not part of ""Project Fear"", but was a ""dawning reality"". Airbus makes wings for the A380 and other models in the UK The term ""Project Fear"" has been used by some pro-Brexit campaigners to denote alleged scaremongering by those in favour of remaining in the EU. ""Airbus have been one of the first companies to stick their head above the parapet and explain how distressing and how worrying the government's current direction of travel is,"" Labour's shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey told BBC Radio 5's Pienaar's Politics. She said she had been told in private meetings with UK business leaders that if the government went into a ""no deal"" Brexit scenario ""it would finish them and they would have to close their sites"". Please upgrade your browser Airbus's 14,000 UK staff are employed across 25 manufacturing sites. About half are in Wales and it currently has more than 4,000 suppliers in the UK. ""Companies are right to say that if there's no deal that won't be good for Britain, but it won't be good for Europe either,"" International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told Sky News. ""The point I make to them is that they should also be making the same case to European governments that that will be bad for them."" Mr Hunt was also asked how the government would fund its pledge to put an extra Â£20bn into the NHS. He said ""all will be revealed"" in the Budget later this year. The health secretary refused to rule out scrapping the Conservatives' 2017 manifesto pledge to cut corporation tax to 17% by 2020. ""We are committed to our manifesto but we also said in our manifesto is that we want our public services to be the best in the world and that the NHS is the most important of all those public services,"" he told Andrew Marr. Pressed on whether he could guarantee to business people that the planned corporation tax cut would go ahead, he said: ""What business people want is a sensible Conservative government"". He urged them to wait for the next Budget to find out what taxes would go up. Two years ago the government promised to cut corporation tax to an all-time low of 17% by 2020. That would have given Britain one of the lowest rates of tax on company profits in the G20, and was warmly welcomed by businesses. Now that promise may be in jeopardy. The health secretary declined to confirm that the cut in corporation tax would proceed, now that the NHS has been promised an extra 3.4% in spending (in real terms) from next year. He also said that higher (and not lower) taxes would be needed to pay for the additional money on health spending. More worrying for companies has been the change in tone from senior Government ministers towards them. Jeremy Hunt described businesses who express concern about progress in the Brexit talks as ""completely inappropriate"" and ""siren voices"".

"President Erdogan and his wife Emine greet supporters at his party's Ankara HQ Turkey's long-standing leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan has won a new five-year term after securing outright victory in the first round of a presidential poll. Mr Erdogan got nearly 53% with almost all votes counted. His closest rival Muharrem Ince was on 31%. He will now assume sweeping new powers, won in a controversial referendum last year. The post of PM will be abolished. Mr Ince accepted the result on the basis of poll figures - but said that everything about the vote was unfair. Erdogan's victory - in 100 and 500 words Turks abroad play decisive role in vote How powerful will Erdogan be? Turkey's political giant Final results will be announced on Friday. The polls were the most fiercely fought in many years. Mr Erdogan has presided over a strong economy and built up a solid support base by investing in healthcare, education and infrastructure. But the 64-year-old has also polarised opinion, cracking down on opponents and putting some 160,000 people in jail. Mr Erdogan gave a triumphant victory speech from the balcony of his party's headquarters in the capital Ankara at 03:00 (00:00 GMT), declaring: ""The winner of this election is each and every individual among my 81 million citizens."" Congratulations have come in from Islamic leaders including Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Russian President Vladimir Putin talked of Mr Erdogan's ""great political authority and mass support"". Supporters of Erdogan and the AK Party took to Istanbul's streets to celebrate Mr Ince, from the Republican People's Party (CHP), said the election was unfair from its declaration to the announcement of the results. Turkey was entering a dangerous period of one-man rule, he added. The young Turks rejecting Islam Full story: Life under President Erdogan But he said that there was no significant difference between official results and his party's figures, and therefore he would accept the outcome. There were another four candidates on the presidential ballot, all of whom fell below 10% of the vote. President Erdogan will assume major new powers under Turkey's new constitution. The changes wereendorsed in a tight referendum last year by 51% of voters, and are due to come into force after the election. They include: Directly appointing top public officials, including ministers and vice-presidents The power to intervene in the country's legal system The power to impose a state of emergency Some critics argue the enhanced role will place too much power in one person's hands, and that Turkey's new system lacks the checks and balances of other executive presidencies like France or the US. Mr Erdogan maintains his increased authority will empower him to address Turkey's economic woes and defeat Kurdish rebels in the country's south-east. In his victory speech, he said Turkey would act more firmly against terrorist groups, and would continue to ""liberate Syrian lands"" so refugees could return to their homes there. Mr Erdogan was prime minister for 11 years before becoming president in 2014. Under the new constitution, he could stand for a third term when his second finishes in 2023, meaning he could potentially hold power until 2028. By Mark Lowen, BBC Turkey correspondent Despite 90% of the media being pro-government and largely shunning the opposition, the president's posters and flags dwarfing any challenge on the streets, the election being held under a state of emergency curtailing protests, and critical journalists and academics being jailed or forced into exile, Mr Erdogan only got half of the country behind him. ""We are living through a fascist regime"", the opposition MP Selin Sayek Boke told the BBC. ""But fascist regimes don't usually win elections with 53%, they win with 90%. So this shows that progressive values are still here and can rise up."" For now, though, this is Mr Erdogan's time. With his sweeping new powers, scrapping the post of prime minister and able to choose ministers and most senior judges, he becomes Turkey's most powerful leader since its founding father Ataturk. He'll now hope to lead the country at least until 2023, a hundred years since Ataturk's creation. And a dejected opposition will have to pick itself up and wonder again if, and how, he can be beaten. Read more from Mark Mr Erdogan said the governing alliance led by his AK Party (AKP) had secured a majority, in a separate vote for the 600-member chamber. State news agency Anadolu said the AKP itself had 42% of the votes for parliament with 99% counted, giving it a projected 293 seats. Its partner, the MHP, had 11% and 50 seats. The opposition CHP won only 23% (146 seats) despite Mr Ince's popularity in the presidential vote, while its nationalist ally the Iyi (Good) party won 10% (44 seats). In a development that will please Kurdish voters, the pro-Kurdish HDP exceeded the 10% threshold needed to enter parliament. With 67 seats, it will form the chamber's second-largest opposition faction. Kurds in Diyarbakir celebrated the HDP's result The party's success comes despite the fact its presidential candidate Selahattin Demirtas is in a high-security prison on terror charges, which he firmly denies. WATCH: Why the Kurdish vote was key Security was tight at polling stations. Ahead of the vote, concerns had been raised about potential voter intimidation and electoral fraud. Voter turnout was high at almost 87%, the state broadcaster reported. Muharrem Ince has accepted the results, though he believes the poll was unfair Rights activists have said the press is not free to report on all sides in Turkey. It has become the world's biggest jailer of journalists under Mr Erdogan's rule, according to monitoring groups. Mr Erdogan has already cautioned his rivals against claiming foul play, saying: ""I hope nobody will try to cast a shadow on the results and harm democracy in order to hide their own failure."" The biggest was the economy. The Turkish lira has tanked and inflation stands at about 11%, though the economy has grown substantially in recent years. The currency has suffered as Mr Erdogan has pressed the central bank not to raise interest rates and suggested before the poll that he might restrict its independence. Terrorism was another key issue, as Turkey faces attacks from Kurdish militants and the jihadists of the Islamic State group. Turkey's brain drain: Crackdown pushes intellectuals out Mr Erdogan's rivals accused him of damaging civil liberties in Turkey and spearheading a slide into authoritarian rule. Turkey has been under a state of emergency since a failed coup in July 2016, with 107,000 public servants and soldiers dismissed from their jobs. More than 50,000 people have been imprisoned pending trial since the uprising. Muharrem Ince attracted huge crowds on the campaign trail CHP candidate Mr Ince's fiery campaigning helped to revitalise Turkey's downtrodden opposition - but ultimately he lacked the numbers to end Mr Erdogan's dominance.

"President Erdogan will now enjoy greater powers as president and have a majority in parliament Recep Tayyip Erdogan has won Turkey's presidential vote, cementing his authority with beefed-up powers. After 15 years at the top of Turkish politics, he fought off a spirited opposition campaign to secure the presidency in the first round and his party will also control parliament. The long read: Erdogan's Turkey Country profile Here is a rundown of what you need to know - in brief and at greater length. Read either or both to understand what his victory means. Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, 64, has not only retained the presidency until at least 2023, he has strengthened it. New powers approved in a 2017 referendum will now come into force, transforming what had been a ceremonial role into the key executive role in this Nato member country. He won 52.5% of the vote and avoided the risk of a run-off vote, shrugging off a faltering economy. For the first time, Turks voted for a new parliament on the same day - and handed the president's Islamist-rooted AK party a majority through its alliance with a nationalist ally. His main opponent has warned of Turkey becoming a ""one-man regime"". Recep Tayyip Erdogan has reshaped Turkey more than any other person since the founding of the modern state, first with two terms as prime minister and, since 2014, as president. He has presided over consecutive years of economic growth and improved public services. But he leads a polarised nation. The results of the 24 June elections show continued support for a leader who has cracked down on opponents and has the support of most Turkish media. One of his challengers for the presidency, Selahattin Demirtas of the pro-Kurdish HDP, fought his campaign from a jail cell and his closest rival, Muharrem Ince, says Turkey has become a ""one-man regime in its fullest sense"". Mr Erdogan has moved to consolidate his power since an attempted coupagainst his rule was suppressed in 2016. Turkey has been under a state of emergency ever since, with 107,000 public servants and soldiers dismissed from their jobs. More than 50,000 people have been imprisoned pending trial since July 2016. In April 2017,51% of Turkish voters endorsed a new constitutionthat scraps the role of prime minister and grants the president new powers: Directly appointment of top public officials, including ministers and vice-presidents The power to intervene in the country's legal system The power to impose a state of emergency Mr Erdogan called snap elections as Turkey's currency, the lira, has slumped 17% this year against the dollar and the main interest rate has been increased to 17.75%. While Turkey's economy continues to grow strongly - by 7.4% in the first quarter of 2018 - there are fears of a sharp slowdown ahead, and the fall of the lira has hit people's pockets. By winning 52.5% of the vote, he saw off his closest rival, Muharrem Ince, who won just over 30% of the vote. His AK party won 42.5% of the separate parliamentary vote but, together with the nationalist MHP, that gives him a comfortable majority with 343 seats in the 600-seat assembly. The nationalists' success came as a surprise to commentators and a bonus to Mr Erdogan, because the party's vote was widely expected to suffer after a rising star, Meral Aksener, left the party to form her own. A vast crowd attended a rally for opposition candidate Ince in Izmir on Thursday Mr Erdogan continues to win support in his conservative heartland outside the big cities and among expatriate voters in Germany, the Netherlands and France. Under the AKP, Turkey has embraced a moderate Islamism, accepting Islamic symbols in public life to some extent - for example, in allowing female state employees to wear headscarves. By contrast Muharrem Ince's Republican People's Party (CHP) is a staunchly secular party. He attracted mass rallies ahead of the elections in Izmir, Ankara and Istanbul, but while he polled well in the presidential vote, his party was unable to spread its appeal beyond Turkey's secular heartland. The CHP polled about 22%. Despite its leader being in jail and restrictions placed on voters in Kurdish areas of the south-east, the pro-Kurdish party, which is firmly against Mr Erdogan, won 11.6% of the national vote and will continue to play a significant role in parliament.

"Italy has urged a shared EU response to the issue of migration The European zone of border-free travel could be in danger if no solution is found to the issue of migration, Italy's prime minister has warned. At an informal meeting of 16 EU leaders in Brussels, Giuseppe Conte called for shared EU responsibility for rescued migrants and penalties for countries refusing to accept quotas. The meeting comes ahead of a full EU summit on migration next week. In recent days, Italy has refused to accept two migrant rescue ships. Can the EU reach a new deal on migrants? In a document presented at the talks, Mr Conte advocated for migrant ""protection centres"" to be established in other EU countries to relieve the burden on Italy, which has received over 600,000 migrants over the past four years. ""Whoever lands in Italy lands in Europe.... Schengen is at risk,"" the document said. The Schengen zone of passport-free travel covers most of the EU and some other European countries. Italy's new populist coalition government, which was formed earlier this month, has taken a hard line on migration and says it wants to deport half a million undocumented migrants. Last week it refused to accept 630 migrantsaboard the charity rescue ship Aquarius, which was eventually diverted to Spain.Another vessel, Lifeline, is now strandedwith around 230 people on board after both Italy and Malta denied it permission to dock. Sunday's meeting was called for by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who indicated that bilateral and trilateral agreements could be necessary if next week's summit fails to reach an EU-wide agreement. She also urged a shared response to the issue of illegal migration, saying: ""Everybody is responsible for everything. Wherever possible, we want European solutions. Where this is not possible, we want to bring together those who are willing and find a common framework for action."" Can the EU reach a new deal on migrants?

"The government will examine claims the NHS was slow to take a ""dangerous"" automatic syringe out of service. It follows a whistleblower's warning,reported in the Sunday Times,,externalthat the devices could have caused widespread deaths among elderly patients. The syringes, for powerful painkillers, were permitted to be used until 2015. Heath Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there were questions over how quickly the NHS reacted ""when we knew these syringes were dangerous"". NHS officials issued warnings of the risk of fatalities from user error in the 1990s but the devices continued to be permitted by the NHS until three years ago. Doctors were concerned that confusing two models of the infusion pumps could lead to a day's dose of drugs being delivered in one hour. Mr Hunt said: ""We need to be absolutely certain that the NHS does react as quickly as possible when you have suggestions a piece of equipment is not safe. ""Urgent guidance was sent out in 2010 and they were finally removed from use in 2015 but we will look at whether that was as quick as it should have been."" Last week the government inquiry into hundreds of deaths at the Gosport War Memorial Hospital found more than 450 patients died after being given powerful painkillers inappropriately. Hospital drugs left 456 patients dead The scandals that haunt the NHS Speaking to the Sunday Times, the whistleblower said the decision makers on the inquiry panel had ""ignored"" evidence that the devices caused fatalities because they were worried about a national scandal. The newspaper claims the syringes were also linked to overdose-related deaths in Wales, South Yorkshire, North Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Devon, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. ""Anyone who has lost their granny over the past 30 years when opiates were administered by this equipment will be asking themselves, 'Is that what killed Granny?',"" the whistleblower told the paper. Mr Hunt said claims of a cover-up had been ""categorically denied"" by the independent panel, who had a ""free hand"", adding ""if they thought there was an issue with the syringe drivers I know they would have said so"". This video can not be played Hundreds of lives were cut short due to prescribed opioids at Gosport War Memorial Hospital The syringe drivers, called Graseby MS26 and Graseby MS16A, were loaded with capsules and programmed to release drugs into a patient's bloodstream over an extended period They delivered drugs at different rates - MS26 delivered in mm per 24 hours, MS16A delivered in mm per hour Cases emerged of the drivers being confused, causing dangerous over-infusion of drugs The NHS's Purchasing and Supply Agency (PSA) said the devices appeared ""very similar aside from colour"" Hazard notices were issued by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to ensure NHS staff knew the difference between the models In 1994, the NHS in Scotland issued a hazard notice warning of the risk of death due to confusion between the two models causing drugs to be delivered at the incorrect rate. Australia and New Zealand had programmes in the late 2000s to remove the devices from use. A 2008 paper by the NHS's Purchasing and Supply Agency (PSA), which closed in 2010, said the devices were an ""essential component of palliative care"". An estimated 40,000 devices - a quarter of the worldwide total - were in the UK, the majority in primary care. The syringes were briefly mentioned in the report released on Wednesday looking into the deaths at Gosport War Memorial Hospital. The report said: ""The panel has considered issues concerned with the particular syringe drivers, known by their tradename of Graseby, and is aware of the hazard notices which applied. ""The panel's analysis does not rest upon any issue relating to these notices."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""While there is a range of statutory requirements to monitor and improve safe management and use of controlled drugs, we would not hesitate to take further action to improve safety.""

"The SNP has withdrawn its support for a third runway at Heathrow airport, hours before a key Commons vote on the move. But the UK government persuaded MPs to give the go-ahead for a third runway, which they say would boost the number of flights to and from Scotland. The Commons supported the government's plan by 415 votes to 119, a majority of 296. The Scottish government has been a longtime backer of the plans, and was still behind them on Sunday. For:415 Against:119 Did not vote:116  But SNP MPs abstained from voting because there were ""no guarantees of the benefits"". It has been projected that the expansion of Heathrow would create at least 100 extra landing slots from Heathrow to Scottish airports each week. Cabinet approves new Heathrow runway Grayling: Heathrow expansion will benefit Scottish airports Scottish government welcomes third runway plan The Scottish government had previously backed Heathrow's bid for a third runway, saying it would bring economic benefits for Scotland. On Sunday, a Transport Scotland spokesman said the government ""supports expansion at Heathrow airport"" and ""looks forward to Scotland seeing the benefits"". However, on the day of the vote, SNP MPs announced they would be abstaining because the UK government had ""failed to make the case"" for the move. Transport spokesman Alan Brown said SNP members ""could not vote for a third runway at Heathrow with no guarantees of the benefits"". Protestors campaigned against the third runway outside the SNP conference in Aberdeen The UK government faced opposition in its own ranks, with a number of Conservatives who represent seats in Heathrow's flight path rebelling. Last week junior trade minister Greg Hands resigned from the government to oppose expansion of Heathrow Airport. Mr Hands, who represents the Chelsea and Fulham constituency in London, said he had pledged to oppose the new runway at the 2017 election. The highest profile opponent of Heathrow expansion in the cabinet is Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, who once pledged to lie down in front of bulldozers to stop it happening. But he was visiting Afghanistan and unable to attend the vote in the House of Commons. Labour is also divided on the controversial issue, with members of the party's leadership, such as shadow chancellor John McDonnell, opposed to it, but high-profile trade union backers in favour. The party's MPs were allowed to vote however they wanted on the issue. Campaigners argue that a new runway will breach the UK's legal limits on air pollution and increase noise pollution with an extra 700 planes a day.

"Gayle and Charlie Anderson were described as ""pillars of the community"" Two British grandparents found dead at their home in Jamaica are thought to have been murdered, police have said. Charlie Anderson, 75, and his wife Gayle, 71, from Manchester, had recently retired to the Caribbean island. They were found dead by neighbours in their home in Mount Pleasant on Friday afternoon. Their sons said in a statement they were ""completely devastated"" by the deaths of the ""hugely popular"" couple. The couple, who were also known as Halford and Florence, lived in a rural community in Hope Bay, Portland, on the north-east of the island. It has been reported locally they had recently called in police to investigate money they said had been fraudulently taken from a bank card. Jamaican police confirmed they were involved in another ongoing investigation but said they had not yet established a motive for the killing. The couple's deaths come as Jamaican authorities seek to tackle a crime wave which has resulted in more than 1,600 murders in 2017. So far this year more than 600 people have been killed, including seven people who had returned to the island after living abroad. A limited state of emergency has been put in place in two high crime areas in an effort to cut the murder rate. In a statement, the couple's sons said: ""Our parents Charlie and Gayle enjoyed a long and happy marriage of 55 years and leave behind their four grandchildren and one great-grandchild. ""They were hardworking people, building a business with integrity and making sure we were always provided for. ""Charlie and Gayle were pillars of the community in Manchester and Jamaica, and were hugely popular and loved by many. ""They were just beginning the next chapter of their lives, retiring to Jamaica before this terrible tragedy. ""We would like to thank our friends, family and community for their prayers and support.

"The plan proposes bans on sweets and junk food promotions in the aisles and online Sweets and fatty snacks sold at checkouts and as part of supermarket deals will be banned under new government proposals to halve childhood obesity in England by 2030. Tighter restrictions on junk food ads on TV and online are also planned, as well as mandatory calorie labelling on restaurant menus. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the measures gave ""power to parents to make healthier choices"". The plans have been broadly welcomed. The proposals form part of the government's updated Childhood Obesity Plan, which was widely criticised for being too weak when it was launched two years ago. What to do if your child is overweight Is UK one of the worst child obesity nations? Will new obesity measures help you? With one in three children now overweight or obese by the age of 11, this updated plan targets stores, industry and advertisers that use ""pester power"" to sell food high in fat, sugar and salt to children and families. It also pledges to ""help close the deprivation gap"" by looking at why children from poorer areas are more than twice as likely to be overweight. The plan encourages all primary schools to introduce a daily ""active mile"" for children. Official advice recommends children should do 60 minutes of activity per day. The measures, which will open for consultation by the end of the year, include: Banning the sale of sweets and snacks at checkouts, shop entrances and in buy-one-get-one-free deals New restrictions on advertising unhealthy food to children on TV and online, which could include a pre-9pm ban Clear calorie labelling in restaurants, cafes and takeaways, to help families know what they are eating Ending the sale of energy drinks containing high levels of caffeine, to children Mr Hunt told the BBC that under the proposals all the big restaurant chains would have to provide calorie labelling, but there could be possible exemptions for smaller businesses. He said the cost of obesity was too great to ignore. ""Parents are asking for help - we know that over three quarters of parents find offers for sugary sweets and snacks at checkouts annoying. ""It's our job to give power to parents to make healthier choices, and to make their life easier in doing so."" Halving childhood obesity in England in the next 12 years would mean 700,000 fewer children being obese by 2030, the government said. Five surprising things that affect weight Can we trust BMI to measure obesity? Are 22,000 children 'severely obese'? Prof Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, called the plan ""strong, robust and bold"" while Public Health England said the steps announced would help ""turn the tide"" on the obesity epidemic. Prof Russell Viner, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said the measures would ""help all families to make healthy choices and make a real difference in the lives of children and young people"". Tim Elwell-Sutton, assistant director at the Health Foundation, said it was a ""positive step forward"" but ""we await to see how these ideas will be turned into action"", while Caroline Cerny, of the Obesity Health Alliance, urged ""swift action"" to ""make these commitments a reality"". The British Retail Consortium said retailers were ""fully committed"" to the health of their customers. Some supermarkets, including Tesco, Aldi and Waitrose, have already stopped selling sweets and chocolate at checkouts. Scotland's First Minister set atarget to cut child obesity by half by 2030in May. Scotland's Public Health Minister, Aileen Campbell, said the government would be setting out its diet and healthy weight delivery plan ""very soon"", adding that it had been ""clear in its intention"" to tackle price promotions on junk food. A sugar taxon manufacturers who sell high-sugar drinks came into force in April in the UK. It means some drinks have increased in price while other brands have cut the sugar content of their drinks to avoid the levy. The tax currently doesn't cover flavoured milk drinks but it could in the future. The jury is still out on whether the tax will have the intended effect of putting people off buying and consuming sugary soft drinks, which are thought to be the biggest contributor to obesity. Public Health England has also started a programme challenging manufacturers to reduce sugar content in products like cakes, biscuits and cereals by 20% over the next four years. The UK has one of the highest proportions of overweight and obese children in the EU. In England, 22% of children are overweight or obese when they start school at the age of four or five, increasing to 34% during their time at primary school. Recent figures show thatone in 25 children aged 10 or 11 is severely obese. Children are measured in different ways and at different ages across the UK. In Wales, 26% of children aged four to five are overweight or obese, and in Scotland 14% of under-16s are at risk of obesity. Childhood obesity is a worldwide problem, but it's estimated to cost the UK economy Â£27bn a year, and the NHS around Â£5bn, in treating illnesses related to the issue, such as type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer.

""Anyone who has lost their granny over the past 30 years when opiates were administered by this equipment will be asking themselves, 'Is that what killed Granny?',"" the whistleblower told the paper. Mr Hunt said claims of a cover-up had been ""categorically denied"" by the independent panel, who had a ""free hand"", adding ""if they thought there was an issue with the syringe drivers I know they would have said so"". This video can not be played Hundreds of lives were cut short due to prescribed opioids at Gosport War Memorial Hospital The syringe drivers, called Graseby MS26 and Graseby MS16A, were loaded with capsules and programmed to release drugs into a patient's bloodstream over an extended period They delivered drugs at different rates - MS26 delivered in mm per 24 hours, MS16A delivered in mm per hour Cases emerged of the drivers being confused, causing dangerous over-infusion of drugs The NHS's Purchasing and Supply Agency (PSA) said the devices appeared ""very similar aside from colour"" Hazard notices were issued by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to ensure NHS staff knew the difference between the models In 1994, the NHS in Scotland issued a hazard notice warning of the risk of death due to confusion between the two models causing drugs to be delivered at the incorrect rate. Australia and New Zealand had programmes in the late 2000s to remove the devices from use. A 2008 paper by the NHS's Purchasing and Supply Agency (PSA), which closed in 2010, said the devices were an ""essential component of palliative care"". An estimated 40,000 devices - a quarter of the worldwide total - were in the UK, the majority in primary care. The syringes were briefly mentioned in the report released on Wednesday looking into the deaths at Gosport War Memorial Hospital. The report said: ""The panel has considered issues concerned with the particular syringe drivers, known by their tradename of Graseby, and is aware of the hazard notices which applied. ""The panel's analysis does not rest upon any issue relating to these notices."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""While there is a range of statutory requirements to monitor and improve safe management and use of controlled drugs, we would not hesitate to take further action to improve safety.""

"This video can not be played DUP leader stands for Irish national anthem at GAA match Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster has attended a major Gaelic games match for the first time. She was among the crowd at the Ulster Football Final between Donegal and Fermanagh in County Monaghan. Speaking before the game, Mrs Foster said she realised that some may be ""uncomfortable"" with her attendance, but that her party wanted to take steps towards a ""shared society"". Mrs Foster stood for the Irish national anthem. It is the first time a senior unionist politician has gone to a Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) game since Peter Robinson in 2012. Mrs Foster took her seat for the match near Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill. Arlene Foster meets GAA team ahead of final Peter Robinson backed for attending GAA match DUP sports minister tries GAA This video can not be played Arlene Foster attends a GAA match in County Monaghan She was accompanied into the stadium by DUP MLA Christopher Stalford and Irish Enterprise Minister Heather Humphreys, a TD (MP) for Cavan-Monaghan. Speaking as she arrived, Mrs Foster said: ""Of course it's not my first time in Clones, I grew up not so very far away from here, but it is my first time at St Tiernach's Park. ""I want to say a big thank you to the Ulster Council of the GAA for the very warm welcome that I've received."" She added: ""I do realise that there are some people that may be uncomfortable with me being here today on a Sunday, but let me say this, I am the leader of a political party that wants to have a shared society in Northern Ireland and to do that we have to take steps forward. ""To do that we also have to build a respect and a tolerance and that's what I want to do. I hope that others will take the chance to step forward as well and to understand and appreciate and tolerate another culture perhaps that isn't theirs. ""I understand the significance of me being here as well today, so I hope I enjoy today."" Mrs Foster, who is from County Fermanagh, met members of her native county's team last Saturday. The final score was Donegal 2-18 Fermanagh 0-12. Councillor Howard Thornton, the Ulster Unionist chair of Fermanagh and Omagh Council, also attended the match. Arlene Foster was welcomed by cheers of 'Come on Arlene' when she entered St. Tiernach's Park in Clones, County Monaghan Richard Morgan, BBC News NI reporter Arlene Foster arrived to cheers and claps and chants of ""Come on Arlene"". It was all smiles from Mrs Foster who, when I asked if she was happy to be here, said she was. Many Fermanagh fans welcomed her arrival at Clones. The dozen or so people I spoke to believe it is a good thing for the county, and for politics. When asked at Clones about Mrs Foster's attendance, Michelle Gildernew said: ""It's only but right. It's a huge day for Fermanagh, for the entire county, and I'm hoping everyone enjoys the match. ""She'll certainly see a spectacle she never expected to see."" Fermanagh (in green) are taking on Donegal in the Ulster Football Championship final on Sunday Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporter Arlene Foster has gone where no senior unionist politician has gone before - her decision to cross the Irish border to County Monaghan for this game will not go unnoticed. DUP politicians have, in the past, attended GAA games in Northern Ireland, but today's journey is significant for the former first minister who once said she didn't do ""gesture politics"". She will attempt to reach out to another community later this week when she attends an LGBT event at Stormont. Whispers that these moves could mark the beginning of a defrosting of relations to try to jumpstart talks with Sinn FÃ©in this autumn may be somewhat premature. And there may be others who feel Mrs Foster's actions are simply a box-ticking exercise or photo opportunity. But longer term, history may look back kindly on the current DUP leader for making the journey to Clones to cheer on her home team. The first page of the GAA's official guide outlines that the organisation's ""basic aim is the strengthening of national identity in a 32-county Ireland through the preservation and promotion of Gaelic games and past times"". It is a statement that underlines the nationalist ethos of the 134-year-old organisation - and has fuelled unionist mistrust. However, in recent years, moves by both unionist politicians and the GAA have becoming symbolic of a thawing relationship. The GAA abolished Rule 21, which banned members of the security forces from being members of the GAA, in 2001 and modified Rule 42 in 2005, which allowed rugby and football to be played in Croke Park, the GAA's headquarters, for the first time. Meanwhile,the DUP's Edwin Poots became the party's first politician to attend a GAA match in an official capacity,externalin 2008 in his then role as Stormont's sports minister. Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness were the guests of the GAA's Ulster Council at the Dr McKenna Cup final in 2012 In 2012, then first minister Peter Robinson attended the Dr McKenna Cup final along with then deputy first minister Martin McGuinness. At the time, party colleague Gregory Campbell described it as a ""symbolic gesture"" and said the ""GAA were travelling in the right direction for some time now"". However, he said there was still more work to do and unionists have often cited the naming of stadiums and clubs after former IRA members as reasons for concern. In 2010,Ulster Unionist Party leader Tom Elliott said he had no interest in attending a GAA match. While he later rowed back from that position, his position is reflected by many in the unionist community. This move by Arlene Foster - at the biggest occasion in Ulster GAA - is the biggest sign of rapprochement between unionism and the GAA to date.

"This video can not be played Does it matter who's in charge of Turkey? Polls have closed in the Turkish elections - where voters are deciding whether to grant President Recep Tayyip Erdogan a second five-year term. He has faced a tough battle with Muharrem Ince, a centre-left candidate who has energised the opposition. Casting his own vote, the president claimed there had been a high turnout. First results are due later on Sunday. If Mr Erdogan wins, he will adopt major new powers that critics say will weaken democratic rule. He is hoping to get more than 50% of the vote in this ballot to avoid going to a second round. As well as the presidency, voters are also choosing members of parliament. Turkey remains under a state of emergency imposed in the aftermath of a failed coup in July 2016. These elections were originally scheduled for November 2019 but were brought forward by Mr Erdogan. ""Turkey is going through a democratic revolution with this election,"" the president told reporters after he voted in Istanbul. Meanwhile Turkey's electoral commission said it would look into reports of ballot-stuffing and intimidation of observers in the southern Urfa province, which borders Syria. Mr Erdogan and Mr Ince both held huge rallies on Saturday, their final day of campaigning - and each branded the other unfit to run Turkey. Turkey's elections in 100 and 500 words Erdogan: Turkey's pugnacious president Reality Check: The numbers behind Turkey's crackdown Mr Ince, whose fiery campaigning has revitalised Turkey's demoralised opposition, promised to push back what he characterised as a slide into authoritarian rule under Mr Erdogan. ""If Erdogan wins, your phones will continue to be listened to... Fear will continue to reign,"" he told at least a million people gathered in Istanbul. ""If Ince wins, the courts will be independent."" Muharrem Ince has pledged to be a non-partisan leader if elected Mr Ince also said that if elected, he would lift Turkey's state of emergency within 48 hours. Emergency rule allows the government to bypass parliament. At his own rally, President Erdogan - who was prime minister for 11 years before becoming president in 2014 - used a violent metaphor to summarise his hoped-for result, asking supporters, ""Are we going to give them an Ottoman slap [a technique for knocking someone out] tomorrow?"" He accused Mr Ince - a former teacher and MP of 16 years - of lacking the skills to lead. ""It's one thing to be a physics teacher, it's another thing to run a country,"" Mr Erdogan said. ""Being president needs experience."" Mr Erdogan said Turkey was going through ""a democratic revolution"" He told supporters he planned to push through more major infrastructure projects to boost the economy. By Mark Lowen, BBC Turkey Correspondent Never in its modern history has this crucial country felt so divided. And never has Recep Tayyip Erdogan faced such a tough election fight. Turkey's most powerful leader since its founding father Ataturk would become more powerful still if he wins, scrapping the post of prime minister and weakening parliament. But if he fails to reach 50% in the presidential vote, he'll face a run-off, probably with Muharrem Ince, a fiery centre-left candidate who has electrified the campaign. In the parliamentary poll, a united opposition is hoping to deprive Mr Erdogan of his majority. Worshipped by his supporters, abhorred by his critics, this is President Erdogan's judgement day. Nobody can tell which way it will go. Two votes were held on Sunday - one to choose Turkey's next president, and another to pick members of parliament. Around 60 million Turks were eligible to take part. Six candidates are vying for the presidency, and if one of them wins more than 50% of the vote they will be elected outright. If nobody hits that threshold, the top two will face off in a second-round vote on 8 July. Mr Erdogan will be hoping to win decisively, as a run-off vote could end in defeat or narrow his margin of victory. In the parliamentary election, the president's AK Party (AKP) will face a tough battle to keep its majority in the 600-seat assembly. The contest pits a government-led coalition against an alliance of opposition parties. What is Turkey like? The full story: Life under President Erdogan The performance of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) could prove decisive. If it hits the 10% vote-share needed to enter parliament, it will be harder for the AKP to retain its dominance. The HDP's presidential candidate Selahattin Demirtas is presently detained in a high-security prison on terror charges, which he firmly denies. The biggest is the economy. The Turkish lira has tanked and inflation stands at around 11% - so ordinary people are feeling the squeeze. Terrorism is another vexed issue, as Turkey faces attacks from Kurdish militants and the jihadists of the Islamic State group. This video can not be played Turkey's economy is the biggest election issue: This is the story of farmer Metin Celik However, our correspondent says the country tends to vote along its big divides: one between Kurds and nationalists, and another between religious and secular people. Polls opened amid high security. In Istanbul alone, more than 38,000 police officers are expected to be on duty. Fears have been raised about possible voter intimidation, especially in south-eastern areas where Kurdish votes are key to the result. Massive crowds have turned out to hear Muharrem Ince on the campaign trail Electoral fraud is another potential risk, especially as a new law allows ballot papers to be counted even if they do not have the election board's stamp to mark them as genuine. Rights activists also say the press is not free to report on all sides. Under Mr Erdogan's rule, the country has become the world's biggest jailer of journalists, according to monitoring groups. Mr Erdogan too draws huge numbers - many are pictured here with Turkish and AK Party flags He would start his second term in a turbo-charged version of the job. The presidency was once a largely ceremonial role, butin April 2017, 51% of Turkish voters endorsed a new constitutionthat grants the president new powers. These include: Directly appointing top public officials, including ministers and vice-presidents The power to intervene in the country's legal system The power to impose a state of emergency The job of prime minister will also be scrapped. Critics have accused Mr Erdogan of trying to usher in one-man rule, and his rival candidates have said they would not bring in the changes. This video can not be played Could Turkey's next president be too powerful? If both elections go against the current president, Turkey's political landscape will change significantly. But if the presidency goes one way and parliament another, it could trigger a period of political instability in the years to come. The country has gone through a tumultuous period since the 2016 coup attempt. More than 160,000 people have been detained, according to the UN, as part of a crackdown on perceived followers of US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom the government accuses of being behind the plot. He denies any involvement.

"This video can not be played DUP leader stands for Irish national anthem at GAA match Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster has attended a major Gaelic games match for the first time. She was among the crowd at the Ulster Football Final between Donegal and Fermanagh in County Monaghan. Speaking before the game, Mrs Foster said she realised that some may be ""uncomfortable"" with her attendance, but that her party wanted to take steps towards a ""shared society"". Mrs Foster stood for the Irish national anthem. It is the first time a senior unionist politician has gone to a Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) game since Peter Robinson in 2012. Mrs Foster took her seat for the match near Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill. Arlene Foster meets GAA team ahead of final Peter Robinson backed for attending GAA match DUP sports minister tries GAA This video can not be played Arlene Foster attends a GAA match in County Monaghan She was accompanied into the stadium by DUP MLA Christopher Stalford and Irish Enterprise Minister Heather Humphreys, a TD (MP) for Cavan-Monaghan. Speaking as she arrived, Mrs Foster said: ""Of course it's not my first time in Clones, I grew up not so very far away from here, but it is my first time at St Tiernach's Park. ""I want to say a big thank you to the Ulster Council of the GAA for the very warm welcome that I've received."" She added: ""I do realise that there are some people that may be uncomfortable with me being here today on a Sunday, but let me say this, I am the leader of a political party that wants to have a shared society in Northern Ireland and to do that we have to take steps forward. ""To do that we also have to build a respect and a tolerance and that's what I want to do. I hope that others will take the chance to step forward as well and to understand and appreciate and tolerate another culture perhaps that isn't theirs. ""I understand the significance of me being here as well today, so I hope I enjoy today."" Mrs Foster, who is from County Fermanagh, met members of her native county's team last Saturday. The final score was Donegal 2-18 Fermanagh 0-12. Councillor Howard Thornton, the Ulster Unionist chair of Fermanagh and Omagh Council, also attended the match. Arlene Foster was welcomed by cheers of 'Come on Arlene' when she entered St. Tiernach's Park in Clones, County Monaghan Richard Morgan, BBC News NI reporter Arlene Foster arrived to cheers and claps and chants of ""Come on Arlene"". It was all smiles from Mrs Foster who, when I asked if she was happy to be here, said she was. Many Fermanagh fans welcomed her arrival at Clones. The dozen or so people I spoke to believe it is a good thing for the county, and for politics. When asked at Clones about Mrs Foster's attendance, Michelle Gildernew said: ""It's only but right. It's a huge day for Fermanagh, for the entire county, and I'm hoping everyone enjoys the match. ""She'll certainly see a spectacle she never expected to see."" Fermanagh (in green) are taking on Donegal in the Ulster Football Championship final on Sunday Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporter Arlene Foster has gone where no senior unionist politician has gone before - her decision to cross the Irish border to County Monaghan for this game will not go unnoticed. DUP politicians have, in the past, attended GAA games in Northern Ireland, but today's journey is significant for the former first minister who once said she didn't do ""gesture politics"". She will attempt to reach out to another community later this week when she attends an LGBT event at Stormont. Whispers that these moves could mark the beginning of a defrosting of relations to try to jumpstart talks with Sinn FÃ©in this autumn may be somewhat premature. And there may be others who feel Mrs Foster's actions are simply a box-ticking exercise or photo opportunity. But longer term, history may look back kindly on the current DUP leader for making the journey to Clones to cheer on her home team. The first page of the GAA's official guide outlines that the organisation's ""basic aim is the strengthening of national identity in a 32-county Ireland through the preservation and promotion of Gaelic games and past times"". It is a statement that underlines the nationalist ethos of the 134-year-old organisation - and has fuelled unionist mistrust. However, in recent years, moves by both unionist politicians and the GAA have becoming symbolic of a thawing relationship. The GAA abolished Rule 21, which banned members of the security forces from being members of the GAA, in 2001 and modified Rule 42 in 2005, which allowed rugby and football to be played in Croke Park, the GAA's headquarters, for the first time. Meanwhile,the DUP's Edwin Poots became the party's first politician to attend a GAA match in an official capacity,externalin 2008 in his then role as Stormont's sports minister. Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness were the guests of the GAA's Ulster Council at the Dr McKenna Cup final in 2012 In 2012, then first minister Peter Robinson attended the Dr McKenna Cup final along with then deputy first minister Martin McGuinness. At the time, party colleague Gregory Campbell described it as a ""symbolic gesture"" and said the ""GAA were travelling in the right direction for some time now"". However, he said there was still more work to do and unionists have often cited the naming of stadiums and clubs after former IRA members as reasons for concern. In 2010,Ulster Unionist Party leader Tom Elliott said he had no interest in attending a GAA match. While he later rowed back from that position, his position is reflected by many in the unionist community. This move by Arlene Foster - at the biggest occasion in Ulster GAA - is the biggest sign of rapprochement between unionism and the GAA to date.

"Nicole Mone found out two months into her pregnancy that her baby was not developing properly An Arizona woman has said she was left ""in tears and humiliated"" after a staff member at US pharmacy chain Walgreens refused to give her prescription medication to end her pregnancy - even though her doctor had said she would ultimately have a miscarriage. Nicole Mone had discovered at a doctor's appointment on Tuesday that her baby was not developing normally. Knowing her two-month pregnancy would not run to term, she was given a choice to end it through a surgical procedure or prescription medication, and chose the latter. When she went to a Walgreens in the city of Peoria to get her prescription, she says a pharmacist refused to serve her on moral grounds - a stance which is within the company's rules. She told the BBC the staff member was ""very short, not compassionate at all"". Ms Mone, 35, shared a picture of a business card identifying the pharmacist on social media. The BBC contacted the store to seek a response from him, but was told he was not available. ""I stood at the mercy of this pharmacist explaining my situation in front of my 7-year-old and five customers standing behind, only to be denied because of his ethical beliefs,""Ms Mone wrote on Facebook,externaland Instagram. ""I get it, we all have our beliefs. But what he failed to understand is, this isn't the situation I had hoped for - this isn't something I wanted. This is something I have zero control over. He has no idea what it's like to want nothing more than to carry a child to full term and be unable to do so."" Ms Mone wrote that she had suffered a previous miscarriage. 'I felt like miscarriage was my fault' Losing a pregnancy in Iraq changed how I see miscarriage She said her young son was left ""trying to figure out what's going on, watching me get upset and trying to figure out why"". ""I left Walgreens in tears, ashamed and feeling humiliated by a man who knows nothing of my struggles but feels it is his right to deny medication prescribed to me by my doctor,"" she wrote. Walgreens told the BBC it was looking into what had happened Ms Mone said she was sharing her story as she didn't want other women to endure similar experiences when they were ""vulnerable and already suffering"". In a statement to the BBC, Walgreens said it was looking into the matter, and had ""reached out to the patient and apologised for how the situation was handled"". It said company policy allowed its pharmacists to ""step away from filling a prescription for which they have a moral objection"". In that situation, staff are required to refer the prescription to another pharmacist or manager ""to meet the patient's needs in a timely manner"". Ms Mone said that did not reflect her experience, however, as the pharmacist ""could have just passed me on to the lady that was standing next to him"" - which she says did not happen. Instead, the prescription was transferred to another Walgreens store. Ms Mone picked it up there after seeking her doctor's help to ensure the second pharmacy would give it to her. She said that Walgreens had not reached out to her to apologise, but that a store manager said she was sorry when Ms Mone telephoned to flag up the incident a day later. In an update to her original Facebook post, which had drawn 33,000 reactions at time of writing, Ms Mone said she had contacted Walgreens corporate office, and filed a complaint with the state Board of Pharmacy. ""Thank you to those who have shown love and support,"" she added.

"This video can not be played Does it matter who's in charge of Turkey? Polls have closed in the Turkish elections - where voters are deciding whether to grant President Recep Tayyip Erdogan a second five-year term. He has faced a tough battle with Muharrem Ince, a centre-left candidate who has energised the opposition. Casting his own vote, the president claimed there had been a high turnout. First results are due later on Sunday. If Mr Erdogan wins, he will adopt major new powers that critics say will weaken democratic rule. He is hoping to get more than 50% of the vote in this ballot to avoid going to a second round. As well as the presidency, voters are also choosing members of parliament. Turkey remains under a state of emergency imposed in the aftermath of a failed coup in July 2016. These elections were originally scheduled for November 2019 but were brought forward by Mr Erdogan. ""Turkey is going through a democratic revolution with this election,"" the president told reporters after he voted in Istanbul. Meanwhile Turkey's electoral commission said it would look into reports of ballot-stuffing and intimidation of observers in the southern Urfa province, which borders Syria. Mr Erdogan and Mr Ince both held huge rallies on Saturday, their final day of campaigning - and each branded the other unfit to run Turkey. Turkey's elections in 100 and 500 words Erdogan: Turkey's pugnacious president Reality Check: The numbers behind Turkey's crackdown Mr Ince, whose fiery campaigning has revitalised Turkey's demoralised opposition, promised to push back what he characterised as a slide into authoritarian rule under Mr Erdogan. ""If Erdogan wins, your phones will continue to be listened to... Fear will continue to reign,"" he told at least a million people gathered in Istanbul. ""If Ince wins, the courts will be independent."" Muharrem Ince has pledged to be a non-partisan leader if elected Mr Ince also said that if elected, he would lift Turkey's state of emergency within 48 hours. Emergency rule allows the government to bypass parliament. At his own rally, President Erdogan - who was prime minister for 11 years before becoming president in 2014 - used a violent metaphor to summarise his hoped-for result, asking supporters, ""Are we going to give them an Ottoman slap [a technique for knocking someone out] tomorrow?"" He accused Mr Ince - a former teacher and MP of 16 years - of lacking the skills to lead. ""It's one thing to be a physics teacher, it's another thing to run a country,"" Mr Erdogan said. ""Being president needs experience."" Mr Erdogan said Turkey was going through ""a democratic revolution"" He told supporters he planned to push through more major infrastructure projects to boost the economy. By Mark Lowen, BBC Turkey Correspondent Never in its modern history has this crucial country felt so divided. And never has Recep Tayyip Erdogan faced such a tough election fight. Turkey's most powerful leader since its founding father Ataturk would become more powerful still if he wins, scrapping the post of prime minister and weakening parliament. But if he fails to reach 50% in the presidential vote, he'll face a run-off, probably with Muharrem Ince, a fiery centre-left candidate who has electrified the campaign. In the parliamentary poll, a united opposition is hoping to deprive Mr Erdogan of his majority. Worshipped by his supporters, abhorred by his critics, this is President Erdogan's judgement day. Nobody can tell which way it will go. Two votes were held on Sunday - one to choose Turkey's next president, and another to pick members of parliament. Around 60 million Turks were eligible to take part. Six candidates are vying for the presidency, and if one of them wins more than 50% of the vote they will be elected outright. If nobody hits that threshold, the top two will face off in a second-round vote on 8 July. Mr Erdogan will be hoping to win decisively, as a run-off vote could end in defeat or narrow his margin of victory. In the parliamentary election, the president's AK Party (AKP) will face a tough battle to keep its majority in the 600-seat assembly. The contest pits a government-led coalition against an alliance of opposition parties. What is Turkey like? The full story: Life under President Erdogan The performance of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) could prove decisive. If it hits the 10% vote-share needed to enter parliament, it will be harder for the AKP to retain its dominance. The HDP's presidential candidate Selahattin Demirtas is presently detained in a high-security prison on terror charges, which he firmly denies. The biggest is the economy. The Turkish lira has tanked and inflation stands at around 11% - so ordinary people are feeling the squeeze. Terrorism is another vexed issue, as Turkey faces attacks from Kurdish militants and the jihadists of the Islamic State group. This video can not be played Turkey's economy is the biggest election issue: This is the story of farmer Metin Celik However, our correspondent says the country tends to vote along its big divides: one between Kurds and nationalists, and another between religious and secular people. Polls opened amid high security. In Istanbul alone, more than 38,000 police officers are expected to be on duty. Fears have been raised about possible voter intimidation, especially in south-eastern areas where Kurdish votes are key to the result. Massive crowds have turned out to hear Muharrem Ince on the campaign trail Electoral fraud is another potential risk, especially as a new law allows ballot papers to be counted even if they do not have the election board's stamp to mark them as genuine. Rights activists also say the press is not free to report on all sides. Under Mr Erdogan's rule, the country has become the world's biggest jailer of journalists, according to monitoring groups. Mr Erdogan too draws huge numbers - many are pictured here with Turkish and AK Party flags He would start his second term in a turbo-charged version of the job. The presidency was once a largely ceremonial role, butin April 2017, 51% of Turkish voters endorsed a new constitutionthat grants the president new powers. These include: Directly appointing top public officials, including ministers and vice-presidents The power to intervene in the country's legal system The power to impose a state of emergency The job of prime minister will also be scrapped. Critics have accused Mr Erdogan of trying to usher in one-man rule, and his rival candidates have said they would not bring in the changes. This video can not be played Could Turkey's next president be too powerful? If both elections go against the current president, Turkey's political landscape will change significantly. But if the presidency goes one way and parliament another, it could trigger a period of political instability in the years to come. The country has gone through a tumultuous period since the 2016 coup attempt. More than 160,000 people have been detained, according to the UN, as part of a crackdown on perceived followers of US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom the government accuses of being behind the plot. He denies any involvement.

"Forensics have spent most of the morning searching the scene for evidence A 15-year-old boy has been stabbed to death in a fight after a birthday party at a community centre in east London. Three teenage boys have been arrested on suspicion of murder and have been taken to separate police stations for questioning. The Met Police said they were called to the centre in Romford on Saturday night after fighting broke out as youngsters left a birthday party. The boy is the youngest victim to be fatally stabbed in London this year. Police were first called to the North Romford Community Centre on Clockhouse Lane at 21:05 BST. According to the Met, a fight broke out and the centre was damaged. The BBC has identified more than 80 murder investigations have now been launched across London this year by both the Metropolitan and City of London Police. There had been reports of fighting after a birthday party at the North Romford Community Centre A woman, who lives close to the community centre and gave her name only as Carol, described hearing friends of the victim screaming and sobbing. She said: ""I heard a lad crying down the phone 'he's dead, he's dead'."" ""He was lying down in the road, there was a lot of blood. The police were working on him, they tried their absolute damnedest with that boy last night. ""Nobody should die like that."" Carol said youngsters spilled on to the surrounding streets after too many people showed up to the party and the community centre stopped letting people in. The victim has become the ninth teenager to have been fatally stabbed in London this year Det Sgt Gurj Singh said: ""Response officers who attended the initial calls were confronted with up to 100 youths leaving a birthday party gathering at a community centre."" Romford MP Andrew Rosindell said it was ""devastating"" that a young life had ""so tragically been cut short on our streets tonight"".

"The prop is mainly made of wood A ""blaster"" used by Harrison Ford's character Han Solo in the film Return of the Jedi has sold at auction in New York for $550,000 (Â£415,000). The weapon, made mostly of wood, had previously spent more than 30 years in the possession of the film's art director James Schoppe. It sold for more than a lightsaber used by Mark Hamill in the first two Star Wars films, which fetched $450,000. Mr Schoppe was nominated for an Oscar for his work on the film. He put about 40 other items up for auction, including an Ewok axe and plans for Jabba the Hutt's ship. Han Solo brandishing the blaster in Return of the Jedi The Ewok axe went for $11,250 and another blaster prop fetched $90,624, Julien's Auctions said.

"Jackie (left) and Gillian (right) are twins but have very different BMIs People might think battling obesity is down to sheer willpower, but medical research says otherwise. Here are five potentially surprising factors that can affect your weight, as unearthed byThe Truth About Obesity. Gillian and Jackie are twins - but one weighs over six stone (41kg) more than the other. Prof Tim Spector has been tracking their progress over 25 years, as part of the Twins Research UK study. He believes a lot of their weight differences are down to the tiny organisms - microbes - that live deep in the gut. ""Every time you eat anything, you're feeding a hundred trillion microbes. You're never dining alone,"" he says. Can we trust BMI to measure obesity? Is it wrong to be blunt about obesity? A stool sample from each twin revealed Gillian, the thinner of the two, had a very diverse range of microbes, whereas Jackie had very few species living in her gut. ""The greater the diversity, the skinnier the person.  If you're carrying too much weight, your microbes aren't as diverse as they should be,"" says Prof Spector, who found the same pattern in a study of 5,000 people. Having a healthy and varied diet, rich in different sources of fibre, has been shown to create a more diverse range of gut microbes. Prof Spector warns most Britons eat only half the fibre they should. Good sources of dietary fibre include: wholegrain breakfast cereals fruits, including berries and pears vegetables, such as broccoli and carrots beans pulses nuts Why do some people diligently follow diets and exercise regularly but still struggle to see results, while others do very little and don't pile on the pounds? Scientists at Cambridge University believe 40-70% of the effect on our weight is down to variation in the genes we inherit. ""It is a lottery,"" says Prof Sadaf Farooqi. ""It is now very clear that genes are involved in regulating our weight, and if you have a particular fault in some genes that can be enough to drive obesity."" Particular genes can affect a person's appetite, how much food they want to eat and what type of food they might prefer. Genes can also affect how we burn calories and whether our bodies can efficiently handle fat. There are at least 100 that can affect weight, including one called MC4R. It is thought about one in every 1,000 people carries a defective version of the MC4R gene, which works in the brain to control hunger and appetite. People with a fault in this gene tend to be more hungry and crave higher fat foods. Prof Farooqi says: ""There's not really anything you can do about your genes, but for some people, knowing that genes may increase their chances of gaining weight can help them to deal with changes in diet and exercise.""

Doctors say that carrying too much fat around your belly can increase your risk of health problems. Excess fat in this area can stress internal organs - even if your BMI is in the healthy range.   Your waist size is[size] For [gender_plural], the NHS says a waist size of: 80cm (31.5 inches) or more means an increased risk of health problems 88cm (34 inches) or more means a very high risk of health problems 94cm (37 inches) or more means an increased risk of health problems 102cm (40 inches) or more means a very high risk of health problems People from non-white ethnic groupsmay be at risk at a lower waist size How to check your waist with just a piece of string If you can't see the calculatortap or click here,external. Can we trust BMI to measure obesity? There's some truth to the old saying: ""Breakfast like a king, lunch like a lord and dinner like a pauper,"" but not for the reasons you might think. Obesity expert Dr James Brown says the later we eat, the more likely we are to gain weight. Not because we're less active at night, as is commonly believed, but because of our internal body clocks. ""The body is set-up to handle calories much more efficiently during the daytime period when it's light than it is at night when it's dark"" he says. For that reason, people who do shift-work and erratic hours might face a particular battle to stave off weight gain. During the night our bodies struggle to digest fats and sugars so eating the bulk of calories before about 19:00 can help you lose weight or prevent you from gaining it in the first place. ""Go to work on an egg"" isn't a bad idea Over the past decade, the average dinnertime in Britain has moved from 17:00 to around 20:00, and this has contributed to rising obesity levels, according to Dr Brown. But today's working patterns and hectic lifestyles aside, there are things we can do that will make a difference to our waistlines. Skipping breakfast or just having a piece of toast is a no-no in Dr Brown's book. Instead, eating something with lots of protein and some fat, as well as carbohydrates - such as eggs on wholegrain toast - will make you feel fuller for longer. Follow that up with a substantial nutritious lunch, and have something lighter at dinnertime. TheBehavioural Insights Team,externalsuggests Britons are bad at keeping track of how much they eat, and that calorie consumption is being underestimated by 30-50% as a result. Behavioural scientist Hugo Harper suggests a number of ways to subconsciously change your eating behaviour, rather than rely on calorie counting. For example, removing visual temptations might be more effective than relying on conscious willpower. So don't have unhealthy snacks out on the kitchen counter - put a fruit bowl or healthy snacks in reach instead. Don't sit down with a whole packet of biscuits in front of the television, put the number you plan to eat on a plate and take that through instead. Dr Harper also encourages substitution behaviours - swapping to lower calorie alternatives of favourite foods rather than trying to banish them all together. Opt for diet versions of soft drinks, for example. And reducing portion sizes can also be more effective than trying to cut out that ritual afternoon tea with a chocolate biscuit (or is that just us?). Not now Fido! ""People don't tend to notice a difference when their portion sizes are reduced by 5-10%,"" Dr Harper says. There is a tendency to eat without thinking about it, so following the serving suggestions on food packets and using a smaller plate when dishing up dinner can prevent someone absent-mindedly chomping through excess calories. The success of bariatric surgery isn't just down to creating a smaller stomach, but the change in hormones it creates. Our appetites are controlled by our hormones and it has been discovered that bariatric surgery - the most effective treatment of obesity - makes the hormones that make us feel full increase and the ones that make us feel hungry drop in number. But its a major operation that involves reducing the size of the stomach by up to 90% and is only carried out on people with a BMI of at least 35. Researchers at Imperial College London have recreated the gut hormones that cause appetite changes after bariatric surgery and are using this for a new clinical trial. A mixture of three hormones are given to patients as an injection every day for four weeks. ""Patients are feeling less hungry, they're eating less and they're losing between 2-8kg (4-17lb) in just 28 days,"" says Dr Tricia Tan. If the drug is proven safe, the plan is to use it until the patients reach a healthy weight.

"Knowing your weight and height is enough to calculate your body mass index You've been using ourfat calculatorin your droves, working out your BMI (body mass index) and comparing the result with people in your age group and your part of the UK. But a few people have been critical. They say using BMI to measure whether they are healthy, overweight or obese is misleading. So what's the truth? Can we trust what it tells us? Firstly, it is a quick and easy way of working out whether you are in the healthy category by using two simple measures - weight and height. Most doctors say it is the best method they have, it's pretty accurate, can be measured simply in clinic and is acceptable to patients. ""It works in the vast majority of people, the vast majority of time,"" says Prof Naveed Sattar, from the University of Glasgow. ""If two people are the same height and one has a BMI of 25 and the other a BMI of 40, then excess body fat is the reason.""

No, not all. And this provoked a few comments along these lines: ""Why, in this day and age, are you using BMI to tell people they are overweight? It is an outdated method that does not take into consideration muscle and actual health!  I am extremely fit and healthy with a low body fat percentage, yet your BMI tells me (and many more self-conscious girls) that I am overweight!"" There are some people who carry a lot of muscle and little fat, like bodybuilders, boxers and rugby players. Muscle is much denser than fat so they may end up with a BMI that classes them as obese, despite the fact they may be fit and healthy. Some professional rugby players will be classed as obese because of their high muscle mass - but this is rare But this is thought to apply to fewer than 1% of the population. Most people aren't extreme athletes. Tim Cole, professor of medical statistics, at University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, said BMI was ""still extremely relevant"". ""You don't see many bodybuilders around but you do see lots of people with large waists. Many people get exercised about that wrongly."" As people age, they lose muscle and may be classed in the ""healthy weight"" range even though they may be carrying excess fat. This is particularly true of smokers. BMI also doesn't apply to pregnant women, and some ethnic groups have a higher risk of health problems at lower BMI levels. It can't measure how much excess fat we have in our bodies - as opposed to muscle and bone - because that would require some pretty complicated and expensive medical procedures, which just aren't practical to carry out on the whole population. What it does do is give a healthy weight range for a particular height, taking into account variations in body shape - and it provides a good starting point for the majority of people. It also doesn't measure how fat is distributed throughout the body (some fat is ok; too much in the wrong place is a risk). Research shows that people who carry a lot of fat around their waists are at higher risk of health problems than those with more fat around their thighs and buttocks. They are more likely to have fat stored in their abdomen around key organs, which could increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes. So waist size may be a better way to monitor your health than BMI. That's why our calculator included an option for giving your waist size too. ""If people think they have lots of muscle mass, their waists should be lower for a given BMI - so they can easily check,"" says Prof Sattar. find the bottom of your ribs and the top of your hips wrap a tape measure around your waist midway between these points breathe out naturally before taking the measurement Regardless of your height or BMI, you should try to lose weight if your waist is: men - 94cm (37ins) or more women - 80cm (31.5ins) or more On its own, it can't. But doctors use BMI in conjunction with other measures - like blood pressure, cholesterol and family history - to work out an individual's risk of type 2 diabetes or heart disease, for example. Body mass index is not specific to any particular health risk - and that's its strength, experts say. However, a BMI above the healthy range or too much fat around the waist is known to increase the risk of serious health problems, including stroke and certain cancers. One person said of the BBC calculator: ""Your unscientific method of calculating 'fatness' is an unhelpful tool that dehumanises those who are obese or overweight, shaming them into losing weight and threatening their fragile relationship with their bodies."" There was no intention of shaming people - merely offering a way of finding out about your own weight because excess fat is the cause of an increased risk of a range of diseases. If you think you would like to lose some weight, you should go and see your GP for advice first.

"This video can not be played Does it matter who's in charge of Turkey? Polls have closed in the Turkish elections - where voters are deciding whether to grant President Recep Tayyip Erdogan a second five-year term. He has faced a tough battle with Muharrem Ince, a centre-left candidate who has energised the opposition. Casting his own vote, the president claimed there had been a high turnout. First results are due later on Sunday. If Mr Erdogan wins, he will adopt major new powers that critics say will weaken democratic rule. He is hoping to get more than 50% of the vote in this ballot to avoid going to a second round. As well as the presidency, voters are also choosing members of parliament. Turkey remains under a state of emergency imposed in the aftermath of a failed coup in July 2016. These elections were originally scheduled for November 2019 but were brought forward by Mr Erdogan. ""Turkey is going through a democratic revolution with this election,"" the president told reporters after he voted in Istanbul. Meanwhile Turkey's electoral commission said it would look into reports of ballot-stuffing and intimidation of observers in the southern Urfa province, which borders Syria. Mr Erdogan and Mr Ince both held huge rallies on Saturday, their final day of campaigning - and each branded the other unfit to run Turkey. Turkey's elections in 100 and 500 words Erdogan: Turkey's pugnacious president Reality Check: The numbers behind Turkey's crackdown Mr Ince, whose fiery campaigning has revitalised Turkey's demoralised opposition, promised to push back what he characterised as a slide into authoritarian rule under Mr Erdogan. ""If Erdogan wins, your phones will continue to be listened to... Fear will continue to reign,"" he told at least a million people gathered in Istanbul. ""If Ince wins, the courts will be independent."" Muharrem Ince has pledged to be a non-partisan leader if elected Mr Ince also said that if elected, he would lift Turkey's state of emergency within 48 hours. Emergency rule allows the government to bypass parliament. At his own rally, President Erdogan - who was prime minister for 11 years before becoming president in 2014 - used a violent metaphor to summarise his hoped-for result, asking supporters, ""Are we going to give them an Ottoman slap [a technique for knocking someone out] tomorrow?"" He accused Mr Ince - a former teacher and MP of 16 years - of lacking the skills to lead. ""It's one thing to be a physics teacher, it's another thing to run a country,"" Mr Erdogan said. ""Being president needs experience."" Mr Erdogan said Turkey was going through ""a democratic revolution"" He told supporters he planned to push through more major infrastructure projects to boost the economy. By Mark Lowen, BBC Turkey Correspondent Never in its modern history has this crucial country felt so divided. And never has Recep Tayyip Erdogan faced such a tough election fight. Turkey's most powerful leader since its founding father Ataturk would become more powerful still if he wins, scrapping the post of prime minister and weakening parliament. But if he fails to reach 50% in the presidential vote, he'll face a run-off, probably with Muharrem Ince, a fiery centre-left candidate who has electrified the campaign. In the parliamentary poll, a united opposition is hoping to deprive Mr Erdogan of his majority. Worshipped by his supporters, abhorred by his critics, this is President Erdogan's judgement day. Nobody can tell which way it will go. Two votes were held on Sunday - one to choose Turkey's next president, and another to pick members of parliament. Around 60 million Turks were eligible to take part. Six candidates are vying for the presidency, and if one of them wins more than 50% of the vote they will be elected outright. If nobody hits that threshold, the top two will face off in a second-round vote on 8 July. Mr Erdogan will be hoping to win decisively, as a run-off vote could end in defeat or narrow his margin of victory. In the parliamentary election, the president's AK Party (AKP) will face a tough battle to keep its majority in the 600-seat assembly. The contest pits a government-led coalition against an alliance of opposition parties. What is Turkey like? The full story: Life under President Erdogan The performance of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) could prove decisive. If it hits the 10% vote-share needed to enter parliament, it will be harder for the AKP to retain its dominance. The HDP's presidential candidate Selahattin Demirtas is presently detained in a high-security prison on terror charges, which he firmly denies. The biggest is the economy. The Turkish lira has tanked and inflation stands at around 11% - so ordinary people are feeling the squeeze. Terrorism is another vexed issue, as Turkey faces attacks from Kurdish militants and the jihadists of the Islamic State group. This video can not be played Turkey's economy is the biggest election issue: This is the story of farmer Metin Celik However, our correspondent says the country tends to vote along its big divides: one between Kurds and nationalists, and another between religious and secular people. Polls opened amid high security. In Istanbul alone, more than 38,000 police officers are expected to be on duty. Fears have been raised about possible voter intimidation, especially in south-eastern areas where Kurdish votes are key to the result. Massive crowds have turned out to hear Muharrem Ince on the campaign trail Electoral fraud is another potential risk, especially as a new law allows ballot papers to be counted even if they do not have the election board's stamp to mark them as genuine. Rights activists also say the press is not free to report on all sides. Under Mr Erdogan's rule, the country has become the world's biggest jailer of journalists, according to monitoring groups. Mr Erdogan too draws huge numbers - many are pictured here with Turkish and AK Party flags He would start his second term in a turbo-charged version of the job. The presidency was once a largely ceremonial role, butin April 2017, 51% of Turkish voters endorsed a new constitutionthat grants the president new powers. These include: Directly appointing top public officials, including ministers and vice-presidents The power to intervene in the country's legal system The power to impose a state of emergency The job of prime minister will also be scrapped. Critics have accused Mr Erdogan of trying to usher in one-man rule, and his rival candidates have said they would not bring in the changes. This video can not be played Could Turkey's next president be too powerful? If both elections go against the current president, Turkey's political landscape will change significantly. But if the presidency goes one way and parliament another, it could trigger a period of political instability in the years to come. The country has gone through a tumultuous period since the 2016 coup attempt. More than 160,000 people have been detained, according to the UN, as part of a crackdown on perceived followers of US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom the government accuses of being behind the plot. He denies any involvement.

"Sarah Sanders said she would continue to treat those with opposing views ""respectfully"" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was kicked out of a restaurant on Friday night because she works for President Donald Trump. A co-owner of the Red Hen in Lexington, Virginia, asked Ms Sanders and her family to leave as a protest against the Trump administration. Ms Sanders tweeted that ""her actions say far more about her than about me"". Stephanie Wilkinson said she believed Ms Sanders worked for an ""inhumane and unethical"" administration. She told the Washington Post,externalthat she decided to ask the Trump spokeswoman to leave the 26-seat, ""farm-to-table"" restaurant after talking to her staff. ""Tell me what you want me to do. I can ask her to leave,"" she said she told them. ""They said yes."" The incident comes days afterHomeland Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was booed at a Mexican restaurantin Washington DC. Both cases come amid increasing pressure on the US government over its controversial policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the Mexican border. Migrant families separation: The big picture explained Who has said what about US border crisis Psychological impact on separated children A decision by the administration to criminally prosecute every undocumented migrant crossing the border led to some 2,300 children being separated from their parents in May and June, and sparked a global wave of outrage. President Trump has now halted family separations but says he remains committed to the ""zero tolerance"" policy. Critics of the Red Hen's decision said that it was discriminatory. However, others compared the restaurant's decision toa recent Supreme Court ruling in favour of a baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple, in a case seen by many conservatives as a test for religious freedom.

"Theresa May must prepare to exit the EU with no deal to have ""real leverage"" in Brexit negotiations, a letter from 60 politicians and business figures says. The prime minister should also reserve the right to ""take with it the Â£39bn it has offered to pay as part of a divorce settlement"", it says. Signatories urge the government to accelerate plans to operate under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. Downing Street said it was confident the UK would get a good deal. Former cabinet ministers, economists and business figures including former chancellor Nigel Lawson, vocal Brexiteer John Redwood, and Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin signed the letter. Reality Check: Will there be a Brexit dividend? May vows 'smooth' Brexit as bill passes BMW joins Airbus in Brexit warning It was organised by Economists for Free Trade (EFT) and asks Mrs May to warn the EU that despite its ""intransigent and punitive stance"" Brexit cannot be stopped. Please upgrade your browser ""We believe you could also make clear that your preferred outcome is a free trade deal between Britain and the EU, an arrangement that is to the mutual benefit of both parties,"" the letter says. It goes on to say that even though a free deal trade is ""eminently possible"", it believed it was ""time"" to move to a World Trade Deal under WTO rules ""in light of the reluctance of the EU swiftly to secure a free trade deal"". Britain is due to leave on 29 March 2019, 46 years after it first joined the European Economic Community, the forerunner to the EU. BBC political correspondent Ben Wright says the letter is ""a sign of how frustrated hardline Brexiteers are becoming"". He adds: ""The letter shows how intense the pressure is for Mrs May not to compromise, from some in her own party."" The UK wants to negotiate a ""comprehensive, bold and ambitious"" free trade agreement with the EU. If it can't achieve that, there are a number of other possible arrangements of varying depth before the UK reaches the point where it hasno preferential trade relationship with the EU other than common membership of the WTO. If the UK had to trade under WTO rules, tariffs - a tax on traded goods - would be applied to all UK exports. The average WTO tariff varies from product to product, from 0% on mineral fuels and pharmaceuticals, to around 20-35% on processed food and 45-50% on meat. Reality Check: Does the UK trade with 'the rest of world' on WTO rules? The warning from well-known Brexit supporters comes after tens of thousands ofpeople marched in central London, demanding a final vote on any UK exit deal.. On Friday, plane-makerAirbus - which employs 14,000 people in Britain - said it could leave the UKif it exits the single market and customs union with no transition deal. Car maker BMW also warned that clarity is needed on a trade dealby the end of the summer, potentially affecting the company's 8,000-strong staff in the UK. This video can not be played Theresa May 'not bluffing' over no-deal Brexit - Fox In the letter, EFT says Britain can ""flourish, even without a free trade deal, because of benefits of leaving the EU"". ""This would give the chancellor ample scope to increase spending on priority public services such as the NHS, while reducing the too high UK tax burden."" Earlier this week, Theresa May said aso-called Brexit dividend could be used to fund part of an extra Â£20bn a year for the health service. Although the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) calculates the UK will begin saving Â£3bn a year by 2020,this does not take into account Britain's expected Â£39bn divorce bill for exiting the EU.

"Forensics have spent most of the morning searching the scene for evidence A 15-year-old boy has been stabbed to death in a fight after a birthday party at a community centre in east London. Three teenage boys have been arrested on suspicion of murder and have been taken to separate police stations for questioning. The Met Police said they were called to the centre in Romford on Saturday night after fighting broke out as youngsters left a birthday party. The boy is the youngest victim to be fatally stabbed in London this year. Police were first called to the North Romford Community Centre on Clockhouse Lane at 21:05 BST. According to the Met, a fight broke out and the centre was damaged. The BBC has identified more than 80 murder investigations have now been launched across London this year by both the Metropolitan and City of London Police. There had been reports of fighting after a birthday party at the North Romford Community Centre A woman, who lives close to the community centre and gave her name only as Carol, described hearing friends of the victim screaming and sobbing. She said: ""I heard a lad crying down the phone 'he's dead, he's dead'."" ""He was lying down in the road, there was a lot of blood. The police were working on him, they tried their absolute damnedest with that boy last night. ""Nobody should die like that."" Carol said youngsters spilled on to the surrounding streets after too many people showed up to the party and the community centre stopped letting people in. The victim has become the ninth teenager to have been fatally stabbed in London this year Det Sgt Gurj Singh said: ""Response officers who attended the initial calls were confronted with up to 100 youths leaving a birthday party gathering at a community centre."" Romford MP Andrew Rosindell said it was ""devastating"" that a young life had ""so tragically been cut short on our streets tonight"".

"This video can not be played (June 2018) Saudi women hit the road Saudi women are officially allowed to get behind the wheel, after a decades-old driving ban was lifted. The change was announced last September and Saudi Arabia issued the first licences to women earlier this month. It was the only country left in the world where women could not drive and families had to hire private chauffeurs for female relatives. However, the move comes amid an intensified crackdown on activists who campaigned for the right to drive. At least eight women's rights activists are being detained and could face trial in a counter-terrorism court and long prison sentences for their activism, human rights group Amnesty says. They include Loujain al-Hathloul, a well-known figure in the campaign for women's driving rights. Amnesty has also called for wider reforms in Saudi Arabia, where women remain subject to male guardianship laws. ""I was so excited that I couldn't sleep"" Five thing Saudi women still can't do In pictures: Saudi women get driving lessons Saudi women troll 'You won't drive' trend Watch: Saudi women prepare to hit the road Human rights groups in the kingdom have campaigned for years to allow women to drive. Dozens of women were arrested for driving in Riyadh in 1990 and some Saudi women began posting videos of themselves at the wheel in 2008, and between 2011 and 2014. Thousands of women could soon take to the roads. ""It is a historic moment for every Saudi woman,"" Saudi television presenter Sabika al-Dosari told the AFP news agency She said she was behind the wheel minutes after the end of the driving ban at midnight local time (21:00 GMT Saturday). Hannan Iskandar is kissed by her parents after driving legally for the first time in Al Khobar ""Those days of waiting long hours for a driver are over,"" said pharmacy student Hatoun bin Dakhil, 21. ""We no longer need a man."" By the BBC's Orla Guerin in Riyadh At the stroke of midnight local time, they were off. We were taken for a spin by one of the first women to get a driving licence here. She said she was honoured and happy to drive on home soil and hadn't slept for days with excitement. Along the way there were cheers from women and children and thumbs up from male drivers. As some Saudi women were driving into the history books, others were in prison. Several leading activists who had challenged the driving ban were arrested last month. They have been accused of treason. Women here may now be able to drive, but they still are not free to travel, marry, divorce or even leave prison without the permission of a male relative. Critics say that whatever the optics, the changes taking place here still amount to baby steps. On 5 June, 10 women became the first female licence-holders after swapping their foreign licences for Saudi ones in cities across the country. The Saudi authorities previously said they expected about 2,000 women to have received licences by the time the ban was lifted.

It was the only country left in the world where women could not drive and families had to hire private chauffeurs for female relatives. However, the move comes amid an intensified crackdown on activists who campaigned for the right to drive. At least eight women's rights activists are being detained and could face trial in a counter-terrorism court and long prison sentences for their activism, human rights group Amnesty says. They include Loujain al-Hathloul, a well-known figure in the campaign for women's driving rights. Amnesty has also called for wider reforms in Saudi Arabia, where women remain subject to male guardianship laws.

Dozens of women were arrested for driving in Riyadh in 1990 and some Saudi women began posting videos of themselves at the wheel in 2008, and between 2011 and 2014. Thousands of women could soon take to the roads. ""It is a historic moment for every Saudi woman,"" Saudi television presenter Sabika al-Dosari told the AFP news agency She said she was behind the wheel minutes after the end of the driving ban at midnight local time (21:00 GMT Saturday).

""We no longer need a man."" By the BBC's Orla Guerin in Riyadh At the stroke of midnight local time, they were off. We were taken for a spin by one of the first women to get a driving licence here. She said she was honoured and happy to drive on home soil and hadn't slept for days with excitement. Along the way there were cheers from women and children and thumbs up from male drivers. As some Saudi women were driving into the history books, others were in prison. Several leading activists who had challenged the driving ban were arrested last month. They have been accused of treason. Women here may now be able to drive, but they still are not free to travel, marry, divorce or even leave prison without the permission of a male relative. Critics say that whatever the optics, the changes taking place here still amount to baby steps. On 5 June, 10 women became the first female licence-holders after swapping their foreign licences for Saudi ones in cities across the country. The Saudi authorities previously said they expected about 2,000 women to have received licences by the time the ban was lifted.
