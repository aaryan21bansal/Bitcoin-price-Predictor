"David Warner made his international debut for Australia in 2009 Australia's Ashes series against England in November could be in doubt because of a players' contract dispute, says vice-captain David Warner. In March, Cricket Australia proposed salary increasesfor men and women,but this would mean players no longer receive a percentage of CA's revenue. The offer was rejected and CA said it would not pay players after 30 June. Warner told theAge newspaper:,external""If it gets to the extreme, they might not have a team for the Ashes."" A stand-off has developed between CA and the Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA), which represents the players. Ex-Australia captain Mark Taylor said the players were""prepared to strike""over the proposals. If the dispute is not resolved, there would be uncertainty over what team Australia could field after 30 June, with a two-Test series scheduled in August in Bangladesh before a home Ashes showdown which runs from 23 November 2017 to 8 January 2018. That 30 June deadline also falls in the middle of the Women's World Cup, whichtakes place in England between 24 June and 23 July- and Australia's elite female players have shown solidarity with their male counterparts over the dispute despiteCA's March offer to double the elite women's pay. A Cricket Australia spokesperson told BBC Sport: ""CA is ready and willing to negotiate with the ACA."" In a letter sent by CA to the ACA, chief executive James Sutherland said ""players with contracts expiring in 2016-17 will not have contracts for 2017-18"" unless the ACA negotiates a new Memorandum of Understanding. ""We want a fair share, and the revenue-sharing model is what we want, so we are going to stick together until we get that,"" added Warner, currently playing in the Indian Premier League. ""We are not going to shy away; we are just going to stick together. ""We want to keep participating for our country as much as we can, but if we don't have a job, we have to go and find some cricket elsewhere."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan believes the dispute could be the first of many to affect the international game. ""It's great for England to see Australia falling out and fighting with each other but in terms of the game as a whole it's not a great story,"" he said onBBC Radio 5 Live's Tuffers and Vaughan Show. ""I've never seen it to this level. It's sad for the game when you're hearing this but I don't think it will be the last case of players getting together as groups. There's so much money coming through TV deals, I think players will say 'we fancy a piece of that'. ""International boards have got to put their hands in their pockets to save international cricket. In our day, international cricket was the sole money-maker for the game but the Twenty20 leagues are catching up.""

"The winner of the Indianapolis 500 is awarded the Borg-Warner trophy Fernando Alonso says he is ""very excited"" about his Indy 500 odyssey - and he is not alone. The two-time F1 champion flew straight from Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix to America to start his attempt to win the Indianapolis 500 on 28 May. Some measure of the impact his decision has had comes from the fact that more than two million people watched Alonso's first test at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway earlier this month. Yes, two million people. Watching a webcast of a single car going around a circuit with four left-hand turns. For Alonso, who is missing the Monaco Grand Prix to race at Indy, this is the next step to trying to win the 'triple crown' of motor racing's three blue-riband events. This video can not be played 'Everything went fine' - Alonso happy with Indy 500 practice Only one man, Graham Hill, has so far triumphed in Monaco - where Alonso has already won twice - at Indy and in the Le Mans 24 Hours. And it is a rare chance to taste success at a time when his F1 career is becalmed by poor machinery. At Indy, Alonso will have a car with which he can win, branded for his McLaren F1 team, run by the elite Andretti Autosport outfit and powered by a Honda engine - which, unlike the one in Alonso's F1 car, is absolutely competitive. Few would question Lewis Hamilton's assessment that Alonso will be ""the best driver in the paddock"" at Indy. Less certain is whether he can adapt quickly enough to racing on a high-speed oval. ""He just won't have the time,"" Hamilton says. ""It will be interesting to see how he fares against the drivers who have all this experience."" This is not just any racing driver. Alonso is an exceptional talent. But he has never raced on an oval before, and is facing highly skilled rivals who have been doing it for years. So what is Alonso up against, and what makes winning at Indy so difficult? McLaren's historic papaya orange colour scheme will grace this year's Indy 500 The Indy 500 is 200 laps of a 2.5-mile 'superspeedway' with four left-hand turns banked at an angle of nine degrees, all of which look identical but have their own subtleties. There are no run-off areas - the track edge is a wall. Average lap speeds top 230mph in qualifying. It is, needless to say, extremely dangerous, even if safety has been improved in recent years by replacing concrete walls with impact-absorbing barriers in the corners. All teams use a spec Dallara chassis but there are two engine manufacturers - Honda and Chevrolet - and each can develop its own aerodynamics. Although the cars are more rudimentary than F1 machinery, there is a level of complexity of set-up on an oval that Alonso has not experienced before. Lewis Hamilton will be watching the progress of his old McLaren team-mate with interest Can Alonso adapt to the challenges of Indianapolis? The beginnings of an answer were provided byhis first run at Indyin early May, which also comprised the mandatory 'rookie test' all drivers new to Indy have to complete. He was alone on track but it provided compelling viewing. Not only for the fly-on-the-wall nature of the coverage - cameras eavesdropped on Alonso's conversations with his engineers in a way never allowed in F1 - but also for the way he dealt with the day. The rookie test required a driver to run a series of laps at pre-determined speeds - 10 laps in the range of 205-210mph, 15 at 210-215mph, 15 at 215-220mph. That's a total of 40 laps for the test. Alonso completed it in just 50, including those on which he exited or returned to the pits. This is not hugely remarkable for a driver of his ability. But there were some eye-opening aspects to the day. At one point, Alonso was told over the radio that he had completed the 210-215mph phase and could go straight onto the next one. His very next lap was 219.495mph. The 215-220mph phase completed, he was straight into the high 221mph range, topping out at 222.548mph. ""That's a race pace right there,"" said a watching Mario Andretti, 1978 F1 world champion and 1969 Indy 500 winner. There was hardly any sense of Alonso playing himself in. He exuded control, as if he did it every day. If he was feeling intimidated by the speeds involved, there was not a hint of it. Between runs, he sat in the car, his face calm, no wide eyes, no apparent trepidation at all. Alonso will face four left-hand turns at the Indy 500 - a far cry from the 19 corners at Monaco Even to an experienced observer, this was extraordinary. Scot Dario Franchitti, a three-time Indy 500 winner, said he was ""amazed"". ""I thought he got up to speed incredibly quickly,"" he added. Alonso had arranged for timing data from a 210mph lap to be put on the steering wheel display screen, and calculated what would be the lap-time difference for the increased speeds. But when I asked 2003 Indy 500 winner Gil de Ferran how Alonso judged it so finely, he made it clear it was a long way from normal. ""The guy has enormous feel. Huge,"" said De Ferran, who is acting as Alonso's mentor at Indy. ""What makes a great racing driver great? It's feel, man. ""Obviously Fernando is extremely gifted, and I have now also learned that he is highly intelligent, has a great attitude and a great work ethic."" De Ferran is a two-time IndyCar champion Alonso described his first test as ""fun"", and did admit to one moment when the speed and the walls got to him. ""The team at one point said: 'You are done with the limitations, so run free as you feel,'"" Alonso said. ""I knew Marco [Andretti, who set the car up for Alonso] was flat in Turn One and I said [to myself] I will do it flat out. ""I was convinced 100% I was going flat out but the foot was not going flat out; it had its own life. The second or third lap I was able to do it, but the first lap was a good moment to feel the place, the car. ""The speed is something. For any racing driver, it is just pure adrenaline. It was a good day."" Intimidated, Alonso clearly is not. But he is aware that winning at Indy involves more than just being fast and brave - and that running in traffic in excess of 230mph and working out how to optimise the car are things he has to learn fast. Alonso in Indy 500 is cool - Kelsey Grammer Alonso has already impressed the Andretti team with his application and his understanding of the differences between what Americans call road racing and oval racing. But the task ahead of him is huge nonetheless. There are so many differences between F1 and the Indy 500 that it is hard to know where to start. The speed is one thing - there is not a corner on an F1 circuit anywhere in the world that is taken as fast as the average lap speed Alonso will be doing in the race at Indy, let alone qualifying. Alonso will reach much greater speeds than he is used to in F1 Whereas an F1 team is not allowed to change the car between qualifying and race, Indy requires two different set-ups for each. And then there is the complexity of how the cars work on an oval track. A driver has to turn right to go in a straight line because the cars are designed only to turn left and set up asymmetrically. The idiosyncrasies of oval racing mean that adjustments for handling balance are made not only to the front and rear but also diagonally across the car. Drivers can change this while out on track with something called a 'weight-jacker' - a kind of diagonal pitch control, which De Ferran says ""changes the balance of the car tremendously"". ""In a way, you have twice as many variables,"" De Ferran adds, ""and [you have to work out] how does that interact with your driving. ""There are a lot of peculiarities for someone who has never done ovals."" Alonso has five days of practice this week, with six hours of running on each as long as the weather stays fine - IndyCars do not run in the rain on ovals - before qualifying over two days on the weekend of 20-21 May. In that time, he will have to learn the car, come up with set-ups for qualifying and race, learn how to adjust the car on track for changing conditions and come to terms with running in traffic at more than 220mph. Only Graham Hill has ever won the Monaco Grand Prix, Indy 500 and Le Mans 24 hours ""Qualifying and the race are very different,"" De Ferran says. ""Qualifying at Indy quite frankly is one of the most difficult things I have ever done in a racing car."" A lap of Indianapolis is supposed to be ""flat"" - the driver never lifts his foot off the accelerator. But it is a long way from easy. The driver is absolutely on the edge, the car in a controlled slide or 'drift', all the time. The car is 'trimmed out' to have as little downforce as the driver feels he get can get away with - because downforce equals drag and drag slows you down on the straights - while going as fast as possible in the corners. The result, De Ferran says, is ""the car feels like you are driving on an ice road at 230mph. It is very, very little grip and very, very little margin"". The grid is set over two days. Saturday's running fundamentally defines the nine drivers who can compete for pole on the Sunday - the so-called 'Fast Nine'. The remaining 24 also compete for grid slots on the Sunday, but the best they can be is 10th, no matter what time they set. Positions are defined by speed over a four-lap run and the drivers take it in turns to go out. ""One of the unfortunate things sometimes about TV is you can't see how on-the-edge the whole thing is,"" De Ferran says. ""It may look from TV that the guy is just going round and round and it looks easy, but you ask any driver where they have to do a lot of runs in qualifying trim, they are like, 'Oh my God, this is so stressful. I don't want to do that many runs in qualifying trim. I'm done. Once is enough.' And now they have to do it at least twice and that's difficult. ""You are literally looking for a few centimetres here and there to make a difference. If the tyres go off, if they are degrading a little bit too much because you are sliding a little bit too much, come the fourth lap you are in trouble. ""It is an adventure like you have no idea."" For the 500 itself, there is a ""completely different set of problems,"" De Ferran explains. The driver still wants to be running as little downforce as possible because, as De Ferran puts it, ""the less downforce you can run, the quicker you will go"". But he has to run more than in qualifying because of the problems created by racing in the vicinity of 32 other cars. Traffic messes up the behaviour of the car. ""That's one of the big difficulties - how much downforce do you add?"" De Ferran says. ""Because the more you add, the more you slow down. Alone. In perfect conditions. ""Now you have to do 30 laps [in a stint] instead of four. And you have to take tyre degradation and traffic into account. ""It may be traffic from a line of cars, from one car, and when you are in traffic you lose downforce and the car starts sliding like mad and then you can't go forward. ""The mindset from a set-up perspective for the race is quite different than in qualifying."" If Alonso wins, he'll have to trade in the champagne he's used to for a bottle of milk - 2012 winner Dario Franchitti here showing him how it's done A driver may want his car to behave differently in the race so it is less on-a-knife-edge than he can get away with for four laps of qualifying. ""Balance-wise you may not want the car to be quite as neutral,"" says De Ferran. This usually means giving it just a little understeer so the front is not quite as grippy as before, which is a safer balance in the race than oversteer, where the rear wants to come around on the driver. But too much understeer - or 'push', as it is known in America - is also bad, De Ferran says. ""When you get in traffic typically you not only you lose grip but you also gain understeer, so it's a very complex equation."" Finally, because the race is 500 miles, on a high-speed oval with no run-off area, accidents are inevitable, and with them come caution periods - or 'yellows' - when the cars are held behind a pace car. Getting it right or wrong when the race goes green again can determine whether you win - as Nigel Mansell found to his cost when he lost the lead on a restart in 1993. One of Alonso's great qualities in F1 has always been his adaptability - his biggest strength among many is arguably his ability to drive the car to its maximum no matter how it is behaving. De Ferran says drivers are ""a bit more limited"" in being able to drive around problems on an oval, but this skill ""always helps because the car is changing all the time really - the tyres are degrading, the fuel level is changing, on an oval you have this traffic to deal with"". He adds: ""It is never this beautiful constant thing that you keep perfecting. The track is changing and you have to learn how to adapt to that. It is one of his skills that he scores very highly at."" De Ferran has been a long-time admirer of Alonso - since watching trackside at the 2001 Brazilian Grand Prix, when the Spaniard was in his first season with Minardi. ""I didn't even know who he was, but I was watching on a corner,"" the 49-year-old recalls. ""The car was three seconds off but I was thinking: 'Hmmm. Who is that?'"" He was approached to be Alonso's mentor for his Indy adventure over the weekend of the Bahrain Grand Prix. ""When they first asked me, that was very emotional. It was, like, 'Wow.' ""You think: 'Jesus, it is one of the best drivers I have ever seen, a great champion.'"" Alonso can expect to be on the edge during the race and qualifying Former IndyCar driver Bryan Herta said at Alonso's rookie test: ""He's going to be a pretty formidable competitor. He's got everyone's attention already."" De Ferran says: ""I think most people are super-happy he has elected to come and do the Indy 500, primarily because Fernando commands a huge amount of respect. ""When I retired, someone asked what was one of your biggest frustrations, and I said I never really went head-to-head with Michael Schumacher and it was something I wanted to do. ""A lot of people see Fernando as I saw Michael and having the opportunity to race against a guy like that in similar equipment and so on is unique."" Veteran Helio Castroneves said adapting to Indy racing would be ""no problem"" for Alonso. And four-time IndyCar champion and 2008 Indy 500 winner Scott Dixon said Alonso had a ""great shot"" at winning. De Ferran says: ""He has the skill, the experience, the knowledge, the emotional control to be a true contender in Indianapolis but there are so many things that have to come right on that one day for you to win. ""Let me put it this way, Mario Andretti tried God knows how long to win it for a second time and he only won it in '69. Scott Dixon, who frankly is supremely talented, won it only once. ""It's unbelievable. Yes, in the car you control a lot of levers but definitely not all of them. And there are some levers that not even the team controls. ""You have a bad pit stop and it happens to be the last one and you are in trouble. You may be dominating the whole race, but there's a strategy call, or a yellow that falls just at the wrong time, and you may be in trouble again. Or a mechanical failure. ""You make a bad decision in the car, once, and it happens to be at a crucial time, and you were in a position to win and now you're not."" Can Alonso emulate Alex Rossi, who won the Indy 500 at his first attempt last year? He uses as an example Alex Rossi, who drove five races for back-of-the-grid F1 team Manor in 2015, but won Indy at his first attempt last year, after gambling on not stopping for fuel after a late-race caution period. De Ferran says: ""If the yellow ended one lap sooner than it did, Rossi would not only not have won the race, he would not even have finished because he would have run out of fuel. That is one clear example between hero and zero that is completely beyond the control of the driver."" ""First, I want to enjoy the experience,"" he says. ""Everyone keeps telling me how big the event is. So my first target is to go there and live that moment. For any racing driver it must feel a privilege to race there. ""After that there is always a small percentage that you can win, because there are many factors there, it is not only about the pace. ""Probably my chance to win is a little lower than some of my competitors because I am lacking experience, but I have a lot of joy and commitment to learn as much as I can so it will be fun. ""But after that, when you close the visor you don't like it when you are are second. It's the same in any sport. We are all competitive and we want to do the best we can.""

"Antonio Conte is enjoying a spectacular first season as Chelsea manager, but can he follow it up by bringing sustained success to Stamford Bridge? The 47-year-old Italian hasthe Premier League titlein the bag, could soon get his hands on the FA Cup as well - and his side will compete in next season's Champions League. He says this is only the startfor his Blues team, but where do they go from here and how will he do it? Former Chelsea playersRuud Gullit, Pat Nevin, Chris Sutton, Graeme le Saux and Mark Schwarzertell BBC Sport what they think could happen next. Reports in Italy suggest Chinese-backed Serie A club Inter Milan are prepared to offer Conte Â£250,000 a week if he leaves Stamford Bridge one season into a three-year deal. Conte's wife and nine-year-old daughter stayed in Turin when he moved to London last year Ruud Gullit (former Chelsea player and manager 1995-98):""From a football point of view, of course he will stay. His next challenge is to win the Champions League and he can do that with Chelsea. ""If he feels he has a team that can win it, why would he leave in order to start all over again somewhere else? ""It is different if it is a decision about his family. His personal life is important as well. ""If his family are not in London, it is a little bit odd because I think it is the best city in the world, so why are they not coming? ""It is understandable if people are very attached to their own customs, however. And, if his family want to be in Italy, then it is an easy choice for him to make."" This video can not be played The Premier League Show: Antonio Conte interview Pat Nevin (played more than 250 games for Chelsea 1983-88):""After spending a couple of hours talking to Antonio a few weeks ago, I would be stunned if he left. ""It would have to be an unbelievably spectacular offer to take him away from Chelsea and the only thing that usually means managers move on from positions like that is that they don't have the level of control they want. ""I don't think his own finances are a big deal for the guy and he told me he is enjoying London now. ""The other thing to consider is that when you stand at Stamford Bridge and you hear the fans singing 'Antonio, Antonio' then you realise the adoration he has got from everyone. That is hard to walk away from."" This video can not be played What next for Conte's 'wonderful winning machine'? Chris Sutton (broke Chelsea's transfer record when he joined for Â£10m in 1999):""The only way I see Conte leaving is if he does not get the players in he wants this summer.

This video can not be played Antonio Conte soaked in Chelsea Premier League title celebration Conte won three successive Serie A titles with Juventus between 2012 and 2014 but his Champions League record is less impressive - Juve lost 4-0 on aggregate to Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals in 2012-13 and failed to get out of the group stage the following season. Graeme le Saux (made more than 300 appearances for Chelsea in two spells 1987-1993 and 1997-2003):""Any success going forward depends on the personnel and if they can retain the quality players they have got. ""Eden Hazard and N'Golo Kante are both 26, and they are young enough to make Chelsea a force going forwards. ""Diego Costa has been linked with a move to China, but it is important for Chelsea they keep this group of players together.

Mark Schwarzer (part of the Chelsea squad that won the Premier League in 2014-15):""The potential is there for back-to-back titles, and Chelsea can win the Champions League too. ""There are players in that squad who have played in a number of Champions League games and been successful in that competition. ""Conte is very good at winning domestic competitions. Clubs like Chelsea, their number one priority is to win the Premier League and then look beyond that to try and win the big one, the Champions League. ""With the right additions, and a little bit of time, Chelsea can really challenge for that title but next season it is going to be a huge burden on them. ""We don't know how they will deal with the physical and mental side of having more games to play and less time to recover."" This video can not be played Chelsea found right way to be stronger - Conte Pat Nevin:""Conte has over-achieved domestically this season but, even so, the Champions League is a big jump - look at the lack of success by English teams in recent years. ""If he got Chelsea out of the group stage and into the latter stages that would be a success in his first season with the club in the Champions League. ""But that is predicated by one very important thing - who is he going to get in, and who will leave in the summer?"" This Chelsea team started 11 out of 22 Premier League matches from 1 October to the end of March after Antonio Conte switched from a 4-1-4-1 formation to start a league game with a 3-4-3 formation for the first time. Only two other players have started league games for the club in that period - Willian (eight starts) and Cesc Fabregas (six). Over the course of the whole season, Conte has made only 38 changes to his starting line-ups over the course of the Premier League season - fewer than any other top-flight team. Pat Nevin:""With the current group, he cannot do next year what he has done this season. There is just not enough numbers there."" Chris Sutton:""Conte is clearly not big on rotation but he still had to change the make-up of his team around at times this season. ""He is fortunate he has got a lot of intelligent footballers who can play in numerous positions, but next season he will need more strength in depth and that means four or five really quality signings. ""Wing-backs would one of the areas where Conte will think he needs more cover and, whether Costa stays or goes, there is lots of talk about Everton striker Romelu Lukaku coming back to the club. ""Does Lukaku fit the Chelsea style? Absolutely. ""He likes to play between the two centre-halves and is not going to come deep to get the ball but, if he joins, I can see him being very successful playing that Costa role."" This video can not be played 'Maybe Drogba can tell me' - Koeman on Lukaku's future Ruud Gullit:""John Terryis definitely leavingso they need someone in defence who can take David Luiz's position if something happens to him. ""But in every area they do not want a situation where they are depending too much on one player. ""Even when you have success, you need to change little things to keep people on their toes - look at what happened to Jose Mourinho after winning the title in 2015 - all of a sudden they went from champions to nothing."" This video can not be played Jose Mourinho: How it went wrong at Chelsea Pat Nevin:""Conte will want a bit more strength and power in midfield - but if he can keep Hazard, Cesc Fabregas, Pedro and Willian then he does not need any more creativity. ""The biggest question is at centre-forward. I watched Michy Batshuayi when he was playing in France and he is a real player, a goalscorer - someone who will do very well. I don't know if it will be at Chelsea though. ""Considering I believe that Conte wants to play two up front, he might want to go for a different type of centre-forward. ""As well as Lukaku, Alvaro Morata has been talked about. What has impressed me most about Conte, though, is he does things you do not expect - those are the names we are thinking about, but he might know about someone completely different."" The Blues won the FA Youth Cup for a record fourth successive year but no players from any of those teams started a league game for them this season. Nathan Ake and Ruben Loftus-Cheek featured from the bench, however, and striker Tammy Abraham could follow them into the first team after his successful loan at Bristol City. Chris Sutton:""Conte is not going to take his foot off the gas, if anything he will put his foot down harder. If any youth players get a game, it will not be down to him doing them a favour. ""Tammy Abraham has got something about him, and it will be interesting to see if he gets a chance. Ultimately, though, things have not changed since my day so it will be down to him - he will have to show what he can do in pre-season and hope it is enough."" Pat Nevin:""Chelsea fans will tell you we have got these good young kids and they will come in and make it. ""Really? Hopefully they will, and it would be the perfect situation if they did but people make the mistake of thinking the jump from the under-21s to Chelsea's first team is one step - it's not, it is about 47 steps. ""Abraham is going to be a great player, and he is coming back to the club for next season, but I would be shocked if all Chelsea did was stick with what they have got, and drafted more youth players in."" Costa's goals have earned more points than any other Premier League player this season Graeme le Saux:""When you look at the balance and blend that Chelsea have you think it would be a shame to lose any of those players as they are all playing so well and understand their role perfectly."" Mark Schwarzer:""You could argue all of them would be hard to replace but Kante and Hazard probably stand out. ""Leicester tried to replace Kante and failed miserably. Yes, Chelsea are on a different level to Leicester but it would still be a huge void to fill. ""As for Hazard, he is an incredible talent. You just don't know what you are going to get from him - his ability to score goals and assist is quite remarkable."" This video can not be played Archive: Everybody loves N'Golo: Pundits purr over Kante Ruud Gullit:""Even when Costa has not been scoring goals, he still does an important job for the team. He is an example of someone they have depended on too much - he is up there with Hazard as one of their most influential players. ""But if Costa feels he wants to leave because he want a different challenge, then let him go. If that's his state of mind, it is better to sell him."" Chris Sutton:""Cesc Fabregas only has a year left on his contract and has not played as much as many of their players, but he will get more games next year. ""Arguably the biggest challenge for Conte was keeping him happy this season, but he has had that kind of harmony with his entire squad."" This video can not be played Nevin: Fabregas sums up Conte's success Conte began the season using a 4-1-4-1 formation but switched to a 3-4-3 formation during their 3-0 defeat by Arsenal on 24 September. They started a game playing that way for the first time in their win against Hull on 1 October and went on to win 13 straight league matches. Pat Nevin:""I suspect Conte will be using different systems, systems that will suit Fabregas a bit better. ""You think of the way Conte's Juventus team played with Andrea Pirlo, and that would suit Fabregas absolutely. ""People said he was a 3-4-3 man when he arrived at Chelsea but that was never the case. If you look back, he often played with four at the back and very frequently with two up front. ""He has already started to show he can change things around, when he left Costa and Hazard on the bench for the FA Cup semi-final. So the sort of thing he will need to do next season is already happening now. This video can not be played Conte will continue to 'raise the bar' in Premier League Chris Sutton:""He changed things once, at the start of last season after some bad results. ""He seems an adaptable, pragmatic manager and I don't think he is frightened to change. You would not rule out him returning to four at the back if he sees fit. ""I don't think he is going to slacken off, though. Yes, he works the players hard in training but when you are successful it makes that treatment easier to accept."" This video can not be played Conte interrupts news conference to eat journalist's cake The last time Chelsea were champions was 2014-15, and they finished 10th the following season. No team has retained their Premier League title since Manchester United won it in 2007-08 and 2008-09. Graeme le Saux:""It bodes well for Chelsea that they now have a culture of achieving and setting very high standards for themselves and each other. The players clearly love playing for Conte and giving him everything as well. ""You would like to think all those values he is building at the club would hold the team in good stead going forward. I hope their success this year means there is some continuity there."" This video can not be played Full-time scenes as Chelsea seal title Pat Nevin:""Financially, Chelsea are in a great position. Obviously they are already very wealthy but it is almost forgottenthey got Â£60m for Oscar in Januaryand they have not spent that. ""So Conte will have an enormous amount to spend in the summer and the other thing he has got in his favour is that he is young for a manager - he turns 48 in July. So the passion, the hunger that he has, it is natural - and he is still on the upward curve. ""I don't think we have seen 50% of his capabilities yet and I am dead keen to see him up against Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho, who will both be stronger next year."" Ruud Gullit:""Even if Conte does lose some of his players, the structure of his team is already there and he can build from the back. ""There are five teams challenging for the title in England but Conte does not have to start from scratch this time. ""It is just a question now of what he can add for next season and, after his first year in England, he will also have learned a lot.""

"Pili Hussein wanted to make her fortune prospecting for a precious stone that's said to be a thousand times rarer than diamonds, but since women weren't allowed down the mines she dressed up as man and fooled her male colleagues for almost a decade. Pili Hussein grew up in a large family in Tanzania.  The daughter of a livestock keeper who had many large farms, Pili's father had six wives and she was one of 38 children. Although she was well looked after, in many ways, she doesn't look back on her upbringing fondly. ""My father treated me like a boy and I was given livestock to take care of - I didn't like that life at all,"" she says. But her marriage was even more unhappy, and at the age of 31 Pili ran away from her abusive husband. In search of work she found herself in the small Tanzanian town of Mererani, in the foothills of Africa's highest mountain, Kilimanjaro - the only place in the world where mining for a rare, violet-blue gemstone called tanzanite takes place. Maasai herders first discovered tanzanite in 1967 - it's now one of the world's best-selling gems but is in limited supply ""I didn't go to school, so I didn't have many options,"" Pili says. ""Women were not allowed in the mining area, so I entered bravely like a man, like a strong person. You take big trousers, you cut them into shorts and you appear like a man. That's what I did."" To complete the transformation, she also changed her name. ""I was called Uncle Hussein, I didn't tell anyone my actual name was Pili. Even today if you come to the camp you ask for me by that name, Uncle Hussein."" In the tight confines of the hot, dirty tunnels - some of which extend hundreds of metres below the ground - Pili would work 10-12 hours a day, digging and sieving, hoping to uncover gemstones in the veins in the graphite rock. ""I could go 600m under, into the mine. I would do this more bravely than many other men. I was very strong and I was able to deliver what men would expect another man could do."" Pili says that nobody suspected that she was a woman. This video can not be played Pili Hussein tells Outlook's Matthew Bannister how she succeeded in becoming a miner ""I acted like a gorilla,"" she says, ""I could fight, my language was bad, I could carry a big knife like a Maasai [warrior]. Nobody knew I was a woman because everything I was doing I was doing like a man."" And after about a year, she struck it rich, uncovering two massive clusters of tanzanite stones. With the money that she made she built new homes for her father, mother and twin sister, bought herself more tools, and began employing miners to work for her. And her cover was so convincing that it took an extraordinary set of circumstances for her true identity to finally be revealed. A local woman had reported that she'd been raped by some of the miners and Pili was arrested as a suspect. ""When the police came, the men who did the rape said: 'This is the man who did it,' and I was taken to the police station,"" Pili says. The miners dig using chisels and fill bags with rubble which are hoisted up to the surface using a rope She had no choice but to reveal her secret. She asked the police to find a woman to physically examine her, to prove that she couldn't be responsible, and was soon released. But even after that her fellow miners found it hard to believe they had been duped for so long. ""They didn't even believe the police when they said that I was a woman,"" she says, ""it wasn't easy for them to accept until 2001 when I got married and I started a family."" Finding a husband when everyone is accustomed to regarding you as a man is not easy, Pili found, though eventually she succeeded. ""The question in his mind was always, 'Is she really a woman?'"" she recalls. ""It took five years for him to come closer to me."" Pili has built a successful career and today owns her own mining company with 70 employees. Three of her employees are women, but they work as cooks not as miners. Pili says that although there are more women in the mining industry than when she started out, even today very few actually work in the mines. ""Some [women] wash the stones, some are brokers, some are cooking,"" she says, ""but they're not going down in to the mines, it's not easy to get women to do what I did."" Pili's success has enabled her to pay for the education of more than 30 nieces, nephews and grandchildren. But despite this she says she wouldn't encourage her own daughter to follow in her footsteps. ""I'm proud of what I did - it has made me rich, but it was hard for me,"" she says. ""I want to make sure that my daughter goes to school, she gets an education and then she is able to run her life in a very different way, far away from what I experienced.""

"This video can not be played Were 'litter police' right to fine this man for dropping a small piece of orange peel? A private company acting as the ""litter police"" for dozens of councils pays officers a bonus for issuing fines, an undercover Panorama report has found. One officer from Kingdom Services, a leading enforcement company, claimed that his bonus one month was Â£987. Other officers were filmed handing out Â£75 fines for tiny pieces of dropped orange peel and poured-away coffee. Kingdom told Panorama that its competency allowance was not a paid incentive for officers to issue fines. Littering is a crime, but if you pay the fine you can avoid a criminal record. Councils are increasingly using private companies such as Kingdom, based in Cheshire, to enforce the Environmental Protection Act. Kingdom currently has about 28 contracts with local authorities and last year saw its profits jump 30% to Â£9m. The company frequently splits the proceeds of the fines with the councils. Panorama uncovered several cases where people were fined incorrectly. Luke Gutteridge, featured in the video at the top of the story, was issued with a fixed penalty notice by an officer working for Kingdom Services after he accidentally dropped a small piece of orange peel. Even though Mr Gutteridge, a market trader from Hertfordshire, picked up the peel, he was accused of littering. Luke's mother Rita Gutteridge, who works for a law firm, contested the case. She told Panorama: ""Had we not appealed, or we weren't in a financial position to, he could have ended up with a criminal record for life, for dropping a piece of orange peel. It's just nonsense, and just disgusting to be quite honest."" Sue Peckitt, a retired civil servant from Ealing in west London, successfully overturned a fine for pouring coffee down a drain. Barrister Dr Michael Ramsden told Panorama: ""It's pure greed on the part of the enforcement officers, I would say. ""Under no stretch of the imagination could you say that the liquid from the coffee cup is cross-contamination when it's going in a sewer, and she placed a coffee cup in the bin."" Sue complained and the fine was dropped. Kingdom Services sent her a Â£20 gift voucher. Liz Jenner, a ballet and pilates instructor from Ealing, was issued with a fine for fly-tipping outside her own home after she put her recycling out on the wrong date during the Christmas holidays. It is understood that in Ealing, Kingdom officers ride on the back of rubbish trucks to issue tickets. She told Panorama: ""'The borough has a very big problem with fly-tipping I appreciate that. But they're targeting the wrong people."" The number of fines issued for littering has risen from 727 to more than 140,000 in England and Wales over the past decade, according to freedom of information requests made in 2015-16 by civil liberties group, the Manifesto Club. Josie Appleton, the group's spokeswoman, said companies such as Kingdom present councils with a ""very seductive offer"". ""They basically just say, 'Sign it over to us and we'll make you a bit of money and you won't lose anything.'"" But she said it was very concerning because ""essentially what you have here is a fine on behalf of a public authority being contracted out to someone who basically has anything but the public interest at heart and so very much is seeking to make money"". Panorama sent an undercover reporter to work inside Kingdom Services' enforcement team in Kent. During her training, the reporter asked a senior member of staff how officers were paid. The Kingdom manager said officers were paid Â£9.47 a hour. He added: ""And then every ticket over four, you get a little competency allowance."" When asked if this was like a bonus, he replied: ""It's a bonus."" He added: ""When I was doing it in Ashford, I was hitting out quite a lot of tickets and I think the most I brought home just on the bonus was Â£987."" In a statement, Kingdom told Panorama it offered a competency allowance. It said the allowance was discretionary and only paid if officers met all their basic competencies. During a training session with Kingdom, the reporter was told by a trainer: ""Obviously we are here to make money, I'm not going to not say that to people."" The trainer also told her that some officers pretended to call the police in order to make people pay a fine. She added: ""When people think you are actually going to do something or you are going to get the police and they're going to have to stand there for another hour they may thenâ¦ their attitude changes."" One officer told the reporter that he often pretended to call the police in order to encourage members of the public to hand over their personal details. Once he had their details, he could issue a ticket. Kingdom said that it was important that members of the public know what could happen if they are convicted at court. But any decision to prosecute alleged offenders is made by the local authority, not Kingdom. The company said it provided local authorities with a cost-effective service and helped to keep Britain tidy within the law. The cost of clearing up litter exceeded Â£1bn last year and a further Â£1bn was spent clearing up waste, according to the campaign group Keep Britain Tidy. Allison Ogden Nash, chief executive of Keep Britain Tidy, said: ""Enforcement is one of the methods we can use to change people's behaviour but it needs to be fair and it needs to have the public on our side.""

"Harmony is more than a sex toy, according to RealDoll founder Matt McMullen Harmony is a new type of sex doll - one that can move and talk. Her head, eyelids and lip movements are fairly crude and her conversation is even more limited. But she is part of a new robotics revolution that is seeing artificial intelligence incorporated into an extremely human-like body. Some think that it will revolutionise the way humans interact with robots while others believe that it represents the very worst in robotic advancement. The uncanny valley - the idea that the closer we get to replicating the human form, the more scared we become of our creations - seems to have come to life in this unassuming factory on the outskirts of San Marcos, California. The receptionists are dolls - the only ones wearing suits Even on reception, two lifelike characters - in business suits rather than underwear, like the rest of the dolls - wait to greet visitors. And the lobby wall is full of photos of beautiful women which, only on very close inspection, reveal themselves to be of dolls. Matt McMullen, the chief executive of Abyss Creations, which makes RealDoll, comes from an art and sculpture background. Adjusting Harmony's wig ahead of my interview with her, he is clearly very fond of the way she looks. She is, he says, the natural next step for sex dolls. ""Many people who may buy a RealDoll because it is sexually capable come to realise it is much more than a sex toy,"" he said. ""It has a presence in their house and they imagine a personality for her. AI gives people the tools to create that personality."" This is done via an app, which can be used with the doll or independently, existing as a virtual person on a smartphone or similar device. Users can choose from a variety of personality options, including moody, angry and loving. Mr McMullen has chosen ""jealous"" for Harmony and she dutifully asks him to ""remove that girl from Facebook"". She speaks in a curiously high-pitched Scottish accent and tells me that she loves science fiction and, of course, Matt. Mr McMullen claims that she learns from her users but when I ask Harmony what it feels like to be jealous, she apologises and says that she ""needs to improve [her] skills"". The app that powers Harmony is already available to buy, although only directly from the Realbotix website, a spin-off from Abyss. Neither Google's nor Apple's official stores will carry it because of the explicit content. The doll will go on sale later this year and there will be two versions - one with computer vision that enables it to recognise faces, which will cost $10,000 (Â£7,700) - and a cheaper version without vision for $5,000. The factory makes the dolls in stages The factory currently makes dolls for clients around the world, mostly men although it claims to have a handful of female clients. All of the dolls conform to a particular idea of beauty - they are Barbie-like, with tiny waists, large bottoms and even larger breasts. Mr McMullen says the design is driven by clients. ""We are running a business and most of our clients have a certain wish list. The unfortunate reality is that that is rather idealistic,"" he said. It takes time to make a realistic face Mr McMullen described his clients as ""completely normal"", claiming some even come to collect their dolls with their wives but admitted later that many of them choose sex dolls because they cannot form relationships with ordinary women. ""Many people are isolated and alone but they were probably that way already. For people who are lonely and find it hard to form a relationship, this is another option. But I've never looked at the dolls or the robot as a replacement."" He himself does not own a sex doll, saying he has instead ""a real human wife and kids"". Mark Young lives in Arizona and he does own a sex doll - called Mai Lin. He has also just invested in the Harmony AI app but he is not planning on integrating the two. ""I thought the app might bring her to life but the app has its own personality and it is different from how I pictured Mai Lin in my mind so it is like having two relationships."" He explained why he invested in a sex doll in the first place. ""I've been single for a while. I've dated a lot of girls. I've wasted time on relationships. While I'd love to meet a girl, in the meantime it is good to have that presence,"" And, while he admits the relationship is physical, he says that is ""secondary"". ""I can go out shopping for her and look at clothes - it is like having somebody in my life without having to deal with making mistakes. If I like a hat on her, she doesn't say that she doesn't like it."" A beautiful young woman or a photograph of a sex robot? As for the app, he has programmed it to be ""happy, affectionate and talkative"". ""AI is a whole different ball-game and that has got me very excited for the future,"" he said. Prof Kathleen Richardson, a robot ethicist at De Montfort University, Leicester, spends her time looking at the impact such machines might have on society and she is appalled by the rise of sex robots. ""There are seven billion people on our planet and we are having a crisis in people forming relationships. And companies are coming along and profiting from this by saying objects can take the place of a human being."" ""We live in a world that objectivises sex through prostitution. Humans are used like tools, and sex dolls are an extension of this."" The factory makes dolls for clients around the world, but none currently has robotic or AI components. A few years ago she launched a campaign to ban sex robots but has since decided that ""dolls aren't really the problem"". Instead, the issue is about attitudes to sex and each other. She is dismissive of the new AI-enabled doll. ""The idea that adding artificial intelligence adds something human to a doll is wrong. There is more artificial intelligence in my washing machine than in this doll and just because it has a face and a body doesn't make it human."" Dr Kate Devlin, a senior lecturer at Goldsmiths University, takes a different view. ""In their current form, sex robots are definitely aimed at men but the sex toy industry is developing and there are lots of start-ups working on sex toys for women."" She thinks robots designed for intimate relationships, will ultimately enhance rather than damage human relationships. ""There is always panic whenever there is a big dramatic technology shift,"" she said. ""People panic about how it will affect humans but the technology generally brings people together.""

"This video can not be played The boss in shining armour. By video journalist Greg Brosnan Jason Kingsley seems far too relaxed about the fatal dangers inherent in his daredevil hobby. ""There have been some deaths in jousting,"" he says. ""But it is usually through inexperience, the wrong safety equipment, and a lot of bad luck combined."" Putting on an exact replica of a medieval suit of armour, the 53-year-old jousts a dozen or so weekends every year. Holding a 12ft (3.7m) long steel-tipped wooden lance in front of him, he rides a stallion full pelt towards another would-be knight coming at him in a similarly determined attempt to knock him off his horse. ""You are both moving at about 20mph (32km/h), so [if the other person's lance hits you] it is like hitting a brick wall at 40mph. ""I have never fallen off, but I have taken three people out of the saddle. Historically people have died, and it is always the lance tip going through the eye slot [of the helmet]."" Given how Jason spends his weekends, you might imagine that his day job is equally daring, that he is some sort of professional stuntman. Jason doesn't wear the suit of armour to work Instead, he is the chief executive of one of the UK's largest computer games companies - Rebellion Developments. Jason set up the Oxford-based business with his younger brother Chris in 1992, and today it has an annual turnover of more than Â£25m. Still wholly owned by the two siblings, its best-selling titles include Sniper Elite and Rogue Trooper. For the past 17 years the company has also owned cult UK comic book series 2000 AD, and publishes a range of novels. Rebellion's best-selling games include the Sniper Elite series While Jason doesn't wear one of his Â£25,000 suits of armour in the office, he says that he tries to run Rebellion - and all other aspects of his life - according to a medieval knight's chivalric code of conduct. ""What the code comes down to is try to be a decent person... and there are three parts - bravery, honesty and kindness. ""In business the need to be brave is obvious; the ability to charge forward and seize the opportunity, and do the best that you can with it. ""It is also about exploring new territories and seeking out new markets. It is an essential component in being a leader."" Jason's three tenets in life are bravery, honesty and kindness He adds: ""Honesty doesn't mean telling everyone your secrets, it means dealing fairly with people. ""So in business, I don't try to get the best deal for myself, I'm trying to get the best deal for both sides. ""This is fairer and the right thing to do, and if the other side makes a profit they will come back and work with me again. ""And kindness is simply about the need to treat people well."" As a teenager Jason says that he and his brother both loved role-playing games. They would sit around a table with their friends and each take on a fantasy character, such as a wizard or knight. Dice would then be thrown to determine how the characters interacted with each other, and how the stories developed. Jason also wrote a number of ""gamebooks"", where the reader has to decide how the story develops from multiple-choice options. Jason Kingsley has 13 horses to look after Studying at Oxford University, they started to develop and programme computer games as a hobby. After they both graduated, Jason says they decided to start Rebellion ""because we loved games, and we saw an opportunity in making computer games"". He adds: ""It really was just naivety and enthusiasm, but I think that is a really good reason for starting a business, because it is much easier to be successful if you love what you are doing."" Working on a number of demo games, Rebellion got its first big break in 1993 when it won a contract from then-games giant Atari to produce the title Alien vs Predator. The game was a bestseller, and Rebellion has never looked back. After making games for other companies, such as James Bond and various titles for The Simpsons, it today tries to focus more on producing and distributing its own material. The firm employs 220 people, mainly at its base in Oxford Jason says: ""We knew we wanted to build up our own IP (intellectual property) and fund our own games, and that is where we are now. ""It has taken us a long time, 25 years to get there... but we now come up with the ideas, fully fund the games, and release them ourselves worldwide. And that's great, there's no-one else in the loop."" Profits from the computer games sales have also been used to expand the business into other areas, such as buying 2000 AD, home to cult comic character Judge Dredd. While Jason won't reveal the exact cost of the deal, he says it was ""many millions"". ""We felt that 2000 AD was on the decline [under its then-Danish owner], and needed to be owned and cherished by someone British who knew the culture of what it was trying to do. ""I genuinely think it is an important bit of our cultural heritage."" Gaming industry expert Dan Maher says that Rebellion has been particularly praised for its custodianship of the 2000 AD comic book. ""As the name suggests, the company prides itself on going against the grain, using the money earned from an industry driven by bleeding-edge technology to make uncynical acquisitions in the traditional publishing sector,"" says Mr Maher. Rebellion bought 2000 AD and its famous character Judge Dredd in, well, 2000 AD ""Such moves, driven as they are by real love and appreciation for comics and sci-fi, have earned them great respect from consumers and professionals alike.""

"It is a typical November Tuesday for Mary, who lives in the north-east of the United States. She is 44, has a degree, and her family is prosperous - in the top quarter of American households by income. So what has she done today? Is she a lawyer or a teacher? No. Mary spent an hour knitting and sewing, two hours setting the table and doing the dishes and well over two hours preparing and cooking food. She is not unusual, because it is 1965 and at that time, many married American women - even those with an excellent education - spent large chunks of their day catering for their families. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. We know about Mary's day - and those of many others - because of time-use surveys conducted around the world. These diaries reveal precisely how different people use their time. For educated women, the way time is spent in the US and other rich countries has changed radically over the past half a century. Women in America now spend around 45 minutes per day in total cooking and cleaning up. That's still much more than men, who spend only 15 minutes a day doing such tasks. But it is a vast reduction from Mary's four hours. Behind this shift is a radical change to the way the food we eat is prepared, as seen by the introduction of the TV dinner in 1954. Presented in a space-age aluminium tray, and prepared so that everything would require the same cooking time, the ""frozen turkey tray TV dinner"" was developed by a bacteriologist called Betty Cronin. She worked for the Swanson food processing company, keen to find ways to keep busy after the business of supplying rations to US troops had dried up. But of course the TV dinner was only part of a panoply of changes, wrought by the availability of freezers, microwaves, preservatives and production lines. Food had been perhaps the last cottage industry: something that would overwhelmingly be produced in the home. But food preparation has been industrialised - outsourced to restaurants and takeaways and to factories that prepare ready-to-eat or ready-to-cook meals. And the invention of the industrial meal - in all its forms - has led to a profound shift in the modern economy. How we spend on food is changing. In 2015, US consumers spent more money on food and drink outside their home than on groceries for the first time American families spend increasingly more outside the home - on fast food, restaurant meals, sandwiches and snacks. Only a quarter of food spending was outside the home in the 1960s. That has steadily risen over time and in 2015 a landmark was reached: for the first time, Americans spent more on food and drink outside the home than at grocery stores. The British passed that particular milestone more than a decade earlier. Even within the home, food is increasingly processed to save the chef time and effort: bagged chopped salad, pre-grated cheese, jars of pasta sauce, individual permeable tea bags, meatballs doused in sauce and chicken that comes plucked and gutted. Each new innovation would seem bizarre to the older generation. I have never plucked a chicken and perhaps my children will never chop salad. All this saves time - serious amounts of time. Such innovation is a modern phenomenon. When the economist Valerie Ramey compared time-use diaries in the US between the 1920s and the 1960s, she found that surprisingly little had changed. Whether women were uneducated and married to farmers, or highly educated and married to urban professionals, they still spent similar amounts of time on housework across those 50 years. It was only in the 1960s that this pattern began to shift. But surely the innovation responsible for emancipating women was not the TV dinner, but the washing machine? The idea is widely believed and is appealing. A frozen TV dinner does not really feel like progress, compared to home-cooked food. The washing machine was innovative, but did not save much time But a washing machine is clean and efficient and replaces work that was always drudgery. How could it not have been revolutionary? Well it was, of course. However, the revolution wasn't in the lives of women, it was in how lemon fresh we all started to smell. As Alison Wolf argues in her book The XX Factor, the evidence is clear that the washing machine did not save a lot of time, because before washing machines, we did not wash clothes very often. When it took all day to wash and dry a few shirts, people used replaceable collars and cuffs or dark outer layers to hide the grime. In contrast, when it took two or three hours to prepare a meal, someone had to take that time. There was not an alternative. The washing machine did not save much time, and the ready meal did, because we were not willing to starve, but we were willing to stink. Tick tock: The importance of knowing the right time How a razor revolutionised the way we pay for stuff Rise of the robots: What advances mean for workers Geeks v government: The battle to secure the internet The availability of ready meals has had some regrettable side-effects. Obesity rates rose sharply in developed countries between the 1970s and the early 21st Century, at much the same time as these culinary innovations were being developed. This is no coincidence, say health economists. The cost of calories has fallen dramatically, not just in financial terms but also in terms of time. Consider the humble potato. It has long been a staple of the American diet, but before World War Two potatoes were usually baked, mashed or boiled. There's a reason for that: roast potatoes need to be peeled, chopped, par-boiled and then roasted. French fries or chips must be finely chopped and then deep fried. Over time, however, the production of fried sliced potato chips - both French fries and crisps - was centralised. French fries can be peeled, chopped, fried and frozen in a factory and then refried in a fast-food restaurant or microwaved at home. Obesity rates have risen sharply since the large scale industrialisation of food production Between 1977 and 1995, American potato consumption increased by a third, almost entirely because of the rise of fried potatoes. Even simpler, crisps can be fried, salted, flavoured and packaged to last for many weeks on the shelf. But this convenience comes at a cost. In the US, calorie intake by adults rose by about 10% between the 1970s and the 1990s. Not as a result of more calorific regular meals but because of increased snacking - usually of processed convenience food. Psychology - and common sense - suggest this should not be a surprise. Experiments by behavioural scientists show that we make very different decisions about what to eat depending on how far away the meal is. A long-planned meal is likely to be nutritious, but when we make more impulsive decisions, our snacks are more likely to be junk food than something nourishing. The industrialisation of food - symbolised by the TV dinner - changed our economy in two important ways. It freed women from hours of domestic chores, removing a large obstacle to them adopting serious professional careers. But by making empty calories ever more convenient to acquire, it also freed our waistlines to expand. The challenge now - as with so many inventions - is to enjoy the benefit without also suffering the cost.

"The claim:Workers' living standards have been falling far too fast for far too long. Reality Check verdict:Average pay adjusted for prices has been rising for the past couple of years, but is still below the level it was 10 years ago, before the financial crisis. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of trade union umbrella body the TUC, has been talking about payon the BBC News Channel. ""I think all major parties need to wake up to the fact that workers' living standardsâ¦ have been falling far too fast for too long,"" she said. The usual measure of whether living standards are falling is whether pay is rising faster than prices. This chart adjusts average pay for changes in inflation, measured by the consumer price index (CPI), to give real average earnings. It's been a tough 10 years for pay. Real average earnings have still not returned to the level they were at before the financial crisis. If prices are rising faster than wages then people's spending power falls. In the last few years, low levels of inflation have meant that pay rises have on average outstripped price rises. But inflation has now been boosted, partly by the rising price of imports caused by the falling value of the pound since the EU referendum was called. You can see from this chart that average prices and pay are currently running at about the same rate. While real wages are still below their pre-financial crisis levels, they have been rising since the autumn of 2014, although that appears to have stalled now. But all of these figures are based on averages, which do not help with the experiences of different areas and sectors of the country. Many workers in the public sector have had pay increases capped at 1%, which has generally been below the rate of inflation. Levels of pay vary considerablythroughout the country,,externalwith average earnings on the whole higher in the south-east of England than in most of the rest of the country. Average pay has also grown faster for people who have been in jobs for more than a year, which some people have interpreted as meaning that it is new jobs being created that are dragging down average pay. However, it may also be argued that it just shows more stable jobs tend to be better paid. Bank of England governor Mark Carneywarned last week that ""wages won't keep up with prices"" this year,meaning ""a more challenging time for British households"". The latest figures for inflation will be released on Tuesday, with average earnings being updated as part of the labour market figures on Wednesday.

"The recent hijacking of a ship by Somali pirates was the first such incident off the Horn of Africa since 2012, and more ships are being targeted off West Africa. But why are attacks increasing and how should the international community respond? The latestState of Maritime Piracy report,externalby the watchdog Oceans Beyond Piracy (OBP) warns against security complacency in the shipping industry, particularly around the Horn of Africa. It appears the industry has gone from a state of heightened security awareness to taking its foot off the pedal. After five years without any hijackings, the Comoros-flagged vessel Aris 13 was seized in March off the coast of Somalia. Pirates freed the oil tanker and its Sri Lankan crew three days later without ransom. But within weeks, there had been more incidents. On the other side of the continent, piracy has not declined even though its form has changed. In its 2015 report, the OBP noted that attacks were on the rise off the West African coast. One out of every five pirate attacks takes place there, making it the most dangerous region for seafarers. Pirates used to seize oil tankers for their cargo but falling oil prices made this less lucrative, so there was a shift to kidnapping for ransom. Foreign seafarers were the obvious targets, as the pirates can make higher ransom demands for them. These attacks were also reported to be more violent. That trend appears to have continued. West African governments have poor surveillance systems, which criminals can exploit. Piracy off Africa reached its heights in 2010-11, prompting a major international response At its peak - between 2010 and 2011 - piracy off the Horn of Africa cost the shipping industry up to $7bn (Â£5.42bn) annually. This prompted an international response led by the tripartite coalition of Nato, theEuropean Union Naval Force,external(EU NAVFOR) and the US Combined Maritime Forces. The use of private security, which was once frowned upon, became common practice. The associated costs and the overall success must have fed the perception that the piracy had been solved. Somalia piracy: India ship hijacked in new attack BBC Africa Experts: Piracy in the Gulf of Guinea Somalia drought fuelling piracy - US Africa command head In November 2016, Japan scaled down its counter-piracy mission in the Gulf of Aden. Weeks later, Nato ended its operation Ocean Shield, which operated around the same area, hailing it as one of the organisation's most successful ever missions, one which had achieved its objectives. However, the pirates never really went away. They just could not strike because of the armed presence in their seas. It's a point that the former Operation Commander for EU NAVFOR Maj Gen Martin Smith explained to me more than a year ago. ""We've taken away the opportunity for pirates to go to seaâ¦ but we're very conscious that the capability required is fairly basic,"" he said. Though subdued, the pirate networks still exist, warns Maj Gen Martin Smith ""Secondly we are aware that the intent still exists. The pirate networks still exist, they're just doing other things and we believe that if we gave them back the opportunity they would go back to piracy."" Now it appears that that is exactly what has happened, as some of the anti-piracy units have completed their mission and have headed home. This is coupled with the issue of illegal fishing by foreign vessels in the area. One of the pirates who hijacked the Aris 13 told the BBC Somali Service that the foreign ships are not just depleting fish reserves but are also attacking local fishing boats. ""We were after a particular ship that destroyed some of our equipment, when we came across this one, about eight miles from the coast,"" he claimed. ""It came across  initially as a fishing vessel, and later on, when we went inside, we discovered that it [was] a cargo ship, transporting oil. We had to hold it, because we have nothing to lose anyway."" While these claims cannot be independently verified, it is true that vessels from elsewhere in the world come to fish illegally in the waters off the Horn of Africa. EU NAVFOR Somalia patrols the country's coast and its territorial and internal waters The Stop Illegal Fishing campaign highlights a global enforcement imbalance as one of the key reasons for the trend. As it says: ""Effective controls in other regions force illegal operators to seek alternative fishing areas where the risk of being caught is lower and the sanctions if caught are less severe, such as the [Western Indian Ocean]."" The mandates of the international naval patrols are limited to counter-piracy operations, rather than maritime policing. The problems both on the eastern and western coasts of Africa involve the absence, or poor implementation, of regional maritime strategies. Ninety per cent of Africa's imports and exports are conducted by sea. Its waters also include key global shipping lanes, such as the Gulf of Aden, so securing these channels would be of great value to the continent and its partners, who both need to show the will to see maritime security improved.

"Pili Hussein wanted to make her fortune prospecting for a precious stone that's said to be a thousand times rarer than diamonds, but since women weren't allowed down the mines she dressed up as man and fooled her male colleagues for almost a decade. Pili Hussein grew up in a large family in Tanzania.  The daughter of a livestock keeper who had many large farms, Pili's father had six wives and she was one of 38 children. Although she was well looked after, in many ways, she doesn't look back on her upbringing fondly. ""My father treated me like a boy and I was given livestock to take care of - I didn't like that life at all,"" she says. But her marriage was even more unhappy, and at the age of 31 Pili ran away from her abusive husband. In search of work she found herself in the small Tanzanian town of Mererani, in the foothills of Africa's highest mountain, Kilimanjaro - the only place in the world where mining for a rare, violet-blue gemstone called tanzanite takes place. Maasai herders first discovered tanzanite in 1967 - it's now one of the world's best-selling gems but is in limited supply ""I didn't go to school, so I didn't have many options,"" Pili says. ""Women were not allowed in the mining area, so I entered bravely like a man, like a strong person. You take big trousers, you cut them into shorts and you appear like a man. That's what I did."" To complete the transformation, she also changed her name. ""I was called Uncle Hussein, I didn't tell anyone my actual name was Pili. Even today if you come to the camp you ask for me by that name, Uncle Hussein."" In the tight confines of the hot, dirty tunnels - some of which extend hundreds of metres below the ground - Pili would work 10-12 hours a day, digging and sieving, hoping to uncover gemstones in the veins in the graphite rock. ""I could go 600m under, into the mine. I would do this more bravely than many other men. I was very strong and I was able to deliver what men would expect another man could do."" Pili says that nobody suspected that she was a woman. This video can not be played Pili Hussein tells Outlook's Matthew Bannister how she succeeded in becoming a miner ""I acted like a gorilla,"" she says, ""I could fight, my language was bad, I could carry a big knife like a Maasai [warrior]. Nobody knew I was a woman because everything I was doing I was doing like a man."" And after about a year, she struck it rich, uncovering two massive clusters of tanzanite stones. With the money that she made she built new homes for her father, mother and twin sister, bought herself more tools, and began employing miners to work for her. And her cover was so convincing that it took an extraordinary set of circumstances for her true identity to finally be revealed. A local woman had reported that she'd been raped by some of the miners and Pili was arrested as a suspect. ""When the police came, the men who did the rape said: 'This is the man who did it,' and I was taken to the police station,"" Pili says. The miners dig using chisels and fill bags with rubble which are hoisted up to the surface using a rope She had no choice but to reveal her secret. She asked the police to find a woman to physically examine her, to prove that she couldn't be responsible, and was soon released. But even after that her fellow miners found it hard to believe they had been duped for so long. ""They didn't even believe the police when they said that I was a woman,"" she says, ""it wasn't easy for them to accept until 2001 when I got married and I started a family."" Finding a husband when everyone is accustomed to regarding you as a man is not easy, Pili found, though eventually she succeeded. ""The question in his mind was always, 'Is she really a woman?'"" she recalls. ""It took five years for him to come closer to me."" Pili has built a successful career and today owns her own mining company with 70 employees. Three of her employees are women, but they work as cooks not as miners. Pili says that although there are more women in the mining industry than when she started out, even today very few actually work in the mines. ""Some [women] wash the stones, some are brokers, some are cooking,"" she says, ""but they're not going down in to the mines, it's not easy to get women to do what I did."" Pili's success has enabled her to pay for the education of more than 30 nieces, nephews and grandchildren. But despite this she says she wouldn't encourage her own daughter to follow in her footsteps. ""I'm proud of what I did - it has made me rich, but it was hard for me,"" she says. ""I want to make sure that my daughter goes to school, she gets an education and then she is able to run her life in a very different way, far away from what I experienced.""

Experiments by behavioural scientists show that we make very different decisions about what to eat depending on how far away the meal is. A long-planned meal is likely to be nutritious, but when we make more impulsive decisions, our snacks are more likely to be junk food than something nourishing. The industrialisation of food - symbolised by the TV dinner - changed our economy in two important ways. It freed women from hours of domestic chores, removing a large obstacle to them adopting serious professional careers. But by making empty calories ever more convenient to acquire, it also freed our waistlines to expand. The challenge now - as with so many inventions - is to enjoy the benefit without also suffering the cost.
