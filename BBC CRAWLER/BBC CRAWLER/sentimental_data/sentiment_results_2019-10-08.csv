"The port in Stranraer was used for ferry services to Northern Ireland up until 2011 The Scottish government could repurpose the old port at Stranraer as a lorry park in the event of a no-deal Brexit, MSPs have been told. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said there were concerns about traffic flows with Northern Ireland if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. He also warned that the Scottish economy could be tipped into recession. The UK government insisted it wanted a deal, and was supporting devolved administrations for exit on 31 October. Sources within Downing Street have said a Brexit deal was ""essentially impossible"" after talks between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The Scottish government has set outa paper of preparations,externalfor the impact of a no-deal departure, which Mr Swinney said was becoming a ""significant risk"". What is 'no-deal Brexit'? Brexit: Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? Brexit deal essentially impossible - No 10 source The most recent extension to the Brexit deadline expires at the end of the month, with Mr Johnson vowing to leave with or without a deal. This is in spite of legislation passed in the Commons which requires him to write to European leaders requesting a fresh extension if no agreement is struck by 19 October. Setting out the Scottish government's analysis and plans at Holyrood, Mr Swinney saidthe latest UK proposals""appear designed to fail"" and were ""part of a political tactic to shift the blame on to Ireland and the EU as a whole"". This video can not be played Ferries to Ireland move from the port of Stranraer to Cairnryan after more than 150 years in a move to cut costs and travel time Stranraerbid farewell to its ferriesjust a little under eight years ago. Stena Linemoved its operations a short distance up the coast to north of Cairnryanin order to cut costs and reduce crossing times to Northern Ireland. It brought to anend the town's role as a ferry portwhich dated back about 150 years. There has been a concerted effort since then toregenerate Stranraer's waterfront areain order to make it a marine leisure destination. The town recently hosted aninternational coastal rowing championshipsand also stages anannual oyster festivalas efforts continue to increase visitor numbers to the former ferry port town. Plans have been made in parts of England for emergency lorry parking in the event of delays post-Brexit, with suggestions ofmotorways being used as holding areas. The Scottish plans could see similar provisions at Stranraer, a former ferry port which was last used in 2011 when services to Northern Ireland switched to nearby Cairnryan. The most recent proposals put to Brussels would seeNorthern Ireland adhering to EU ruleson the regulation of some goods - meaning there would have to be checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, potentially at crossings on the Irish Sea. Look back at John Swinney's statement John Swinney updated MSPs on the latest plans for a no-deal exit, something he said was a ""significant risk"" Mr Swinney said: ""In the event of increased traffic flows between Northern Ireland and Scotland, we are looking to repurpose the disused port at Stranraer to hold up to 300 HGVs to help deal with any potential disruption."" Other plans to mitigate the effects of a no-deal exit include: A Â£7m fund for councils to support vulnerable communities with housing, fuel poverty or food insecurity A flexible resource of 300 public-order trained police officers to deal with ""any Brexit-related civil contingency issues"" A special group to respond to shortages of medicines Support for Marine Scotland in case of ""disorder at sea"", including ""hostile or illegal activity"" Mr Swinney warned that ""there is no amount of preparation that could ever make us 'ready', in any real sense, for the needless and significant impact of a no-deal outcome"". He said such a move ""has the potential to generate a significant economic shock"" which could ""tip the Scottish economy into recession"" - and cause prices to rise by 5%, which would ""push an additional 130,000 people it poverty"". The deputy first minister added: ""There is no doubt that a no-deal outcome would have profound consequences for jobs, investment and living standards across Scotland and the rest of the UK - the UK government should do the responsible thing and rule it out now."" Much planning has gone into how to keep traffic flowing at vital Channel crossings such as Dover The UK has its own assessment for the possible affects of a no-deal Brexit,known as ""Operation Yellowhammer"". This includes a warning of significant queues at Channel crossings, particularly in Dover - with contingency plans to hold up to 6,000 lorries at Manston Airfield, near Ramsgate, and thousands more on the M26 and M20 motorways. Plans have also been made to deal with disruption to food supplies, shortages of medicines, energy prices rises and protests. A spokesman said the UK government ""want a deal and want to talk"" with European counterparts, but said any deal ""will require movement from the EU"". He said: ""We will be ready for Brexit on 31 October with or without a deal. ""We are also supporting the devolved administrations to get ready for Brexit on 31 October and we have committed almost Â£140 million to the Scottish government to fund their preparations."" This position was echoed at Holyrood by Scottish Conservative MSP Donald Cameron, who said the best way to avoid a no-deal exit was to agree a deal, but that ""any responsible government"" should be preparing for either outcome. Meanwhile, Scottish Labour's Alex Rowley meanwhile agreed with Mr Swinney that any talk of a deal was ""disingenuous"" in light of the ""unworkable solutions"" put forward.

"The UK winner now has a fortune eclipsing those of singers Sir Tom Jones, Adele and Ed Sheeran A UK ticket-holder has won the full Â£170m Euromillions jackpot, making them Britain's richest ever lottery winner. National Lottery operator Camelot said the Â£170,221,000.00 jackpot was won by a single ticket-holder on Tuesday. The ticket-holder is yet to be named and it is unknown if it is a single person, a family or a syndicate. The winning numbers picked were 7, 10, 15, 44 and 49, with 3 and 12 selected for the Lucky star numbers. If the winner is an individual, their new found fortune would earn them a place on the Sunday Times' Rich List of the 1,000 wealthiest people living in the UK or with British business links. What do you do with Â£170m? According to the paper's 2019 rankings,external, the winner's wealth eclipses that of singers Sir Tom Jones, Ed Sheeran and Adele, who are worth Â£165m, Â£160m and Â£150m respectively.  Â£161mColin and Chris Weir, from North Ayrshire, Scotland in 2011. Â£148mAdrian and Gillian Bayford, from Suffolk, in 2012. Â£123mAnonymous UK ticket-holder in June. Â£121.3mAnonymous UK ticket-holder in April last year. Â£114.9mPatrick and Frances Connolly, from NI, in January. The lucky ticket-holder has also beaten the previous record set by Colin and Chris Weir who became Britain's richest lottery winners when they claimed Â£161m in 2011. Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser at the National Lottery, said: ""One incredibly lucky ticket-holder has scooped tonight's enormous Â£170m Euromillions jackpot. ""They are now the UK's biggest ever winner. Players all across the country are urged to check their tickets as soon as possible."" The Euromillions jackpot has rolled over 22 consecutive times since July 19, first reaching the maximum prize fund of Â£170m (â¬190m) on 24 September. Under jackpot cap rules, the top prize can roll over four consecutive times once the cap has been reached, before it must be won in the fifth and final draw, which happened on Tuesday. If no one had won the jackpot by matching five numbers plus two Lucky Stars, the entire jackpot would have rolled down to the next highest tier, most likely where five numbers and one Lucky star are matched. It is the first time that a jackpot has gone the full five draws at its cap and only the second time that a Must Be Won draw has ever been held; the first was on November 17, 2006. Tickets for Euromillions are sold in nine countries - the UK, France, Spain, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Irish Republic, Portugal and Switzerland - with ticket-holders in all those countries trying to win a share of the same jackpot each week.

"In 2017, the government's flagship treatment scheme for people convicted in England and Wales of rape or child sexual abuse was scrapped after it was shown to raise the risk of reoffending. Two sex offenders have told BBC Radio 4's File on 4 programme what it was like to take part in the rehabilitation programme. ""Everything was discussed in minute detail. They had what was called the 'hot seat' and every prisoner that was in a group had to sit in the hot seat and they were bombarded - it was like an interrogation."" These are Paul's experiences of group sessions on the discredited Sex Offender Treatment Programme (SOTP), which ran from the early 1990s until 2017. Paul has been convicted of numerous offences, including rape, and is serving a long jail sentence. Speaking to me from a prison pay-phone, he says he started the SOTP on three occasions - it was a cognitive behaviour therapy designed to teach offenders to think and act differently. But, the 60-year-old says, each time, he was removed from the course before the end because group facilitators thought he ""wasn't learning anything"". ""Being in group settings, discussing serious offences and some less serious offences - because these groups were mixed - actually made prisoners worse and normalised what prisoners were doing,"" he says. Rapists, murderers, child sex offenders and ""flashers"" were all placed together, says Paul. ""People were learning from their mistakes - they were learning from other group members how to perhaps be better sex offenders without being caught."" Ministry of Justice (MoJ) research showed 10% of men who had completed the SOTP reoffended, compared with 8% of those who had not done the programme. Kathryn Hopkins's research revealed those who went on the SOTP were more likely to reoffend. The results were published five years after analyst Kathryn Hopkins first alerted the department the scheme might not be working. Paul also claims some inmates were told to disclose the names of their victims as part of the process of setting out their offending history in graphic detail. ""It was to physically humiliate you and break you - I could see no other purpose for it,"" he says. Many of Paul's observations are shared by Dr Robert Forde, a retired forensic psychologist who used to work for the Home Office and is an expert on assessing risk. Dr Forde toldFile on 4: ""One prisoner said to me, 'I hate doing this course because I've never had so many deviant sexual thoughts as I've had since I started because we're talking about sex offending all the time and actually I want to get away from all that.'"" Another prisoner, who had himself been a victim of sex abuse as a child, told him he had been asked to give details of what had happened to him in front of paedophiles who had became aroused as a result. Dr Forde said some prisoners on the SOTP courses would ""play the system"" in order to convince the Parole Board they were safe to be released. He said one prisoner had told him: ""You claim to have things like deviant thoughts about victims or indulge in deviant sexual practices and then after the course is finished and you're doing the post-course assessment, you then drop all these things and you just tell the truth."" The inmate claimed this would then result in the prisoner being given a lower risk score by course assessors. Former prisoner Peter, who has served two sentences for sexual offences against children and possessing indecent images, tells me the SOTP provided a false sense of security. ""You come out thinking you're fixed,"" he says. ""There's that feeling... because it's a treatment programme and that's what treatment does, doesn't it - fixes what's wrong?"" Now in his 50s, Peter had to do a ""booster"" course when he was first released. ""You're going back over the offences, so you keep reliving this stuff that just isn't helpful,"" he says. ""You're not going to forget what you've done and you know you've made victims... if you're going to be a useful member of society, you need to try and move your life forward."" During his second spell in jail, Peter completed one-to-one sessions as part of the Healthy Sex Programme, which he found far more beneficial because it focused less on his offending and more on steps to overcome his problems. He is now receiving support at the Corbett Centre, a groundbreaking project in Nottingham run by the Safer Living Foundation Charity. It provides a range of emotional help and practical support for about 30 sex offenders living in the community. ""You're in an environment where people know what's happened,"" Peter says. ""So you're not having to start your life with a lie... you can put your life back on track."" Although the Corbett Centre shows some promising early signs, it will be some years before it is known whether it reduces reoffending in the long term. A number of Ministry of Justice initiatives are also unproven - the Healthy Sex Programme is currently being evaluated, while the two sex offender rehabilitation schemes that replaced the SOTP, Horizon and Kaizen, have yet to be tested. The MoJ says it works ""closely"" with the Correctional Services Accreditation and Advice Panel in the design of programmes delivered in prison and on probation. The department says the panel, which has to approve such schemes before they can be used, is made up of ""independent experts from academia and practice from across the world"". But two forensic psychiatrists, Penny Brown and Callum Ross, have been so alarmed by the failings in the SOTP programme they are calling for greater oversight of new forms of treatment. This week, the Lancet Psychiatry medical journal published a paper they have written. ""We want to get reassurance that government-funded policy research is subjected to the same requirements and high academic standards that are placed on everybody else and all other scientists,"" says Dr Brown. ""The need to show that you're doing something shouldn't override the risk of actually causing harm."" File on 4is on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 on 8 October and 17:00 on 13 October andBBC Sounds.

"This video can not be played Watch as Turkish tanks are sent to the border with Syria Turkey has boosted its forces on the Syrian border ahead of a long-threatened incursion that could target Kurdish-led forces allied to the US. Troops would cross into Syria ""shortly"", a presidential aide said. Turkey wants to create a ""safe zone"" cleared of a Kurdish militia that will also house some of Turkey's 3.6 million Syrian refugees. President Donald Trump has withdrawn US troops in the area in a controversial move condemned at home and abroad. He again defended his move on Tuesday, saying the Kurds had not been abandoned, calling them ""special"". The Kurds were key US allies in defeating the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in Syria. But Turkey regards the Kurdish militia that dominates the US-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) as a terrorist group. The US pullout was seen as paving the way for an offensive. Convoys of trucks with armoured personnel carriers and tanks were seen heading to the Turkish border town of Akcakale on Tuesday night. Images of buses carrying personnel were shown by state news agency Anadolu. Turkey is planning to create a 32km (20-mile) deep ""safe zone"" running for 480km along the Syrian side of the border. Kurds inside Syria have been holding protests against the threat of a Turkish incursion Fahrettin Altun, the Turkish president's director of communications, said Turkish forces would cross the border shortly to ""neutralise a long-standing threat against Turkish citizens"". Kurdish militia fighters, he said, could either ""defect or we will have [to] stop them from disrupting our counter-IS efforts"". Ibrahim Kalin, special adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, told the BBC ""the goal is to clear and secure our border along with Syria by eliminating all the terrorist elements"" and to create conditions for ""refugees to return safely and voluntarily"". Mr Kalin also said that ""Turkey has no intention of occupying any part of Syria"". Initial indications suggest a limited incursion by Turkey along a 100km stretch of the border between the towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain. It is a sparsely populated, mostly Arab, area and it is unclear what conflict with Kurdish forces would take place. US troops have already withdrawn from four border positions there, but they have not withdrawn from positions further east and west. The SDF said the border areas were ""on the edge of a possible humanitarian catastrophe"". ""The attack will spill the blood of thousands of innocent civilians,"" the SDF's general command said. The Kurdish-led administration in the region announced ""three days of general mobilisation in northern and eastern Syria"", calling on civilians to ""head to the border with Turkey to fulfil their duty"". Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Washington was sending mixed signals and Kurds feared the confusion could ""ignite the whole region"". Russia's security council said it was ""important for everyone to avoid any action that could create obstacles to a peaceful settlement in Syria"". He said his pullout - described as a ""stab in the back"" by the SDF - affected ""only 50 soldiers"" of some 1,000 US troops in the country. In a series of tweets, Mr Trump also praised Turkey as a trade partner and Nato ally, hours after sayinghe would ""destroy and obliterate"" its economyif the country went ""off limits"" in its incursion. Turkish forces positioned on the border with Syria near Akcakale ""We may be in the process of leaving Syria, but in no way have we abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters,"" Mr Trump said, adding that the US was helping the Kurds ""financially [and with] weapons"". Turkey v Syria's Kurds explained Who are the Kurds? Why the battle for northern Syria matters ""Any unforced or unnecessary fighting by Turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency,"" the president said as he described the relationship between the two countries as ""very good"". The Pentagon said Turkey had ""unfortunately... chosen to act unilaterally"" and US personnel had been removed ""to ensure their safety"" but were not leaving Syria. The White House also confirmed that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan would visit the US on 13 November at the invitation of President Trump. The SDF says it is detaining more than 12,000 men suspected of being IS members in seven prisons. At least 4,000 of the prisoners are foreign nationals. The exact locations have not been not published, but some are reportedly close to the Turkish border. This video can not be played Inside the camp of IS families in Syria Two camps - Roj and Ain Issa - holding families of suspected IS members are inside the ""safe zone"". Mr Trump warned Mr Erdogan if he did send troops into northern Syria, they would be responsible for securing captured IS fighters. The SDF has said its fighters will continue to guard the prisons and camps, but there is a concern they could be called away to other areas or be forced to flee if they come under attack. On Wednesday, IS militants reportedly carried out three suicide attacks in their former de facto capital of Raqqa, about 80km south of Akcakale on the Turkish border.

"This video can not be played Jennifer Arcuri: ""I'm not going to put myself in a position where you can weaponise my answer"" Downing Street has complied with an order to hand over details of Boris Johnson's contacts with Jennifer Arcuri, the London Assembly has said. But No 10 has asked the Assembly not to publish the document as it is ""confidential"", an Assembly spokesperson said. The PM is facing questions about his friendship with the US businesswoman when he was London mayor. He has denied claims of failing to declare a conflict of interest. Mr Johnson had been given until Tuesday to provide details of contacts with Ms Arcuri. The Assembly has said that they will comply with Downing Street's request for confidentiality, having previously said that they would publish the response. Speaking before the details were released, Len Duvall, chairman of the Assembly's oversight committee, said: ""The allegations are serious, I hope the prime minister is treating them seriously."" No 'favouritism' over Johnson links, Arcuri says Jennifer Arcuri: What's the story about? He said the assembly's powers to take action against Mr Johnson, if he was found to have breached its code of conduct, were limited because he was no longer mayor of London. He held the office between 2008 and 2016. But it could still summon the prime minister to appear before the oversight committee to answer further questions about his contacts with Ms Arcuri, along with others connected to the case. The committee has asked for the details and a timeline of all contact between Mr Johnson and Ms Arcuri, including private text messages and emails. According to the Sunday Times, which first reported the story, Ms Arcuri joined trade missions led by Mr Johnson when he was mayor and received thousands of pounds in public money. It is also understood she attended events on two of the trade missions - to New York and Tel Aviv - despite not officially qualifying for them as a delegate. The prime minister has denied breaking any rules of conduct and insisted everything was done ""entirely in the proper way"". Ms Arcuri told ITV's Good Morning Britain Mr Johnson was ""a really good friend"" - but denied the then mayor had shown any ""favouritism"" towards her. The code governing conduct at London City Hall states that public office holders should not act in any way to gain benefits for families or friends, and should declare private interests to resolve any conflicts. Mr Duvall, a Labour member of the London Assembly, said his committee was attempting to ""make a judgement call on what the relationship was"" before deciding what, if any, action it would take at a meeting next week. Separately, the Independent Office for Police Conduct has been asked to consider whether Mr Johnson, who as mayor was responsible for policing in London, should be investigated for misconduct in public office, a criminal offence. Current Mayor Sadiq Khan has asked a senior lawyer to review a 2013 decision by London and Partners, the mayor's promotional agency, to sponsor a conference organised one of Ms Arcuri's companies, for Â£10,000. London and Partners say they have found no evidence of Mr Johnson's involvement in the decision. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is, meanwhile, ""reviewing"" a Â£100,000 grant made in February this year to Ms Arcuri's cyber-security business Hacker House.

"This video can not be played A resident explains what she enjoys about her home An eco-friendly council estate in Norwich has scooped this year's prestigious Riba Stirling Prize for architecture. The Royal Institute of British Architects gives out the award each year to the UK's best new building. The estate, called Goldsmith Street, is made up of almost 100 ultra low-energy homes for Norwich City Council. It beat the likes of London Bridge Station and the Nevill Holt Opera, Market Harborough, to the prize. Goldsmith Street meets rigorous ""Passivhaus"" environmental standards, which means it ""provides a high level of occupant comfort while using very little energy for heating and cooling"", according to thePassivhaus Trust,external. Riba said the estate's environmental credentials made it a ""beacon of hope"" and highly unusual for a mass housing development. Meet the residents of Goldsmith Street Riba Stirling Prize: The nominees in full ""Faced with a global climate emergency, the worst housing crisis for generations and crippling local authority cuts, Goldsmith Street is a beacon of hope,"" said Riba president Alan Jones. ""It is commended not just as a transformative social housing scheme and eco-development, but a pioneering exemplar for other local authorities to follow."" Goldsmith Street is made up of two-storey houses, bookended by three-storey flats. The estate has been designed by architect company Mikhail Riches to be eco-friendly down to the smallest of detail. Letterboxes are built into external porches, rather than the front doors, to reduce draughts. Homes run on a passive solar scheme, estimated to bring residents annual energy bills which are 70% cheaper than those for the average household. All face south to get as much sunlight as possible; walls are more than 60cm thick and the roofs are tilted in such a way to avoid blocking sunlight from the neighbours. As for the aesthetic, they are made in materials referencing Norwich's history, such as glossy black roof pantiles, which are a nod to the city's Dutch trading links, and creamy clay bricks similar to Victorian terraces nearby. To give residents a sense of individuality and ownership, touches have been included such coloured front doors, generous lobby space for prams and bikes and private balconies. And to encourage a community spirit, the back gardens of the central terraces share a secure play area for children and a landscaped walkway for communal gatherings runs through the middle of the estate. ""It is not often we are appointed to work on a project so closely aligned with what we believe matters; buildings people love which are low impact,"" said David Mikhail of Mikhail Riches. ""We hope other local authorities will be inspired to deliver beautiful homes for people who need them the most, and at an affordable price.

The 13 are suspected of being part of the UK arm of a well established organised crime group that allegedly used Dutch and British front companies to import heroin, cocaine and cannabis. Four men and two women arrested in April by Dutch police, on a European Arrest Warrant, are awaiting extradition to the UK and are suspected of being part of the same conspiracy. This investigation has got results thanks to cross-border European co-operation.

"The FBI released Samuel Little's drawings in the hope that the victims could be identified. The FBI has confirmed an imprisoned murderer who confessed to 93 murders over four decades is the most prolific serial killer in US history. Police have matched Samuel Little, 79, to 50 cases from 1970 to 2005 thus far. He has been serving life in prison since 2012 for the murders of three women. Little targeted vulnerable individuals, mostly black women, many of whom were sex workers or drug users, officials say. A former competitive boxer, Little would knock his victims out with punches before strangling them - meaning that there were not always ""obvious signs"" that the person had been brutally murdered. Some of these deaths were never investigated by the FBI as a result, and many deaths were incorrectly determined to be overdoses or accidental. Some bodies have never been found, the agency said. In a statement on Monday, the FBI said its analysts believe ""all of his confessions are credible"". ""For many years, Samuel Little believed he would not be caught because he thought no one was accounting for his victims,"" FBI crime analyst Christie Palazzolo said in the statement. ""Even though he is already in prison, the FBI believes it is important to seek justice for each victim - to close every case possible."" Law enforcement is still working to verify the remaining 43 cases he confessed to. A recent mugshot of Little, who reportedly also went by the name Samuel McDowell Officials have nowreleased additional information about five cases,externalin Kentucky, Florida, Louisiana, Nevada and Arkansas to the public in hopes of identifying the unconfirmed victims. The agency had previously shared Little's coloured portraits of his victims, which he drew in prison, in an effort to identify more victims. FBI releases serial killer's drawings Why was there a spike in serial killers? The 40-year hunt for a killer They have also published video clips of the interviews where he described details of the murders. In one of the five cases the FBI is seeking public assistance to solve, Little describes meeting a young black transgender woman named Marianne or Mary Ann in Miami, Florida, in the early 70s. He described killing the 19-year-old on a driveway near a sugarcane field, dragging her body deeper into the Everglades. ""The earth was mushy,"" Little recounted. ""I turned her loose and she fell into it face down."" In another case, Little detailed strangling a woman in 1993 in a motel room in Las Vegas. He recalled having met her son before, even shaking his hand. After murdering her, he drove to the outskirts of the city and rolled her body down a slope. Officials have said Little's memory of the killings has been mostly precise, but he is unable to remember specific dates, which has hindered the investigation. It is unclear if Little will face more charges over the recent confessions. Little was arrested in 2012 on a drugs charge in Kentucky and extradited to California, where officers carried out DNA testing on him. Little already had an extensive criminal record, with offences from armed robbery to rape across the US. The DNA results linked him to three unsolved murders from 1987 and 1989 in Los Angeles County. He pleaded not guilty at trial, but was eventually convicted and sentenced to three consecutive life sentences, with no chance of parole. He was then referred to the FBI's Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (ViCAP) - a scheme that works to analyse serial offenders of violent and sexual crimes, and share information with local law enforcement agencies to cross-reference unsolved crimes. US serial killer 'confesses to 90 murders' Last year, Texas Ranger James Holland travelled with a ViCAP team to interview Little in California. They say Little agreed to talk to them because he was hoping to move prisons. Ranger Holland was able to question Little ""nearly daily"" and built up the full picture of his crimes.

"The company operates over two sites in Merthyr Tydfil county borough A furniture company has gone bust with 252 job losses after reporting ""a catastrophic collapse in orders"". Triumph Furniture of Merthyr Tydfil, which has bases in the town and Dowlais, supplied more than 600 furniture sellers, as well as being a major supplier of central government. The firm went into administration on Tuesday, after an ""unprecedented fall in sales"" over the last 10 weeks. Administrators said 239 jobs will go immediately. The remaining 13 will be kept on in the short-term to help administrators. Jobs in Wales: how has work changed over two decades? Honda axe impact for 12 Welsh firms Hoover jobs could leave Merthyr Tydfil It was established in 1946 as a family-run business, with chief executive Andrew Jackson describing its demise as fast. He said: ""The family is devastated by this appalling outcome and are extremely concerned for the welfare of all Triumph employees and their families at this terrible time. ""The business has suffered a rapid and catastrophic collapse in orders since the middle of July, which has been impossible to recover from, despite every effort."" He said Triumph had enjoyed ""incredible loyalty and support"" from the people of Merthyr Tydfil and the surrounding valleys, which has been a ""key element"" in its success and longevity. ""All connected with the business over these years should be very proud of what has been achieved,"" he added. There was a management buyout in 2011 after the firm ran into trouble A contractor said staff thought the writing was on the wall but were not expecting the company to fold this side of Christmas. ""A driver told me that over the last few months the work has been going down and down,"" he said. ""He had driven just two chairs to Aberdeen. When you're doing that, you know the business is in trouble "" Staff were gathered in the loading bay at the main Abercanaid site at about 12:00 on Tuesday - the only area big enough to accommodate them all in the dry. ""It was heartbreaking to see them walking back up slowly having been told they had lost their jobs,"" the contractor added. ""Most of the staff left immediately. ""I've been told there are just three staff remaining in the loading bay area to remove the rest of the stock and show auctioneers around."" A worker leaving the site said he was ""gutted"", adding: ""Work has slackened off, but I didn't expect it to shut."" He said: ""Tomorrow, wake up, try looking for a job. ""Trying my best. I've got four kids, a mortgage, money's got to come in. ""Somewhere for Christmas."" Most staff are said to have left the site after hearing the news Administrator Huw Powell, of Begbies Traynor, said attempts were made to secure major customer backing and additional funding to support a restructure or sale of the business. But he added: ""Due to the speed at which order levels reduced, these efforts ultimately proved unsuccessful before funding ran out."" Administrators are now working with staff to help them access support. Mr Powell said: ""It is especially sad to see such a prominent business fail when there are so many redundancies involved. ""We know this will be devastating news for those concerned."" Analysis from Brian Meechan, BBC Wales business correspondent Triumph's last accounts are filed up to June 2018. They show a loss of Â£343,000 for the year compared to a profit of Â£66,000 for the previous year. The company blames the financial situation on delays in new government contracts affecting sales and profits, lost public sector sales worth Â£401,000 in profit and a 2% increase in overheads. The accounts also pointed to continuing uncertainty over Brexit however they said that orders and profitability meant the company remained in a strong position. The accounts also warned that the drop in the value of the pound increased the costs of raw materials and that wages had risen. Currently the company has five outstanding charges-effectively mortgages- most of them with Lloyds Bank. Leader of Merthyr Tydfil county council Kevin O'Neill said: ""The closure of Triumph Furniture is very sad, not just for the employer and employees, but for the whole community."" He said council officials have been working with local employers and will host a recruitment day on Thursday. Economy Minister Ken Skates said: ""This is devastating news and my thoughts are with the employees of Triumph and their families at this very difficult time. ""Our focus now is on supporting the workforce and finding alterative local employment."" A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman reassured staff that the Jobcentre Plus Rapid Response Service will be working alongside the Welsh Government, Careers Wales and local employers to provide ""tailored support"". The company previously ran into trouble in 2011,entering administration before it was boughtby the firm's management team. At the time, Mr Jackson said Triumph Furniture needed to ""make sure we have the right product range at the right price for today's business; and the opportunity to do what we've always done well: offer the trade new ideas which can bolster the work of all our dealers in difficult times"".

"This video can not be played Watch as Turkish tanks are sent to the border with Syria Turkey has boosted its forces on the Syrian border ahead of a long-threatened incursion that could target Kurdish-led forces allied to the US. Troops would cross into Syria ""shortly"", a presidential aide said. Turkey wants to create a ""safe zone"" cleared of a Kurdish militia that will also house some of Turkey's 3.6 million Syrian refugees. President Donald Trump has withdrawn US troops in the area in a controversial move condemned at home and abroad. He again defended his move on Tuesday, saying the Kurds had not been abandoned, calling them ""special"". The Kurds were key US allies in defeating the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in Syria. But Turkey regards the Kurdish militia that dominates the US-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) as a terrorist group. The US pullout was seen as paving the way for an offensive. Convoys of trucks with armoured personnel carriers and tanks were seen heading to the Turkish border town of Akcakale on Tuesday night. Images of buses carrying personnel were shown by state news agency Anadolu. Turkey is planning to create a 32km (20-mile) deep ""safe zone"" running for 480km along the Syrian side of the border. Kurds inside Syria have been holding protests against the threat of a Turkish incursion Fahrettin Altun, the Turkish president's director of communications, said Turkish forces would cross the border shortly to ""neutralise a long-standing threat against Turkish citizens"". Kurdish militia fighters, he said, could either ""defect or we will have [to] stop them from disrupting our counter-IS efforts"". Ibrahim Kalin, special adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, told the BBC ""the goal is to clear and secure our border along with Syria by eliminating all the terrorist elements"" and to create conditions for ""refugees to return safely and voluntarily"". Mr Kalin also said that ""Turkey has no intention of occupying any part of Syria"". Initial indications suggest a limited incursion by Turkey along a 100km stretch of the border between the towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain. It is a sparsely populated, mostly Arab, area and it is unclear what conflict with Kurdish forces would take place. US troops have already withdrawn from four border positions there, but they have not withdrawn from positions further east and west. The SDF said the border areas were ""on the edge of a possible humanitarian catastrophe"". ""The attack will spill the blood of thousands of innocent civilians,"" the SDF's general command said. The Kurdish-led administration in the region announced ""three days of general mobilisation in northern and eastern Syria"", calling on civilians to ""head to the border with Turkey to fulfil their duty"". Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Washington was sending mixed signals and Kurds feared the confusion could ""ignite the whole region"". Russia's security council said it was ""important for everyone to avoid any action that could create obstacles to a peaceful settlement in Syria"". He said his pullout - described as a ""stab in the back"" by the SDF - affected ""only 50 soldiers"" of some 1,000 US troops in the country. In a series of tweets, Mr Trump also praised Turkey as a trade partner and Nato ally, hours after sayinghe would ""destroy and obliterate"" its economyif the country went ""off limits"" in its incursion. Turkish forces positioned on the border with Syria near Akcakale ""We may be in the process of leaving Syria, but in no way have we abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters,"" Mr Trump said, adding that the US was helping the Kurds ""financially [and with] weapons"". Turkey v Syria's Kurds explained Who are the Kurds? Why the battle for northern Syria matters ""Any unforced or unnecessary fighting by Turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency,"" the president said as he described the relationship between the two countries as ""very good"". The Pentagon said Turkey had ""unfortunately... chosen to act unilaterally"" and US personnel had been removed ""to ensure their safety"" but were not leaving Syria. The White House also confirmed that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan would visit the US on 13 November at the invitation of President Trump. The SDF says it is detaining more than 12,000 men suspected of being IS members in seven prisons. At least 4,000 of the prisoners are foreign nationals. The exact locations have not been not published, but some are reportedly close to the Turkish border. This video can not be played Inside the camp of IS families in Syria Two camps - Roj and Ain Issa - holding families of suspected IS members are inside the ""safe zone"". Mr Trump warned Mr Erdogan if he did send troops into northern Syria, they would be responsible for securing captured IS fighters. The SDF has said its fighters will continue to guard the prisons and camps, but there is a concern they could be called away to other areas or be forced to flee if they come under attack. On Wednesday, IS militants reportedly carried out three suicide attacks in their former de facto capital of Raqqa, about 80km south of Akcakale on the Turkish border. There was no confirmation of casualties.

"This video can not be played Jennifer Arcuri: ""I'm not going to put myself in a position where you can weaponise my answer"" Downing Street has complied with an order to hand over details of Boris Johnson's contacts with Jennifer Arcuri, the London Assembly has said. But No 10 has asked the Assembly not to publish the document as it is ""confidential"", an Assembly spokesperson said. The PM is facing questions about his friendship with the US businesswoman when he was London mayor. He has denied claims of failing to declare a conflict of interest. Mr Johnson had been given until Tuesday to provide details of contacts with Ms Arcuri. The Assembly has said that they will comply with Downing Street's request for confidentiality, having previously said that they would publish the response. Speaking before the details were released, Len Duvall, chairman of the Assembly's oversight committee, said: ""The allegations are serious, I hope the prime minister is treating them seriously."" No 'favouritism' over Johnson links, Arcuri says Jennifer Arcuri: What's the story about? He said the assembly's powers to take action against Mr Johnson, if he was found to have breached its code of conduct, were limited because he was no longer mayor of London. He held the office between 2008 and 2016. But it could still summon the prime minister to appear before the oversight committee to answer further questions about his contacts with Ms Arcuri, along with others connected to the case. The committee has asked for the details and a timeline of all contact between Mr Johnson and Ms Arcuri, including private text messages and emails. According to the Sunday Times, which first reported the story, Ms Arcuri joined trade missions led by Mr Johnson when he was mayor and received thousands of pounds in public money. It is also understood she attended events on two of the trade missions - to New York and Tel Aviv - despite not officially qualifying for them as a delegate. The prime minister has denied breaking any rules of conduct and insisted everything was done ""entirely in the proper way"". Ms Arcuri told ITV's Good Morning Britain Mr Johnson was ""a really good friend"" - but denied the then mayor had shown any ""favouritism"" towards her. The code governing conduct at London City Hall states that public office holders should not act in any way to gain benefits for families or friends, and should declare private interests to resolve any conflicts. Mr Duvall, a Labour member of the London Assembly, said his committee was attempting to ""make a judgement call on what the relationship was"" before deciding what, if any, action it would take at a meeting next week. Separately, the Independent Office for Police Conduct has been asked to consider whether Mr Johnson, who as mayor was responsible for policing in London, should be investigated for misconduct in public office, a criminal offence. Current Mayor Sadiq Khan has asked a senior lawyer to review a 2013 decision by London and Partners, the mayor's promotional agency, to sponsor a conference organised one of Ms Arcuri's companies, for Â£10,000. London and Partners say they have found no evidence of Mr Johnson's involvement in the decision. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is, meanwhile, ""reviewing"" a Â£100,000 grant made in February this year to Ms Arcuri's cyber-security business Hacker House.

"This video can not be played Watch as Turkish tanks are sent to the border with Syria Turkey has boosted its forces on the Syrian border ahead of a long-threatened incursion that could target Kurdish-led forces allied to the US. Troops would cross into Syria ""shortly"", a presidential aide said. Turkey wants to create a ""safe zone"" cleared of a Kurdish militia that will also house some of Turkey's 3.6 million Syrian refugees. President Donald Trump has withdrawn US troops in the area in a controversial move condemned at home and abroad. He again defended his move on Tuesday, saying the Kurds had not been abandoned, calling them ""special"". The Kurds were key US allies in defeating the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in Syria. But Turkey regards the Kurdish militia that dominates the US-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) as a terrorist group. The US pullout was seen as paving the way for an offensive. Convoys of trucks with armoured personnel carriers and tanks were seen heading to the Turkish border town of Akcakale on Tuesday night. Images of buses carrying personnel were shown by state news agency Anadolu. Turkey is planning to create a 32km (20-mile) deep ""safe zone"" running for 480km along the Syrian side of the border. Kurds inside Syria have been holding protests against the threat of a Turkish incursion Fahrettin Altun, the Turkish president's director of communications, said Turkish forces would cross the border shortly to ""neutralise a long-standing threat against Turkish citizens"". Kurdish militia fighters, he said, could either ""defect or we will have [to] stop them from disrupting our counter-IS efforts"". Ibrahim Kalin, special adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, told the BBC ""the goal is to clear and secure our border along with Syria by eliminating all the terrorist elements"" and to create conditions for ""refugees to return safely and voluntarily"". Mr Kalin also said that ""Turkey has no intention of occupying any part of Syria"". Initial indications suggest a limited incursion by Turkey along a 100km stretch of the border between the towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain. It is a sparsely populated, mostly Arab, area and it is unclear what conflict with Kurdish forces would take place. US troops have already withdrawn from four border positions there, but they have not withdrawn from positions further east and west. The SDF said the border areas were ""on the edge of a possible humanitarian catastrophe"". ""The attack will spill the blood of thousands of innocent civilians,"" the SDF's general command said. The Kurdish-led administration in the region announced ""three days of general mobilisation in northern and eastern Syria"", calling on civilians to ""head to the border with Turkey to fulfil their duty"". Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Washington was sending mixed signals and Kurds feared the confusion could ""ignite the whole region"". Russia's security council said it was ""important for everyone to avoid any action that could create obstacles to a peaceful settlement in Syria"". He said his pullout - described as a ""stab in the back"" by the SDF - affected ""only 50 soldiers"" of some 1,000 US troops in the country. In a series of tweets, Mr Trump also praised Turkey as a trade partner and Nato ally, hours after sayinghe would ""destroy and obliterate"" its economyif the country went ""off limits"" in its incursion. Turkish forces positioned on the border with Syria near Akcakale ""We may be in the process of leaving Syria, but in no way have we abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters,"" Mr Trump said, adding that the US was helping the Kurds ""financially [and with] weapons"". Turkey v Syria's Kurds explained Who are the Kurds? Why the battle for northern Syria matters ""Any unforced or unnecessary fighting by Turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency,"" the president said as he described the relationship between the two countries as ""very good"". The Pentagon said Turkey had ""unfortunately... chosen to act unilaterally"" and US personnel had been removed ""to ensure their safety"" but were not leaving Syria. The White House also confirmed that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan would visit the US on 13 November at the invitation of President Trump. The SDF says it is detaining more than 12,000 men suspected of being IS members in seven prisons. At least 4,000 of the prisoners are foreign nationals. The exact locations have not been not published, but some are reportedly close to the Turkish border. This video can not be played Inside the camp of IS families in Syria Two camps - Roj and Ain Issa - holding families of suspected IS members are inside the ""safe zone"". Mr Trump warned Mr Erdogan if he did send troops into northern Syria, they would be responsible for securing captured IS fighters. The SDF has said its fighters will continue to guard the prisons and camps, but there is a concern they could be called away to other areas or be forced to flee if they come under attack. On Wednesday, IS militants reportedly carried out three suicide attacks in their former de facto capital of Raqqa, about 80km south of Akcakale on the Turkish border. There was no confirmation of casualties.

"Lord Provost Eva Bolander receives a civic allowance The Lord Provost of Glasgow has been criticised after it emerged her expenses included claims for 23 pairs of shoes. TheDaily Record reports,externalEva Bolander submitted receipts totalling more than Â£8,000 over a 28-month period. A council spokesman said the SNP councillor incurs personal expenses as she is required to represent the city at hundreds of events. But Glasgow Labour MSP James Kelly said her position was not tenable. Mr Kelly said: ""While services for homeless people across Glasgow are being cut, the SNP Lord Provost has been touring the city in a grotesque spending spree at the taxpayers' expense. ""In just one trip to John Lewis she spent more on herself than what a worker being paid the national minimum wage earns in a whole week. ""Eva Bolander should pay back the money and resign."" Scottish Conservative Glasgow MSP Annie Wells said: ""For any politician to think they can claim something like this on expenses is a joke. ""It's not even one or two misdemeanours - these revelations show a pattern of behaviour which will be completely unacceptable to council tax payers in Glasgow. ""She must now do the right thing and stand down - there's simply no way she can continue in this senior role after these reports. She also owes the people of Glasgow an almighty apology."" The figures, obtained under a Freedom of Information request, cover claims between May 2017 and August this year. The paper reports Ms Bolander spent Â£1,150 on shoes, including a single order for two pairs from Watford-based Sole Bliss which cost Â£308. The Lord Provost's expenses also included Â£389 for Harris Tweed fabric, around Â£992 for 14 dresses and Â£435 for seven blazers. Ms Bolander - who earns Â£39,310 - got her nails done 20 times and claimed for 10 hair appointments totalling Â£751. The most expensive items were a pair of Â£358 spectacles and Â£200 hat from milliner William Chambers. By Jamie McIvor, BBC Scotland Local Government Correspondent There is no accusation of impropriety against the Lord Provost of Glasgow Eva Bolander. The money spent was within the civic allowance allocated to the council by the Scottish government. The issue here is whether the amount spent on clothes was necessarily politically wise at a time when local government continues to face tough financial choices. For opposition parties, the story seems like an open goal. Try justifying spending on clothes to someone unhappy about a cut or an unfilled pothole. Ms Bolander's supporters would point out that her role involves representing the council (and indeed Glasgow itself) at a large number of events in the city and beyond. There is little love lost between the Labour and SNP groups on Glasgow City Council. Labour is still reeling that the SNP gained control of the administration in 2017 - promising a greater degree of openness and transparency. The question is whether spending this amount of money on clothes is an appropriate use of public resource - does it send out the right signals about the administration in Glasgow or about local government in general? This is to a large extent about the optics. The money may be a drop in the ocean within Glasgow City Council's overall budget but, given the cuts and savings local government has made in recent years, opponents will not be hesitant to suggest what they would consider to be more appropriate uses of taxpayers' money. A council spokesman said: ""The national committee that oversees councillors' pay recognises that the requirement to represent their city at hundreds of events means Lord Provosts often incur personal expenses. ""For that reason, the Scottish government allocates a civic allowance to each council. ""For Glasgow City Council, this is subject to a yearly maximum of Â£5,000."" The civic allowance, which was introduced by the Scottish Local Authorities Remuneration Committee, replaced the clothing allowance and reflects a councillor's public profile. For that reason the Lord Provost is eligible to claim more than a backbench councillor. Last year the council came under fire foraccepting a Rolls Royce Ghostfor use as the Lord Provost's car at a time when it was preparing to increase nursery fees by 57%. It later emerged the anonymous donor wasBoyd Tunnock, owner of the Tunnock's biscuit business. The businessman said he just wanted to do ""a good thing"" for the city.

"This video can not be played James Peebles (L), Didier Queloz (C) and Michel Mayor (R) share the nine million kronor prize Three scientists have been awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics for ""ground-breaking"" discoveries about the Universe. James Peebles, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz were announced as this year's winners at a ceremony in Stockholm. Peebles was honoured for work on the evolution of the Universe, while Mayor and Queloz won for their discovery of a planet around a Sun-like star. The winners will share the prize money of nine million kronor (Â£738,000). Reacting to the news, Prof Queloz told BBC News: ""It's unbelievable,"" adding: ""Since the discovery 25 years ago, everyone kept telling me: 'It's a Nobel Prize discovery'. And I say: 'Oh yeah, yeah, maybe, whatever.'"" But in the intervening years, he more-or-less ""forgot"" about the discovery: ""I don't even think about it,"" he said. ""So frankly, yes, it came as a surprise to me. I understand the impact of the discovery, but there's such great physics being done in the world, I thought, it's not for us, we will never have it. ""I'm a bit shocked right now, I'm still trying to digest what it means."" How our cells sense oxygen wins Nobel prize The cosmic microwave background represents the faint afterglow of the Big Bang Ulf Danielsson, a member of the Nobel Committee, commented: ""Both these prizes... tell us something essential, something existential about our place in the Universe."" ""The first one, tracing the history back to an unknown origin, is so fascinating. The other one tries to answer these questions about: 'are we alone - is there life anywhere else in the Universe?'"" Winnipeg, Canada-born James Peebles was honoured for his contributions to the understanding of the evolution of the Universe and Earth's place in the cosmos. With others, he predicted the existence of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, the so-called afterglow of the Big Bang. By studying the CMB, scientists have been able to determine the age, shape and contents of the Universe. ""Cosmic background radiation was discovered in 1965, and turned out to be a goldmine for our understanding of how the Universe developed from its early childhood to the present day,"" said Mats Larsson, chair of the Nobel physics prize committee. ""Were it not for the theoretical discoveries of James Peebles, the wonderful high-precision measurements of this radiation over the last 20 years would have told us almost nothing."" This video can not be played How do you they pick a Nobel prize winner? The 84-year-old cosmologist, who is now based at Princeton University in New Jersey, US, also made major contributions to the theory of dark matter and dark energy, the mysterious components which together make up some 95% of the Universe. In addition, he helped develop the theoretical framework of structure formation - which describes how galaxies and other large structures emerged from earlier density fluctuations in the Universe. Asked what he considered his most important contribution, Prof Peebles said he was ""hard-pressed to say"", adding that his work had been collaborative. ""It's a life's work,"" he told the news conference at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz were awarded the prize for finding 51 Pegasi b, a gas giant orbiting a star 50 light-years away. Artwork: Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz have won for their detection of the distant planet 51 Pegasi b It was the first exoplanet to be discovered orbiting a star like our own. They used the pioneering radial velocity technique. This detects distant worlds indirectly, by measuring how a parent star ""wobbles"" when it is tugged on by the gravity of an orbiting planet. The astronomers were working at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, when the discovery was made. Mayor, 77, is still there as a professor emeritus; Queloz, 53, now holds positions at Geneva and at the University of Cambridge, UK. Michael Moloney, chief executive officer of the American Institute of Physics, said: ""[The laureates'] groundbreaking work on discovering the fundamental nature of the Universe and new worlds in distant solar systems has opened up whole new areas of research in cosmology and exoplanet science.

Activists have attached themselves to the underside of a lorry, which is blocking the road outside the Home Office. The vehicle is parked on Marsham Street, where hundreds of protesters set up camp overnight. One activist climbed on top of the lorry and set up a tent. There was a large police presence in the area on Tuesday, with pictures showing officers removing activists from the lorry.

Two activists have attached themselves to the doors of the building, while others demonstrate outside. Meanwhile, a group have placed 800 potted trees outside Parliament, in Old Palace Yard, as they call on the government to plant billions of trees across the UK. Trees have been dedicated to MPs, and protesters hope they will use them to reforest the country. Sean Clay, 36, from Newcastle, told the BBC: ""Planting trees would go a long way to restore the habitats we have lost as well as absorbing carbon emissions."" Activists have created a ""fledgling forest"" Asked about Boris Johnson's description of demonstrators, Packham told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""I was there yesterday. I met farmers, I met teachers, I met scientists, I met lawyers, I met grandparents, I met mothers and fathers, and I met children. ""These are the concerned people of the world."" Mr Johnson had suggested while attending a book launch on Monday that the demonstrators should abandon their ""hemp-smelling bivouacs"" and stop blocking roads. Protester Claudia Fisher, 57, from Brighton said campaigners would like to discuss their views with the prime minister. Responding to his description of activists as ""uncooperative crusties"", Ms Fisher said: ""We are a little bit crusty, I'll put my hands up to it, after a night sleeping out on the grounds of Whitehall, but we're not uncooperative. ""We're actually very co-operative. We... would really like to hear what he has to say, and we'd really like him to... hear what we have to say."" Activists set up tents throughout Westminster, including Horseferry Road John Curran, a 49-year-old former detective sergeant for the Metropolitan Police, was one of the protesters who camped overnight. Mr Curran, who has a three-year-old daughter, says he was arrested while protesting with Extinction Rebellion in April, and is willing to be arrested again. He said: ""Clearly there is some frustration (for the police) that they probably have better things to be doing, and I agree, but the responsibility for that must lie with the government. ""Take action, and we won't have to be here."" Activists camped at Smithfield Market overnight, but say they allowed traders to operate. There is a festival atmosphere in Westminster as Extinction Rebellion activists emerge from their tents to stage a second day of protests in central London. The roads around Parliament - normally full with traffic - are instead dotted with encampments of tents, gazebos and makeshift food points, where hundreds of protesters from across the country spent the night.

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was in a crash with a Volvo The parents of a teenage motorcyclist killed in a crash have said ""we will go to Washington if we have to"", to secure the return of a US diplomat's wife suspected of driving the other vehicle. Harry Dunn, 19, died in a crash with a Volvo in Northamptonshire on 27 August. Anne Sacoolas, a suspect in the crash, later left the UK despite telling police she had no such plans. Prime MinisterBoris Johnson has urged the USto reconsider its decision to allow her immunity. Meanwhile, both Northamptonshire's chief constable and police and crime commissioner have urged the Americans to waive Ms Sacoolas's diplomatic immunity. Tim Dunn, Harry's father, told the BBC: ""With Boris Johnson saying what he did, it was nice to feel actually we were getting the support we were trying to get. ""Maybe President Trump will look at this and hopefully look in our favour."" Harry's mother, Charlotte Charles, said: ""We have spoken to some American news channels, we've got others lined up. The message is clearly getting out across there. ""The messages of support we've had from the US have been immense. They're all appalled and devastated for us and disgusted that this woman has been allowed to leave the UK."" Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles have spoken to US media about their case Ms Charles said: ""We are determined to see it through, we won't stop. We will go to Washington if we have to, we've taken [legal] advice on that."" She said they would ""plead"" to President Trump to not only waive Ms Sacoolas' diplomatic immunity, but also ""look at the laws"" around diplomatic immunity ""With the amount of diplomats we have in the UK, we can't have someone go out and do something like that again and leave another family to suffer,"" she added. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, has spoken to the US ambassador Woody Johnson, and raised the case in a telephone call with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. A Foreign Office spokesman said Mr Raab had ""reiterated his disappointment with the US decision and urged them to reconsider"". Harry Dunn died after his Kawasaki motorcycle was involved in a crash with a black Volvo XC90 at about 20:30 BST on B4031 Park End in Croughton close to the RAF base, on Tuesday, 27 August. He was taken to Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford where he died a short time later. Northamptonshire's chief constable Nick Adderley said that ""based on CCTV evidence"", officers knew that ""a vehicle alighted from the RAF base at Croughton"" and was ""on the wrong side of the road"". He said the suspect, Anne Sacoolas had ""engaged fully"" following the crash and said ""she had no plans to leave the country in the near future"". About 23,000 individuals in the UK have diplomatic immunity, a status reserved for foreign diplomats and their families, as long as they don't have British citizenship. It is granted by the 1961 Vienna Convention and means that, in theory, diplomats cannot face court proceedings for any crime or civil case. The convention also states that those entitled to immunity are expected to obey the law. Where crimes are committed, the Foreign Office can ask a foreign government to waive immunity where they feel it is appropriate. In 2017, there were 12 serious offences committed by people entitled to diplomatic protection. Five of these were driving related, but other crimes included sexual assault, blackmail and possession of a firearm. Diplomatic immunity is by no means restricted to those named on the Diplomatic List from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Drivers, cooks and other support staff whose names do not appear, but have been accredited to Britain (""the receiving state"") have the same diplomatic status and immunity as those who are listed. Equally, there are a number of foreign nationals in Britain attached to international organizations who have the same status and protection. Imtiaz Tyab, Correspondent CBS News The US is going through some pretty extraordinary times at the moment.

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was in a crash with a Volvo The parents of a teenage motorcyclist killed in a crash have said ""we will go to Washington if we have to"", to secure the return of a US diplomat's wife suspected of driving the other vehicle. Harry Dunn, 19, died in a crash with a Volvo in Northamptonshire on 27 August. Anne Sacoolas, a suspect in the crash, later left the UK despite telling police she had no such plans. Prime MinisterBoris Johnson has urged the USto reconsider its decision to allow her immunity. Meanwhile, both Northamptonshire's chief constable and police and crime commissioner have urged the Americans to waive Ms Sacoolas's diplomatic immunity. Tim Dunn, Harry's father, told the BBC: ""With Boris Johnson saying what he did, it was nice to feel actually we were getting the support we were trying to get. ""Maybe President Trump will look at this and hopefully look in our favour."" Harry's mother, Charlotte Charles, said: ""We have spoken to some American news channels, we've got others lined up. The message is clearly getting out across there. ""The messages of support we've had from the US have been immense. They're all appalled and devastated for us and disgusted that this woman has been allowed to leave the UK."" Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles have spoken to US media about their case Ms Charles said: ""We are determined to see it through, we won't stop. We will go to Washington if we have to, we've taken [legal] advice on that."" She said they would ""plead"" to President Trump to not only waive Ms Sacoolas' diplomatic immunity, but also ""look at the laws"" around diplomatic immunity ""With the amount of diplomats we have in the UK, we can't have someone go out and do something like that again and leave another family to suffer,"" she added. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, has spoken to the US ambassador Woody Johnson, and raised the case in a telephone call with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. A Foreign Office spokesman said Mr Raab had ""reiterated his disappointment with the US decision and urged them to reconsider"". Harry Dunn died after his Kawasaki motorcycle was involved in a crash with a black Volvo XC90 at about 20:30 BST on B4031 Park End in Croughton close to the RAF base, on Tuesday, 27 August. He was taken to Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford where he died a short time later. Northamptonshire's chief constable Nick Adderley said that ""based on CCTV evidence"", officers knew that ""a vehicle alighted from the RAF base at Croughton"" and was ""on the wrong side of the road"". He said the suspect, Anne Sacoolas had ""engaged fully"" following the crash and said ""she had no plans to leave the country in the near future"". About 23,000 individuals in the UK have diplomatic immunity, a status reserved for foreign diplomats and their families, as long as they don't have British citizenship. It is granted by the 1961 Vienna Convention and means that, in theory, diplomats cannot face court proceedings for any crime or civil case. The convention also states that those entitled to immunity are expected to obey the law. Where crimes are committed, the Foreign Office can ask a foreign government to waive immunity where they feel it is appropriate. In 2017, there were 12 serious offences committed by people entitled to diplomatic protection. Five of these were driving related, but other crimes included sexual assault, blackmail and possession of a firearm. Diplomatic immunity is by no means restricted to those named on the Diplomatic List from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Drivers, cooks and other support staff whose names do not appear, but have been accredited to Britain (""the receiving state"") have the same diplomatic status and immunity as those who are listed. Equally, there are a number of foreign nationals in Britain attached to international organizations who have the same status and protection. Imtiaz Tyab, Correspondent CBS News The US is going through some pretty extraordinary times at the moment. But somehow this story has really struck a chord with many Americans and I think that is because at its heart you have two parents grieving the loss of their son.

"Productivity in the UK fell at its fastest annual pace in five years in the April-to-June quarter,according to the Office for National Statistics.,external The figure - measured by output per hour - fell by 0.5%, after two previous quarters of zero growth. Both services and manufacturing saw a fall from April to June, the ONS said. It added: ""This sustained period of declining labour productivity represents a continuation of the UK's 'productivity puzzle'."" The ONS added that productivity since the economic downturn in 2008 was ""growing more slowly than during the long period prior to downturn"". No-deal Brexit 'to push UK debt to 50-year high' Stagnant productivity 'costs workers Â£5,000 a year' Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ""These figures hammer home the impact uncertainty is having on the business environment. ""Unsure of what's around the corner, businesses' investment in the new equipment and technology that drives up their performance has been stifled. Many companies are also trimming their investment pipelines for the year ahead to build up a cash cushion in anticipation of challenging economic conditions ahead."" Why does productivity, the amount of output you get from each worker, matter so much In the long term, rising living standards need rising productivity. There's a well-known line from the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman on this:  ""Productivity isn't everything, but in the long run it is almost everything. A country's ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker"". The period of weak productivity growth after the financial crisis has been a time when the economy has, for most of the time, been growing but not strongly. The one rather brighter spot has been the other element in the productivity calculation, employment. Britain now has the highest percentage of the population in employment since at least 1971 (that's how far back this particular data series goes). More jobs, but less productive than they would have been, had productivity grown at the rates we have seen in previous decades. Jon Boys, from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said: ""Businesses may have more immediate concerns than raising productivity, but it's the only way to increase pay packets in the long term. ""We mustn't be fooled by recent strong earnings growth figures, which have been driven by a tight labour market and not an increase in employers' ability to pay."" Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, commented: ""Heightened concerns over Brexit - especially serious concerns among many companies of the UK leaving the EU without a deal - has clearly caused companies to limit their investment with damaging implications for productivity. ""If a Brexit deal is agreed and enacted by 31 October, this will hopefully dilute business uncertainty and provide some boost to business investment, which would be good news for productivity prospects.""

"The health secretary is wrong to think compulsory child vaccination will help tackle falling immunisation rates in England, a leading doctor says. Matt Hancock has said he is ""looking very seriously"" at the option. But Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health expert Dr David Elliman said it could be counter-productive and make people more suspicious. He joined others in calling for vaccines to be offered in places such as supermarkets and music festivals. Figures released last monthshowed vaccination rates for all nine vaccines given to children before the age of five fell in the last year in England- figures for the rest of the UK nations are better. The UK lost its measles-free status in August amid a rising number of cases. During 2018 there were nearly 1,000 cases - more than double the number in 2016. Speaking at the Science Media Centre in London, Dr Elliman, a consultant in community child health at Great Ormond Street Hospital, said he found Mr Hancock's view on compulsory vaccination ""concerning"" and ""not evidence-based"". ""Compulsory vaccination ain't going to work and isn't going to get the support of most health professionals."" He said it risked breaking the trust that exists between health professionals and the public and creating a row about civil liberties. He also pointed out that it would do nothing to encourage those who have already missed vaccinations to take part in catch-up programmes, citing the need to reach out to people in their 20s who did not have the MMR vaccine at the height of the scare two decades ago. Matt Hancock says unvaccinated children are putting other children at risk Instead, he wants the government, which is drawing up a new vaccinations strategy, to focus on accessibility, saying he would like to see pop-up clinics being held at music festivals to reach out to those who missed out on the MMR jab at the turn of the century when uptake rates were even lower than they are now. Prof Helen Bedford, of University College London, agreed accessibility was key. ""People live busy lives so if we can make it easier for them to get vaccinated I think we would see an increase in uptake."" She said clinics could be held in children's centres and even supermarkets, but warned it would require investment in vaccination teams and nurses to give the jabs. The government said the vaccination strategy would be out later in the year.

"Dr Calder - with her sons James and Oliver- says it is ""disappointing"" that not all boys will get the jab GP Carolyn Calder has two teenage sons and wanted to ensure they were protected against the cancer-causing human papillomavirus (HPV). A vaccination programme is being introduced for all first year boys in secondary schools in Scotland, but aged 16 and 14 her sons James and Oliver would have missed out. Dr Calder decided to take matters into her own hands and get it for them privately. She told BBC Scotland it gave her ""peace of mind"". She has set-up a private clinic in Glasgow for others who want to pay for the vaccine but believes all teenage boys should be offered it on the NHS. Her view is echoed by experts who have said not offering a catch-up programme for all teenage boys could put thousands of lives at risk. Boys' HPV vaccine 'to stop thousands of cancers' What is HPV? HPV vaccine for boys 'could cut cancer rates' Dr Calder said: ""It became very apparent to me that there was lots of evidence that HPV vaccination is needed in boys as well as girls. ""From 2008, the government has been vaccinating girls for cervical cancer and there's a recognised need for that and the programme has been very successful. ""But what we realised for our boys was that there are other cancers which are also a risk, and they can hopefully be avoided by having the vaccination."" The GP admits that going private is a costly option but for her it was ""worth it"". She said: ""Unfortunately it's not a cheap vaccine. We've done it for both our boys and it's Â£155 per vaccine. If you are under 15 you need two vaccines but over 15 you need three of them. ""It gives us peace of mind that hopefully we have done all we can to try and prevent these horrible cancers."" By Lisa Summers, BBC Scotland Health Correspondent The human papillomavirus is commonly spread through intimate contact. Most strains are harmless but in rare cases it can cause cancer. Links to cervical cancer are well known and that's why an HPV vaccination programme was introduced for girls over a decade ago. Evidence suggestsit has dramatically reduced pre-cancerous cells in young women. But HPV has also been connected to other cancers and has been blamed for a sharp rise in cases of throat cancer. Scotland now has the highest incidence of these cancers in the UK. From this yearS1 boys will be offered the vaccination. But dentists say that a catch up programme should be offered to all secondary school boys in the same way that all teenage girls can get the vaccination for free. They say thousands of boys will be at increased risk. But that would have cost implications and the Scottish government say the decision was made on UK expert advice. Information packs will soon be sent out to all S1 boys. The vaccination is being offered to all boys in first year at secondary schools in Scotland HPV is a leading cause of throat cancer and in Scotland cases of these cancers have almost trebled in recent years. Professor of dental public health at Glasgow University, David Conway, told BBC Scotland: ""Oropharyngeal cancer, throat cancer, is the most rapidly rising cancer in Scotland, and it's the HPV association that seems to be driving that change."" Dentists also think the decision not to offer a catch-up vaccination programme for older boys is a mistake. Dr David Cross, from the British Dental Association Scotland, said: ""Throat cancer is different in Scotland, there is a much higher rate of throat cancers associated with HPV infection and 75% of them are occurring in men so we think the boys need protection, and rolling out a catch-up programme will mean we can protect an additional 140,000 boys."" Professor Ian Frazer has been at the forefront of Australia's immunisation programme The Scottish scientist who invented the HPV vaccine says there is ""no sensible argument"" against universal immunisation of boys and girls in schools. Prof Ian Frazer, who is based at the University of Queensland, has been at the forefront of Australia's immunisation programme since it was launched 2013. In the first year, all 12 to 15-year-old boys received three years' worth of catch-up vaccines. Now, all 12-year-old boys are offered the jab which Prof Frazer says loses effectiveness as boys get older. He told BBC Scotland's John Beattie programme: ""The vaccine has been proven safe in trials worldwide and the only complication we have noticed is a very rare one-in-a-million allergic reaction to the vaccine. ""There is no known downside to vaccination, apart of course from the cost which has to be met somehow. But the upside of saving significant numbers of lives is a real one. And it's an investment, not only for now but for the future, because all these cancers which could occur in the future could be prevented."" Prof Frazer said he believed all parents ""owe it to your son to protect him as you would your daughter"". He added: ""It's more sensible to vaccinate one particular age cohort. It would be sensible to do a catch-up programme if there are sufficient funds available. If not, then the logical thing is just to do 12-year-olds. ""The yield is less for every year past 12 you go. The cost-benefits analysis looks less good for every extra year. And by the time you've got to 17, it's down to a third of the benefit that you get from vaccinating 12-year-olds."" The Scottish government has encouraged all eligible boys to take up the offer of the HPV jab. A spokesman added: ""Vaccination policy in Scotland, as with the rest of the UK, is based on recommendations from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. ""The JCVI has not recommended a catch-up approach for the HPV boys programme. Should that change, we will not hesitate to act and extend our programme."" Dr Calder has set up a private vaccination clinic in Glasgow For Dr Calder, the important thing was to ensure her sons were protected and she said other parents who have come to her clinic have become more aware of the potential risks from not having the jab. She said: ""Often these are parents, unfortunately at the moment, who can afford to do it and know about it but the issue isn't as widely known as we'd like. ""As a doctor working for the NHS, you always want to try and provide good health for the whole nation. ""So it would be really good if we could get all boys vaccinated and try and eradicate some of these cancers.""

"Lord Provost Eva Bolander receives a civic allowance The Lord Provost of Glasgow has been criticised after it emerged her expenses included claims for 23 pairs of shoes. TheDaily Record reports,externalEva Bolander submitted receipts totalling more than Â£8,000 over a 28-month period. A council spokesman said the SNP councillor incurs personal expenses as she is required to represent the city at hundreds of events. But Glasgow Labour MSP James Kelly said her position was not tenable. Mr Kelly said: ""While services for homeless people across Glasgow are being cut, the SNP Lord Provost has been touring the city in a grotesque spending spree at the taxpayers' expense. ""In just one trip to John Lewis she spent more on herself than what a worker being paid the national minimum wage earns in a whole week. ""Eva Bolander should pay back the money and resign."" Scottish Conservative Glasgow MSP Annie Wells said: ""For any politician to think they can claim something like this on expenses is a joke. ""It's not even one or two misdemeanours - these revelations show a pattern of behaviour which will be completely unacceptable to council tax payers in Glasgow. ""She must now do the right thing and stand down - there's simply no way she can continue in this senior role after these reports. She also owes the people of Glasgow an almighty apology."" The figures, obtained under a Freedom of Information request, cover claims between May 2017 and August this year. The paper reports Ms Bolander spent Â£1,150 on shoes, including a single order for two pairs from Watford-based Sole Bliss which cost Â£308. The Lord Provost's expenses also included Â£389 for Harris Tweed fabric, around Â£992 for 14 dresses and Â£435 for seven blazers. Ms Bolander - who earns Â£39,310 - got her nails done 20 times and claimed for 10 hair appointments totalling Â£751. The most expensive items were a pair of Â£358 spectacles and Â£200 hat from milliner William Chambers. By Jamie McIvor, BBC Scotland Local Government Correspondent There is no accusation of impropriety against the Lord Provost of Glasgow Eva Bolander. The money spent was within the civic allowance allocated to the council by the Scottish government. The issue here is whether the amount spent on clothes was necessarily politically wise at a time when local government continues to face tough financial choices. For opposition parties, the story seems like an open goal. Try justifying spending on clothes to someone unhappy about a cut or an unfilled pothole. Ms Bolander's supporters would point out that her role involves representing the council (and indeed Glasgow itself) at a large number of events in the city and beyond. There is little love lost between the Labour and SNP groups on Glasgow City Council. Labour is still reeling that the SNP gained control of the administration in 2017 - promising a greater degree of openness and transparency. The question is whether spending this amount of money on clothes is an appropriate use of public resource - does it send out the right signals about the administration in Glasgow or about local government in general? This is to a large extent about the optics. The money may be a drop in the ocean within Glasgow City Council's overall budget but, given the cuts and savings local government has made in recent years, opponents will not be hesitant to suggest what they would consider to be more appropriate uses of taxpayers' money. A council spokesman said: ""The national committee that oversees councillors' pay recognises that the requirement to represent their city at hundreds of events means Lord Provosts often incur personal expenses. ""For that reason, the Scottish government allocates a civic allowance to each council. ""For Glasgow City Council, this is subject to a yearly maximum of Â£5,000."" The civic allowance, which was introduced by the Scottish Local Authorities Remuneration Committee, replaced the clothing allowance and reflects a councillor's public profile. For that reason the Lord Provost is eligible to claim more than a backbench councillor. Last year the council came under fire foraccepting a Rolls Royce Ghostfor use as the Lord Provost's car at a time when it was preparing to increase nursery fees by 57%. It later emerged the anonymous donor wasBoyd Tunnock, owner of the Tunnock's biscuit business. The businessman said he just wanted to do ""a good thing"" for the city.

"Boris Johnson hasoutlined his plan to the European Union (EU),externalto avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. Mr Johnson said the plan ""removes the so-called backstop"". The backstop is the insurance policy negotiated by Theresa May and the EU. It is designed to avoid any physical border infrastructure, which it is feared would bring back memories of the Troubles, after Brexit. It would keep the UK in the same customs territory as the EU, and Northern Ireland closely tied to EU regulations - until the UK and the EU reach a trade deal. But it would stop the UK striking its own trade deals, which is why so many Conservative MPs, including Mr Johnson, oppose the backstop. So, what is his alternative? The government wants the UK to leave the EU customs union. This would mean Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ending up in two different customs territories. This means lorries entering the Republic of Ireland from Northern Ireland will need to complete customs declarations. This is to ensure the correct tariffs (tax on imports) are paid when UK goods enter the EU customs union. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Reality Check's Chris Morris:From the beginning the EU has struggled to see how Ireland and Northern Ireland can exist in different customs territories while keeping the border as open as it is now under all circumstances. They will argue that - in the absence of a future free trade deal - this proposal means the UK is breaking commitments it has made about the border. The UK counters that the backstop has already been rejected in Parliament three times, and something needs to change. Instead of installing customs posts and other physical infrastructure at the Irish border, the UK says declarations should be done electronically. The government says physical checks would still be needed ""on a very small proportion of movements"". Currently, about one in 100 consignments entering the EU customs union are inspected to check that the goods match the information on the declaration. These inspections could be carried out at warehouses or ""designated locations, which could be located anywhere in Ireland or Northern Ireland."" The government's proposal does not spell out what these ""designated locations"" would look like, but it adds there should be ""a firm commitment (by both parties) never to conduct checks at the border in future"". Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? If adopted, a border solution relying on technology and remote checks would be a first. The EU does not currently share a single border with a non-EU country where checks have been completely eliminated. That includes Norway (not in the EU) and Sweden (an EU member) - which share one of the most technologically advanced borders in the world. Their main crossing point processes about 1,300 lorries a day, with each waiting 20 minutes on average. The EU has previously rejected a customs solution that relies on technology. Back in January, Sabine Weyand, the EU's director-general for trade, said: ""We looked at every border on this Earth, every border the EU has with a third country - there's simply no way you can do away with checks and controls."" The government says that some small traders should be exempt from paying duty. However, the document does not address smuggling head on. In other words, what will be done to detect and prevent traders, who should be paying duty, from crossing the border without completing custom declarations first? Reality Check's Chris Morris:The EU will see much of this as a rehash of previous ideas that it doesn't think will work. And many people will worry that unspecified ""designated locations"" could become targets for anyone seeking to undermine the Northern Ireland peace process. The EU will push back hard against suggestions that it needs to revise its own customs rules to suit the UK. When it comes to the regulation of goods, Northern Ireland would keep to the rules of the EU's single market, rather than UK rules. That removes the need for product standard and safety checks on goods at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, because both will be part of an ""all-island regulatory zone"". But it creates the need for checks between the rest of the UK - which will not be sticking to EU single market rules - and Northern Ireland.. All agricultural, food or animal products entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK will have to go through a Border Inspection Post. That's a bit of infrastructure where goods can be physically examined and paperwork checked. Manufactured goods in Northern Ireland would also have to keep to EU rules, and these goods would be checked ""at the boundary of the zone"" - presumably at crossings between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, on the Irish Sea. Reality Check's Chris Morris:This is quite a big concession from the UK side - basically accepting that there would have to be quite intrusive checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK for a number of years, on things like product standards and food safety. The EU has always said there have to be checks carried out somewhere, and both sides will try to deny any suggestion that this amounts to a new border in the Irish Sea. Having Northern Ireland following EU rules for the production of goods over which it has no say is, as the document says, ""a significant democratic problem"". As a result, it is proposed that the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive will have to sign off on the plan before it takes effect. The Northern Irish institutions will be asked to approve the plan again every four years, and if they do not then Northern Ireland would stop following EU rules one year later. The Northern Ireland Assembly has not met since early 2017. Reality Check's Chris Morris:The issue of democratic legitimacy is a crucial one, but it cannot be applied unevenly. The EU is likely to have a problem with anything which suggests that only Northern Ireland could have - in effect - a veto on this plan. The point of the backstop was to provide a legal guarantee to keep an open border under all circumstances. Being subject to approval every four years simply isn't the same thing. If Northern Ireland voted to leave this arrangement things like checks on food safety would have to take place at the Irish border. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"This video can not be played A flat in Hammersmith in London was one of the properties raided on Tuesday Police investigating what they say is the UK's biggest ever drugs conspiracy have arrested 13 men in dawn raids. The arrests follow aNational Crime Agency,externalinvestigation tracking drugs allegedly smuggled into the UK in lorry loads of vegetables and juice. The conspiracy was around the importation of more than 50 tonnes of drugs, worth millions of pounds, from the Netherlands, officers say. NCA branch commander Jayne Lloyd called the arrests ""massively significant"". The arrests took place in London, Manchester, Stockport, St Helens, Warrington, Bolton, Dewsbury, and Leeds. ""We believe it's the biggest ever conspiracy that we've seen in the UK,"" said Ms Lloyd, NCA regional head of investigations for the north of England. The 13 are suspected of being part of the UK arm of a well established organised crime group that allegedly used Dutch and British front companies to import heroin, cocaine and cannabis. Four men and two women arrested in April by Dutch police, on a European Arrest Warrant, are awaiting extradition to the UK and are suspected of being part of the same conspiracy. This investigation has got results thanks to cross-border European co-operation. Six arrests by Dutch investigators were under the EU's European Arrest Warrant, which aims to swiftly extradite suspects to face justice in the UK. But the UK won't be able to use this tool if it leaves the EU without a security deal. The UK will also, overnight, leave Europol and Eurojust - both of which were involved in this investigation. They co-ordinate the sharing of information and evidence that police and prosecutors use to put serious criminals behind bars. The government has, however,today published a 159-page ""No Deal Readiness"" report.,external If you get to page 153, you will find it admits that leaving the EU without a deal amounts to a ""loss of capability"" for British police. And it further admits that the proposed alternatives ""cannot fully compensate for the loss of EU co-operation tools"". Drug crime mapped Suffolk drugs raids lead to 18 arrests The 13 men are alleged to have imported drugs on numerous occasions between February 2017 and October 2018, including three consignments intercepted in 2018 with a total street value of more than Â£38m. ""We suspect these men were involved in an industrial-scale operation - the biggest ever uncovered in the UK - bringing in tonnes of deadly drugs that were distributed to crime groups throughout the country,"" Ms Lloyd said. The 13 arrested are believed to be part of a drugs smuggling gang The investigation is linked to an operation in 2015 that saw 13 people jailed for a total of 176 years after the seizure of more than 100kg of heroin. Ms Lloyd said she hoped the arrests would ""have a big impact"" on the county lines drugs trade - in which drugs are transported form cities to users across the country - which was having a ""devastating effect on the public, vulnerable children and the economy"". The NCA says the investigation involved European police forces and agencies, includingEuropol,externalandEurojust,external, as well as the UKBorder Force,externalandRevenue & Customs.,external ""By working closely with partners here and overseas, in particular the Dutch national police, we believe we have dismantled a well established drug supply route,"" Ms Lloyd said.

"Lord Provost Eva Bolander receives a civic allowance The Lord Provost of Glasgow has been criticised after it emerged her expenses included claims for 23 pairs of shoes. TheDaily Record reports,externalEva Bolander submitted receipts totalling more than Â£8,000 over a 28-month period. A council spokesman said the SNP councillor incurs personal expenses as she is required to represent the city at hundreds of events. But Glasgow Labour MSP James Kelly said her position was not tenable. Mr Kelly said: ""While services for homeless people across Glasgow are being cut, the SNP Lord Provost has been touring the city in a grotesque spending spree at the taxpayers' expense. ""In just one trip to John Lewis she spent more on herself than what a worker being paid the national minimum wage earns in a whole week. ""Eva Bolander should pay back the money and resign."" Scottish Conservative Glasgow MSP Annie Wells said: ""For any politician to think they can claim something like this on expenses is a joke. ""It's not even one or two misdemeanours - these revelations show a pattern of behaviour which will be completely unacceptable to council tax payers in Glasgow. ""She must now do the right thing and stand down - there's simply no way she can continue in this senior role after these reports. She also owes the people of Glasgow an almighty apology."" The figures, obtained under a Freedom of Information request, cover claims between May 2017 and August this year. The paper reports Ms Bolander spent Â£1,150 on shoes, including a single order for two pairs from Watford-based Sole Bliss which cost Â£308. The Lord Provost's expenses also included Â£389 for Harris Tweed fabric, around Â£992 for 14 dresses and Â£435 for seven blazers. Ms Bolander - who earns Â£39,310 - got her nails done 20 times and claimed for 10 hair appointments totalling Â£751. The most expensive items were a pair of Â£358 spectacles and Â£200 hat from milliner William Chambers. By Jamie McIvor, BBC Scotland Local Government Correspondent There is no accusation of impropriety against the Lord Provost of Glasgow Eva Bolander. The money spent was within the civic allowance allocated to the council by the Scottish government. The issue here is whether the amount spent on clothes was necessarily politically wise at a time when local government continues to face tough financial choices. For opposition parties, the story seems like an open goal. Try justifying spending on clothes to someone unhappy about a cut or an unfilled pothole. Ms Bolander's supporters would point out that her role involves representing the council (and indeed Glasgow itself) at a large number of events in the city and beyond. There is little love lost between the Labour and SNP groups on Glasgow City Council. Labour is still reeling that the SNP gained control of the administration in 2017 - promising a greater degree of openness and transparency. The question is whether spending this amount of money on clothes is an appropriate use of public resource - does it send out the right signals about the administration in Glasgow or about local government in general? This is to a large extent about the optics. The money may be a drop in the ocean within Glasgow City Council's overall budget but, given the cuts and savings local government has made in recent years, opponents will not be hesitant to suggest what they would consider to be more appropriate uses of taxpayers' money. A council spokesman said: ""The national committee that oversees councillors' pay recognises that the requirement to represent their city at hundreds of events means Lord Provosts often incur personal expenses. ""For that reason, the Scottish government allocates a civic allowance to each council. ""For Glasgow City Council, this is subject to a yearly maximum of Â£5,000."" The civic allowance, which was introduced by the Scottish Local Authorities Remuneration Committee, replaced the clothing allowance and reflects a councillor's public profile. For that reason the Lord Provost is eligible to claim more than a backbench councillor. Last year the council came under fire foraccepting a Rolls Royce Ghostfor use as the Lord Provost's car at a time when it was preparing to increase nursery fees by 57%. It later emerged the anonymous donor wasBoyd Tunnock, owner of the Tunnock's biscuit business. The businessman said he just wanted to do ""a good thing"" for the city.

"Productivity in the UK fell at its fastest annual pace in five years in the April-to-June quarter,according to the Office for National Statistics.,external The figure - measured by output per hour - fell by 0.5%, after two previous quarters of zero growth. Both services and manufacturing saw a fall from April to June, the ONS said. It added: ""This sustained period of declining labour productivity represents a continuation of the UK's 'productivity puzzle'."" The ONS added that productivity since the economic downturn in 2008 was ""growing more slowly than during the long period prior to downturn"". No-deal Brexit 'to push UK debt to 50-year high' Stagnant productivity 'costs workers Â£5,000 a year' Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ""These figures hammer home the impact uncertainty is having on the business environment. ""Unsure of what's around the corner, businesses' investment in the new equipment and technology that drives up their performance has been stifled. Many companies are also trimming their investment pipelines for the year ahead to build up a cash cushion in anticipation of challenging economic conditions ahead."" Why does productivity, the amount of output you get from each worker, matter so much In the long term, rising living standards need rising productivity. There's a well-known line from the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman on this:  ""Productivity isn't everything, but in the long run it is almost everything. A country's ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker"". The period of weak productivity growth after the financial crisis has been a time when the economy has, for most of the time, been growing but not strongly. The one rather brighter spot has been the other element in the productivity calculation, employment. Britain now has the highest percentage of the population in employment since at least 1971 (that's how far back this particular data series goes). More jobs, but less productive than they would have been, had productivity grown at the rates we have seen in previous decades. Jon Boys, from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said: ""Businesses may have more immediate concerns than raising productivity, but it's the only way to increase pay packets in the long term. ""We mustn't be fooled by recent strong earnings growth figures, which have been driven by a tight labour market and not an increase in employers' ability to pay."" Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, commented: ""Heightened concerns over Brexit - especially serious concerns among many companies of the UK leaving the EU without a deal - has clearly caused companies to limit their investment with damaging implications for productivity. ""If a Brexit deal is agreed and enacted by 31 October, this will hopefully dilute business uncertainty and provide some boost to business investment, which would be good news for productivity prospects.""

"This video can not be played James Peebles (L), Didier Queloz (C) and Michel Mayor (R) share the nine million kronor prize Three scientists have been awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics for ""ground-breaking"" discoveries about the Universe. James Peebles, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz were announced as this year's winners at a ceremony in Stockholm. Peebles was honoured for work on the evolution of the Universe, while Mayor and Queloz won for their discovery of a planet around a Sun-like star. The winners will share the prize money of nine million kronor (Â£738,000). Reacting to the news, Prof Queloz told BBC News: ""It's unbelievable,"" adding: ""Since the discovery 25 years ago, everyone kept telling me: 'It's a Nobel Prize discovery'. And I say: 'Oh yeah, yeah, maybe, whatever.'"" But in the intervening years, he more-or-less ""forgot"" about the discovery: ""I don't even think about it,"" he said. ""So frankly, yes, it came as a surprise to me. I understand the impact of the discovery, but there's such great physics being done in the world, I thought, it's not for us, we will never have it. ""I'm a bit shocked right now, I'm still trying to digest what it means."" How our cells sense oxygen wins Nobel prize The cosmic microwave background represents the faint afterglow of the Big Bang Ulf Danielsson, a member of the Nobel Committee, commented: ""Both these prizes... tell us something essential, something existential about our place in the Universe."" ""The first one, tracing the history back to an unknown origin, is so fascinating. The other one tries to answer these questions about: 'are we alone - is there life anywhere else in the Universe?'"" Winnipeg, Canada-born James Peebles was honoured for his contributions to the understanding of the evolution of the Universe and Earth's place in the cosmos. With others, he predicted the existence of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, the so-called afterglow of the Big Bang. By studying the CMB, scientists have been able to determine the age, shape and contents of the Universe. ""Cosmic background radiation was discovered in 1965, and turned out to be a goldmine for our understanding of how the Universe developed from its early childhood to the present day,"" said Mats Larsson, chair of the Nobel physics prize committee. ""Were it not for the theoretical discoveries of James Peebles, the wonderful high-precision measurements of this radiation over the last 20 years would have told us almost nothing."" This video can not be played How do you they pick a Nobel prize winner? The 84-year-old cosmologist, who is now based at Princeton University in New Jersey, US, also made major contributions to the theory of dark matter and dark energy, the mysterious components which together make up some 95% of the Universe. In addition, he helped develop the theoretical framework of structure formation - which describes how galaxies and other large structures emerged from earlier density fluctuations in the Universe. Asked what he considered his most important contribution, Prof Peebles said he was ""hard-pressed to say"", adding that his work had been collaborative. ""It's a life's work,"" he told the news conference at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz were awarded the prize for finding 51 Pegasi b, a gas giant orbiting a star 50 light-years away. Artwork: Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz have won for their detection of the distant planet 51 Pegasi b It was the first exoplanet to be discovered orbiting a star like our own. They used the pioneering radial velocity technique. This detects distant worlds indirectly, by measuring how a parent star ""wobbles"" when it is tugged on by the gravity of an orbiting planet. The astronomers were working at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, when the discovery was made. Mayor, 77, is still there as a professor emeritus; Queloz, 53, now holds positions at Geneva and at the University of Cambridge, UK. Michael Moloney, chief executive officer of the American Institute of Physics, said: ""[The laureates'] groundbreaking work on discovering the fundamental nature of the Universe and new worlds in distant solar systems has opened up whole new areas of research in cosmology and exoplanet science. ""The discovery of a planet orbiting a star outside our own system has changed our perceptions of our place in the Universe - a Universe that still holds many mysteries to solve.""

"Lord Provost Eva Bolander receives a civic allowance The Lord Provost of Glasgow has been criticised after it emerged her expenses included claims for 23 pairs of shoes. TheDaily Record reports,externalEva Bolander submitted receipts totalling more than Â£8,000 over a 28-month period. A council spokesman said the SNP councillor incurs personal expenses as she is required to represent the city at hundreds of events. But Glasgow Labour MSP James Kelly said her position was not tenable. Mr Kelly said: ""While services for homeless people across Glasgow are being cut, the SNP Lord Provost has been touring the city in a grotesque spending spree at the taxpayers' expense. ""In just one trip to John Lewis she spent more on herself than what a worker being paid the national minimum wage earns in a whole week. ""Eva Bolander should pay back the money and resign."" Scottish Conservative Glasgow MSP Annie Wells said: ""For any politician to think they can claim something like this on expenses is a joke. ""It's not even one or two misdemeanours - these revelations show a pattern of behaviour which will be completely unacceptable to council tax payers in Glasgow. ""She must now do the right thing and stand down - there's simply no way she can continue in this senior role after these reports. She also owes the people of Glasgow an almighty apology."" The figures, obtained under a Freedom of Information request, cover claims between May 2017 and August this year. The paper reports Ms Bolander spent Â£1,150 on shoes, including a single order for two pairs from Watford-based Sole Bliss which cost Â£308. The Lord Provost's expenses also included Â£389 for Harris Tweed fabric, around Â£992 for 14 dresses and Â£435 for seven blazers. Ms Bolander - who earns Â£39,310 - got her nails done 20 times and claimed for 10 hair appointments totalling Â£751. The most expensive items were a pair of Â£358 spectacles and Â£200 hat from milliner William Chambers. By Jamie McIvor, BBC Scotland Local Government Correspondent There is no accusation of impropriety against the Lord Provost of Glasgow Eva Bolander. The money spent was within the civic allowance allocated to the council by the Scottish government. The issue here is whether the amount spent on clothes was necessarily politically wise at a time when local government continues to face tough financial choices. For opposition parties, the story seems like an open goal. Try justifying spending on clothes to someone unhappy about a cut or an unfilled pothole. Ms Bolander's supporters would point out that her role involves representing the council (and indeed Glasgow itself) at a large number of events in the city and beyond. There is little love lost between the Labour and SNP groups on Glasgow City Council. Labour is still reeling that the SNP gained control of the administration in 2017 - promising a greater degree of openness and transparency. The question is whether spending this amount of money on clothes is an appropriate use of public resource - does it send out the right signals about the administration in Glasgow or about local government in general? This is to a large extent about the optics. The money may be a drop in the ocean within Glasgow City Council's overall budget but, given the cuts and savings local government has made in recent years, opponents will not be hesitant to suggest what they would consider to be more appropriate uses of taxpayers' money. A council spokesman said: ""The national committee that oversees councillors' pay recognises that the requirement to represent their city at hundreds of events means Lord Provosts often incur personal expenses. ""For that reason, the Scottish government allocates a civic allowance to each council. ""For Glasgow City Council, this is subject to a yearly maximum of Â£5,000."" The civic allowance, which was introduced by the Scottish Local Authorities Remuneration Committee, replaced the clothing allowance and reflects a councillor's public profile. For that reason the Lord Provost is eligible to claim more than a backbench councillor. Last year the council came under fire foraccepting a Rolls Royce Ghostfor use as the Lord Provost's car at a time when it was preparing to increase nursery fees by 57%. It later emerged the anonymous donor wasBoyd Tunnock, owner of the Tunnock's biscuit business. The businessman said he just wanted to do ""a good thing"" for the city.

"This video can not be played Gloomy post-Brexit forecasts 'accurate' Even a ""relatively benign"" no-deal Brexit would push UK debt to its highest since the 1960s, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has said. The think tank said borrowing was likely to rise to Â£100bn and total debt would soar to 90% of national income. ""The government is now adrift without any effective fiscal anchor,"" said IFS director Paul Johnson. The Treasury said any decisions would be made ""with a view to the long-term sustainability of the public finances"". The gloomy forecasts are part of the IFS Green Budget, looking at the challenges facing Chancellor Sajid Javid as he prepares for his first Budget. The IFS's Mr Johnson said: ""Given the extraordinary level of uncertainty and risks facing the economy and public finances, it [the government] should not be looking to offer further permanent overall tax giveaways in any forthcoming Budget. ""In the case of a no-deal Brexit, though, it should be implementing carefully targeted and temporary tax cuts and spending increases where it can effectively support the economy."" The next election: What will the parties promise? A simple guide to Brexit Will Johnson's Brexit plan work for business? But even before the cost of a possible no-deal Brexit is factored in, the think tank said the government was set to break its own spending rules. The IFS forecasts that annual borrowing - the difference between what the government spends and what it receives through, for example, taxation - will top Â£50bn next year. That will be about 2.3% of gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of national income. Under current spending rules the government can only borrow up to 2% of national income. The think tank said the government's current plans for day-to-day spending next year are closer to the levels proposed by Labour's 2017 manifesto than plans laid out by the Conservative party at the time. An HM Treasury spokesperson said: ""September's spending round supported the people's priorities of health, education and the police within the existing fiscal rules, as we said it would be. ""Beyond that, the chancellor has already said that we will be reviewing the fiscal framework as we turn the page on austerity. In so doing, we will retain a fiscal anchor to public spending so that decisions are taken with a view to the long-term sustainability of the public finances."" A doubling in the annual budget deficit, leading, in relation to the size of the economy, to the highest government debt since the 1960s. These are the new forecasts of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies for how a no-deal Brexit is likely to drench the UK's public finances in red ink. Only on the extraordinary scale of the fiscal collapse of the 2008 financial crisis are these numbers modest. On any ordinary scale they do matter - an annual deficit heading back up towards Â£100bn, and national debt closer to 90% of GDP for the first time in half a century. And all this comes at a time where the institute concludes that the government is no longer taking its own fiscal rules seriously, borrowing more to spend more on public services even as the Treasury approaches its self-imposed limits. Read more here. In the case of a no-deal Brexit, the IFS said a temporary government spending spree could help to smooth the path for growth, although it would also add to government debt. The think tank forecasts that the debt stock - the total amount of money owed by the government - would climb to almost 90% of national income. It currently stands at about 80%. Even with ""substantial"" government spending, the IFS expects the UK economy to flatline for two years following a no-deal Brexit. It warned that a rise in public spending in 2020 would likely be followed by ""another bust"" as the government would have to deal with ""the consequences of a smaller economy and higher debt for funding public services"". Mr Johnson said that it would be ""crucial"" that government spending programmes were temporary. ""An economy that turns out smaller than expected can, in the long run, support less public spending than expected, not more,"" he said. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics Christian Schulz, the chief UK economist at Citi, which contributed to the report, said: ""The UK economy is already around Â£60bn smaller than it would have been without a vote to leave the European Union, with the UK missing out on a bout of global growth. ""Business investment is up to 20% lower than it would otherwise have been, hurting productivity and wage growth,"" he said. However, Mr Schulz added that a further Brexit delay would create more uncertainty, denting investment and leaving growth at around 1% a year. ""From a growth perspective, a Brexit deal is a little better, leaving growth at 1.5%, but it would leave no chance of Brexit being cancelled,"" he said. ""A no-deal Brexit - even with a substantial stimulus - could mean no growth at all for the next two years. Remaining in the EU would be the best scenario for economic growth in the next few years.""

"Some observers believe the herd fell while trying to help a baby elephant The number of elephants that died after falling down a waterfall in Thailand has increased to 11. It is thought the animals may have been trying to save a baby elephant that slipped over the edge. Local authorities at the Khao Yai National Park in central Thailand initially spotted only six dead elephants over the weekend. The additional five were spotted by drone near the notorious fall known as Haew Narok (Hell's Fall). The dead elephants included a three-year-old calf, park officials said at the weekend, according to the Reuters news agency. ""We understand that the elephants were trying to cross over to the other side of the river,"" local official Badin Chansrikam told the agency. ""Probably, one of the smaller elephants might have slid and the adult ones were trying to rescue them but instead, were swept away by the water."" Nine reasons why we love elephants Six elephants die trying to save each other Poacher trampled by elephant, eaten by lions Elephant tourism is 'fuelling cruelty' According to local media though, the reason the animals fell into the strong current is not known. This video can not be played Some believe the herd fell while trying to help a baby elephant When the first six dead animals were discovered at the weekend, two surviving elephants were found struggling on a rock. Park rangers lowered food laced with supplements to the stranded animals to help them regain strength and climb back into the forest. But experts warn their long-term survival may be difficult as elephants rely on large herds for protection and finding food. The incident could also take an emotional toll. Elephants have been known to display signs of grief. There are around 300 wild elephants in the park, which is  home to various wild animals, including bears and gibbons, and is a popular destination for tourists. Thai authorities shared an image of one survivor attempting to revive its companion National park officers are trying to retrieve the bodies from the river as there are fears the carcasses might contaminate the water. According to the Bangkok Post, the new death toll makes it one of the biggest losses to Thailand's elephant population in recent memory. The Haew Narok waterfall has a history of similar incidents. A herd of eight elephants died after falling in 1992, in a case that brought national attention. Around 7,000 Asian elephants remain in Thailand, with more than half living in captivity.

"This video can not be played UK Brexit proposals ""very fair"" and ""generous"", says PM Boris Johnson has called on the EU to enter detailed talks to ""thrash out"" its objections to his latest Brexit proposals. The prime minister said the UK plans were a ""big concession"", but European leaders had not offered specific criticism of his ideas. French President Emmanuel Macron says the EU will decide at the end of the week whether a new deal is possible. Mr Johnson held further telephone calls with EU counterparts on Monday. Meanwhile, a Scottish courthas dismissed a callfor it to issue an order to compel the PM to comply with a law which would force him to seek a Brexit delay. Under legislation passed by MPs last month - the Benn Act - Mr Johnson must write to the EU requesting a further delay if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October, unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit. Downing Street said the PM held phone calls with the leaders of Sweden, Denmark and Poland, after speaking to Mr Macron on Sunday. The prime minister told the French president over the phone he believed a deal could be achieved, but the EU must match compromises made by the UK. Judge dismisses no-deal Brexit challenge What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit Cross-party Brexit talks - will they or won't they? Speaking to reporters on Monday, Mr Johnson said: ""What we're saying to our friends is: this is a very fair, generous and reasonable offer we've made. ""We haven't really heard the detail from them about what they think the problems are. It's time for us to get together and really thrash this thing out."" His remarks come at the start of a key few days of negotiations as both parties try to find a new agreement in time for a summit of European leaders on 17 and 18 October. Arrangements for preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland continue to be a sticking point, with the EU calling for ""fundamental changes"" to the UK's latest proposals, which were unveiled last week. According to a briefing given to European diplomats on Monday, the European Commission was ""nonplussed"" about being asked to rule out any checks on the Irish border when it was unclear what controls the UK was intending elsewhere in Northern Ireland. The BBC's Adam Fleming said it is understood the EU was also concerned that the UK wanted to have continued access to several EU trade databases, even if Northern Ireland's Stormont Assembly withheld its consent for the new regulatory and customs arrangements. A UK government spokesperson said Mr Johnson's Europe adviser David Frost would continue talks with EU officials on Tuesday after the UK provided ""additional legal text"" on the British proposals. ""This provided further technical detail on customs and goods regulations to further clarify how the UK's proposals would operate,"" the spokesperson added. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will also visit EU capitals this week as part of an effort to drum up support for the PM's plans. Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" Speaking after meeting Mr Barclay, Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok urged ""more realism and clarity"" from the UK this week. ""Important questions still remain on [the] UK Brexit proposals,"" hetweeted,external. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has previously said he did not understand how tariff checks could be avoided if Northern Ireland left the EU's customs union. He also raised concerns about Mr Johnson's plan to give the Northern Ireland Assembly a vote over entering into a ""regulatory zone"" with the EU. He said the views of the ""whole population of Northern Ireland"" should be represented, and no one party should have a ""veto"" over the idea. This video can not be played Last week in Brexit: The PM revealed his plan to attempt to ""get Brexit done"" Meanwhile, opposition leaders have met to discuss the prime minister's border proposals together for the first time, and to consider how they might be able to force him to comply with the terms of the Benn Act. But a planned attempt from opposition parties to pave the way for MPs to take control of the Commons agenda from next week has stalled. The move was aimed at allowing them to pass more emergency laws on no-deal, or demand more documents in the run-up to 31 October. The BBC's Nick Eardley says the idea failed to win the backing of former Tory MPs expelled from the party last month, after they decided to give No 10 more time to try and get a new deal with Brussels. After Monday's meeting, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said she was concerned at Labour's continuing insistence that Jeremy Corbyn must lead any so-called government of national unity created to replace Mr Johnson. She said Mr Corbyn could not command the numbers in the House of Commons to make an interim government viable and failing to see that made a no-deal Brexit more likely. Allow Twitter content?

Labour has pressed the government to publish its proposed legal text to replace theexisting Irish border backstop plan, which it has shared with EU officials. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the document could contradict the PM's claim, made last week, that his plans would not require any ""physical infrastructure"" to make them work. But Brexit minister James Duddridge said publishing the text now could ""get in the way of getting a deal"", adding that talks were at a ""sensitive"" stage. He told the Commons that the government would only publish the text ""when doing so will assist the negotiations"". Tuesday 8 October- Last working day in the House of Commons before it is due to be prorogued - suspended - ahead of a Queen's Speech to begin a new parliamentary session.

Anyone suspected of breaching the condition - which has no time limit - could be arrested and prosecuted, police said. A Section 14 order allows the police to impose conditions on a static protest - where campaigners are gathered in one place, rather than marching. To impose the condition, police must have evidence that serious disruption is being caused to communities. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Activists have attached themselves to the underside of a lorry, which is blocking the road outside the Home Office. The vehicle is parked on Marsham Street, where hundreds of protesters set up camp overnight. One activist climbed on top of the lorry and set up a tent. There was a large police presence in the area on Tuesday, with pictures showing officers removing activists from the lorry.

Two activists have attached themselves to the doors of the building, while others demonstrate outside. Meanwhile, a group have placed 800 potted trees outside Parliament, in Old Palace Yard, as they call on the government to plant billions of trees across the UK. Trees have been dedicated to MPs, and protesters hope they will use them to reforest the country. Sean Clay, 36, from Newcastle, told the BBC: ""Planting trees would go a long way to restore the habitats we have lost as well as absorbing carbon emissions."" Activists have created a ""fledgling forest"" Asked about Boris Johnson's description of demonstrators, Packham told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""I was there yesterday. I met farmers, I met teachers, I met scientists, I met lawyers, I met grandparents, I met mothers and fathers, and I met children. ""These are the concerned people of the world."" Mr Johnson had suggested while attending a book launch on Monday that the demonstrators should abandon their ""hemp-smelling bivouacs"" and stop blocking roads. Protester Claudia Fisher, 57, from Brighton said campaigners would like to discuss their views with the prime minister. Responding to his description of activists as ""uncooperative crusties"", Ms Fisher said: ""We are a little bit crusty, I'll put my hands up to it, after a night sleeping out on the grounds of Whitehall, but we're not uncooperative. ""We're actually very co-operative. We... would really like to hear what he has to say, and we'd really like him to... hear what we have to say."" Activists set up tents throughout Westminster, including Horseferry Road John Curran, a 49-year-old former detective sergeant for the Metropolitan Police, was one of the protesters who camped overnight. Mr Curran, who has a three-year-old daughter, says he was arrested while protesting with Extinction Rebellion in April, and is willing to be arrested again. He said: ""Clearly there is some frustration (for the police) that they probably have better things to be doing, and I agree, but the responsibility for that must lie with the government. ""Take action, and we won't have to be here."" Activists camped at Smithfield Market overnight, but say they allowed traders to operate. There is a festival atmosphere in Westminster as Extinction Rebellion activists emerge from their tents to stage a second day of protests in central London. The roads around Parliament - normally full with traffic - are instead dotted with encampments of tents, gazebos and makeshift food points, where hundreds of protesters from across the country spent the night. Volunteers serve bowls of porridge from a truck, while others bang drums and join sing-alongs.

"Human rights groups say up to one million Uighurs and other Muslims are in detention centres in Xinjiang The US has blacklisted 28 Chinese organisations for their alleged involvement in abuses against ethnic Uighurs in China's Xinjiang province. The organisations are now on the so-called Entity List, which bars them from buying products from US companies without approval from Washington. The 28 targets include both government agencies and technology companies specialising in surveillance equipment. China reacted angrily, dismissing the US allegations as groundless. ""There is no such thing as these so-called 'human rights issues' as claimed by the United States,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang. ""These accusations are nothing more than an excuse for the United States to deliberately interfere in China's internal affairs."" It is not the first time the US has put Chinese groups under a trade ban. In May,the Trump administration added telecommunications giant Huawei to the Entity List,externalbecause of security fears over its products. The vanished Uighurs of Xinjiang China's Muslim 'crackdown' explained A Commerce Department filing said the organisations are ""implicated in human rights violations and abuses"".

Xinjiang province's Public Security Bureau is on the list, along with 19 other smaller government agencies.

'We're all paying for this': People in the trade war crossfire US-China trade war in 300 words The US-China trade war in charts By Karishma Vaswani, BBC Asia Business correspondent This move by the US will no doubt hurt China's technology ambitions, at least in the short term. The companies targeted are some of China's biggest tech stars in artificial intelligence - the industry China is staking its future on. But the processor chips used to train AI algorithms are currently dominated by American firms like Intel and Nvidia. Increasingly, though, US moves to restrict the American tech available to Chinese companies is prompting China Inc to accelerate its desire for self-sufficiency. For instance, after Huawei was placed on the US entity list earlier this year - which meant that companies like Google would need to get an export license from Washington before selling to it - the Chinese company said it would start developing its own operating software to embed on its phones. Chinese alternatives to other US technology are also being developed. As the US and China's trade war turns increasingly into a battle over technology, consumers will eventually have to choose between all-Chinese and all-American products. China has launched a massive security operation in Xinjiang, in its far west, in recent years. Human rights groups and the UN say China has rounded up and detained more than a million Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in vast detention camps, where they are forced to renounce Islam, speak only in Mandarin Chinese and learn obedience to the communist government. China says those people are attending ""vocational training centres"" which are giving them jobs and helping them integrate into Chinese society, in the name of preventing terrorism. This video can not be played The BBC's John Sudworth meets Uighur parents in Turkey who say their children are missing in China There have been increasingly vocal denunciations from the US and other countries about China's actions in Xinjiang. Last week,US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo alleged that China ""demands its citizens worship government, not God"",externalin a press conference in the Vatican. And in Julymore than 20 countries at the UN Human Rights Council signed a joint lettercriticising China's treatment of the Uighurs and other Muslims. Uighurs are ethnically Turkic Muslims. They make up about 45% of the Xinjiang region's population; 40% are Han Chinese. China re-established control in 1949 after crushing short-lived state of East Turkestan. Why is there tension between China and the Uighurs? Since then, there has been large-scale immigration of Han Chinese and Uighurs fear erosion of their culture.

"Lord Provost Eva Bolander receives a civic allowance The Lord Provost of Glasgow has been criticised after it emerged her expenses included claims for 23 pairs of shoes. TheDaily Record reports,externalEva Bolander submitted receipts totalling more than Â£8,000 over a 28-month period. A council spokesman said the SNP councillor incurs personal expenses as she is required to represent the city at hundreds of events. But Glasgow Labour MSP James Kelly said her position was not tenable. Mr Kelly said: ""While services for homeless people across Glasgow are being cut, the SNP Lord Provost has been touring the city in a grotesque spending spree at the taxpayers' expense. ""In just one trip to John Lewis she spent more on herself than what a worker being paid the national minimum wage earns in a whole week. ""Eva Bolander should pay back the money and resign."" Scottish Conservative Glasgow MSP Annie Wells said: ""For any politician to think they can claim something like this on expenses is a joke. ""It's not even one or two misdemeanours - these revelations show a pattern of behaviour which will be completely unacceptable to council tax payers in Glasgow. ""She must now do the right thing and stand down - there's simply no way she can continue in this senior role after these reports. She also owes the people of Glasgow an almighty apology."" The figures, obtained under a Freedom of Information request, cover claims between May 2017 and August this year. The paper reports Ms Bolander spent Â£1,150 on shoes, including a single order for two pairs from Watford-based Sole Bliss which cost Â£308. The Lord Provost's expenses also included Â£389 for Harris Tweed fabric, around Â£992 for 14 dresses and Â£435 for seven blazers. Ms Bolander - who earns Â£39,310 - got her nails done 20 times and claimed for 10 hair appointments totalling Â£751. The most expensive items were a pair of Â£358 spectacles and Â£200 hat from milliner William Chambers. By Jamie McIvor, BBC Scotland Local Government Correspondent There is no accusation of impropriety against the Lord Provost of Glasgow Eva Bolander. The money spent was within the civic allowance allocated to the council by the Scottish government. The issue here is whether the amount spent on clothes was necessarily politically wise at a time when local government continues to face tough financial choices. For opposition parties, the story seems like an open goal. Try justifying spending on clothes to someone unhappy about a cut or an unfilled pothole. Ms Bolander's supporters would point out that her role involves representing the council (and indeed Glasgow itself) at a large number of events in the city and beyond. There is little love lost between the Labour and SNP groups on Glasgow City Council. Labour is still reeling that the SNP gained control of the administration in 2017 - promising a greater degree of openness and transparency. The question is whether spending this amount of money on clothes is an appropriate use of public resource - does it send out the right signals about the administration in Glasgow or about local government in general? This is to a large extent about the optics. The money may be a drop in the ocean within Glasgow City Council's overall budget but, given the cuts and savings local government has made in recent years, opponents will not be hesitant to suggest what they would consider to be more appropriate uses of taxpayers' money. A council spokesman said: ""The national committee that oversees councillors' pay recognises that the requirement to represent their city at hundreds of events means Lord Provosts often incur personal expenses. ""For that reason, the Scottish government allocates a civic allowance to each council. ""For Glasgow City Council, this is subject to a yearly maximum of Â£5,000."" The civic allowance, which was introduced by the Scottish Local Authorities Remuneration Committee, replaced the clothing allowance and reflects a councillor's public profile. For that reason the Lord Provost is eligible to claim more than a backbench councillor. Last year the council came under fire foraccepting a Rolls Royce Ghostfor use as the Lord Provost's car at a time when it was preparing to increase nursery fees by 57%. It later emerged the anonymous donor wasBoyd Tunnock, owner of the Tunnock's biscuit business. The businessman said he just wanted to do ""a good thing"" for the city.

"Some observers believe the herd fell while trying to help a baby elephant The number of elephants that died after falling down a waterfall in Thailand has increased to 11. It is thought the animals may have been trying to save a baby elephant that slipped over the edge. Local authorities at the Khao Yai National Park in central Thailand initially spotted only six dead elephants over the weekend. The additional five were spotted by drone near the notorious fall known as Haew Narok (Hell's Fall). The dead elephants included a three-year-old calf, park officials said at the weekend, according to the Reuters news agency. ""We understand that the elephants were trying to cross over to the other side of the river,"" local official Badin Chansrikam told the agency. ""Probably, one of the smaller elephants might have slid and the adult ones were trying to rescue them but instead, were swept away by the water."" Nine reasons why we love elephants Six elephants die trying to save each other Poacher trampled by elephant, eaten by lions Elephant tourism is 'fuelling cruelty' According to local media though, the reason the animals fell into the strong current is not known. This video can not be played Some believe the herd fell while trying to help a baby elephant When the first six dead animals were discovered at the weekend, two surviving elephants were found struggling on a rock. Park rangers lowered food laced with supplements to the stranded animals to help them regain strength and climb back into the forest. But experts warn their long-term survival may be difficult as elephants rely on large herds for protection and finding food. The incident could also take an emotional toll. Elephants have been known to display signs of grief. There are around 300 wild elephants in the park, which is  home to various wild animals, including bears and gibbons, and is a popular destination for tourists. Thai authorities shared an image of one survivor attempting to revive its companion National park officers are trying to retrieve the bodies from the river as there are fears the carcasses might contaminate the water. According to the Bangkok Post, the new death toll makes it one of the biggest losses to Thailand's elephant population in recent memory. The Haew Narok waterfall has a history of similar incidents. A herd of eight elephants died after falling in 1992, in a case that brought national attention. Around 7,000 Asian elephants remain in Thailand, with more than half living in captivity.

"This video can not be played James Peebles (L), Didier Queloz (C) and Michel Mayor (R) share the nine million kronor prize Three scientists have been awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics for ""ground-breaking"" discoveries about the Universe. James Peebles, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz were announced as this year's winners at a ceremony in Stockholm. Peebles was honoured for work on the evolution of the Universe, while Mayor and Queloz won for their discovery of a planet around a Sun-like star. The winners will share the prize money of nine million kronor (Â£738,000). Reacting to the news, Prof Queloz told BBC News: ""It's unbelievable,"" adding: ""Since the discovery 25 years ago, everyone kept telling me: 'It's a Nobel Prize discovery'. And I say: 'Oh yeah, yeah, maybe, whatever.'"" But in the intervening years, he more-or-less ""forgot"" about the discovery: ""I don't even think about it,"" he said. ""So frankly, yes, it came as a surprise to me. I understand the impact of the discovery, but there's such great physics being done in the world, I thought, it's not for us, we will never have it. ""I'm a bit shocked right now, I'm still trying to digest what it means."" How our cells sense oxygen wins Nobel prize The cosmic microwave background represents the faint afterglow of the Big Bang Ulf Danielsson, a member of the Nobel Committee, commented: ""Both these prizes... tell us something essential, something existential about our place in the Universe."" ""The first one, tracing the history back to an unknown origin, is so fascinating. The other one tries to answer these questions about: 'are we alone - is there life anywhere else in the Universe?'"" Winnipeg, Canada-born James Peebles was honoured for his contributions to the understanding of the evolution of the Universe and Earth's place in the cosmos. With others, he predicted the existence of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, the so-called afterglow of the Big Bang. By studying the CMB, scientists have been able to determine the age, shape and contents of the Universe. ""Cosmic background radiation was discovered in 1965, and turned out to be a goldmine for our understanding of how the Universe developed from its early childhood to the present day,"" said Mats Larsson, chair of the Nobel physics prize committee. ""Were it not for the theoretical discoveries of James Peebles, the wonderful high-precision measurements of this radiation over the last 20 years would have told us almost nothing."" This video can not be played How do you they pick a Nobel prize winner? The 84-year-old cosmologist, who is now based at Princeton University in New Jersey, US, also made major contributions to the theory of dark matter and dark energy, the mysterious components which together make up some 95% of the Universe. In addition, he helped develop the theoretical framework of structure formation - which describes how galaxies and other large structures emerged from earlier density fluctuations in the Universe. Asked what he considered his most important contribution, Prof Peebles said he was ""hard-pressed to say"", adding that his work had been collaborative. ""It's a life's work,"" he told the news conference at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz were awarded the prize for finding 51 Pegasi b, a gas giant orbiting a star 50 light-years away. Artwork: Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz have won for their detection of the distant planet 51 Pegasi b It was the first exoplanet to be discovered orbiting a star like our own. They used the pioneering radial velocity technique. This detects distant worlds indirectly, by measuring how a parent star ""wobbles"" when it is tugged on by the gravity of an orbiting planet. The astronomers were working at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, when the discovery was made. Mayor, 77, is still there as a professor emeritus; Queloz, 53, now holds positions at Geneva and at the University of Cambridge, UK. Michael Moloney, chief executive officer of the American Institute of Physics, said: ""[The laureates'] groundbreaking work on discovering the fundamental nature of the Universe and new worlds in distant solar systems has opened up whole new areas of research in cosmology and exoplanet science.

"This video can not be played Maryanne Pugsley: ""The impact of this has infiltrated every single aspect of my life"" Police have launched a fresh probe into claims a woman was sexually abused by her teacher at a South Ayrshire school. Maryanne Pugsleyfirst spoke about the allegations- which date back to the 1970s - at Holyrood when she was calling for an inquiry into abuses at state schools. A Police Scotland investigation into the claims was launched in 2016 but no-one was charged. However, BBC Scotland understands the force is now pursuing new leads. Mrs Pugsley, 55, claims the man abused her over a number of years from the age of 12 and alleges they had a ""meeting place"" in the middle of the Ayrshire countryside, where their initials are carved into a tree. The mother-of-two made a complaint to South Ayrshire Council in the 1990s but said she was told at the time there was not enough evidence for the case to proceed to prosecutors. Two years ago Mrs Pugsley, who works as a classroom assistant, asked the local authority for a copy of her complaint file but was told that they could not find any records. She has also now launched a civil legal action against South Ayrshire Council seeking compensation for her alleged abuse. The local authority has said its current safeguarding procedures for children are far more robust than in the past. Mrs Puglsey said:  ""I'm hoping that this investigation will finally lead to resolving my quest for justice. ""Repeatedly revisiting the sexual abuse that I suffered as a child leaves me exhausted, both mentally and physically. ""Many times I have been praised for the courage in putting forward the petition and complimented on how strong I am but what people don't see are the days when I have a complete meltdown and cannot function."" Mrs Puglsey said she would ""not rest"" until her case had been resolved. Maryanne Pugsley, whose former surname is Fitzsimmons, lodged a petition at the Scottish Parliament in April calling for an inquiry into child abuse at state schools Mrs Puglsey haslodged a petition at the Scottish Parliament,externalcalling for a public inquiry into the abuse of children within Scottish state schools, an issue not currently covered by the ongoing Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry. The petition has the backing of Tory MSP Brian Whittle who has been supporting Mrs Puglsey in her case. A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: ""In 2016 a report of non-recent sexual abuse (1970s) of a female pupil by a male teacher at a school in South Ayrshire was received by Police Scotland. ""An investigation was carried out at that time and no-one was charged. ""However, inquiries are still continuing."" A spokesman for South Ayrshire Council said: ""The council is sympathetic to anyone suffering as a result of the unresolved injustice of historical child abuse.

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was in a crash with a Volvo The parents of a teenage motorcyclist killed in a crash have said ""we will go to Washington if we have to"", to secure the return of a US diplomat's wife suspected of driving the other vehicle. Harry Dunn, 19, died in a crash with a Volvo in Northamptonshire on 27 August. Anne Sacoolas, a suspect in the crash, later left the UK despite telling police she had no such plans. Prime MinisterBoris Johnson has urged the USto reconsider its decision to allow her immunity. Meanwhile, both Northamptonshire's chief constable and police and crime commissioner have urged the Americans to waive Ms Sacoolas's diplomatic immunity. Tim Dunn, Harry's father, told the BBC: ""With Boris Johnson saying what he did, it was nice to feel actually we were getting the support we were trying to get. ""Maybe President Trump will look at this and hopefully look in our favour."" Harry's mother, Charlotte Charles, said: ""We have spoken to some American news channels, we've got others lined up. The message is clearly getting out across there. ""The messages of support we've had from the US have been immense. They're all appalled and devastated for us and disgusted that this woman has been allowed to leave the UK."" Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles have spoken to US media about their case Ms Charles said: ""We are determined to see it through, we won't stop. We will go to Washington if we have to, we've taken [legal] advice on that."" She said they would ""plead"" to President Trump to not only waive Ms Sacoolas' diplomatic immunity, but also ""look at the laws"" around diplomatic immunity ""With the amount of diplomats we have in the UK, we can't have someone go out and do something like that again and leave another family to suffer,"" she added. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, has spoken to the US ambassador Woody Johnson, and raised the case in a telephone call with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. A Foreign Office spokesman said Mr Raab had ""reiterated his disappointment with the US decision and urged them to reconsider"". Harry Dunn died after his Kawasaki motorcycle was involved in a crash with a black Volvo XC90 at about 20:30 BST on B4031 Park End in Croughton close to the RAF base, on Tuesday, 27 August. He was taken to Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford where he died a short time later. Northamptonshire's chief constable Nick Adderley said that ""based on CCTV evidence"", officers knew that ""a vehicle alighted from the RAF base at Croughton"" and was ""on the wrong side of the road"". He said the suspect, Anne Sacoolas had ""engaged fully"" following the crash and said ""she had no plans to leave the country in the near future"". About 23,000 individuals in the UK have diplomatic immunity, a status reserved for foreign diplomats and their families, as long as they don't have British citizenship. It is granted by the 1961 Vienna Convention and means that, in theory, diplomats cannot face court proceedings for any crime or civil case. The convention also states that those entitled to immunity are expected to obey the law. Where crimes are committed, the Foreign Office can ask a foreign government to waive immunity where they feel it is appropriate. In 2017, there were 12 serious offences committed by people entitled to diplomatic protection. Five of these were driving related, but other crimes included sexual assault, blackmail and possession of a firearm. Diplomatic immunity is by no means restricted to those named on the Diplomatic List from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Drivers, cooks and other support staff whose names do not appear, but have been accredited to Britain (""the receiving state"") have the same diplomatic status and immunity as those who are listed. Equally, there are a number of foreign nationals in Britain attached to international organizations who have the same status and protection. Imtiaz Tyab, Correspondent CBS News The US is going through some pretty extraordinary times at the moment. But somehow this story has really struck a chord with many Americans and I think that is because at its heart you have two parents grieving the loss of their son. What's also so different about this story is this idea of diplomatic immunity. That doesn't sit right with a lot of people we've been hearing from either commenting on our reports or through social media. Many of them say Anne Sacoolas should be back in the UK and should meet with the family of Harry Dunn.

"Angela Merkel and Boris Johnson spoke on the phone on Tuesday morning A No 10 source has said a Brexit deal is ""essentially impossible"" after a call between the PM and Angela Merkel. Boris Johnson and the German chancellor spoke earlier about the proposals he had put forward to the EU - but the source said she made clear a deal based on them was ""overwhelmingly unlikely"". Mrs Merkel's office said it would not comment on ""private"" conversations. But the BBC's Adam Fleming said there was ""scepticism"" within the EU that Mrs Merkel would have used such language. And the EU's top official warned the UK against a ""stupid blame game"". President of the European Council Donald Tusk sent a public tweet to Mr Johnson, telling him ""the future of Europe and the UK"" was at stake. Allow Twitter content?

With efforts to get a deal by the end of the month on an apparent knife edge, Mr Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar have said they hope to meet later in the week. But Mr Varadkar told an interviewer on Tuesday eveninghe thought it would be ""very difficult"" to secure an agreement by next week. He said the UK had ""repudiated"" the deal negotiated previously with Theresa May's government and had ""sort of put half of that now back on the table, and are saying that's a concession. And of course it isn't, really"". And following talks in Downing Street, the president of the European Parliament said there had been ""no progress"" and MEPs would not agree to a compromise deal ""at any price"". David Sassoli said the UK's new proposed customs arrangements for Northern Ireland were a ""long way from something to which the Parliament could agree"". The president of the European Parliament said the EU faced a no-deal exit or a further delay Amid frantic diplomatic manoeuvring in European capitals, details of a call earlier on Tuesday between the UK and German leaders have reignited tensions across the continent. The No 10 source suggested Mrs Merkel told her counterpart the only way to break the deadlock was for Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union and for it to permanently accept EU single market rules on trade in goods. Latest on Brexit deal talks Kuenssberg: Is no-deal about to become PM's policy? How does the border plan differ from the backstop? Brexitcast: Blame game This, the source said, marked a shift in Germany's approach and made a negotiated deal ""essentially impossible"". The prime minister's official spokesman said the conversation had been ""frank"" but denied the negotiations were all but over. Norbert Rottgen, an ally of the chancellor who is chair of the Bundestag's Foreign Affairs Committee, said there was ""no new German position"". He tweeted that a deal,externalbased on the UK's latest proposals had ""been unrealistic from the beginning and yet the EU has been willing to engage"". The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler said it was ""no secret"" Berlin found the UK's proposed new customs solution for Northern Ireland problematic. Allow Twitter content?

Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" The UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, is continuing to meet EU counterparts in Brussels, but the No 10 source said Tuesday morning's phone call had been a ""clarifying moment"", adding: ""Talks in Brussels are close to breaking down."" They said the UK was not willing to move away from the principle of providing a consent mechanism for Northern Ireland, or the plan for leaving the customs union, and if the EU did not accept those principles, ""that will be that"" and the plan moving forward would be an ""obstructive"" strategy towards Brussels. They also accused the EU of being ""willing to torpedo the Good Friday agreement"" - the peace process agreed in Northern Ireland in the 1990s - by refusing to accept Mr Johnson's proposals. Hands up if all this stuff about ""spokesman"" and ""sources"" is driving you bonkers? Here's the in-brief explanation of how it works at Westminster. The prime minister has an official spokesman. They work for the government, not the political party that is in government. They give two briefings a day to reporters when Parliament is sitting and they are on the record. That is to say we report what is said and we report who said it - although by convention we don't actually name the spokesman. There are two reasons for this: they are speaking on behalf of the PM, not themselves. And sometimes a deputy does the briefing instead. In addition to the official spokesman, there are other people in Downing Street who will talk to journalists. For some, that is their specific job. For others, it is not. These people will always talk to us off the record - so we can quote them, but not name them, or do anything that risks identifying them. Journalists always prefer on the record quotes, but in politics as in life, people are often more candid in private, and so we can get a greater sense of what is going on in return for respecting the terms on which the information has been given to us. Updating MPs on contingency planning for a no-deal exit, minister Michael Gove said there was still ""every chance"" of a deal but the EU must engage with the UK's plans. ""In setting out these proposals, we've moved - it is now time for the EU to move too,"" he said. Ireland's TÃ¡naiste (Deputy Prime Minister), Simon Coveney, said a deal was still possible but ""not any at cost"" - and the UK must accept it had ""responsibilities"" on the island of Ireland. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics The UK and Irish leaders spoke on the phone for 40 minutes on Tuesday, after which No 10 said both sides ""strongly reiterated"" their desire to reach a deal. But Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told MPs the government was ""intent on collapsing the talks and engaging in a reckless blame game"". ""The stark reality is the government put forward proposals that were designed to fail,"" he said, adding that it was ""beneath contempt"" that, according toa Downing Street source reported by the Spectator,external, the UK could withdraw security co-operation from other EU countries if it were forced to remain beyond 31 October. How could no-deal happen? Brexit deal possible but not at any cost - Coveney Judge dismisses no-deal Brexit court move What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? The PM has insisted the UK will leave the EU on that date, with or without a deal. That is despite legislation passed by MPs last month, known as the Benn Act, which requires Mr Johnson to write to the EU requesting a further delay if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October - unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit. No-one really wants to comment directly on this phone call - certainly not Berlin - but talking to EU officials and diplomats in Brussels, there is considerable scepticism. That's because the words attributed to Angela Merkel do not reflect the EU's agreed language. For one, Mrs Merkel and the EU have repeatedly said they will keep talking to the last second and will not pull the plug before that. And secondly, the No 10 source claims the EU wants to keep Northern Ireland permanently ""trapped"" in the customs union - Brussels insists it doesn't want that at all, it just wants the option for Northern Ireland stay inside temporarily until something else is worked out. So as I say, scepticism. It could be a misinterpretation or it could be a deliberate bit of spin, because we're now entering into a blame game about whose fault it is that progress isn't being made. The key focus of the new UK plans is to replace the so-called backstop - the policy negotiated by Theresa May and the EU to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland - which has long been a sticking point. After presenting them, government sources hoped the sides might be able to enter an intense 10-day period of talks almost immediately, but a number of senior EU figures, including Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, warned they did not form the basis for deeper negotiations - even if they believed a deal could still be done. Mr Varadkar has warned the Johnson plan could actually undermine that principle by giving one party in Northern Ireland a veto over what happens to the country as a whole. Tuesday 8 October- Last working day in the House of Commons before it is will be prorogued - suspended - ahead of a Queen's Speech to begin a new parliamentary session. Monday 14 October- The Commons is due to return, and the government will use the Queen's Speech to set out its legislative agenda. The speech will then be debated by MPs throughout the week. Thursday 17 October- Crucial two-day summit of EU leaders begins in Brussels. This is the last such meeting currently scheduled before the Brexit deadline. Saturday 19 October- Date by which the PM must ask the EU for another delay to Brexit under the Benn Act, if no Brexit deal has been approved by Parliament and they have not agreed to the UK leaving with no-deal. Thursday 31 October- Date by which the UK is due to leave the EU, with or without a withdrawal agreement.

"Syria's Kurds said they would defend their territory at all costs A deal between Turkey and Russia has brought an end to a Turkish military operation in north-eastern Syria against a Kurdish-led militia alliance previously allied to the United States. We've boiled down why it matters. Turkey considers the biggest militia in the Kurdish-led alliance a terrorist organisation. It says it is an extension of a Kurdish rebel group fighting in Turkey. On 9 October, Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels launched an offensive to create a 30km (20-mile) deep ""safe zone"" along the Syrian side of the border. Turkey's president says its aim is to ""destroy the terror corridor formed on our southern border"" It came after the withdrawal of US troops, who had relied on the Kurds to defeat the Islamic State group. The Kurds asked Syria's government and its ally, Russia, to help stop the assault. Turkey and Russia subsequently agreed to take joint control of the border area. Turkey wants to push back from its border members of a Syrian Kurdish militia called the People's Protection Units (YPG). Turkish leaders view the YPG as a terrorist organisation. They say it is an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for decades. The Syrian Democratic Forces alliance led the fight against the Islamic State group in Syria The YPG dominates an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which drove IS out of a quarter of Syria with the help of a US-led multinational coalition. When the US declared the defeat of IS in March, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pushed it to create a ""safe zone"" clear of YPG fighters in north-eastern Syria where refugees could be resettled. The US agreed to establish one together with Turkey in August and the YPG complied. But two months later, US troops pulled back from the border after Mr Erdogan decided to launch an operation to create a 440km-long ""safe zone"" unilaterally. The SDF said it had been ""stabbed in the back"" by the US and warned the defeat of IS might be reversed. On 9 October, Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels attacked. Four days later, the SDF turned to the Syrian government and its backer, Russia, for help. They agreed to deploy Syrian soldiers to stop the advance. Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed a deal to end the offensive The US negotiated a 5-day ceasefire on 17 October to allow YPG fighters to withdraw from a 120km-long stretch of the frontier from Ras al-Ain to Tal Abyad where the fighting was focused. Just before the ceasefire expired, Mr Erdogan reached a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin. They agreed Turkey could keep its forces in the area between Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad, and that Russian and Syrian troops would take control of the rest of the border. It feels threatened by the People's Protection Units (YPG), the military wing of the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD). The Turkish government insists the YPG is an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey since 1984 and is designated as a terrorist group by the US and EU. The YPG and PKK share a similar ideology, but say they are separate entities. This is Turkey's third cross-border military operation against Syrian Kurdish-led forces The YPG is the dominant force in an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). With the help of air strikes by a US-led multinational coalition against the jihadist group Islamic State (IS), SDF fighters captured tens of thousands of square kilometres of territory in north-eastern Syria between 2015 and 2019. The SDF set up an autonomous administration to govern the region, home to three million people. It avoided conflict with the Syrian government, but sought recognition for Kurdish autonomy. Despite being a member of Nato and the US-led coalition against IS, Turkey opposed the support the US gave the SDF. This video can not be played A young face destroyed by war: The impact of an air strike one year on In 2016, the Turkish military supported an offensive by allied Syrian rebel factions that drove IS militants out of the border area around Jarablus and stopped SDF fighters moving west, towards the Kurdish enclave of Afrin. In January 2018, after US officials said they were helping the SDF build a new ""border security force"" to prevent IS infiltration, Turkish-led forces launched an operation to expel YPG fighters from Afrin. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long sought what he has called a ""safe zone"" clear of YPG fighters in north-east Syria. But the issue came to the fore after the SDF captured the last pocket of IS territory in Syria in March 2019. In August, the US and Turkey agreed to a ""security mechanism"" covering a predominantly Arab border area between Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad. Turkish and US troops took part in joint patrols before the offensive US and Turkish troops carried out joint patrols and YPG began dismantling fortifications. But on 6 October, Mr Erdogan told US President Donald Trump that Turkey was about to start a unilateral operation to set up a ""safe zone"". Mr Trump ordered US troops to pull back from the area. At the start of ""Operation Peace Spring"" on 9 October, Mr Erdogan said Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels aimed to ""neutralize terror threats against Turkey and lead to the establishment of a safe zone, facilitating the return of Syrian refugees to their homes"". SDF commanders warned that a Turkish offensive would ""spill the blood of thousands of innocent civilians"" and might pave the way for the return of IS. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said 120 civilians were killed, along with 275 SDF fighters, 196 Turkish-backed Syrian rebels, 10 Turkish soldiers, and five Syrian soldiers. Dozens of civilians and combatants were killed in the first week of the assault President Erdogan said 775 ""terrorists"" had been ""neutralised"" and that 79 Syrian rebels and seven Turkish soldiers had been killed. He denied any civilians had been killed in Syria but said 20 had died in YPG attacks on Turkey. The UN said at least 176,000 people had been displaced by the fighting and that critical civilian infrastructure had been damaged. After four days of fighting, the US began a full withdrawal from northern Syria and the Kurds agreed a deal with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government for the Syrian army to deploy along the northern border for the first time in years to confront the Turkish-led forces. Russia, Mr Assad's staunch ally, sent military police to key locations. On 17 October, the US persuaded Mr Erdogan to ""pause"" Turkey's offensive to allow it to ""facilitate the withdrawal of YPG forces from the Turkish-controlled safe zone"". The ceasefire largely held and on 22 October the head of the SDF said the withdrawal had been completed. Residents of the town of Tal Tamer welcomed the arrival of the Syrian army That same day, Mr Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a plan to end the offensive. They agreed: Turkish forces would be allowed to remain in the 120km-long strip of territory they had captured between Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad Russian and Syrian troops would take control of the rest of the border area and ensure YPG fighters pulled back 30km from the border Turkish and Russian troops would start joint patrols inside a 10km-deep zone along the border on 29 October There are questions about the deal, such as how long the Turkish forces can stay and what will happen to the tens of thousands of people being detained by the SDF on suspicion of links to IS. But there is no doubt it has cemented Russia's role as the pivotal player in Syria.

"Angela Merkel and Boris Johnson spoke on the phone on Tuesday morning A No 10 source has said a Brexit deal is ""essentially impossible"" after a call between the PM and Angela Merkel. Boris Johnson and the German chancellor spoke earlier about the proposals he had put forward to the EU - but the source said she made clear a deal based on them was ""overwhelmingly unlikely"". Mrs Merkel's office said it would not comment on ""private"" conversations. But the BBC's Adam Fleming said there was ""scepticism"" within the EU that Mrs Merkel would have used such language. And the EU's top official warned the UK against a ""stupid blame game"". President of the European Council Donald Tusk sent a public tweet to Mr Johnson, telling him ""the future of Europe and the UK"" was at stake. Allow Twitter content?

With efforts to get a deal by the end of the month on an apparent knife edge, Mr Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar have said they hope to meet later in the week. But Mr Varadkar told an interviewer on Tuesday eveninghe thought it would be ""very difficult"" to secure an agreement by next week. He said the UK had ""repudiated"" the deal negotiated previously with Theresa May's government and had ""sort of put half of that now back on the table, and are saying that's a concession. And of course it isn't, really"". And following talks in Downing Street, the president of the European Parliament said there had been ""no progress"" and MEPs would not agree to a compromise deal ""at any price"". David Sassoli said the UK's new proposed customs arrangements for Northern Ireland were a ""long way from something to which the Parliament could agree"". The president of the European Parliament said the EU faced a no-deal exit or a further delay Amid frantic diplomatic manoeuvring in European capitals, details of a call earlier on Tuesday between the UK and German leaders have reignited tensions across the continent. The No 10 source suggested Mrs Merkel told her counterpart the only way to break the deadlock was for Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union and for it to permanently accept EU single market rules on trade in goods. Latest on Brexit deal talks Kuenssberg: Is no-deal about to become PM's policy? How does the border plan differ from the backstop? Brexitcast: Blame game This, the source said, marked a shift in Germany's approach and made a negotiated deal ""essentially impossible"". The prime minister's official spokesman said the conversation had been ""frank"" but denied the negotiations were all but over. Norbert Rottgen, an ally of the chancellor who is chair of the Bundestag's Foreign Affairs Committee, said there was ""no new German position"". He tweeted that a deal,externalbased on the UK's latest proposals had ""been unrealistic from the beginning and yet the EU has been willing to engage"". The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler said it was ""no secret"" Berlin found the UK's proposed new customs solution for Northern Ireland problematic. Allow Twitter content?

Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" The UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, is continuing to meet EU counterparts in Brussels, but the No 10 source said Tuesday morning's phone call had been a ""clarifying moment"", adding: ""Talks in Brussels are close to breaking down."" They said the UK was not willing to move away from the principle of providing a consent mechanism for Northern Ireland, or the plan for leaving the customs union, and if the EU did not accept those principles, ""that will be that"" and the plan moving forward would be an ""obstructive"" strategy towards Brussels. They also accused the EU of being ""willing to torpedo the Good Friday agreement"" - the peace process agreed in Northern Ireland in the 1990s - by refusing to accept Mr Johnson's proposals. Hands up if all this stuff about ""spokesman"" and ""sources"" is driving you bonkers? Here's the in-brief explanation of how it works at Westminster. The prime minister has an official spokesman. They work for the government, not the political party that is in government. They give two briefings a day to reporters when Parliament is sitting and they are on the record. That is to say we report what is said and we report who said it - although by convention we don't actually name the spokesman. There are two reasons for this: they are speaking on behalf of the PM, not themselves. And sometimes a deputy does the briefing instead. In addition to the official spokesman, there are other people in Downing Street who will talk to journalists. For some, that is their specific job. For others, it is not. These people will always talk to us off the record - so we can quote them, but not name them, or do anything that risks identifying them. Journalists always prefer on the record quotes, but in politics as in life, people are often more candid in private, and so we can get a greater sense of what is going on in return for respecting the terms on which the information has been given to us. Updating MPs on contingency planning for a no-deal exit, minister Michael Gove said there was still ""every chance"" of a deal but the EU must engage with the UK's plans. ""In setting out these proposals, we've moved - it is now time for the EU to move too,"" he said. Ireland's TÃ¡naiste (Deputy Prime Minister), Simon Coveney, said a deal was still possible but ""not any at cost"" - and the UK must accept it had ""responsibilities"" on the island of Ireland. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics The UK and Irish leaders spoke on the phone for 40 minutes on Tuesday, after which No 10 said both sides ""strongly reiterated"" their desire to reach a deal. But Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told MPs the government was ""intent on collapsing the talks and engaging in a reckless blame game"". ""The stark reality is the government put forward proposals that were designed to fail,"" he said, adding that it was ""beneath contempt"" that, according toa Downing Street source reported by the Spectator,external, the UK could withdraw security co-operation from other EU countries if it were forced to remain beyond 31 October. How could no-deal happen? Brexit deal possible but not at any cost - Coveney Judge dismisses no-deal Brexit court move What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? The PM has insisted the UK will leave the EU on that date, with or without a deal. That is despite legislation passed by MPs last month, known as the Benn Act, which requires Mr Johnson to write to the EU requesting a further delay if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October - unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit. No-one really wants to comment directly on this phone call - certainly not Berlin - but talking to EU officials and diplomats in Brussels, there is considerable scepticism. That's because the words attributed to Angela Merkel do not reflect the EU's agreed language. For one, Mrs Merkel and the EU have repeatedly said they will keep talking to the last second and will not pull the plug before that. And secondly, the No 10 source claims the EU wants to keep Northern Ireland permanently ""trapped"" in the customs union - Brussels insists it doesn't want that at all, it just wants the option for Northern Ireland stay inside temporarily until something else is worked out. So as I say, scepticism. It could be a misinterpretation or it could be a deliberate bit of spin, because we're now entering into a blame game about whose fault it is that progress isn't being made. The key focus of the new UK plans is to replace the so-called backstop - the policy negotiated by Theresa May and the EU to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland - which has long been a sticking point. After presenting them, government sources hoped the sides might be able to enter an intense 10-day period of talks almost immediately, but a number of senior EU figures, including Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, warned they did not form the basis for deeper negotiations - even if they believed a deal could still be done. Mr Varadkar has warned the Johnson plan could actually undermine that principle by giving one party in Northern Ireland a veto over what happens to the country as a whole. Tuesday 8 October- Last working day in the House of Commons before it is will be prorogued - suspended - ahead of a Queen's Speech to begin a new parliamentary session. Monday 14 October- The Commons is due to return, and the government will use the Queen's Speech to set out its legislative agenda. The speech will then be debated by MPs throughout the week. Thursday 17 October- Crucial two-day summit of EU leaders begins in Brussels. This is the last such meeting currently scheduled before the Brexit deadline. Saturday 19 October- Date by which the PM must ask the EU for another delay to Brexit under the Benn Act, if no Brexit deal has been approved by Parliament and they have not agreed to the UK leaving with no-deal. Thursday 31 October- Date by which the UK is due to leave the EU, with or without a withdrawal agreement.

The force is asking residents to be its ""eyes and ears"" to curb the problem. In July,84-year-old John Miller was badly hurtafter a hit-and-run incident in the capital when a rider allegedly lost control while ""pulling a wheelie"". A joint project between Cardiff Council and the police has confiscated and destroyed 38 bikes since 2017. The force has urged the public to share information and pictures of anti-social bike use so they can identify those illegally riding powerful off-road motorcycles and quad bikes. Sgt Duncan Mitchell, from South Wales Police, said they were not ""small, children's scrambler bikes"". ""Often riders aren't using correct protective equipment,"" he said. ""They're riding on a road at speed, again without helmets, without any safety equipment. It puts them at danger. It puts others at danger."" This photo taken by a member of the public captured a motorbike driving dangerously in Tremorfa Park as children played rugby St Albans RFC has had problems with off-road bikes on and around their pitch on Tremorfa Park. Team manager Ian Watkins, who has been involved with the club since 1976, said they had been ""plagued"" with off-road bikes trespassing on the park. ""[They're] riding onto the pitches, damaging the pitches and causing a hazard and danger to all park users, particularly our younger section,"" he said. Ian Watkins said on one occasion bike riders in the park were goading members of the public Mr Watkins said: ""It can be intimidating, there's been occasion where some of the riders are actually goading members of the public and goading the police when they attend. ""I think the worst occasion was six bikes on the park. ""It only takes one accident for somebody to be hurt, God forbid fatally injured.""

"Heidi Allen is the seventh former Tory or Labour MP to join the Lib Dems this year MP Heidi Allen, who quit the Conservative Party earlier this year, has joined the Liberal Democrats. The MP for South Cambridgeshire left the Conservatives in February over its Brexit policy and other issues. She subsequently became the leader of the fledgling Change UK but left after the party's failure to win any seats in the European elections. She is the fourth ex-Tory to join the Lib Dems in recent months, after Sarah Wollaston, Philip Lee and Sam Gyimah. This video can not be played Sam Gyimah is introduced as a Lib Dem MP at their party conference Her move means the Liberal Democrats now have 19 MPs, eight more than at the start of the year. In a statement,,externalthe 44-year old said she would fight the South Cambridgeshire seat for her new party at the next election and had been ""bowled over"" by the support she had received. Ms Allen said the Conservatives and Labour had both ""moved to the extremes"" and it was only the Liberal Democrats which now occupied the ""liberal centre ground"" of British politics. The MP, who has been sitting as an independent in Parliament for several months, said she could be ""stronger and more effective"" in her opposition to Brexit as ""part of a team"". ""Now is the time to stand shoulder to shoulder with, not just alongside, those I have collaborated and found shared values with,"" she said. ""As we face the monumental task ahead of stopping a damaging Brexit, healing the rifts in the UK and rebuilding the UK, there is only one party with the honesty, energy and vision to do that."" Welcoming the party's latest new recruit, the Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said Ms Allen had ""long been an ally"" in the fight to stop Brexit. She said her arrival showed that the Lib Dems were the ""strongest party of Remain"". The MP was among ex-Tory and Labour politicians to form Change UK Ms Allen was first elected to Parliament in 2015, having previously worked for her family business as well as ExxonMobil and Royal Mail. She caused ripples in her maiden speech in the Commons, decrying tribalism in Parliament and attacking elements of the government's welfare policy. After walking out of the Tories earlier this year, she caused controversy by suggesting that if she and other defectors did their job, the Conservatives would no longer ""need to exist"". But Change UK only managed to win 3.4% of the vote in May's European elections after reportedly refusing to co-operate with the Lib Dems and other anti-Brexit parties. She is the fifth of the 11 founding members of Change UK to join the Lib Dems - following Chuka Umunna, Luciana Berger, Angela Smith and Sarah Wollaston. She faces a tough task in retaining her seat at the next election, which has been a safe Conservative seat since its creation in 1997. In 2017, the Lib Dems came in third place in the constituency - more than 20,000 votes behind the Tories and more than 5,000 votes behind Labour. However, the Lib Dems took control of South Cambridgeshire council in last year's local authority elections. The area voted strongly to remain in the 2016 Brexit referendum.

"Human rights groups say up to one million Uighurs and other Muslims are in detention centres in Xinjiang The US has blacklisted 28 Chinese organisations for their alleged involvement in abuses against ethnic Uighurs in China's Xinjiang province. The organisations are now on the so-called Entity List, which bars them from buying products from US companies without approval from Washington. The 28 targets include both government agencies and technology companies specialising in surveillance equipment. China reacted angrily, dismissing the US allegations as groundless. ""There is no such thing as these so-called 'human rights issues' as claimed by the United States,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang. ""These accusations are nothing more than an excuse for the United States to deliberately interfere in China's internal affairs."" It is not the first time the US has put Chinese groups under a trade ban. In May,the Trump administration added telecommunications giant Huawei to the Entity List,externalbecause of security fears over its products. The vanished Uighurs of Xinjiang China's Muslim 'crackdown' explained A Commerce Department filing said the organisations are ""implicated in human rights violations and abuses"".

This video can not be played The BBC visits the camps where Chinaâs Muslims have their ""thoughts transformed"" The Commerce Department said in its decision on Monday,externalthat these 28 entities are implicated in ""China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups."" Xinjiang province's Public Security Bureau is on the list, along with 19 other smaller government agencies. Hikvision, Dahua Technology and Megvii Technology are among eight commercial groups on the list, all of which specialise in facial-recognition technology. Hikvision is one of the largest surveillance equipment manufacturers in the world.

'We're all paying for this': People in the trade war crossfire US-China trade war in 300 words The US-China trade war in charts By Karishma Vaswani, BBC Asia Business correspondent This move by the US will no doubt hurt China's technology ambitions, at least in the short term. The companies targeted are some of China's biggest tech stars in artificial intelligence - the industry China is staking its future on. But the processor chips used to train AI algorithms are currently dominated by American firms like Intel and Nvidia. Increasingly, though, US moves to restrict the American tech available to Chinese companies is prompting China Inc to accelerate its desire for self-sufficiency. For instance, after Huawei was placed on the US entity list earlier this year - which meant that companies like Google would need to get an export license from Washington before selling to it - the Chinese company said it would start developing its own operating software to embed on its phones. Chinese alternatives to other US technology are also being developed. As the US and China's trade war turns increasingly into a battle over technology, consumers will eventually have to choose between all-Chinese and all-American products. China has launched a massive security operation in Xinjiang, in its far west, in recent years. Human rights groups and the UN say China has rounded up and detained more than a million Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in vast detention camps, where they are forced to renounce Islam, speak only in Mandarin Chinese and learn obedience to the communist government. China says those people are attending ""vocational training centres"" which are giving them jobs and helping them integrate into Chinese society, in the name of preventing terrorism. This video can not be played The BBC's John Sudworth meets Uighur parents in Turkey who say their children are missing in China There have been increasingly vocal denunciations from the US and other countries about China's actions in Xinjiang. Last week,US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo alleged that China ""demands its citizens worship government, not God"",externalin a press conference in the Vatican. And in Julymore than 20 countries at the UN Human Rights Council signed a joint lettercriticising China's treatment of the Uighurs and other Muslims. Uighurs are ethnically Turkic Muslims. They make up about 45% of the Xinjiang region's population; 40% are Han Chinese. China re-established control in 1949 after crushing short-lived state of East Turkestan. Why is there tension between China and the Uighurs? Since then, there has been large-scale immigration of Han Chinese and Uighurs fear erosion of their culture.

However, their immunity can be waived by the state that has sent them. Ms Sacoolas left the UK despite telling police she had no such plans. Harry Dunn, 19, died in hospital after his motorbike was in a crash with a Volvo Speaking during a visit to a hospital in Watford, Mr Johnson said: ""I think everybody's sympathies are very much with the family of Harry Dunn and our condolences to them for their tragic loss. ""I must answer you directly, I do not think that it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose. ""And I hope that Anne Sacoolas will come back and will engage properly with the processes of law as they are carried out in this country. ""That's a point that we've raised or are raising today with the American ambassador here in the UK and I hope it will be resolved very shortly. ""And to anticipate a question you might want to raise, if we can't resolve it then of course I will be raising it myself personally with the White House."" This video can not be played Harry Dunn crash: Family 'will travel to US to fight for change' Both Northamptonshire's chief constable and police and crime commissioner have already urged the Americans to waive Ms Sacoolas's diplomatic immunity. Mr Dunn died in hospital shortly after his Kawasaki motorcycle was involved in a crash with a Volvo XC90 at about 20:30 BST near the RAF base at Croughton. Chief constable Nick Adderley said based on CCTV evidence, officers knew that on the night of the crash a vehicle had left the base ""on the wrong side of the road"". Supt Sarah Johnson said the police were collecting evidence with support from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the RAF base and the Dunn family. ""We're going to make sure that we deal with it [the investigation] in a way that we can take it through to prosecution,"" she said. Gary O'Donoghue, BBC Washington Correspondent The appeal from Boris Johnson will undoubtedly be heard at the White House. But I think it's unlikely the Americans will change their minds. It happens on a reasonably regular basis around the world that diplomats get into serious situations and don't face the law. We understand the diplomat and his wife had only been in Britain for three weeks. On the face of it that sounds like something that has been brought to a premature end, presumably in connection with what happened. I think the slightly distasteful thing is that apparently Ms Sacoolas promised to stay and co-operate but then left. But we don't know the circumstances around that because we haven't heard her side of the story. The crash happened on the B4031 near RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire, in August Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said it was ""such a dishonourable thing to do"" for Ms Sacoolas to leave the country and urged her to come back. Ms Charles told BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""[It was] unintentional. She didn't purposely drive on the other side of the road... if she'd have stayed and faced us as a family we could have found that forgiveness... but forgiving her for leaving, I'm nowhere near."" She has previously said that if the diplomatic waiver was declined then she would travel to see President Donald Trump and ""ask him directly"". The US State Department said it was in ""close consultation"" with British officials and has offered its ""deepest sympathies"" to the family of Mr Dunn.

"This video can not be played Gloomy post-Brexit forecasts 'accurate' Even a ""relatively benign"" no-deal Brexit would push UK debt to its highest since the 1960s, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has said. The think tank said borrowing was likely to rise to Â£100bn and total debt would soar to 90% of national income. ""The government is now adrift without any effective fiscal anchor,"" said IFS director Paul Johnson. The Treasury said any decisions would be made ""with a view to the long-term sustainability of the public finances"". The gloomy forecasts are part of the IFS Green Budget, looking at the challenges facing Chancellor Sajid Javid as he prepares for his first Budget. The IFS's Mr Johnson said: ""Given the extraordinary level of uncertainty and risks facing the economy and public finances, it [the government] should not be looking to offer further permanent overall tax giveaways in any forthcoming Budget. ""In the case of a no-deal Brexit, though, it should be implementing carefully targeted and temporary tax cuts and spending increases where it can effectively support the economy."" The next election: What will the parties promise? A simple guide to Brexit Will Johnson's Brexit plan work for business? But even before the cost of a possible no-deal Brexit is factored in, the think tank said the government was set to break its own spending rules. The IFS forecasts that annual borrowing - the difference between what the government spends and what it receives through, for example, taxation - will top Â£50bn next year. That will be about 2.3% of gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of national income. Under current spending rules the government can only borrow up to 2% of national income. The think tank said the government's current plans for day-to-day spending next year are closer to the levels proposed by Labour's 2017 manifesto than plans laid out by the Conservative party at the time. An HM Treasury spokesperson said: ""September's spending round supported the people's priorities of health, education and the police within the existing fiscal rules, as we said it would be. ""Beyond that, the chancellor has already said that we will be reviewing the fiscal framework as we turn the page on austerity. In so doing, we will retain a fiscal anchor to public spending so that decisions are taken with a view to the long-term sustainability of the public finances."" A doubling in the annual budget deficit, leading, in relation to the size of the economy, to the highest government debt since the 1960s. These are the new forecasts of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies for how a no-deal Brexit is likely to drench the UK's public finances in red ink. Only on the extraordinary scale of the fiscal collapse of the 2008 financial crisis are these numbers modest. On any ordinary scale they do matter - an annual deficit heading back up towards Â£100bn, and national debt closer to 90% of GDP for the first time in half a century. And all this comes at a time where the institute concludes that the government is no longer taking its own fiscal rules seriously, borrowing more to spend more on public services even as the Treasury approaches its self-imposed limits. Read more here. In the case of a no-deal Brexit, the IFS said a temporary government spending spree could help to smooth the path for growth, although it would also add to government debt. The think tank forecasts that the debt stock - the total amount of money owed by the government - would climb to almost 90% of national income. It currently stands at about 80%. Even with ""substantial"" government spending, the IFS expects the UK economy to flatline for two years following a no-deal Brexit. It warned that a rise in public spending in 2020 would likely be followed by ""another bust"" as the government would have to deal with ""the consequences of a smaller economy and higher debt for funding public services"". Mr Johnson said that it would be ""crucial"" that government spending programmes were temporary. ""An economy that turns out smaller than expected can, in the long run, support less public spending than expected, not more,"" he said. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics Christian Schulz, the chief UK economist at Citi, which contributed to the report, said: ""The UK economy is already around Â£60bn smaller than it would have been without a vote to leave the European Union, with the UK missing out on a bout of global growth. ""Business investment is up to 20% lower than it would otherwise have been, hurting productivity and wage growth,"" he said. However, Mr Schulz added that a further Brexit delay would create more uncertainty, denting investment and leaving growth at around 1% a year. ""From a growth perspective, a Brexit deal is a little better, leaving growth at 1.5%, but it would leave no chance of Brexit being cancelled,"" he said. ""A no-deal Brexit - even with a substantial stimulus - could mean no growth at all for the next two years. Remaining in the EU would be the best scenario for economic growth in the next few years.""
