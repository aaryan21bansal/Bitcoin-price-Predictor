"The UK has lost 83% of its main department stores in the five years since the collapse of the BHS chain. The figure highlights the extent of the upheaval in the High Street as the Covid pandemic sped up changes in shopping habits. The data, compiled by commercial property information firm CoStar Group, also reveals that more than two-thirds of these shops remain unoccupied. Some 237 big stores have yet to be taken over by a new business. ""The data undoubtedly highlights the acceleration of change in the retail sector in recent years, which the pandemic has only exacerbated,"" said CoStar Group's head of analytics, Mark Stansfield. CoStar tracked the UK's largest chains, from BHS and Beales to Debenhams and House of Fraser, from 2016 to the present day. Five years ago, they had 467 stores between them. Now, however, only 79 are left. CoStar Group also examined what had happened to the 388 that had closed. Although 237 are currently sitting empty, 52 already have either firm plans in place or early planning approval for a change of use or repurposing. The research was done in July. Mr Stansfield told the BBC he believed the pace of change would soon step up. ""We are increasingly seeing forward-thinking real estate owners getting ahead of the problem and reshaping what are key assets in our town centres to provide a focal point for regeneration,"" he said. ""I think we'll see many more plans come to light in the coming months. With these store closures come new opportunities."" Department stores have long been the cornerstone of UK shopping areas. Many are in purpose-built shopping centres, while some occupy historic buildings. Figuring out what to do with all this redundant space is one of the biggest challenges for landlords, as well as for the town centres that host those properties. BHS is a good illustration of why there is no quick fix for the problem. Five years after the retailer ceased trading, a quarter of its former outlets have still failed to attract new tenants. In 2016, the BBC visited the old BHS store on Edinburgh's Princes Street, one of the biggest in the chain. The owners already had new ideas for the site - and crucially, they decided to turn it into a building with a mix of different uses. BHS: Inside a 'ghost store' in Edinburgh What will happen to closed High Street shops? Its six floors, once riddled with asbestos, have slowly been transformed. The old staff locker rooms and half of the building have been turned into hotel bedrooms by Premier Inn. The former BHS store on Princes Street in Edinburgh has been repurposed They're also putting the finishing touches to a state-of the art office right at the top, while the basement will hopefully become a bowling alley. There will also eventually be retail, just a lot less than before. ""It costs a lot of money and takes a lot of time to turn these large format spaces into new uses,"" says the architect behind the project, Frank Hinds of CDA. ""In development terms, we did this in a relatively short space of time."" When it comes to repurposing, says Mr Hinds, the stumbling blocks are often financial. Investors have to be able to make a return to justify the huge investment. Luckily for this BHS, it's on a world-class street. ""The viability comes from the location and the desire that people have to be in that location,"" he adds. For Premier Inn, the hotelier involved, it was an opportunity too good to miss. ""Buildings like this don't come along very often with beautiful views across to the castle,"" says Valerie Graham, regional operations director. Premier Inn's Valerie Graham: ""Buildings like this don't come along very often"" ""Seeing so many people get use of the space is just fantastic. And the demand is there. We're creating jobs too."" Edinburgh has lost four of its main department stores in the past few years, but, fortunately, there are solutions under way for all of them. For instance, the former House of Fraser store at the other end of Princes Street is about to open its doors as the Johnnie Walker Whisky Experience. Filling the gaps in smaller towns is a much greater challenge. In Dumfries, the old Debenhams store is still vacant. It's the biggest retail unit in the town, with no takers so far for the space. ""It comes down to money,"" says Scott Mackay, who runs the Midsteeple Quarter, a local company founded to benefit the community. Through crowdfunding, donations and public money, it's buying old, empty, shops and bringing them back to life with new tenants. The community group is buying up shops around the historic Midsteeple in Dumfries ""This is a small rural town historically and there isn't the amount of money to be invested in Dumfries compared with our bigger cities. We stand or fall on our own two feet,"" he says. Would he like to take on the former Debenhams site as well? ""If we had the funding, absolutely we would take on a building like this,"" he says. ""I think it would make a great small boutique cinema or food court on the ground floor, with potentially residential on the upper floors."" Some of form of intervention is needed, he believes, to avoid the store sitting empty for years. Debenhams is a more recent casualty of the changing High Street environment than BHS, havingshut its last stores in May this year. In all, 149 former Debenhams stores are currently vacant, as the data from CoStar Group shows. CoStar Group's team has been scouring planning applications and talking to property agents on the ground as well as big landlords for this research, which is the most comprehensive picture to date on the huge structural changes to have hit this part of British retail. The appetite for quality shop space hasn't completely diminished. For instance, Next has already taken space in Debenhams stores for its new beauty concept, while Mike Ashley is redeveloping or re-letting space for his Flannels brand. But if BHS is anything to go by, reviving many of these these vast sites will take time, as well as some radical thinking.

"A company which supplies food to care homes and restaurants says it is taking ""drastic action"" to try to get round the shortage of UK lorry drivers. The boss of Country Range said the group was buying smaller vans in the face of ""significant"" problems caused by a lack of qualified HGV drivers. Managing director Coral Rose said the issue was ""going to get worse"" as schools and offices return to normal. Industry warnings about the impact ofdriver shortageshave been increasing. On Wednesday, both Tesco and Iceland said there could be some shortages on the shelves in the run up to the key Christmas trading period. Supermarket bosses warn over Christmas supplies Act now to end lorry driver crisis, government told How serious is the HGV driver shortage? A combination of Covid, Brexit and other factors has meant there are not enough drivers to meet demand. The Road Haulage Association estimates there is now a shortage of more than 100,000 drivers in the UK, out of a pre-pandemic total of about 600,000. That number included tens of thousands of drivers from EU member states who were living and working in the UK. Even before Covid, the estimated shortage was about 60,000 drivers. Country Range is a group of 12 wholesalers supplying food and non-food items to schools, care homes, hotels, restaurants and small shops. Ms Rose said the shortage of drivers had affected both the supply of products from manufacturers to its warehouses and also from its warehouses to its customers. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Rose said Country Range was ""taking drastic action such as buying smaller delivery vehicles to make sure that we don't have to have people with specific HGV licences to drive them"". There was ""going to be increased pressure as schools reopen, people continue to holiday in the UK, people return back to their offices, so staff feeding may reopen again, so the issue is going to get worse and we would like government intervention"", she added. One short-term fix the government could take would be to a temporary visa scheme ""to encourage EU workers to come back"", she said. But she wants the government to give support for people with training and apprenticeships in the longer term ""because this is not a quick fix, it's a long-term issue"". Ms Rose also said: ""There's lot of drivers who are able to drive but can't go on the road at the moment because they couldn't take their tests or refresher course and training through the last year because of Covid, so there's potential to release a lot more drivers. There could be some increased resource in that area as well and that would help."" On Wednesday, the government said there was a ""highly resilient"" food supply chain and it was taking measures to tackle the driver shortage. Labour's shadow minister for business and consumers, Seema Malhotra, said: ""The chaos hitting supply chains is of the Conservatives' making. Their failure to keep their promise to cut red tape for businesses, which are struggling with more paperwork and higher costs, combined with worker shortages, has created a perfect storm."" The government said it had ""well-established ways of working with the food sector to address food supply chain disruptions"". A spokesperson added the government had announced measures to tackle driver shortages, which included streamlining and increasing tests. ""Most of the solutions are likely to be driven by industry, with progress already being made in testing and hiring, and a big push towards improving pay, working conditions and diversity,"" they added. ""We want to see employers make long-term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad."" Sainsbury's said ""availability in some product categories may vary but alternatives are available and stores continue to receive deliveries daily"". Morrisons said it was working with suppliers to minimise shortages. It said it had ""contingency plans around Brexit in place for a number of years"". It added it was ""less concerned"" about some fresh foods because it produced them itself. However, it said the ""challenges"" had been exacerbated by summer holidays meaning fewer drivers were available. ""But there is no short-term fix for the haulage industry with drivers and vacancies increasing nationally."" Waitrose said it had been ""working through the same challenges that all supermarkets are facing right now"". It added it was focussing on ""maintaining the best possible range of products"". Iceland Foods, said: ""We are currently facing a massive shortage of HGV drivers in the UK which is impacting the food supply chain on a daily basis. We... have already seen deliveries to our stores cancelled for the first time since the pandemic began, and this is solely due to the HGV driver shortage."" The Co-op said: ""Like many retailers, we are impacted by some patchy disruption to our deliveries, logistics and store operations but we are working closely with our suppliers to get re-stocked quickly."" Tesco said ""there may be some shortages"", but people should not ""over-dramatise"" and panic-buy. ""It's very easy to make a drama out of a modest crisis."" The motor industry has already reported thatvan sales have hit near record levels in 2021as a result of a boom in home deliveries and the economy reopening. Ms Rose admitted that a firm such as Country Range buying more small delivery vans would increase the number of vehicles on the roads. ""More vehicles and more staff required to do that, it's not an ideal scenario but it's something that we're trying to do to continue to supply our customers."" She said steps were needed in order to encourage people to take up driving jobs. ""We need to make this an attractive profession and a recognised profession, not just with food service but within the whole of the UK. ""The average age of the drivers is over 55 - there isn't a lot of new blood coming into the industry because it takes time and money to train and people don't necessarily have that."" Staff shortages in the food industry are extending beyond drivers. Bolton-based Greenhalgh's Craft Bakery has a chain of shops in Greater Manchester and Lancashire, and delivers wholesale nationally. Six members of the firm's management team have been taking turns to do shifts driving the delivery vans. Boss David Smart told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""It's a bit of a perfect storm really. We are short of drivers but it isn't just drivers, we're actually short of quite a few people throughout the business from bakers to bakery operatives to shop colleagues to drivers to office staff. ""It's the August bank holiday, everybody wants to go everywhere and because we're a food service industry we try to supply all those areas. We're extremely busy. However, we are very, very busy with too few hands.""

"Lisa Shaw was a presenter on BBC Radio Newcastle until her death in May A radio presenter died due to complications from the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, a coroner has found. Lisa Shaw, who worked for BBC Radio Newcastle,died at the age of 44 in Mayafter developing headaches a week after getting her first dose of the vaccine. Newcastle coroner Karen Dilks heard Ms Shaw suffered blood clots in the brain which ultimately led to her death. The inquest heard the condition linked to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was very rare. The coroner said: ""Lisa died due to complications of an AstraZeneca Covid vaccination."" Ms Dilks said Ms Shaw was previously fit and well but concluded that it was ""clearly established"" that her death was due to a very rare ""vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia"", a condition which leads to swelling and bleeding of the brain. Ms Shaw, a mother of one from Consett, received her first dose of the vaccine on 29 April. On 13 May she was taken by ambulance to University Hospital of North Durham after having a headache for several days. Covid vaccines and rare clots - what do we know? How effective is the vaccine, and do I need a booster? In a statement, Dr John Holmes who treated her said she complained of having a ""severe headache shooting and stabbing"" across her forehead and behind her eyes. Tests were carried out and blood clots were found in her brain, prompting her to be moved to the neurology specialist unit at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI). The clots are considered extremely rare - there have been417 reported cases and 72 deaths,external- after 24.8 million first doses and 23.9 million second doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK. Dr Christopher Johnson, a consultant in anaesthetics and intensive care at the RVI, said Ms Shaw had been conscious for several days and had been treated for the clots with drugs which seemed to be successful. But on the evening of 16 May Ms Shaw said the headaches were worse and she had difficulty speaking. Scans showed she had suffered a haemorrhage in the brain and after her condition deteriorated, part of her skull was removed to try and relieve the pressure inside her head. Her condition continued to worsen and despite more surgery and treatments, she died on 21 May. This video can not be played Gareth Eveâs wife, BBC Newcastle presenter Lisa Shaw, died in hospital after a bleed on the brain Dr Johnson said doctors were in a daily conference with a national panel about vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, the condition Ms Shaw was believed to be suffering from. Asked if he would have changed the treatments given to Ms Shaw, he said: ""No."" Dr Johnson said The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) published guidelines on how to treat the condition in July which matched the treatment Ms Shaw received. ""Lisa got all the treatments that were recommended in the order they were recommended,"" he said. ""If we had the same presentation tomorrow we would do the same thing."" Dr Tuomo Polvikoski, a consultant neuro-pathologist who examined Ms Shaw after her death, said given her history of being fit and healthy with no medical problems, it was ""surprising"" she died of blood clots and bleeding in the brain. He said ""timewise"" it ""seems most likely"" her death was ""indeed vaccine induced"". Ms Dilks said the condition was ""very rare"" but agreed with Dr Polvikoski's findings. After the hearing, Ms Shaw's family said in a statement: ""This is another difficult day in what has been a devastating time for us. ""The death of our beloved Lisa has left a terrible void in our family and in our lives. ""She truly was the most wonderful wife, mum, daughter, sister and friend."" The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's chief safety officer, Dr Alison Cave, said it would be ""reviewing"" the coroner's verdict. ""The benefits of the Covid-19 vaccine AstraZeneca continue to outweigh the risks for most people,"" she said. ""It is therefore still vitally important that people come forward for their vaccination and for their second dose when invited to do so.""

"NHS England has admitted that a shortage of vials used for blood tests will worsen over the next few weeks and will last until mid-September. Itsaid supplies remain constrained,externaland are forecast ""to become even more constrained over the coming weeks"". While the NHS expects the position to improve by the middle of next month, ""overall supply is likely to remain challenging for a significant period."" Doctors had been told to stagger some blood tests due to the shortage. They are warning that patient care will suffer due to delays. It comes after Becton Dickinson, a company that makes vials for the health service, said it is experiencing serious supply chain issues. Due to the shortage, the NHS has temporarily stopped some blood testing for fertility, pre-diabetes, allergies and certain blood disorders. NHS England issuedguidance,externalurging doctors to delay regular blood tests if clinically safe and NHS Walesissued similar guidance. In its guidance, NHS England said ""alternative products are being sought to alleviate these constraints,"" as a result of the global shortages of blood tube products. Dr Farah Jameel, a GP based in north London and a representative from the British Medical Association trade body said she was having ""difficult conversations"" with patients about rationing the vials ""among the very sickest"". Dr Jameel is having ""incredibly challenging"" conversations with patients about delayed blood tests. She said there has been ""very unclear messaging from NHS England on how quickly we're going to run short and what the impact will be on patient care."" ""The NHS needs to communicate clearly with the public and with the profession so there is a clear understanding of the problems which will help us manage expectations,"" Dr Jameel said. ""These tests are a fundamental part of patient care, giving us essential insights into different conditions, warning signs and overall health."" Doctor Gavin Jamie, an GP based in Swindon agreed that preventative care is going to be slower, in addition to screening delays cause by the pandemic which he said he's still trying to catch up on. ""We've not seen the full effect yet but it looks like it could carry on for at least a few months from the time scale NHS England have been giving us,"" he added. GPs across the country have tweeted about the difficulties the shortage is causing, while patients have tweeted texts from their surgeries which have said their blood tests have been cancelled. Alison Webb's blood tests have been delayed by four months due to the shortages Alison Webb, from Wales, told the BBC she was told that she can't have her yearly thyroid and cholesterol checked due to the blood tube shortages. She has a condition which means the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones and said her blood tests are currently overdue by four months. ""Now I've been told to ring again in a month's time. Terrible,"" she said. The medical device company, Becton Dickinson, which partly manufactures its tubes in the US, said the need to test Covid-19 patients in addition to routine testing for procedures which were delayed due to the pandemic had increased demand. Responding to the new NHS guidance, theBritish Medical Association,externalsaid that healthcare staff were ""still no closer to understanding how this situation was able to develop and why there wasn't a contingency plan"". ""Today's guidance does not explain what will happen if hospitals or GP surgeries do run out of stock, and this must be addressed as a matter of urgency,"" said Dr David Wrigley, deputy chair of BMA council. ""No doctor wants the consequence of delayed diagnosis for patients due to these shortages, and they also need to know they are protected from any possible negligence claims,"" he added. Like many other industries, Becton Dickinson said in addition to increased demand, it was experiencing ""continued transportation challenges"", which included port and transport capacity, air freight capacity and UK border challenges. ""Suppliers are also challenged to meet increased demand for raw materials and components,"" the firm told the BBC. ""We are balancing the frequency of preventive maintenance leading to plant shutdown to provide continuing supply of products, and we are working closely with our raw material suppliers, transport agencies and other necessary third parties to minimize supply disruptions,"" a spokesperson added. A spokesperson for the Department for Health and Social Care told the BBC: ""Patient safety and continuity of care is our priority and we are working to ensure there is minimal possible impact on patient care. ""The health and care system is working closely with Becton Dickinson to put mitigations in place to resolve any problems if they arise,"" they added. Diabetes UK expressed concerns for the 13.6 million people in the country at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes can develop more slowly than those for type 1. Nikki Joule, policy manager at the charity, said the supply issues would make the condition ""harder to spot"" and said it's ""very important"" that those at risk ""do not fall through the cracks due to a logistical issue."" Gwenda Burns, chief executive of Fertility Network UK agrees that the logistical issue is ""extremely worrying"" for those awaiting fertility tests.

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"".

A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"".

""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"". Click here to read more about what the Taliban takeover means for Africa's jihadists Guterres also warned of extremists feeling emboldened Welcome to our live coverage of the latest developments in Afghanistan. The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

"This video can not be played Twin bombs exploded near the perimeter of Kabul airport, hours after warnings from Western governments President Joe Biden has promised to hunt down the jihadists behind an attack in Kabul which killed at least 90 people - including 13 US troops. Mr Biden warned the US would ""not forgive"" the perpetrators. The twin blasts, claimed by a local branch of Islamic State (IS), tore through crowds of men, women and children outside Kabul airport. They were hoping to join the 100,000 people airlifted out of Afghanistan since it fell to Taliban militants. There had been repeated warnings that an attack was likely, but it either did not reach or did not deter those waiting. US troops in control of Kabul international airport have been facilitating the evacuation of foreign nationals and Afghans who had been working with foreign missions. They have been aiming to complete this within a 31 August deadline for US forces to leave under an agreement with the Taliban. A number of European countries have already announced the end of their evacuation plans. The UK said on Friday it would not be processing any more applications, acknowledging it was leaving people behind. Speaking hours after Thursday's attack, Mr Biden vowed to complete the evacuation mission, adding ""we will not be deterred by terrorists"". Who are IS-K? He said the US military had been ordered to attack the leadership, assets and facilities of the group known as Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K), active in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The group is part of the global IS network, but has local links - even to the Taliban. However, IS-K have accused the Taliban of abandoning the battlefield in favour of a negotiated peace settlement. The attack at the airport - which began at about 18:00 local time (13:30 GMT) - targeted ""translators and collaborators with the American army"", the jihadist group said. The first blast happened near the Abbey Gate, where US and British forces have been checking people entering the airport, followed by a second minutes later  at a hotel which was used by British officials to process Afghans hoping to travel to the UK. Survivors described the horror in the wake of the attack, with one saying they saw ""bodies and body parts flying in the air like a tornado blowing plastic bags"". Another recounted how they tried to take an injured baby to safety, only for the child to die in their arms. Pictures being shared on social media suggest families have lost several members. Hospitals were quickly overwhelmed with the injured. Alberto Zanin, the medical director of one facility run by Italian NGO Emergency, described on Twitter how the victims ""could not speak, many were terrified, their eyes totally lost in emptiness, their gaze blank"". Thursday's events as they happened Airport attack: What we know Thirteen US troops were among those killed - the first US military casualties in Afghanistan since February 2020. Mr Biden said the troops who had died ""were heroes who were on a selfless mission to save the lives of others"". The head of US Central Command, Gen Frank McKenzie, said the threat from IS-K remained high and US forces were working with Taliban to try to stop further attacks and that the Taliban had already prevented many. But the attack is likely to significantly complicate the evacuation effort ahead of the deadline. There are currently 5,800 US troops on the ground at Kabul airport with a further 1,000 UK troops also there. To date, 104,000 civilians have been transferred from Afghanistan, including 66,000 by the US and 37,000 by allies and partners. Where will all the Afghan refugees go? UK enters final stages of Afghan evacuation About 5,000 people are waiting at the airport and many more are still trying to get through the perimeter checkpoints. A number of countries, including Canada, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Denmark had already stopped their operations. Turkey has announced that its troops, who had been providing security at the airport for six years, were withdrawing. Kabul attack: What we know Attack leaves many casualties.

"A local branch of the Islamic State group in Afghanistan has vowed to continue attacks now that Taliban militants are in control. So who are these IS militants? IS-K - Islamic State Khorasan Province - is the regional affiliate of the Islamic State group. It is the most extreme and violent of all the jihadist militant groups in Afghanistan. IS-K was set up in January 2015 at the height of IS's power in Iraq and Syria, before its self-declared caliphate was defeated and dismantled by a US-led coalition. It recruits both Afghan and Pakistani jihadists, especially defecting members of the Afghan Taliban who don't see their own organisation as extreme enough. ""Khorasan"" refers to a historical region covering parts of modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. The group initially included Pakistan until a separate Pakistan section was declared in May 2019. At its height the group numbered about 3,000 fighters. However, it has suffered significant casualties in clashes with both the US and Afghan security forces, and also with the Taliban. IS-K has targeted Afghan security forces, Afghan politicians and ministries, the Taliban, religious minorities, including Shia Muslims and Sikhs, US and Nato forces, and international agencies, including aid organisations. IS-K have been blamed for some of the worst atrocities in recent years, targeting girls' schools, hospitals and even a maternity ward, where they reportedly shot dead pregnant women and nurses. IS-K claimed responsibility for the deadly attack outside Kabul airport on 26 August Unlike the Taliban, whose interest is confined to Afghanistan, IS-K are part of the global IS network that seeks to carry out attacks on Western, international and humanitarian targets wherever they can reach them. IS-K are based in the eastern province of Nangarhar, close to drug and people-smuggling routes in and out of Pakistan. While most of its activities have been in Nangahar and Kabul, it has also claimed attacks in the provinces of Kunar, Jowzjan, Paktia, Kunduz and Herat. Peripherally yes, via a third party, the Haqqani network. According to researchers, there are strong links between IS-K and the Haqqani network, which in turn is closely linked to the Taliban. The man now in charge of security in Kabul is Khalil Haqqani who has had a $5m (Â£3.6m) bounty on his head. Dr Sajjan Gohel from the Asia Pacific Foundation has been monitoring the militant networks in Afghanistan for years. He says ""several major attacks between 2019 and 2021 involved collaboration between IS-K, the Taliban's Haqqani network and other terror groups based in Pakistan"". When the Taliban took over in Kabul on 15 August, the group released large numbers of prisoners from Pul-e-Charki jail, reportedly including IS and al-Qaeda militants. These people are now at large. But IS-K have major differences with the Taliban, accusing them of abandoning Jihad and the battlefield in favour of a negotiated peace settlement hammered out in ""posh hotels"" in Doha, Qatar. IS-K considers Taliban militants ""apostates"", making their killing lawful under their interpretation of Islamic law. IS militants now represent a major security challenge for the incoming Taliban government, something the Taliban leadership shares in common with Western intelligence agencies. Who are the Taliban?

"Mike Ashley's Frasers Group has offered the retail tycoon's future son-in-law a Â£100m bonus - but only if he can more than double the share price. The Sports Direct owner has put forward the bonus plan for Michael Murray when he becomes chief executive in May 2022. However, he will only collect if its share price reaches Â£15 for 30 trading days in a row before October 2025, up from its current level of about Â£6.50. The company described the target as ""challenging but achievable"". Mr Murray, 31, engaged to be married to Mr Ashley's daughter Anna, is currently ""head of elevation"" at Frasers and is in charge of modernising stores and transforming the business. The board of Frasers Group, which owns Sports Direct and House of Fraser, said it had also recommended Â£1m a year salary for Mr Murray. Shareholders are set to vote on the proposed bonus scheme at the group's annual general meeting on 29 September. Mike Ashley: Who is the founder of Sports Direct? Mr Ashley is due to step down as chief executive when Mr Murray takes over, but will remain on the board as an executive director. Mr Ashley founded Sports Direct in 1982 and retains 64% of the group. The company listed its shares on the stock exchange in 2007, with shares priced at 300p. Prices surged to more than 900p in early 2014. Worries over corporate governance and working conditions, as well as the impact of Covid on retailers, have since hit the share price. The group was renamed Frasers in December 2019, following its takeover of House of Fraser, but stores retained the Sports Direct brand. Sports Direct promised in 2016 to end zero-hours contracts and offer its workers guaranteed hours, but unions have sinceaccused the company of breaking that pledge. The firm has attracted criticism forcontinuing to recruit workers on zero-hours contracts,externalduring the pandemic. Mike Ashley will remain on the Frasers Group board after stepping down as chief executive ""The board believes that the significant increase in value of the shares to be achieved before Michael's share option award vests is suitably challenging but achievable and would be evidence of the success of the group's elevation strategy and Michael's leading role in this,"" the company said. Mr Murray has been working for the group for several years, but his role at the company raised eyebrows after reports about him being paid millions of pounds in consultancy fees. Mr Ashley was previously executive deputy chairman of the retail group - which changed its name from Sports Direct International to Frasers Group two years ago - until 2016, when long-serving chief executive Dave Forsey resigned. Mr Ashley, 56, has been one of the High Street's most prominent and colourful figures since founding his business.

"Butcher Chris George says young people ""don't want to do it"" A shortage of UK workers is hitting supermarket shelves in Wales. Avara Foods, which employs 350 at its turkey processing plant in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, said a combination of Covid and Brexit meant many of its EU national workers had returned home. Logistics UK has said there are90,000 HGV driver vacancies in the UKand a family butcher has warned there are no young people to replace those retiring. The UK government said it was working to attract UK domestic workers. Earlier this week, the IHS Markit/CIPS Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for August hit a six-month low, prompting a warning staff and supply shortages havetaken their toll on the UK's economic recovery. Avara Foods, which supply major retailers across the UK and restaurants, said EU nationals once made up half of its workforce because of a shortage of UK workers. McDonald's runs out of milkshakes Nando's shuts restaurants as it runs short of supplies Restaurant temporarily closes because of 'staff shortage' Jim Roberts from the company said: ""The UK labour simply wasn't there, so we would supplement it with non-UK workers that were either already in the country or traveling from overseas."" He said the company was now looking for workers but not finding them. Logistics UK has said there are 90,000 HGV driver vacancies in the UK Usually, the company would be getting about 80 job applications a month, but now they are getting between 20 and 30, he said. ""It looks to us like it's primarily Brexit-related although probably not in isolation - Covid undoubtedly has played a part, but it's certainly not Covid on its own. ""We track who is absent because of Covid on a daily basis and the numbers are very, very low. It looks much more like it's a reduced labour pool and that's primarily caused by non-UK workers returning back home."" Avara wants the seasonal workers scheme to be extended to help with the Christmas rush. Mr Roberts said they needed staff for ""a number of skilled roles, particularly butchery"". A third-generation family butchers may seem a world away from a processing plant with hundreds of staff but the pressures are the same. Chris George says butchery takes years of training Chris George's grandfather took over WJ George butchers in Talgarth in Powys from his uncle. In recent years they have had up to six skilled butchers working there but now there are just two. ""As people have retired there's been nobody coming behind to replace them, so as they reach retirement age there's just no youngsters coming forward to take over the sort of skills you need for butchery,"" he said. ""And how serious is that shortage of skills? Quite serious really. ""You can't just put anybody in to do it, it takes years of practice to get it right."" There are calls to add butchers to the UK's shortage occupation list He said young people were not interested in butchery: ""They just don't want to do it,"" he said. ""It's not a hospitable place to work, it's not glamorous, it just doesn't appeal to a lot of young - I think a lot actually just like to be in front of a keyboard and just push buttons and it's more appealing."" CK Stores has 31 stores across Wales. Speaking from its distribution centre in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, company owner Chris Chris Kiley said: ""We have got a lot of shortages going on. ""There is no one product, there is no range of products, its just across the board ""I think its the driver shortage that's the biggest problem."" Andy Richardson who chairs the Welsh Government Food and Drink Board, agreed: ""We can't deny that there may be some manufacturers issues but the biggest issue is haulage. ""The lack of drivers because EU citizens went back home and because of problems at HGV testing centres during Covid lockdowns. ""We call upon government to look at all the possible short-term solutions as well as long-term strategic issues of driver shortages which have been highlighted by industry to government for months."" At Avara, Mr Roberts said there were ""oversights"" that can be easily corrected to ease the situation. ""Theshortage occupation list,externaldoesn't currently include skilled roles that are necessary in food production, so butchers and HGV drivers could easily join an archaeologist, web designers and nurses [who are] on that list."" He also called for theseasonal workers scheme,externalto include the Christmas season, saying: ""Again that's an oversight that could be quickly corrected."" The UK government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: ""In 2021 and beyond, food and farming businesses will continue to be able to rely on EU nationals living in the UK with settled or pre-settled status. ""We are working with other departments to encourage and support the sector to attract UK domestic workers though offering training, careers options, wage increases and to invest in increased automation technology.""

"From cabin to cab: Aaron Leventhal found it much easier to get a job driving a lorry than previously A former pilot who had to give up his job when his airline collapsed has said getting a HGV job closer to home has been a lot easier this time round. Aaron Leventhal said the UK was ""desperate for drivers"" and pay has increased significantly since he previously drove lorries. Shortages of drivers have created major problems for shops and restaurants across the UK. The pandemic, changes after Brexit and paperwork delays have all been blamed. Mr Leventhal, who lives in Swansea, is a former Flybe pilot who returned to the HGV industry after the airline collapsed at the start of the pandemic. He said being made redundant left him ""high and dry"" but as he worked during his pilot training, his HGV licences were all up to date. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? Act now to end lorry driver crisis, government told McDonald's restaurants run out of milkshakes He said some Flybe colleagues have gone to work in supermarkets as the demand for pilots is not there. Since the driver shortage emerged he has been able to get a job near his home in Swansea. The father-of-one said he has seen pay rates for agency drivers in his licence category go from Â£9 per hour a year ago to up to Â£30 an hour - plus an extra Â£5 an hour to pay for a driver's hotel room. Food companies are desperate to get drivers like him, Mr Leventhal says He has a dangerous goods licence which enables him to transport fuel - a section of the industry which traditionally paid more. He said, however, many are moving over to transporting food, as the demand and pay rates are much higher. ""They are desperate to get drivers and they will pay more,"" he said. ""I can't see it coming down too much because it's kind of a trap. I've had emails coming through in the last six months paying up to Â£30-an-hour."" Brexit has meant it is not worth it for European drivers to come in and out of the UK The Road Haulage Association estimates there is a shortage of more than 100,000 drivers in the UK, out of a pre-pandemic total of about 600,000. That number included tens of thousands of drivers from EU member states who were living and working in the UK. Even before Covid, the estimated shortage was about 60,000 drivers, according to surveys of its members. Bernard Davies has run haulage firm ATB Davies in Carmarthen since 1973 and the 76-year-old currently employs 16 drivers - but could do with more. He said: ""There is a shortage and it is very serious because there's nobody coming through the system. ""We've had to increase pay by 10% to 12% - we've been to the customers and they have agreed to give us a rate increase to cover that. ""People are desperate - they are all desperate to get drivers to get their goods delivered."" He said Brexit and the cost of getting the licences is to blame. This video can not be played Scrapping theory tests could cut HGV driver shortage, says lorry driving instructor ""If you want a Class 1 now and you've got to do a Class 2 first and you're looking at Â£3,500. ""Before Brexit I could recruit a lot more easily. Increasing the hours isn't going to solve anything - we need more drivers."" He said a HGV driver now is earning Â£40,000 a year, up from about Â£28,000 to Â£30,000 five years ago. ""But somebody's got pay for it and it's going to be the public,"" he said. ""If you're going to the shop it's going to cost you a bit more. I don't think it's going to come out of the profits of the supermarket people."" Analysis by BBC Wales political reporter Adrian Browne There was already a shortage of HGV drivers before Brexit and coronavirus. Freight firms and retailers estimate 25,000 EU drivers returned home during the pandemic and at the end of the Brexit transition period, when freedom of movement between the continent and UK ceased. And Covid-19 put driver training and testing for new lorry drivers on hold for 12 months. There have been warnings about fruit and vegetable deliveries because of driver shortages UK ministers are refusing to grant temporary work visas to EU drivers. They insist the British people voted in a referendum and a general election to end free movement. UK firms, ministers say, should no longer rely on labour from abroad and must invest in the workforce at home instead. Read more about the shortage here The UK government has slightly relaxed the daily driving limit from nine hours to 11 hours twice a week. Haulage companies want a change in the rules to make it easier for drivers from abroad to get temporary visas to work here. But the UK government argues progress is already being made in testing and hiring, and it says a big push is being made towards improving pay, working conditions and diversity. And ministers have said employers should invest in British workers. Luke Vernon's licence was removed after he was injured in a crash but he said trying to get through to the DVLA is ""like a puzzle"" Luke Vernon, from Ceredigion, said growing up he always dreamed of being a lorry driver - just like his father. After 24 years in the industry, a car crash has meant he has been off work since last February. He said medical examinations revealed it was not an ongoing problem but it had been a ""puzzle"" trying to get his licence back. He said some people had left the industry because of companies ""treating drivers like children by constantly tracking them"", but the pay had a lot to do with it too. Brexit has made this worse because a lot of the European drivers went home, he added. ""Before this companies didn't have an issue recruiting drivers because they could pay low wages and always find employees but now this pool of employees has gone they are having to pay more."" He said lower-end drivers earn around Â£10 per hour with higher-end ones taking home up to Â£17 per hour. ""I really do enjoy it. I've never been that bothered about money because I'm single and live alone but I've been all over Europe."" A Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency spokesperson said: ""By law, all drivers must meet the medical standards for fitness to drive at all times when driving. ""We are prioritising HGV provisional licence applications which are being issued in around two weeks, and HGV licence applications which are currently being issued in around four weeks. ""More complex transactions, for example if medical investigations are needed as part of a driving licence application, may face longer delays. ""There are delays in processing paper applications due to ongoing industrial action and social distancing requirements, which means that we have fewer staff than usual on site.""

"Lisa Shaw was a presenter on BBC Radio Newcastle until her death in May A radio presenter died due to complications from the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, a coroner has found. Lisa Shaw, who worked for BBC Radio Newcastle,died at the age of 44 in Mayafter developing headaches a week after getting her first dose of the vaccine. Newcastle coroner Karen Dilks heard Ms Shaw suffered blood clots in the brain which ultimately led to her death. The inquest heard the condition linked to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was very rare. The coroner said: ""Lisa died due to complications of an AstraZeneca Covid vaccination."" Ms Dilks said Ms Shaw was previously fit and well but concluded that it was ""clearly established"" that her death was due to a very rare ""vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia"", a condition which leads to swelling and bleeding of the brain. Ms Shaw, a mother of one from Consett, received her first dose of the vaccine on 29 April. On 13 May she was taken by ambulance to University Hospital of North Durham after having a headache for several days. Covid vaccines and rare clots - what do we know? How effective is the vaccine, and do I need a booster? In a statement, Dr John Holmes who treated her said she complained of having a ""severe headache shooting and stabbing"" across her forehead and behind her eyes. Tests were carried out and blood clots were found in her brain, prompting her to be moved to the neurology specialist unit at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI). The clots are considered extremely rare - there have been417 reported cases and 72 deaths,external- after 24.8 million first doses and 23.9 million second doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK. Dr Christopher Johnson, a consultant in anaesthetics and intensive care at the RVI, said Ms Shaw had been conscious for several days and had been treated for the clots with drugs which seemed to be successful. But on the evening of 16 May Ms Shaw said the headaches were worse and she had difficulty speaking. Scans showed she had suffered a haemorrhage in the brain and after her condition deteriorated, part of her skull was removed to try and relieve the pressure inside her head. Her condition continued to worsen and despite more surgery and treatments, she died on 21 May. This video can not be played Gareth Eveâs wife, BBC Newcastle presenter Lisa Shaw, died in hospital after a bleed on the brain Dr Johnson said doctors were in a daily conference with a national panel about vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, the condition Ms Shaw was believed to be suffering from. Asked if he would have changed the treatments given to Ms Shaw, he said: ""No."" Dr Johnson said The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) published guidelines on how to treat the condition in July which matched the treatment Ms Shaw received. ""Lisa got all the treatments that were recommended in the order they were recommended,"" he said. ""If we had the same presentation tomorrow we would do the same thing."" Dr Tuomo Polvikoski, a consultant neuro-pathologist who examined Ms Shaw after her death, said given her history of being fit and healthy with no medical problems, it was ""surprising"" she died of blood clots and bleeding in the brain. He said ""timewise"" it ""seems most likely"" her death was ""indeed vaccine induced"". Ms Dilks said the condition was ""very rare"" but agreed with Dr Polvikoski's findings. After the hearing, Ms Shaw's family said in a statement: ""This is another difficult day in what has been a devastating time for us. ""The death of our beloved Lisa has left a terrible void in our family and in our lives. ""She truly was the most wonderful wife, mum, daughter, sister and friend."" The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's chief safety officer, Dr Alison Cave, said it would be ""reviewing"" the coroner's verdict. ""The benefits of the Covid-19 vaccine AstraZeneca continue to outweigh the risks for most people,"" she said. ""It is therefore still vitally important that people come forward for their vaccination and for their second dose when invited to do so.""

"GPs in Scotland are warning against a rush back to more face-to-face consultations with patients as part of the government'sNHS Recovery Plan.,external First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has saidthe move will be one of the ""key actions""for the next five years to reduce backlogs in healthcare. The number of GPs will also be increased by 800 to try and tackle recruitment and retention problems. However, GPs insist the hybrid system for appointments should stay for now. The Royal College of GPs in Scotland said it welcomed the government's recognition that general practice ""is going to be one of the ways out of this pandemic"". The industry body also backed the announcement of increased investment to help in-person consultations eventually return to pre-Covid levels. But it said a major shift back to face-to-face appointments should only be made when it is safe to do so. David Shackles, joint chair of the Royal College of GPs in Scotland, told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that face-to-face consulting remained ""something that GPs and patients value"". He said: ""It was only when we had the pandemic that there was this increased need for remote consulting. ""The model has served us very well throughout the pandemic. ""General practice is still open for face-to-face consultations when clinically necessary, and we see the likelihood of increasing face-to-face consultations as it becomes safe to do that. But we have got to make sure it is safe."" Thousands of patients have had video call consultations with their GP since the start of the pandemic Dr Shackles pointed to the continued rise in Covid cases - with positives tests hitting a record high of 5,021 on Wednesday - as the main reason to be cautious. He said ""With case numbers and hospitalisations rising, we've got to make sure that our vulnerable patients who do attend the surgery are not at risk of Covid because we are increasing the footfall too much."" Nicola Sturgeon has insisted that, overall, the recovery plan will both reform the NHS and increase its capacity. Its key actions will include: Raising primary care investment by 25%, supporting GPs, community pharmacists, dentists and optometrists Â£8m to support the mental health and wellbeing of the health and care workforce 1,000 more mental health link workers in communities and 800 more GPs and Â£130m to deliver a National Cancer Plan and Detect Cancer Early Programme Opposition parties have described it as ""thin and flimsy"". The Conservatives said it contained ""a litany of recycled pledges and oversights"", while Scottish Labour said it was ""as underwhelming as it was overdue"". However, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said it set out a series of benefits for under-pressure healthcare workers. He told Good Morning Scotland: ""They are right to raise concerns because staff, of course, have had the most difficult 18 months possible. ""They are, quite frankly, knackered. ""So that is why we are going to invest first and foremost in their mental health and wellbeing to make sure that what we are asking them to do, they are able to do without feeling undue pressure."" Mr Yousaf added: ""We are also increasing the number of medical graduates that we are going to take by 100 per annum. ""But we will also have to look at, and the BMA and the Royal College of GPs have made this point to me quite strongly, how we retain staff in the professions that they are currently in."" The Scottish Conservatives' health spokesman Craig Hoy said he feared the recovery plan would be ""too little, too late"". He said: ""We should be acutely aware that the Scottish NHS had a capacity problem before we went into the Covid pandemic, and that problem has undoubtedly got much worse as a result."" Mr Hoy said the 28-page document was ""very thin on content, and in many senses rows back on previous commitments"". He added: ""We would have wanted, for example, to see a real commitment to establishing Long Covid clinics. ""Clearly, that [Long Covid] is going to put stress on GPs' surgeries and this would also stop many patients presenting themselves at A&E clinics. ""There is also very little reference has to how A&E clinics are going to receive additional funding."" IMMUNITY -Should we remain worried about coronavirus?

"Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater are both MSPs and co-leaders of the Scottish Green Party The Scottish Green Party has confirmed that its co-leaders will become ministers if its deal with the Scottish government is approved. On Saturday party members are due to vote on the agreement, which would take Greens into national government for the first time anywhere in the UK. If approved, Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater will be given minister roles. Thepower-sharing agreement,externalbetween the pro-independence Scottish Greens and the SNP was announced last week. It is understood the two Green ministers would have responsibility for areas of environmental and social justice policy and would work across several different departments. What could the SNP-Green deal mean for Scotland? The co-leaders could expect to earn an extra Â£30,000 a year each on top of their MSP salaries. While they would not serve in the Scottish Cabinet, they might be invited to attend from time to time. Mr Harvie and Ms Slater's appointments are expected to be made next week by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. The new ministers would be additions to the government so SNP ministers would not lose their jobs to make way for them. Greens say going into government for the first time is about maximising their influence, getting as much of their manifesto delivered as possible. They know that does not come cost free. Some of their principles will come under pressure like never before. If this deal is approved, Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater will become part of a government that remains committed to building new roads and has not set a date for ending oil and gas extraction. But if the deal is rejected, Greens may lose the chance to shift more transport spending towards rail and cycling, set rent controls in social housing and expand renewable energy production. Party members have to decide if the deal includes enough Green clout to offset the compromises that come with sharing power. The party's co-leaders stress their flexibility to criticise the SNP in policy areas outside their agreement but they may also be obliged to defend government decisions they do not like. Following her party's confirmation of the ministerial proposals, Lorna Slater said it was time for Scotland ""to step up efforts to decarbonise our economy and invest in a greener, independent future"". She added: ""The co-operation agreement we've negotiated would put Greens at the heart of decision-making at this crucial time and if our members endorse it then I look forward to driving change in government."" Patrick Harvie said if party members backed the plan, ""they can be assured that we'll waste no time getting to work to deliver on their transformative agenda"". He said: ""With Greens in government we would be able to deliver positive change like tackling Scotland's emissions, protecting nature, advancing tenants' rights, bringing forward overdue equalities legislation and delivering an independence referendum."" The Scottish Greens are keen to tackle Scotland's emissions The Scottish Conservatives' Covid recovery spokesman Murdo Fraser accused Nicola Sturgeon of looking to appoint ""extremists"" who ""don't believe in economic growth...and who actively want to limit Scotland's economy"". He said: ""Neither Patrick Harvie or Lorna Slater should be anywhere near key financial decisions that will impact jobs and businesses. ""Their growing influence is a danger to our oil and gas industry and the 100,000 jobs it supports. The Greens seek to undermine the future of the North Sea sector at every turn, and Nicola Sturgeon is giving them a bigger platform to do that."" The Greens have signed up to the bulk of the government's policy - but there will also be areas where they are in disagreement with the SNP, and they will be able to criticise it on those points. These excluded areas include aviation policy, international relations, policy on fee-paying schools, fox hunting and Nato membership if Scotland becomes independent. The co-operation agreement says the two parties will work together to provide ""effective and responsible leadership for Scotland for this session of the Scottish Parliament, in the interests of Scotland, of the people who live in Scotland, and of future generations"". It says they will secure a referendum on Scottish independence ""within the current parliamentary session on a specific date to be determined by the Scottish Parliament"". They have also committed to holding a referendum on Scottish independence within the next five years, and preferably by the end of 2023.

"The Swedish band are one of the biggest pop acts of all time. Pop group Abba have teased a major announcement for next week, as fans await their first new music in 39 years. The Swedish band launched a new website on Thursday morning titled ""Abba Voyage"", asking fans to register interest in a new project. It is expected to be a long-gestating ""hologram tour"" that Abba initially announced in 2016. The band are also expected to release five new songs to accompany the show. Allow Twitter content?

According to The Sun, the show will involve ""Abba-tars"" of the stars performing hits like Waterloo, Dancing Queen and Mamma Mia. It said the holograms will be beamed onstage in a purpose-built east London theatre, where fans will also be able to see a documentary-style film on the band's comeback. Speaking to the BBC during the early stages of the show's production, Ulvaeus said the idea had been presented to the band by Spice Girls manager Simon Fuller. ""He came to Stockholm and he presented this idea to us that we could make identical digital copies of ourselves of a certain age and that those copies could then go on tour and they could sing our songs, you know, and lip sync.

But their joint project completely eclipsed their previous work. After winning the Eurovision Song Contest with Waterloo in 1974, the band sold almost 400 million singles and albums around the world. Mamma Mia!, the musical based on their hits and produced by Ulvaeus and Andersson, has also been seen by more than 50 million people. During their most successful period, the band survived marriage break-ups between Ulvaeus and Faltskog, and Lyngstad and Andersson, but they finally called it a day in 1983. Their final recording sessions, in 1982, produced the hits Under Attack and The Day Before You Came, which featured on the compilation album The Singles. Their last public performance came three years later, on the Swedish version of TV show This Is Your Life, which honoured their manager Stig Anderson.

"The prime minister lives in a flat above 11 Downing Street Conservative party accounts reveal a Tory donor provided almost Â£53,000 towards the cost of Boris Johnson's Downing Street flat refurbishment. Figures confirm Lord Brownlow reimbursed the party for a ""bridging loan"" it initially provided for some of the works. The costs were then settled by the prime minister, but it sparked a row over ministerial conduct. A report by the standards' adviser said the PM had acted ""unwisely"". Downing St flat: PM cleared but 'acted unwisely' What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? What are the rules governing political donations? Details published clarify the extent of the Conservative peer's financial involvement in the renovations which are thought to have cost up to Â£200,000. Conservative Party accounts show its central office provided a ""bridging loan"" of Â£52,802 to cover the works after being invoiced by the Cabinet Office in June last year. The party was ""reimbursed in full"" by Lord Brownlow in October, before Mr Johnson ""settled the costs"" incurred by the Conservative peer in March. A Conservative spokesman said: ""As stated, the party provided a short-term bridging loan that was reimbursed to the party in full."" Prime ministers receive an annual public grant of Â£30,000 to spend on their Downing Street living quarters, which are publicly-owned. But a Cabinet Office report in July said more than Â£28,000 was spent on painting and sanding floorboards alone. And invoices for works, including services of interior designer Lulu Lytle, pushed the total costs significantly beyond the limit of public funding. Mr Johnson's former chief adviser Dominic Cummingsclaimed the prime minister had planned to solve this shortfall by having donors ""secretly pay"" for the work. In May, an investigation by the prime minister's adviser on standards, Lord Geidt, cleared Mr Johnson of misconduct although it found he should have been more ""rigorous"" in finding out how the costs were covered. Lord Geidt is the PM's standards adviser While the report found Lord Brownlow had paid an invoice for some of the costs, it did not say how much he had put up to fund the refurbishment. Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said questions are hanging over so-called ""flatgate"".

The government said Mr Edwards, currently the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner, would ""go beyond the regulator's traditional role"". The job would now be ""balanced"" between protecting rights and promoting ""innovation and economic growth"". Mr Edwards has been named as the government's preferred candidate, and said it is a ""great honour"". ""I look forward to the challenge of steering the organisation and the British economy into a position of international leadership in the safe and trusted use of data for the benefit of all,"" he said. His predecessor, current Commissioner Elizabeth Denham, said Mr Edwards ""will take on a role that has never been more important or more relevant to people's lives."" The government's shake-up of the Information Commissioner's Office was announced alongside planned changes to data protection post-Brexit. In an interview with The Telegraph newspaper, Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said the plans include getting rid of ""endless"" cookie pop-ups which are common on most large sites, asking for permission to store a user's personal information. This is widely marketed as a tool for compliance with EU data law the GDPR, although the practice pre-dates it. He told the newspaper that ""high risk"" sites would still need similar notices, but that many of them are ""pointless"". And he said reform of data protection rules is ""one of the big prizes of leaving"" the EU. ""There's an awful lot of needless bureaucracy and box ticking and actually we should be looking at how we can focus on protecting people's privacy but in as light a touch way as possible,"" he said. This video can not be played WATCH: What is GDPR? The proposed reforms extend to all sorts of data. In the official announcement, the government said it will prioritise making new ""data adequacy"" partnerships that will allow it to send people's personal data internationally, to places such as the United States, Korea, Singapore, Dubai and Colombia, among others. Data adequacy in this sense means an agreement that the protections in place are similar in two countries, with the idea of ensuring that personal information remains safe. It is a key part of EU regulations and was a minor sticking point in the Brexit negotiations. EU approves data flow to UK but adds sunset clause No-deal Brexit - the data dilemma The UK currently has a data adequacy agreement with the EU, though it needs to be renewed in future and could change if the law in the UK diverges too far from EU rules. Other details remain light, with the government promising to launch a consultation on what future data laws will look like. The government said that as much as Â£11bn of trade ""goes unrealised around the world due to barriers associated with data transfers"". ""Now that we have left the EU I'm determined to seize the opportunity by developing a world-leading data policy that will deliver a Brexit dividend for individuals and businesses across the UK,"" Mr Dowden said. ""It means reforming our own data laws so that they're based on common sense, not box-ticking."" Andrew Dyson, a data protection expert at law firm DLA Piper, said these announcements amounted to the ""first evidence"" of ""a bold new regulatory landscape for digital Britain post-Brexit"". ""It will be interesting to see the further announcements that are sure to follow on reforms to the wider policy landscape that are just hinted at here,"" he said. This is a big moment in the evolution of the UK's data protection policies. As New Zealand's Privacy Commissioner, John Edwards showed he was anything but timid in taking on the tech giants. After the Christchurch massacre, he described Facebook ""as morally bankrupt pathological liars who enable genocide (Myanmar), [and] facilitate foreign undermining of democratic institutions"" - in a tweet he later deleted. The current commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, has been criticised by some privacy campaigners for not being robust enough in protecting data rights. But it looks as though the government wants her replacement to be even more cautious. Mr Edwards ""will be empowered to go beyond the regulator's traditional role of focusing only on protecting data rights, with a clear mandate to take a balanced approach that promotes further innovation and economic growth."" That looks like a clear signal that the interests of those businesses complaining about the burden of what they regard as excessive data regulations will be given a hearing. Oliver Dowden's told the Daily Telegraph that EU rules on cookies - which, by the way, predate the GDPR data laws - could be the first target of the new slimmed down approach to regulation. With many web users frustrated by the constant need to click ""accept"" on cookie banners every time they visit a new site, this could prove a popular move. But data protection specialists warn that it's easy to generate  headlines about a bonfire of regulations, much harder to frame new laws diverging from what applies across the English Channel. And the tech companies themselves may complain about EU data laws - but may see this as just adding another layer of complexity to their global policies, rather than a big opportunity.

"The prime minister lives in a flat above 11 Downing Street Conservative party accounts reveal a Tory donor provided almost Â£53,000 towards the cost of Boris Johnson's Downing Street flat refurbishment. Figures confirm Lord Brownlow reimbursed the party for a ""bridging loan"" it initially provided for some of the works. The costs were then settled by the prime minister, but it sparked a row over ministerial conduct. A report by the standards' adviser said the PM had acted ""unwisely"". Downing St flat: PM cleared but 'acted unwisely' What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? What are the rules governing political donations? Details published clarify the extent of the Conservative peer's financial involvement in the renovations which are thought to have cost up to Â£200,000. Conservative Party accounts show its central office provided a ""bridging loan"" of Â£52,802 to cover the works after being invoiced by the Cabinet Office in June last year. The party was ""reimbursed in full"" by Lord Brownlow in October, before Mr Johnson ""settled the costs"" incurred by the Conservative peer in March. A Conservative spokesman said: ""As stated, the party provided a short-term bridging loan that was reimbursed to the party in full."" Prime ministers receive an annual public grant of Â£30,000 to spend on their Downing Street living quarters, which are publicly-owned. But a Cabinet Office report in July said more than Â£28,000 was spent on painting and sanding floorboards alone. And invoices for works, including services of interior designer Lulu Lytle, pushed the total costs significantly beyond the limit of public funding. Mr Johnson's former chief adviser Dominic Cummingsclaimed the prime minister had planned to solve this shortfall by having donors ""secretly pay"" for the work. In May, an investigation by the prime minister's adviser on standards, Lord Geidt, cleared Mr Johnson of misconduct although it found he should have been more ""rigorous"" in finding out how the costs were covered. Lord Geidt is the PM's standards adviser While the report found Lord Brownlow had paid an invoice for some of the costs, it did not say how much he had put up to fund the refurbishment. Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said questions are hanging over so-called ""flatgate"".

Deep DasguptaFormer India wicketkeeper on BBC Test Match Special The most important thing for India is to not look at the scoreboard. Just come out and bat as long as possible. Michael VaughanFormer England captain on BBC Test Match Special What has happened to India from Lord's to Headingley? They have arrived and played like a really poor cricket team, which they're not. England batter Haseeb Hameed on Sky Sports:""Yesterday was pretty much a perfect day and today we were able to build on that. We are very happy going in to tomorrow. ""There's so much you can learn as a young player from Joe Root. He's of the highest class but for me, what stands out is the simplicity of his game. He plays like he has so much time, he's so diligent and also mentally, to turn up and perform in every innings shows how hungry he is. ""That first innings at Lord's is a bit of a blur now! But I'm very happy to contribute here. I felt a lot more comfortable opening the batting so to go on and get a 50 plus score was really nice. ""It was important for Rory and myself to just bat and not think too much about the wicket. You can overthink it when you've just seen a team get all out for 78 so we just went out there and played with good intent."" Michael VaughanFormer England captain on BBC Test Match Special The best teams in the world adapt. This India team are a good team but can't be up their with the best unless they're willing to try things differently. Deep DasguptaFormer India wicketkeeper on BBC Test Match Special India haven't bowled that well in the Test. Bumrah was good, Shami in spells, but they didn't get enough support. England also lost Moeen Ali and Sam Curran after Joe Root was dismissed. Curran did share 35 with Craig Overton though, as England look their lead comfortably over 300. They eventually finished on 423-8, a lead of 345. Michael VaughanFormer England captain on BBC Test Match Special I like the substance of Malan at three and the experience of Bairstow at five, which could be replaced by Ben Stokes. I think Buttler is a concern, he doesn't seem to have the rhythm for Test cricket. In between the wickets of Dawid Malan and Joe Root England also lost Jonny Bairstow, who made 29 in quick time, and Jos Buttler for seven. Alison MitchellCommentator on BBC Test Special Just think of the debate we were having a few years ago about Joe Root's conversion rate. It was something which was tormenting even him. Michael VaughanFormer England captain on BBC Test Match Special Two perfect days of Test cricket. Burns and Hameed played nicely, set the foundation and made sure England didn't lose wickets. Dawid Malan looked settled, looks like he knows his game and has confidence in his ability. Then the skipper once again. You know from the time Joe Root got to about six that he would get to 100. He's playing so well and knows his game so well. At the other end Joe Root was once again superb in making 121. It was his sixth century of the year - pulling him level with Michael Vaughan and Denis Compton for Test centuries for England in a calendar year. It was another animated celebration from Root, and he was embraced by good friend Jonny Bairstow. Dawid Malan and Joe Root then put on 139 for the third wicket. Malan, playing his first Test for two years, made 70, before getting a thin edge down the leg side. As usual, he was particularly strong through the off side. England resumed this morning on 120-0, after bowling out India 78 on day one. It was slow going with India's bowling, particularly that of Jasprit Bumrah's, being much better. Mohammed Shami got Rory Burns in the first hour, before Ravindra Jadeja got Haseeb Hameed. Ebony Rainford-BrentFormer England batter on BBC Test Match Special England dominated day one by a country mile. The question was whether they could back it up on day two? They have. Make sure you stick with us for the next 25 minutes or so as we bring you all the best reaction and clips from the second day at Headingley. Here's the final wicket to fall today, that of Sam Curran.

"There have been 38,281 new Covid cases and a further 140 deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported across the UK NHS organisations in England have been told to prepare for a possible extension of the vaccine rollout to all 12 to 15-year-olds Prof Devi Sridhar, of the University of Edinburgh, says children should be vaccinated as the Delta variant is ""flying through schools"" But Prof Russell Viner of Sage says there should be caution and ""we would be vaccinating teenagers largely to protect adults"" Covid rates in England are higher among 10 to 19-year-olds than any other age group, with 616.5 cases per 100,000 people BBC Radio Newcastle presenter Lisa Shaw died due to complications from the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, a coroner finds India has given more than 600 million vaccine doses - with the most recent 100 million jabs administered in just 19 days Japan suspends use of about 1.63 million doses of Moderna jab due to contamination Edited by James Clarke That's all from our coronavirus live coverage today. We'll be back with more updates tomorrow. Today's pandemic news has been brought to you by Becky Morton, Doug Faulkner, Hamish Mackay and James Clarke. A health worker speaks to people waiting in line at a Covid-19 vaccination centre in Melbourne as authorities try to bring the virus under control in Australia We're about to close up for the day but if you are just joining us here is a reminder of what has been happening today.  Research is to be carried out into how long immunity lasts after a coronavirus vaccine. with scientists hoping this could help with the design of future jabs. Some Â£1.5 million is being invested in understanding why some people get Covid-19 despite being jabbed or having had the virus before, while others do not. Health Secretary Sajid Javid says the new research will ""help us gain valuable insights"", while public health leader Dr Susan Hopkins says the findings will be ""essential"" in concluding who is most at risk post-jab and for vaccine developers in designing boosters. Research earlier this week concluded the protection provided by two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccines starts to wane within six months. One reasonable worst-case scenario suggests protection could fall to below 50% for the elderly and healthcare workers by winter. Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent School pupils in Northern Irelandwill not have to self-isolate after coming into contact with a coronavirus case if they have recently tested positive for the virus themselves. New guidance, issued by the Public Health Agency (PHA) ahead of the school term, says as long as a pupil is well they can stay in school but must avoid visiting care homes and hospitals. Staff who are close contacts of a coronavirus case can keep working in school if they are fully vaccinated. However, unvaccinated staff have to self-isolate for 10 days. The PHA guidance for schools states: ""Pupils who are close contacts but have already had a positive test result in the previous 90 days and have no new symptoms do not need to arrange a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test or self-isolate. ""This is because it is possible for PCR tests to remain positive for some time after COVID-19 infection due to residual virus fragments (which are not infectious)."" Covid case rates in Wales have climbed tonumbers not seen since January. However, Public Health Wales figures show deaths and hospital admissions remain much lower, thanks to the vaccine rollout. Rising cases were anticipated with restrictions easing and more mixing. Case rates are currently above the ""most likely scenario"" modelled by scientists but the impact on hospitals remains within calculations. The Wales case rate has now risen to 334.1 cases per 100,000. One further death was also reported, bringing the average over the past seven days to 1.1 deaths a day. At this stage during the second wave there was an average of 23 deaths per day. Rhoda OdhiamboBBC health reporter, Nairobi Kenya says the main Covid-19 vaccine to be used in rural areas will be the one manufactured by Johnson & Johnson. Chairperson of the country's vaccine taskforce, Dr Willis Akhwale, says hospitals in these areas do not have the infrastructure to store the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, which require specialist equipment, such as very cold freezers. When properly stored, the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine can last up to two
years and can be easily distributed in hard-to-reach areas where vaccination rates
are still low. Dr Willis tells the BBC the AstraZeneca vaccine will also be
used in hospitals in rural and urbans areas. Of Kenya's 50 million population, 2.5 million people have so far received at least one jab. Of these, close to 800,000 are fully vaccinated. Yulia Putintseva complained of a mice infestation in the hotel room where she was quarantining A two-week bio-secure bubble is set to replace hotel quarantine at next year's Australian Open, tournament bosses say. At this year's Grand Slam in February, players spent 14 days in hotel rooms with limited training time, because of the country's strict Covid rules. The restrictions drew complaints from players, with some forced to isolate in their rooms for the duration. Tennis Australia chief Craig Tiley says the bubble will allow players ""to move freely between the hotel and courts"". While some players were allowed up to five hours training time on closed courts at the 2021 competition, 72 who had been in contact with positive cases on flights to Australia had to isolate entirely in their rooms. Read more. There have been 38,281 new Covid cases and a further 140 deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported across the UK, according tothe latest government figures,external. That is up from 36,572 and 113 deaths for the same day a week ago. A further 68,076 first vaccine doses have been given as well as another 161,705 second jabs. Lochaber High School in Fort William is among sites affected A third of all schools in the Scottish Highlands havebeen affected by Covid, the area's council says. Grantown, Kingussie, Culloden and Fort William's Lochaber secondary schools have ""a significant number of year groups self-isolating"". Aviemore Primary School and Thurso's Pennyland Primary are closed to some pupils, while Kincraig's Alvie primary is requiring a one-day closure. Highland Council says the region has seen an ""exponential increase"" in cases. There are 203 schools in the Highland Council region. On Wednesday, NHS Highland warned of a ""large number of outbreaks"" of Covid in schools in its area, which includes Argyll and Bute. The health board says there have been more than 1,000 new cases in the local population in the past week - representing almost 10% of all cases in the region since the start of the pandemic. As we heard earlier, the number of people testing positive for coronavirus in England is continuing rise. Prof Tim Spector, who runs the Zoe Covid study, says the UK now has the highest Covid rates in Europe, despite the success of its vaccine rollout. ""The main difference between the UK and Europe is
our lack of restrictions. In many parts of Europe, people are still wearing
face coverings and observing some social distancing,"" the professor of genetic epidemiology
at King's College London says. ""In the UK, where we eagerly declared 'freedom' from
Covid and did away with even the most basic social measures, Covid has found an
opportunity to spread."" He adds that with schools returning ""there's a good chance cases will continue to rise from here"". We are expecting an update to the UK's travel lists later today. The lists are updated every three weeks by ministers, based on advice fromthe Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC),external, which looks at the Covid situation in each country. Last time the categories were updatedthe quarantine rules for fully-vaccinated travellers from France were dropped while Mexico was added to the red list. Other changes included India, Qatar and the UAE moving from red to amber while Germany, Austria and Norway were among those to move to green. Here is a reminder of which countries are currently in each category. Pupils will be returning to the classroom across England, Wales and Northern Ireland in September, while in Scotland the new term has already started. Many restrictions have been lifted but some safety measures will remain in place, including asking pupils to take tests before they return. For schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, social distancing measures and rules around ""bubbles"", where pupils stay in a fixed group, have been relaxed. But in Scotland, all staff must stay at least 1m (3ft) from pupils and colleagues when on school premises until the end of September. Face coverings will initially be required in classrooms in Scotland and Northern Ireland but they will no longer be routinely advised in England and Wales. You can read more about what the new school term will look like in different parts of the UK here. A campaign on radio, social and digital media to reassure parents and pupils it is safe to return to school in England has been launched by the government. Science experiments, sport, music and drama are back on the timetable, while distancing rules, ""bubble"" groups and staggered starts have been axed. All secondary pupils are also being urged to get tested either at school or in the community, before term starts. But the Association of School and College Leaders says there are still concerns about the possible impact of Covid spreading among pupils, who are largely unvaccinated. Attendance fell off dramatically towards the end of the summer term, as Covid cases were rising in the younger population. Read more. Covid case rates are rising in all regions of England, except London and Yorkshire and the Humber, according to the latest data from Public Health England. South-west England has seen the highest rate with 481.7 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 22 August, up sharply from 351.8 the week before. The East Midlands has the second highest rate at 360.9, up from 351.5. London has the lowest rate with 247.3, down from 277.6. Rates in England are also continuing to rise in most age groups, PHE says, with the exceptions of children aged four and under, and adults aged between 20 and 39. The highest rate is among 10 to 19-year-olds, with 616.5 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 22 August, up sharply week-on-week from 472.5. The lowest rate is among people aged 80 and over, at 95.2, up slightly from 90.1. Over the past few weeks, Chinese sources have been amplifying a baseless claim that Covid-19 was made in the US.

BBC Radio 5 Live Supply chain issues, in part due to a shortage of lorry drivers, are affecting businesses across the UK. One problem is that the pandemic has halted HGV driver training and testing for more than 12 months, according to the trade association Logistics UK. And the Road Haulage Association adds that, alongside Brexit, this has led to the current shortfall of around 100,000 HGV drivers. Trainee driver Hayley O'Beirnes has been speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live about the hurdles she has faced to get into the industry ""Any normal person would have thrown in the towel by now, what should have just taken a few months has taken nearly a year,"" she says. Ms O'Beirnes - who starting training in February - says she has always wanted to be an arctic lorry driver, but delays and rising prices of training have stopped her from completing her training. ""I couldn't afford the Â£3,000, which is the average cost of doing training up front, I was forced to find a company that did finance.""

Namibia is currently experiencing its third wave of the pandemic, which has exposed its insufficient health infrastructure. The Welsh government is also giving a further Â£500,000 grant for oxygen equipment and nurse training. But Welsh Tory health spokesman Russell George is warning that the decision will ""raise some eyebrows"" as the African nation is ""often accused of being besieged by corruption"". Thornwell Primary School in Chepstow runs sessions to teach children about healthy lifestyles Disadvantaged pupils in Wales ate less fruit and vegetables, did less exercise and had more takeaways during lockdown school closures, research suggests. Most pupils stayed home from March to June 2020 and again at the start of 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Academics from Swansea University say school structure can have a big impact on a child's diet, as children prepare to return to the classroom. Researchers asked eight to 11-year-olds in Welsh primary schools to do an online survey about their health and wellbeing during the first lockdown period, from April to June 2020. They found there were overall improvements in aspects of children's wellbeing, such as sleep and happiness with family, compared with similar surveys in the previous two years. However, children receiving free school meals ate fewer fruit and vegetables, while more disadvantaged children also reported a reduction in physical activity. Read more of the findingshere.

"Lisa Shaw was a presenter on BBC Radio Newcastle until her death in May A radio presenter died due to complications from the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, a coroner has found. Lisa Shaw, who worked for BBC Radio Newcastle,died at the age of 44 in Mayafter developing headaches a week after getting her first dose of the vaccine. Newcastle coroner Karen Dilks heard Ms Shaw suffered blood clots in the brain which ultimately led to her death. The inquest heard the condition linked to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was very rare. The coroner said: ""Lisa died due to complications of an AstraZeneca Covid vaccination."" Ms Dilks said Ms Shaw was previously fit and well but concluded that it was ""clearly established"" that her death was due to a very rare ""vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia"", a condition which leads to swelling and bleeding of the brain. Ms Shaw, a mother of one from Consett, received her first dose of the vaccine on 29 April. On 13 May she was taken by ambulance to University Hospital of North Durham after having a headache for several days. Covid vaccines and rare clots - what do we know? How effective is the vaccine, and do I need a booster? In a statement, Dr John Holmes who treated her said she complained of having a ""severe headache shooting and stabbing"" across her forehead and behind her eyes. Tests were carried out and blood clots were found in her brain, prompting her to be moved to the neurology specialist unit at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI). The clots are considered extremely rare - there have been417 reported cases and 72 deaths,external- after 24.8 million first doses and 23.9 million second doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK. Dr Christopher Johnson, a consultant in anaesthetics and intensive care at the RVI, said Ms Shaw had been conscious for several days and had been treated for the clots with drugs which seemed to be successful. But on the evening of 16 May Ms Shaw said the headaches were worse and she had difficulty speaking. Scans showed she had suffered a haemorrhage in the brain and after her condition deteriorated, part of her skull was removed to try and relieve the pressure inside her head. Her condition continued to worsen and despite more surgery and treatments, she died on 21 May. This video can not be played Gareth Eveâs wife, BBC Newcastle presenter Lisa Shaw, died in hospital after a bleed on the brain Dr Johnson said doctors were in a daily conference with a national panel about vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, the condition Ms Shaw was believed to be suffering from. Asked if he would have changed the treatments given to Ms Shaw, he said: ""No."" Dr Johnson said The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) published guidelines on how to treat the condition in July which matched the treatment Ms Shaw received. ""Lisa got all the treatments that were recommended in the order they were recommended,"" he said. ""If we had the same presentation tomorrow we would do the same thing."" Dr Tuomo Polvikoski, a consultant neuro-pathologist who examined Ms Shaw after her death, said given her history of being fit and healthy with no medical problems, it was ""surprising"" she died of blood clots and bleeding in the brain. He said ""timewise"" it ""seems most likely"" her death was ""indeed vaccine induced"". Ms Dilks said the condition was ""very rare"" but agreed with Dr Polvikoski's findings.

"Lisa Shaw was a presenter on BBC Radio Newcastle until her death in May A radio presenter died due to complications from the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, a coroner has found. Lisa Shaw, who worked for BBC Radio Newcastle,died at the age of 44 in Mayafter developing headaches a week after getting her first dose of the vaccine. Newcastle coroner Karen Dilks heard Ms Shaw suffered blood clots in the brain which ultimately led to her death. The inquest heard the condition linked to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was very rare. The coroner said: ""Lisa died due to complications of an AstraZeneca Covid vaccination."" Ms Dilks said Ms Shaw was previously fit and well but concluded that it was ""clearly established"" that her death was due to a very rare ""vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia"", a condition which leads to swelling and bleeding of the brain. Ms Shaw, a mother of one from Consett, received her first dose of the vaccine on 29 April. On 13 May she was taken by ambulance to University Hospital of North Durham after having a headache for several days. Covid vaccines and rare clots - what do we know? How effective is the vaccine, and do I need a booster? In a statement, Dr John Holmes who treated her said she complained of having a ""severe headache shooting and stabbing"" across her forehead and behind her eyes. Tests were carried out and blood clots were found in her brain, prompting her to be moved to the neurology specialist unit at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI). The clots are considered extremely rare - there have been417 reported cases and 72 deaths,external- after 24.8 million first doses and 23.9 million second doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK. Dr Christopher Johnson, a consultant in anaesthetics and intensive care at the RVI, said Ms Shaw had been conscious for several days and had been treated for the clots with drugs which seemed to be successful. But on the evening of 16 May Ms Shaw said the headaches were worse and she had difficulty speaking. Scans showed she had suffered a haemorrhage in the brain and after her condition deteriorated, part of her skull was removed to try and relieve the pressure inside her head. Her condition continued to worsen and despite more surgery and treatments, she died on 21 May. This video can not be played Gareth Eveâs wife, BBC Newcastle presenter Lisa Shaw, died in hospital after a bleed on the brain Dr Johnson said doctors were in a daily conference with a national panel about vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, the condition Ms Shaw was believed to be suffering from. Asked if he would have changed the treatments given to Ms Shaw, he said: ""No."" Dr Johnson said The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) published guidelines on how to treat the condition in July which matched the treatment Ms Shaw received. ""Lisa got all the treatments that were recommended in the order they were recommended,"" he said. ""If we had the same presentation tomorrow we would do the same thing."" Dr Tuomo Polvikoski, a consultant neuro-pathologist who examined Ms Shaw after her death, said given her history of being fit and healthy with no medical problems, it was ""surprising"" she died of blood clots and bleeding in the brain. He said ""timewise"" it ""seems most likely"" her death was ""indeed vaccine induced"". Ms Dilks said the condition was ""very rare"" but agreed with Dr Polvikoski's findings. After the hearing, Ms Shaw's family said in a statement: ""This is another difficult day in what has been a devastating time for us. ""The death of our beloved Lisa has left a terrible void in our family and in our lives. ""She truly was the most wonderful wife, mum, daughter, sister and friend.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson wants to see a âjobs-led recoveryâ with wage rises ârather than through taxation of other peopleâ Two Conservative MPs have written to Boris Johnson, urging him not to press on with plans to cut universal credit payments from October. Peter Aldous and John Stevenson said the Â£20-per-week increase, brought in as a response to the pandemic, should be made permanent. The letter comes amid warnings from two charities that cutting the top-up will push millions of families into debt. But ministers have said the increase was only ever a temporary measure. Labour sets out plan to overhaul universal credit Â£20 universal credit top-up always temporary - Sunak When will the Â£20 universal credit boost stop? And Boris Johnson said that the key focus for the government was on coming out of the pandemic with ""a jobs-led recovery"", saying he was proud to see the living wage had risen. ""I'm very pleased to see the way the unemployment numbers have been falling, employment numbers have been rising and also wages have been rising,"" the prime minister said. He added: ""My strong preference is for people to see their wages rise through their efforts rather than through taxation of other people put into their pay packets, rather than welfare."" In the letter, the MPs, who represent constituencies in Suffolk and Carlisle and not so-called ""red wall"" former Labour strongholds, said they did ""not take this step lightly"". But they told the prime minister they had ""very serious concerns"" about the ability of low income families to make ends meet if the top-up is removed. And they said they were ""alarmed to see the government unwilling to heed the widespread warnings that are coming from all quarters"" about the impact on living standards. The letter read: ""Our central promise at the last election, that you articulated so well, was to level up. ""Infrastructure is a crucial part of this agenda, but with the emphasis solely on eye-catching projects we are at risk of forgetting the importance of investment in people in these communities, without whom this vision cannot be realised."" They told Mr Johnson that the majority of people impacted by the cut ""are in fact already in work"" and  ""low paid, hardworking families will see up to Â£1,040 slashed from their income"". The Â£20-a-week boost is ""one of our best legacies from the pandemic"" and the investment must continue, they added. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Aldous said the feedback he is getting in his constituency is ""that this is going to cause an awful lot of problems to a lot of people, both in work and looking for work"". He said that over the past 10 years, universal credit had ""not had the funding that it needed"" and there was ""an element of catch up"" that the extra Â£20-a-week was helping to address. The MPs fear the impact of the cut on ""hardworking families"" The MPs' intervention comes amid increased warnings from campaigners as the change looms. The charity Citizens Advice has warned that a third of people on universal credit, or at least 2.3 million people, will end up in debt when the extra payment is removed in October. It said the average shortfall for people would be between Â£51 and Â£55 a month. Its chief executive, Dame Clare Moriarty, said: ""A cut to universal credit this autumn will be a hammer blow to millions of people. ""It undermines our chance of a more equal recovery by tipping families into the red and taking money from the communities most in need. ""The government must listen to the growing consensus that it should reverse course and keep this vital lifeline."" In a separate breakdown of the figures, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which campaigns against poverty, said a third of working age families would be affected in more than 400 constituencies across Britain. Deputy director of policy at the charity, Katie Schmuecker, said with warnings coming from all sides, ""now is the time for all MPs to step up and oppose this cut to their constituents' living standards"". She added: ""Plunging low-income families into deeper poverty and debt as well as sucking billions of pounds out of local economies is no way to level up. ""It's not too late for the prime minister and chancellor to listen to the huge opposition to this damaging cut and change course."" Speaking on the Today programme, one universal credit claimant, Karen, said the extra Â£20 a week had meant ""everything"" to her. She went on to the benefit after being unable to return to work after a car accident, and has had notification that her payment will revert to the old rate after her September instalment. She said: ""I've found everything is so much more expensive now especially with lots of shortages in the shops. ""You can't make a choice and budget like you used to be able to do. ""Everything still has to be paid, the electricity bill still has to be paid."" The universal credit uplift was designed to be a temporary measure to help people through the pandemic. And the number of people on the benefit has doubled over the course of the crisis - so the extra money costs a lot at a time when the Treasury is trying to bring spending under control. But charities and opposition parties argue removing the extra Â£20 a week will have a devastating impact on individuals and families already struggling to make ends meet. There was a debate in government over ending the uplift - the Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey argued for it to stay. And several Conservatives are nervous about the impending change - with this letter a sign of how unhappy some backbenchers are. The question is whether more will speak out in the coming weeks, and how much pressure they will put on No 10 and 11 to have a rethink. Labour also criticised the cut, saying it would hit the lowest paid hardest and damage the country's economic recovery. Shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said: ""Time is running out for the Conservatives to see sense, back struggling families and cancel their cut to universal credit. ""Labour would maintain the uplift until we can replace universal credit with a fairer social security system."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said the uplift was only meant as a temporary measure Speaking in July, Chancellor Rishi Sunak confirmed the uplift would be scrapped ""as it was always intended to be a temporary measure"". He said like the furlough scheme, the top-up was part of the policies put in place to deal with the crisis and would have to come to an end. And he said ministers thought the best approach going forward to support people was to ""help them into work and make sure those jobs are well paid"". A government spokesman said: ""The temporary uplift to universal credit was designed to help claimants through the economic shock and financial disruption of the toughest stages of the pandemic, and it has done so. ""Universal credit will continue to provide a vital safety net and with record vacancies available, alongside the successful vaccination rollout, it's right that we now focus on our Plan for Jobs, helping claimants to increase their earnings by boosting their skills and getting into work, progressing in work or increasing their hours.""

"This video can not be played Johnson: ""We always knew this was a moment where there were going to be particular vulnerabilities to terrorism"" The UK will continue its operation to evacuate people from Afghanistan despite the ""despicable"" attack at the capital's airport, Boris Johnson says. Speaking after an emergency meeting, the PM pledged the UK would be working ""flat out"" until ""the last moment"". But he also acknowledged the push was nearing its conclusion, with hours remaining. Two explosions hit Kabul airporton Thursday, killing some 90 people - among them 13 US military personnel. At least 150 people were also wounded in the attack, which the so-called Islamic State group say it was behind. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said there had been ""no reported UK military or UK government casualties"". Figures released by the MoD on Thursday night showed 13,146 individuals had been flown out by the UK so far. Live: US braces for further attacks after Kabul bombing Explosion outside Kabul airport Kabul airport attack: What do we know? In an address on Thursday night,President Joe Biden also promised to carry onwith the evacuation, which is due to end on 31 August. He said the US would ""not forgive"" and ""not forget"" the attack, telling the perpetrators: ""We will hunt you down and make you pay."" US commanders have said they are on alert for more attacks by so-called Islamic State, including possible rockets or vehicle-borne bombs targeting Kabul airport. By Damian Grammaticas,BBC political correspondent In the aftermath of the suicide bombings at the airport, the pace of the emergency airlift from Afghanistan has slowed but it has not halted. The BBC understands that people who'd already been allowed inside the airport perimeter have continued to be processed, to be boarded on to departing planes. But sources said the numbers arriving to be processed had decreased considerably as the Taliban were turning back many Afghans, particularly those who did not hold foreign passports or visas. Boris Johnson said the UK was ""coming towards the very end"" of its operation and suggested ""the overwhelming majority of those eligible"" had now been flown out. But there remain many clamouring not to be left behind, including interpreters who had worked for the British military, security guards from the UK embassy, Afghan soldiers trained by British forces, those who worked with international organisations and academics. Thursday's twin blasts took place outside the Abbey Gate - where US and British forces have been stationed to help with evacuations - and at a nearby hotel,following warnings there could be terrorist incidents in the area. Speaking after chairing an emergency Cobra meeting, the PM described the blasts - reportedly carried out by suicide bombers - as ""barbaric"". He said: ""I want to stress that this threat of a terrorist attack is one of the constraints that we've been operating under... in the big extraction that's been going on, and we've been ready for it, we've been prepared for it. ""And I want to stress that we're going to continue with that operation - and we're now coming towards the end of it, to the very end of it, in any event. ""But, clearly, what this attack shows is the importance of continuing that work in as fast and as efficient a manner as possible in the hours that remain to us, and that's what we're going to do."" The total number of casualties remains unconfirmed Continuing, Mr Johnson said the Foreign Office, Home Office and Border Force teams were ""going to work flat out"" to get people through ""as fast as they can"". He added: ""We're going to keep going up until the last moment."" The US has set the deadline of the end of the month for the withdrawal of its troops, with President Biden rejecting calls from Mr Johnson and other allies for an extension. In the past 12 hours, some countries including Canada, Germany and Australia have announced that they have ended their evacuation operations. Charity worker Pen Farthing targeted in airport attack UK's Kabul evacuation going at 'significant pace' Tired and scared, Afghans start new lives in the UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has offered condolences to the families of the civilians who were killed or injured, saying the US troops who were killed and harmed ""paid the ultimate sacrifice while helping others reach safety"". ""The UK and US remain resolute in our mission to get as many people out as possible. It is testament to the remarkable courage of our personnel that they continue to do so while under fire,"" he said. A statement from the MoD said: ""Our primary concern remains the safety of our personnel, British citizens and the citizens of Afghanistan. We are in close contact with our US and other NATO allies at an operational level on the immediate response to this incident."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called the attack ""devastating"", and said his thoughts were with ""all those killed and wounded, serving personnel supporting the evacuations and all those desperately trying to leave"". He added: ""The bravery of the troops at the airport will always outweigh the cowardice of those who wish to harm us."" This video can not be played Earlier, Boris Johnson said the UK had rescued the ""overwhelming majority"" of people to whom it owes a debt Kabul airport iscurrently being defended and run by the US, which has 5,800 troops on the ground - with the help of more than 1,000 UK troops. Armed Forces minister James Heappey declined to give a date for the last UK evacuation flights, but said it was likely that UK and other foreign troops would have to leave before the last American airlifts. However, Mr Johnson has insisted the US deadline will not mark the end of the UK's efforts to help people wishing to flee the Taliban-controlled country. He said on Thursday that the current airlifts were just the ""first phase"". ""Even beyond the US deadline of 31 of this month, we hope to be able to continue to say to people, well you can come out,"" he said.

"Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said he favours ""light touch"" regulation The UK's new Information Commissioner will be charged with a post-Brexit ""shake up"" of data rules, including getting rid of cookie pop-ups. John Edwards has been named the next head of data regulator the ICO. The government said Mr Edwards, currently the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner, would ""go beyond the regulator's traditional role"". The job would now be ""balanced"" between protecting rights and promoting ""innovation and economic growth"". Mr Edwards has been named as the government's preferred candidate, and said it is a ""great honour"". ""I look forward to the challenge of steering the organisation and the British economy into a position of international leadership in the safe and trusted use of data for the benefit of all,"" he said. His predecessor, current Commissioner Elizabeth Denham, said Mr Edwards ""will take on a role that has never been more important or more relevant to people's lives."" The government's shake-up of the Information Commissioner's Office was announced alongside planned changes to data protection post-Brexit. In an interview with The Telegraph newspaper, Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said the plans include getting rid of ""endless"" cookie pop-ups which are common on most large sites, asking for permission to store a user's personal information. This is widely marketed as a tool for compliance with EU data law the GDPR, although the practice pre-dates it. He told the newspaper that ""high risk"" sites would still need similar notices, but that many of them are ""pointless"". And he said reform of data protection rules is ""one of the big prizes of leaving"" the EU. ""There's an awful lot of needless bureaucracy and box ticking and actually we should be looking at how we can focus on protecting people's privacy but in as light a touch way as possible,"" he said. This video can not be played WATCH: What is GDPR? The proposed reforms extend to all sorts of data. In the official announcement, the government said it will prioritise making new ""data adequacy"" partnerships that will allow it to send people's personal data internationally, to places such as the United States, Korea, Singapore, Dubai and Colombia, among others. Data adequacy in this sense means an agreement that the protections in place are similar in two countries, with the idea of ensuring that personal information remains safe. It is a key part of EU regulations and was a minor sticking point in the Brexit negotiations. EU approves data flow to UK but adds sunset clause No-deal Brexit - the data dilemma The UK currently has a data adequacy agreement with the EU, though it needs to be renewed in future and could change if the law in the UK diverges too far from EU rules. Other details remain light, with the government promising to launch a consultation on what future data laws will look like. The government said that as much as Â£11bn of trade ""goes unrealised around the world due to barriers associated with data transfers"". ""Now that we have left the EU I'm determined to seize the opportunity by developing a world-leading data policy that will deliver a Brexit dividend for individuals and businesses across the UK,"" Mr Dowden said. ""It means reforming our own data laws so that they're based on common sense, not box-ticking."" Andrew Dyson, a data protection expert at law firm DLA Piper, said these announcements amounted to the ""first evidence"" of ""a bold new regulatory landscape for digital Britain post-Brexit"". ""It will be interesting to see the further announcements that are sure to follow on reforms to the wider policy landscape that are just hinted at here,"" he said. This is a big moment in the evolution of the UK's data protection policies. As New Zealand's Privacy Commissioner, John Edwards showed he was anything but timid in taking on the tech giants. After the Christchurch massacre, he described Facebook ""as morally bankrupt pathological liars who enable genocide (Myanmar), [and] facilitate foreign undermining of democratic institutions"" - in a tweet he later deleted. The current commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, has been criticised by some privacy campaigners for not being robust enough in protecting data rights. But it looks as though the government wants her replacement to be even more cautious. Mr Edwards ""will be empowered to go beyond the regulator's traditional role of focusing only on protecting data rights, with a clear mandate to take a balanced approach that promotes further innovation and economic growth."" That looks like a clear signal that the interests of those businesses complaining about the burden of what they regard as excessive data regulations will be given a hearing. Oliver Dowden's told the Daily Telegraph that EU rules on cookies - which, by the way, predate the GDPR data laws - could be the first target of the new slimmed down approach to regulation. With many web users frustrated by the constant need to click ""accept"" on cookie banners every time they visit a new site, this could prove a popular move. But data protection specialists warn that it's easy to generate  headlines about a bonfire of regulations, much harder to frame new laws diverging from what applies across the English Channel. And the tech companies themselves may complain about EU data laws - but may see this as just adding another layer of complexity to their global policies, rather than a big opportunity.

"The actress is reprising her role as the sharp-witted technological genius Shuri in the Black Panther sequel Actress Letitia Wright was treated in hospital after an accident on the set of the upcoming Black Panther sequel. The star, who plays Shuri, Princess of Wakanda, received minor injuries in what was described as a ""stunt rig accident"". The film shoot was happening overnight in Boston, separate to the main production in Atlanta. Although the nature of her injuries was not disclosed, the actress was released from hospital after several hours. The incident is not expected to have an impact on the shooting schedule for the superhero sequel. Wright is one of several stars returning in the film, titled Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, alongside Daniel Kaluuya, Danai Gurira, Lupita Nyong'o and Angela Bassett. Plot details are being kept under wraps, but the movie is expected to continue the story of the technologically-advanced African nation of Wakanda after the death of King T'Challa, who was played by the late actor Chadwick Boseman. Film studio Marvel has confirmed that Boseman's role will not be recast, and they will not use digital effects to include his likeness in the film. Boseman will not be replaced in Black Panther 2 Why Chadwick Boseman meant so much to black fans It was recently announced that British star Michaela Coel - who created and starred in I May Destroy You - would join the cast in an unknown role. Additionally, Dominique Thorne, who will play the up-and-coming superhero Ironheart in a forthcoming Disney Plus TV series, will make her Marvel debut in the Black Panther film.

"Rifka Meyer was finally granted a religious divorce last year Rifka Meyer was 32 when she entered into a religious marriage. Two-and-a-half years later, she became what is known among orthodox Jews as a ""chained wife"" - trapped in a religious marriage with a man who refused to let her have a divorce. ""You feel hopeless and you feel very alone,"" she tells BBC Newsnight. ""You feel like you're screaming and not being heard."" It would take her nearly 10 years to get a religious divorce. But more than 100 women from the Charedi Jewish community remain trapped in religious marriages in the UK, according to Labour Peer Jonathan Mendelsohn, who is part of a cross-party parliamentary group that formed to help them. ""The thing that has shocked me [is] that I alone have been contacted by people since I raised this issue,"" he says. ""Tens of cases, tens of cases, including a number of people in the Jewish community in which I live."" Under orthodox Jewish law, the husband must grant his wife a document called a ""get"" in Hebrew. Without this, worshippers believe she remains married to him even if they are legally divorced. The women stuck in these religious marriages are known as Agunot, or ""chained wives"". Ms Meyer says it meant she was not permitted to have another partner. ""You're stuck. I can't even think of meeting anyone, or dating or moving my life forward because I am stuck in this corner without a view and I just can't go anywhere from there,"" she says. ""There's not enough communication and support to help you through it. You feel very desperate and very alone. It's a very lonely journey to go through."" Ms Meyer, who lives in London, finally received her get last year. She now runs a charity called GETT Out to help women who are in the same situation. The woman is forbidden from getting married again as it is considered adultery She is also not allowed to have children with anybody else. If she does, the child is labelled a ""mamzer"" or an estranged person If the man is seen as being pressured into giving the get, the Jewish Court - called the Beth Din - rules the divorce invalid An amendment to the statutory guidance under the Domestic Abuse Act now says that withholding a get can be a form of domestic abuse. If it is deemed controlling or coercive behaviour, the man could be charged and, if found guilty, imprisoned. Ministers hope the change will give women more power to complain to the authorities about their former partners for not granting a religious divorce. But the Federation of Synagogues, a group representing orthodox Jews, says any get ""given under duress, whether due to physical threats, financial threats or the threat of imprisonment, is absolutely invalid"" under Jewish law. ""The couple would remain married to one another, notwithstanding the granting of a get,"" it said in a letter. The federation added that any woman using the provisions of the Domestic Abuse Act will have ""tied... the hands"" of the Jewish court, as ""clearly the husband in such a situation will be acting under duress"". Eli Spitzer, a headteacher who is part of the orthodox Jewish community in London, says some rabbis believe that women seeking help under the legislation ""would start a process which is then irreversible"". ""The husband is no longer in a position to grant a divorce or to give the divorce to his wife out of free will because obviously he faces prosecution, and therefore what the rabbis are saying [is] this has undermined what a Jewish divorce is all about, that it has to be given out of free will,"" he says. But Lord Mendelsohn, who is Jewish, believes there is no clash between religious and non-religious law, and questions the motives of the rabbis who say there is. ""They've chosen to create a conflict where none really exists. And I don't know why that is, I suspect [it] is because they feel they're losing control of parts of the process,"" he says. ""But in any situation where a religious minority exists in a democracy, you have to balance these things... I think they really have to get a grip of the situation and come to realise that this is Britain, this is Britain in 2021."" Some worshippers have told Newsnight they believe the Torah did not intend for women to feel stuck in unhappy marriages. But there is concern among some in the orthodox community that secularism is overriding religion, wiping away centuries of deep-rooted tradition and law practised by millions. Ms Meyer says that while the amendment to the guidance under the Domestic Abuse Act helps women, it is necessary to ""work with the rabbis as well"". ""The women feel desperate and they'll take whatever they can get in order to achieve their get,"" she says. ""It's a lifetime of these women being stuck in a marriage that's dead.""

"Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said he favours ""light touch"" regulation The UK's new Information Commissioner will be charged with a post-Brexit ""shake up"" of data rules, including getting rid of cookie pop-ups. John Edwards has been named the next head of data regulator the ICO. The government said Mr Edwards, currently the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner, would ""go beyond the regulator's traditional role"". The job would now be ""balanced"" between protecting rights and promoting ""innovation and economic growth"". Mr Edwards has been named as the government's preferred candidate, and said it is a ""great honour"". ""I look forward to the challenge of steering the organisation and the British economy into a position of international leadership in the safe and trusted use of data for the benefit of all,"" he said. His predecessor, current Commissioner Elizabeth Denham, said Mr Edwards ""will take on a role that has never been more important or more relevant to people's lives."" The government's shake-up of the Information Commissioner's Office was announced alongside planned changes to data protection post-Brexit. In an interview with The Telegraph newspaper, Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said the plans include getting rid of ""endless"" cookie pop-ups which are common on most large sites, asking for permission to store a user's personal information. This is widely marketed as a tool for compliance with EU data law the GDPR, although the practice pre-dates it. He told the newspaper that ""high risk"" sites would still need similar notices, but that many of them are ""pointless"". And he said reform of data protection rules is ""one of the big prizes of leaving"" the EU. ""There's an awful lot of needless bureaucracy and box ticking and actually we should be looking at how we can focus on protecting people's privacy but in as light a touch way as possible,"" he said. This video can not be played WATCH: What is GDPR? The proposed reforms extend to all sorts of data. In the official announcement, the government said it will prioritise making new ""data adequacy"" partnerships that will allow it to send people's personal data internationally, to places such as the United States, Korea, Singapore, Dubai and Colombia, among others. Data adequacy in this sense means an agreement that the protections in place are similar in two countries, with the idea of ensuring that personal information remains safe. It is a key part of EU regulations and was a minor sticking point in the Brexit negotiations. EU approves data flow to UK but adds sunset clause No-deal Brexit - the data dilemma The UK currently has a data adequacy agreement with the EU, though it needs to be renewed in future and could change if the law in the UK diverges too far from EU rules. Other details remain light, with the government promising to launch a consultation on what future data laws will look like. The government said that as much as Â£11bn of trade ""goes unrealised around the world due to barriers associated with data transfers"". ""Now that we have left the EU I'm determined to seize the opportunity by developing a world-leading data policy that will deliver a Brexit dividend for individuals and businesses across the UK,"" Mr Dowden said. ""It means reforming our own data laws so that they're based on common sense, not box-ticking."" Andrew Dyson, a data protection expert at law firm DLA Piper, said these announcements amounted to the ""first evidence"" of ""a bold new regulatory landscape for digital Britain post-Brexit"". ""It will be interesting to see the further announcements that are sure to follow on reforms to the wider policy landscape that are just hinted at here,"" he said. This is a big moment in the evolution of the UK's data protection policies. As New Zealand's Privacy Commissioner, John Edwards showed he was anything but timid in taking on the tech giants. After the Christchurch massacre, he described Facebook ""as morally bankrupt pathological liars who enable genocide (Myanmar), [and] facilitate foreign undermining of democratic institutions"" - in a tweet he later deleted. The current commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, has been criticised by some privacy campaigners for not being robust enough in protecting data rights. But it looks as though the government wants her replacement to be even more cautious. Mr Edwards ""will be empowered to go beyond the regulator's traditional role of focusing only on protecting data rights, with a clear mandate to take a balanced approach that promotes further innovation and economic growth."" That looks like a clear signal that the interests of those businesses complaining about the burden of what they regard as excessive data regulations will be given a hearing. Oliver Dowden's told the Daily Telegraph that EU rules on cookies - which, by the way, predate the GDPR data laws - could be the first target of the new slimmed down approach to regulation. With many web users frustrated by the constant need to click ""accept"" on cookie banners every time they visit a new site, this could prove a popular move. But data protection specialists warn that it's easy to generate  headlines about a bonfire of regulations, much harder to frame new laws diverging from what applies across the English Channel. And the tech companies themselves may complain about EU data laws - but may see this as just adding another layer of complexity to their global policies, rather than a big opportunity.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson wants to see a âjobs-led recoveryâ with wage rises ârather than through taxation of other peopleâ Two Conservative MPs have written to Boris Johnson, urging him not to press on with plans to cut universal credit payments from October. Peter Aldous and John Stevenson said the Â£20-per-week increase, brought in as a response to the pandemic, should be made permanent. The letter comes amid warnings from two charities that cutting the top-up will push millions of families into debt. But ministers have said the increase was only ever a temporary measure. Labour sets out plan to overhaul universal credit Â£20 universal credit top-up always temporary - Sunak When will the Â£20 universal credit boost stop? And Boris Johnson said that the key focus for the government was on coming out of the pandemic with ""a jobs-led recovery"", saying he was proud to see the living wage had risen. ""I'm very pleased to see the way the unemployment numbers have been falling, employment numbers have been rising and also wages have been rising,"" the prime minister said. He added: ""My strong preference is for people to see their wages rise through their efforts rather than through taxation of other people put into their pay packets, rather than welfare."" In the letter, the MPs, who represent constituencies in Suffolk and Carlisle and not so-called ""red wall"" former Labour strongholds, said they did ""not take this step lightly"". But they told the prime minister they had ""very serious concerns"" about the ability of low income families to make ends meet if the top-up is removed. And they said they were ""alarmed to see the government unwilling to heed the widespread warnings that are coming from all quarters"" about the impact on living standards. The letter read: ""Our central promise at the last election, that you articulated so well, was to level up. ""Infrastructure is a crucial part of this agenda, but with the emphasis solely on eye-catching projects we are at risk of forgetting the importance of investment in people in these communities, without whom this vision cannot be realised."" They told Mr Johnson that the majority of people impacted by the cut ""are in fact already in work"" and  ""low paid, hardworking families will see up to Â£1,040 slashed from their income"". The Â£20-a-week boost is ""one of our best legacies from the pandemic"" and the investment must continue, they added. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Aldous said the feedback he is getting in his constituency is ""that this is going to cause an awful lot of problems to a lot of people, both in work and looking for work"". He said that over the past 10 years, universal credit had ""not had the funding that it needed"" and there was ""an element of catch up"" that the extra Â£20-a-week was helping to address. The MPs fear the impact of the cut on ""hardworking families"" The MPs' intervention comes amid increased warnings from campaigners as the change looms. The charity Citizens Advice has warned that a third of people on universal credit, or at least 2.3 million people, will end up in debt when the extra payment is removed in October. It said the average shortfall for people would be between Â£51 and Â£55 a month. Its chief executive, Dame Clare Moriarty, said: ""A cut to universal credit this autumn will be a hammer blow to millions of people. ""It undermines our chance of a more equal recovery by tipping families into the red and taking money from the communities most in need. ""The government must listen to the growing consensus that it should reverse course and keep this vital lifeline."" In a separate breakdown of the figures, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which campaigns against poverty, said a third of working age families would be affected in more than 400 constituencies across Britain. Deputy director of policy at the charity, Katie Schmuecker, said with warnings coming from all sides, ""now is the time for all MPs to step up and oppose this cut to their constituents' living standards"". She added: ""Plunging low-income families into deeper poverty and debt as well as sucking billions of pounds out of local economies is no way to level up. ""It's not too late for the prime minister and chancellor to listen to the huge opposition to this damaging cut and change course."" Speaking on the Today programme, one universal credit claimant, Karen, said the extra Â£20 a week had meant ""everything"" to her. She went on to the benefit after being unable to return to work after a car accident, and has had notification that her payment will revert to the old rate after her September instalment. She said: ""I've found everything is so much more expensive now especially with lots of shortages in the shops. ""You can't make a choice and budget like you used to be able to do. ""Everything still has to be paid, the electricity bill still has to be paid."" The universal credit uplift was designed to be a temporary measure to help people through the pandemic. And the number of people on the benefit has doubled over the course of the crisis - so the extra money costs a lot at a time when the Treasury is trying to bring spending under control. But charities and opposition parties argue removing the extra Â£20 a week will have a devastating impact on individuals and families already struggling to make ends meet. There was a debate in government over ending the uplift - the Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey argued for it to stay. And several Conservatives are nervous about the impending change - with this letter a sign of how unhappy some backbenchers are. The question is whether more will speak out in the coming weeks, and how much pressure they will put on No 10 and 11 to have a rethink. Labour also criticised the cut, saying it would hit the lowest paid hardest and damage the country's economic recovery. Shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said: ""Time is running out for the Conservatives to see sense, back struggling families and cancel their cut to universal credit. ""Labour would maintain the uplift until we can replace universal credit with a fairer social security system."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said the uplift was only meant as a temporary measure Speaking in July, Chancellor Rishi Sunak confirmed the uplift would be scrapped ""as it was always intended to be a temporary measure"". He said like the furlough scheme, the top-up was part of the policies put in place to deal with the crisis and would have to come to an end. And he said ministers thought the best approach going forward to support people was to ""help them into work and make sure those jobs are well paid"". A government spokesman said: ""The temporary uplift to universal credit was designed to help claimants through the economic shock and financial disruption of the toughest stages of the pandemic, and it has done so. ""Universal credit will continue to provide a vital safety net and with record vacancies available, alongside the successful vaccination rollout, it's right that we now focus on our Plan for Jobs, helping claimants to increase their earnings by boosting their skills and getting into work, progressing in work or increasing their hours.""

"The actress is reprising her role as the sharp-witted technological genius Shuri in the Black Panther sequel Actress Letitia Wright was treated in hospital after an accident on the set of the upcoming Black Panther sequel. The star, who plays Shuri, Princess of Wakanda, received minor injuries in what was described as a ""stunt rig accident"". The film shoot was happening overnight in Boston, separate to the main production in Atlanta. Although the nature of her injuries was not disclosed, the actress was released from hospital after several hours. The incident is not expected to have an impact on the shooting schedule for the superhero sequel. Wright is one of several stars returning in the film, titled Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, alongside Daniel Kaluuya, Danai Gurira, Lupita Nyong'o and Angela Bassett. Plot details are being kept under wraps, but the movie is expected to continue the story of the technologically-advanced African nation of Wakanda after the death of King T'Challa, who was played by the late actor Chadwick Boseman. Film studio Marvel has confirmed that Boseman's role will not be recast, and they will not use digital effects to include his likeness in the film. Boseman will not be replaced in Black Panther 2 Why Chadwick Boseman meant so much to black fans It was recently announced that British star Michaela Coel - who created and starred in I May Destroy You - would join the cast in an unknown role. Additionally, Dominique Thorne, who will play the up-and-coming superhero Ironheart in a forthcoming Disney Plus TV series, will make her Marvel debut in the Black Panther film. Production on the sequel began in June, with Ryan Coogler back in the director's chair.

"GPs in Scotland are warning against a rush back to more face-to-face consultations with patients as part of the government'sNHS Recovery Plan.,external First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has saidthe move will be one of the ""key actions""for the next five years to reduce backlogs in healthcare. The number of GPs will also be increased by 800 to try and tackle recruitment and retention problems. However, GPs insist the hybrid system for appointments should stay for now. The Royal College of GPs in Scotland said it welcomed the government's recognition that general practice ""is going to be one of the ways out of this pandemic"". The industry body also backed the announcement of increased investment to help in-person consultations eventually return to pre-Covid levels. But it said a major shift back to face-to-face appointments should only be made when it is safe to do so. David Shackles, joint chair of the Royal College of GPs in Scotland, told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that face-to-face consulting remained ""something that GPs and patients value"". He said: ""It was only when we had the pandemic that there was this increased need for remote consulting. ""The model has served us very well throughout the pandemic. ""General practice is still open for face-to-face consultations when clinically necessary, and we see the likelihood of increasing face-to-face consultations as it becomes safe to do that. But we have got to make sure it is safe."" Thousands of patients have had video call consultations with their GP since the start of the pandemic Dr Shackles pointed to the continued rise in Covid cases - with positives tests hitting a record high of 5,021 on Wednesday - as the main reason to be cautious. He said ""With case numbers and hospitalisations rising, we've got to make sure that our vulnerable patients who do attend the surgery are not at risk of Covid because we are increasing the footfall too much."" Nicola Sturgeon has insisted that, overall, the recovery plan will both reform the NHS and increase its capacity. Its key actions will include: Raising primary care investment by 25%, supporting GPs, community pharmacists, dentists and optometrists Â£8m to support the mental health and wellbeing of the health and care workforce 1,000 more mental health link workers in communities and 800 more GPs and Â£130m to deliver a National Cancer Plan and Detect Cancer Early Programme Opposition parties have described it as ""thin and flimsy"". The Conservatives said it contained ""a litany of recycled pledges and oversights"", while Scottish Labour said it was ""as underwhelming as it was overdue"". However, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said it set out a series of benefits for under-pressure healthcare workers. He told Good Morning Scotland: ""They are right to raise concerns because staff, of course, have had the most difficult 18 months possible. ""They are, quite frankly, knackered. ""So that is why we are going to invest first and foremost in their mental health and wellbeing to make sure that what we are asking them to do, they are able to do without feeling undue pressure."" Mr Yousaf added: ""We are also increasing the number of medical graduates that we are going to take by 100 per annum. ""But we will also have to look at, and the BMA and the Royal College of GPs have made this point to me quite strongly, how we retain staff in the professions that they are currently in."" The Scottish Conservatives' health spokesman Craig Hoy said he feared the recovery plan would be ""too little, too late"". He said: ""We should be acutely aware that the Scottish NHS had a capacity problem before we went into the Covid pandemic, and that problem has undoubtedly got much worse as a result."" Mr Hoy said the 28-page document was ""very thin on content, and in many senses rows back on previous commitments"". He added: ""We would have wanted, for example, to see a real commitment to establishing Long Covid clinics. ""Clearly, that [Long Covid] is going to put stress on GPs' surgeries and this would also stop many patients presenting themselves at A&E clinics. ""There is also very little reference has to how A&E clinics are going to receive additional funding."" IMMUNITY -Should we remain worried about coronavirus?

"A company which supplies food to care homes and restaurants says it is taking ""drastic action"" to try to get round the shortage of UK lorry drivers. The boss of Country Range said the group was buying smaller vans in the face of ""significant"" problems caused by a lack of qualified HGV drivers. Managing director Coral Rose said the issue was ""going to get worse"" as schools and offices return to normal. Industry warnings about the impact ofdriver shortageshave been increasing. On Wednesday, both Tesco and Iceland said there could be some shortages on the shelves in the run up to the key Christmas trading period. Supermarket bosses warn over Christmas supplies Act now to end lorry driver crisis, government told How serious is the HGV driver shortage? A combination of Covid, Brexit and other factors has meant there are not enough drivers to meet demand. The Road Haulage Association estimates there is now a shortage of more than 100,000 drivers in the UK, out of a pre-pandemic total of about 600,000. That number included tens of thousands of drivers from EU member states who were living and working in the UK. Even before Covid, the estimated shortage was about 60,000 drivers. Country Range is a group of 12 wholesalers supplying food and non-food items to schools, care homes, hotels, restaurants and small shops. Ms Rose said the shortage of drivers had affected both the supply of products from manufacturers to its warehouses and also from its warehouses to its customers. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Rose said Country Range was ""taking drastic action such as buying smaller delivery vehicles to make sure that we don't have to have people with specific HGV licences to drive them"". There was ""going to be increased pressure as schools reopen, people continue to holiday in the UK, people return back to their offices, so staff feeding may reopen again, so the issue is going to get worse and we would like government intervention"", she added. One short-term fix the government could take would be to a temporary visa scheme ""to encourage EU workers to come back"", she said. But she wants the government to give support for people with training and apprenticeships in the longer term ""because this is not a quick fix, it's a long-term issue"". Ms Rose also said: ""There's lot of drivers who are able to drive but can't go on the road at the moment because they couldn't take their tests or refresher course and training through the last year because of Covid, so there's potential to release a lot more drivers. There could be some increased resource in that area as well and that would help."" On Wednesday, the government said there was a ""highly resilient"" food supply chain and it was taking measures to tackle the driver shortage. Labour's shadow minister for business and consumers, Seema Malhotra, said: ""The chaos hitting supply chains is of the Conservatives' making. Their failure to keep their promise to cut red tape for businesses, which are struggling with more paperwork and higher costs, combined with worker shortages, has created a perfect storm."" The government said it had ""well-established ways of working with the food sector to address food supply chain disruptions"". A spokesperson added the government had announced measures to tackle driver shortages, which included streamlining and increasing tests. ""Most of the solutions are likely to be driven by industry, with progress already being made in testing and hiring, and a big push towards improving pay, working conditions and diversity,"" they added. ""We want to see employers make long-term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad."" Sainsbury's said ""availability in some product categories may vary but alternatives are available and stores continue to receive deliveries daily"". Morrisons said it was working with suppliers to minimise shortages. It said it had ""contingency plans around Brexit in place for a number of years"". It added it was ""less concerned"" about some fresh foods because it produced them itself. However, it said the ""challenges"" had been exacerbated by summer holidays meaning fewer drivers were available. ""But there is no short-term fix for the haulage industry with drivers and vacancies increasing nationally."" Waitrose said it had been ""working through the same challenges that all supermarkets are facing right now"". It added it was focussing on ""maintaining the best possible range of products"". Iceland Foods, said: ""We are currently facing a massive shortage of HGV drivers in the UK which is impacting the food supply chain on a daily basis. We... have already seen deliveries to our stores cancelled for the first time since the pandemic began, and this is solely due to the HGV driver shortage."" The Co-op said: ""Like many retailers, we are impacted by some patchy disruption to our deliveries, logistics and store operations but we are working closely with our suppliers to get re-stocked quickly."" Tesco said ""there may be some shortages"", but people should not ""over-dramatise"" and panic-buy. ""It's very easy to make a drama out of a modest crisis."" The motor industry has already reported thatvan sales have hit near record levels in 2021as a result of a boom in home deliveries and the economy reopening. Ms Rose admitted that a firm such as Country Range buying more small delivery vans would increase the number of vehicles on the roads. ""More vehicles and more staff required to do that, it's not an ideal scenario but it's something that we're trying to do to continue to supply our customers."" She said steps were needed in order to encourage people to take up driving jobs. ""We need to make this an attractive profession and a recognised profession, not just with food service but within the whole of the UK. ""The average age of the drivers is over 55 - there isn't a lot of new blood coming into the industry because it takes time and money to train and people don't necessarily have that."" Staff shortages in the food industry are extending beyond drivers. Bolton-based Greenhalgh's Craft Bakery has a chain of shops in Greater Manchester and Lancashire, and delivers wholesale nationally. Six members of the firm's management team have been taking turns to do shifts driving the delivery vans. Boss David Smart told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""It's a bit of a perfect storm really. We are short of drivers but it isn't just drivers, we're actually short of quite a few people throughout the business from bakers to bakery operatives to shop colleagues to drivers to office staff. ""It's the August bank holiday, everybody wants to go everywhere and because we're a food service industry we try to supply all those areas. We're extremely busy. However, we are very, very busy with too few hands.""

"The Royal College of Surgeons is calling for the creation of ""Covid-light sites"" where surgery can continue Health Minister Robin Swann has apologised for lengthy hospital waiting lists in Northern Ireland. More than half of patients waiting for a first consultant appointment in Northern Ireland are still waiting longer than a year. Mr Swann told BBC News that wait times were not ""where we want them to be"". The Royal College of Surgeons has described the figures as ""devastating"" and said an urgent summit was needed to tackle the backlog. The latest figures from the Department of Health cover April to June this year. They show that 348,867 people are waiting for a first appointment - an increase of almost 14,000 on the previous quarter, and a rise of 38,946 compared with the same time last year. This video can not be played Mary Anderson says she has had no health service support while she has been on a waiting list Fifty-three percent (184,873) are waiting 52 weeks or more. In this last quarter, the healthcare system was trying to restore services as coronavirus case numbers fell, before the Delta variant took hold. More people were seen in the three months to June (82,788), compared with the previous quarter (71,404). That is more than twice as many as were seen in the same period last year (34,645). The ministerial target is that at least half of all those waiting should be seen within nine weeks. But that target was breached for 285,937 patients (82%). The picture is as bleak for the 112,915 people waiting for inpatient and day-case admission. Robin Swann says the health service has suffered from underinvestment More than 91,000 have waited longer than the ministerial target of 13 weeks and 66,287 of those have been on a list for a year or more. Mr Swann said there was a ""recognition"" in the Northern Ireland Executive that action was needed to address waiting lists. ""It's not where we want them to be - we don't want people waiting that long because it actually increases demand on our health service the longer people are waiting,"" he said. The minister said the health system needed to be better resourced and said there were plans in place to train new staff to fill vacancies. ""This is about changing the direction of the underinvestment, not just in the health service but also in our workforce, so it takes time,"" he added. Rising NHS waiting lists are now one of the main domestic policy challenges facing ministers in all of the UK's administrations. Trying to reduce backlogs of operations, caused by widespread postponements during the first and second peaks of Covid, is proving to be much tougher than expected. But with more than 460,000 patients waiting to see a consultant or waiting to start hospital treatment - nearly a quarter of the population - Northern Ireland's problems are certainly more acute than those in the rest of the UK. While Covid has made things worse, the waiting list issue in Northern Ireland goes back several years before the pandemic. Failure to follow through on successive reform plans and political stalemate at times have been cited as factors holding back the health service. Health Minister Robin Swann is well aware of the challenges and knows that radical action is needed. The question now is whether he can persuade ministerial colleagues to make difficult decisions over funding and rationalisation. Mark Taylor from the Royal College of Surgeons said that behind the statistics were ""patients waiting in pain, worry and in great distress"". ""It is heartbreaking as a clinician to tell patients that they may be waiting many more months, if not years for the treatment they need,"" he said. Mary Anderson from south Belfast has arthritis and has been referred for an operation on her ankle and a scan on her shoulder. But she said she had heard ""absolutely nothing"" about the treatments since April 2020. Ministerial targets were breached for the majority of patients ""I can't do a full shop, for example,"" she told BBC News. ""I have to sit down regularly because the pain is just so bad and I was also advised very strongly by the surgeon to be very careful because the ankle, if I went over on it, could shatter, and that would be a major problematic surgery. ""So it affects every aspect of just moving about."" Ms Anderson said there had been ""no communication"" about her treatments and explained there was ""no support for us whilst we're on the long waiting lists"". On top of the regular waiting lists, separate figures for cataract treatment show 13,306 people are waiting for a first consultant-led appointment. Diagnostic services are taking longer too. The number of people on the list for tests is 145,301, up more than 8,000 on the previous quarter (5.9%) but down slightly on the same time last year (149,403). But a third of them (48,543) are waiting longer than six months. Mark Taylor says long waiting lists are an ""ever increasing problem"" The ministerial targets state that at least 50% of first appointments should happen within nine weeks, 55% of inpatient and day case admissions should take place within 13 weeks, and overall no-one should wait longer than a year for a service. But those targets are being breached for the majority of patients across the board. To tackle the waiting times, the Royal College of Surgeons said recently-retired surgeons could work in ""Covid-light sites"". ""This stop-start approach to surgery is wreaking havoc on operating lists,"" said Mr Taylor ""We are urging system health leaders to do all that they can to bring about an expansion of Covid-light hospital sites and surgical hubs, to allow surgery to continue irrespective of the peaks and troughs of the pandemic. ""Our health service was in need of radical change before the pandemic, and the situation has only worsened over the last year.""

"The supermarkets are being treated as crime scenes Shoppers have been told to throw away food bought in three west London supermarkets on Wednesday evening, after a man was arrested on suspicion of injecting items using syringes. A Sainsbury's Local, Tesco Express and Little Waitrose on Fulham Palace Road, Fulham, remain closed. Both food and non-food products were injected with an unknown substance, police said. Police believe the man was acting alone. A Hammersmith and Fulham Council spokesman said shoppers at the three supermarkets ""are advised to bin anything bought after 18.00 BST on the evening of Wednesday 25 August,"" ""If you suspect any of the items purchased may be contaminated, please keep hold of these items and contact the police,"" the spokesman added. There was a police presence outside Tesco Express The Metropolitan Police said officers were called at about 19:40 BST after a man was reported to be shouting abuse at people in the street. The Met said: ""It is currently unknown as to how many items have been contaminated, or what with. Investigations are ongoing to establish if other businesses in the area are involved in the incident."" A Little Waitrose shopper, who lives on the same street as the stores, told the BBC: ""It is a bit a worrying because I was buying milk at the time and the police were escorting everyone out.

"There have been 38,281 new Covid cases and a further 140 deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported across the UK NHS organisations in England have been told to prepare for a possible extension of the vaccine rollout to all 12 to 15-year-olds Prof Devi Sridhar, of the University of Edinburgh, says children should be vaccinated as the Delta variant is ""flying through schools"" But Prof Russell Viner of Sage says there should be caution and ""we would be vaccinating teenagers largely to protect adults"" Covid rates in England are higher among 10 to 19-year-olds than any other age group, with 616.5 cases per 100,000 people BBC Radio Newcastle presenter Lisa Shaw died due to complications from the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, a coroner finds India has given more than 600 million vaccine doses - with the most recent 100 million jabs administered in just 19 days Japan suspends use of about 1.63 million doses of Moderna jab due to contamination Edited by James Clarke That's all from our coronavirus live coverage today. We'll be back with more updates tomorrow. Today's pandemic news has been brought to you by Becky Morton, Doug Faulkner, Hamish Mackay and James Clarke. A health worker speaks to people waiting in line at a Covid-19 vaccination centre in Melbourne as authorities try to bring the virus under control in Australia We're about to close up for the day but if you are just joining us here is a reminder of what has been happening today.  Research is to be carried out into how long immunity lasts after a coronavirus vaccine. with scientists hoping this could help with the design of future jabs. Some Â£1.5 million is being invested in understanding why some people get Covid-19 despite being jabbed or having had the virus before, while others do not. Health Secretary Sajid Javid says the new research will ""help us gain valuable insights"", while public health leader Dr Susan Hopkins says the findings will be ""essential"" in concluding who is most at risk post-jab and for vaccine developers in designing boosters. Research earlier this week concluded the protection provided by two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccines starts to wane within six months. One reasonable worst-case scenario suggests protection could fall to below 50% for the elderly and healthcare workers by winter. Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent School pupils in Northern Irelandwill not have to self-isolate after coming into contact with a coronavirus case if they have recently tested positive for the virus themselves. New guidance, issued by the Public Health Agency (PHA) ahead of the school term, says as long as a pupil is well they can stay in school but must avoid visiting care homes and hospitals. Staff who are close contacts of a coronavirus case can keep working in school if they are fully vaccinated. However, unvaccinated staff have to self-isolate for 10 days. The PHA guidance for schools states: ""Pupils who are close contacts but have already had a positive test result in the previous 90 days and have no new symptoms do not need to arrange a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test or self-isolate. ""This is because it is possible for PCR tests to remain positive for some time after COVID-19 infection due to residual virus fragments (which are not infectious)."" Covid case rates in Wales have climbed tonumbers not seen since January. However, Public Health Wales figures show deaths and hospital admissions remain much lower, thanks to the vaccine rollout. Rising cases were anticipated with restrictions easing and more mixing. Case rates are currently above the ""most likely scenario"" modelled by scientists but the impact on hospitals remains within calculations. The Wales case rate has now risen to 334.1 cases per 100,000. One further death was also reported, bringing the average over the past seven days to 1.1 deaths a day. At this stage during the second wave there was an average of 23 deaths per day. Rhoda OdhiamboBBC health reporter, Nairobi Kenya says the main Covid-19 vaccine to be used in rural areas will be the one manufactured by Johnson & Johnson. Chairperson of the country's vaccine taskforce, Dr Willis Akhwale, says hospitals in these areas do not have the infrastructure to store the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, which require specialist equipment, such as very cold freezers. When properly stored, the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine can last up to two
years and can be easily distributed in hard-to-reach areas where vaccination rates
are still low. Dr Willis tells the BBC the AstraZeneca vaccine will also be
used in hospitals in rural and urbans areas. Of Kenya's 50 million population, 2.5 million people have so far received at least one jab. Of these, close to 800,000 are fully vaccinated. Yulia Putintseva complained of a mice infestation in the hotel room where she was quarantining A two-week bio-secure bubble is set to replace hotel quarantine at next year's Australian Open, tournament bosses say. At this year's Grand Slam in February, players spent 14 days in hotel rooms with limited training time, because of the country's strict Covid rules. The restrictions drew complaints from players, with some forced to isolate in their rooms for the duration. Tennis Australia chief Craig Tiley says the bubble will allow players ""to move freely between the hotel and courts"". While some players were allowed up to five hours training time on closed courts at the 2021 competition, 72 who had been in contact with positive cases on flights to Australia had to isolate entirely in their rooms. Read more. There have been 38,281 new Covid cases and a further 140 deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported across the UK, according tothe latest government figures,external. That is up from 36,572 and 113 deaths for the same day a week ago. A further 68,076 first vaccine doses have been given as well as another 161,705 second jabs. Lochaber High School in Fort William is among sites affected A third of all schools in the Scottish Highlands havebeen affected by Covid, the area's council says. Grantown, Kingussie, Culloden and Fort William's Lochaber secondary schools have ""a significant number of year groups self-isolating"". Aviemore Primary School and Thurso's Pennyland Primary are closed to some pupils, while Kincraig's Alvie primary is requiring a one-day closure. Highland Council says the region has seen an ""exponential increase"" in cases. There are 203 schools in the Highland Council region. On Wednesday, NHS Highland warned of a ""large number of outbreaks"" of Covid in schools in its area, which includes Argyll and Bute. The health board says there have been more than 1,000 new cases in the local population in the past week - representing almost 10% of all cases in the region since the start of the pandemic. As we heard earlier, the number of people testing positive for coronavirus in England is continuing rise. Prof Tim Spector, who runs the Zoe Covid study, says the UK now has the highest Covid rates in Europe, despite the success of its vaccine rollout. ""The main difference between the UK and Europe is
our lack of restrictions. In many parts of Europe, people are still wearing
face coverings and observing some social distancing,"" the professor of genetic epidemiology
at King's College London says. ""In the UK, where we eagerly declared 'freedom' from
Covid and did away with even the most basic social measures, Covid has found an
opportunity to spread."" He adds that with schools returning ""there's a good chance cases will continue to rise from here"". We are expecting an update to the UK's travel lists later today. The lists are updated every three weeks by ministers, based on advice fromthe Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC),external, which looks at the Covid situation in each country. Last time the categories were updatedthe quarantine rules for fully-vaccinated travellers from France were dropped while Mexico was added to the red list. Other changes included India, Qatar and the UAE moving from red to amber while Germany, Austria and Norway were among those to move to green. Here is a reminder of which countries are currently in each category. Pupils will be returning to the classroom across England, Wales and Northern Ireland in September, while in Scotland the new term has already started. Many restrictions have been lifted but some safety measures will remain in place, including asking pupils to take tests before they return. For schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, social distancing measures and rules around ""bubbles"", where pupils stay in a fixed group, have been relaxed. But in Scotland, all staff must stay at least 1m (3ft) from pupils and colleagues when on school premises until the end of September. Face coverings will initially be required in classrooms in Scotland and Northern Ireland but they will no longer be routinely advised in England and Wales. You can read more about what the new school term will look like in different parts of the UK here. A campaign on radio, social and digital media to reassure parents and pupils it is safe to return to school in England has been launched by the government. Science experiments, sport, music and drama are back on the timetable, while distancing rules, ""bubble"" groups and staggered starts have been axed. All secondary pupils are also being urged to get tested either at school or in the community, before term starts. But the Association of School and College Leaders says there are still concerns about the possible impact of Covid spreading among pupils, who are largely unvaccinated. Attendance fell off dramatically towards the end of the summer term, as Covid cases were rising in the younger population. Read more. Covid case rates are rising in all regions of England, except London and Yorkshire and the Humber, according to the latest data from Public Health England. South-west England has seen the highest rate with 481.7 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 22 August, up sharply from 351.8 the week before. The East Midlands has the second highest rate at 360.9, up from 351.5. London has the lowest rate with 247.3, down from 277.6. Rates in England are also continuing to rise in most age groups, PHE says, with the exceptions of children aged four and under, and adults aged between 20 and 39. The highest rate is among 10 to 19-year-olds, with 616.5 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 22 August, up sharply week-on-week from 472.5. The lowest rate is among people aged 80 and over, at 95.2, up slightly from 90.1. Over the past few weeks, Chinese sources have been amplifying a baseless claim that Covid-19 was made in the US.

Previous estimates had put the number between 91,700 and 98,700 deaths. Estimates for the number of hospital admissions directly averted by the programme are unchanged at more than 82,100. BBC Radio 5 Live Supply chain issues, in part due to a shortage of lorry drivers, are affecting businesses across the UK. One problem is that the pandemic has halted HGV driver training and testing for more than 12 months, according to the trade association Logistics UK. And the Road Haulage Association adds that, alongside Brexit, this has led to the current shortfall of around 100,000 HGV drivers. Trainee driver Hayley O'Beirnes has been speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live about the hurdles she has faced to get into the industry ""Any normal person would have thrown in the towel by now, what should have just taken a few months has taken nearly a year,"" she says. Ms O'Beirnes - who starting training in February - says she has always wanted to be an arctic lorry driver, but delays and rising prices of training have stopped her from completing her training. ""I couldn't afford the Â£3,000, which is the average cost of doing training up front, I was forced to find a company that did finance.""

Namibia is currently experiencing its third wave of the pandemic, which has exposed its insufficient health infrastructure. The Welsh government is also giving a further Â£500,000 grant for oxygen equipment and nurse training. But Welsh Tory health spokesman Russell George is warning that the decision will ""raise some eyebrows"" as the African nation is ""often accused of being besieged by corruption"". Thornwell Primary School in Chepstow runs sessions to teach children about healthy lifestyles Disadvantaged pupils in Wales ate less fruit and vegetables, did less exercise and had more takeaways during lockdown school closures, research suggests. Most pupils stayed home from March to June 2020 and again at the start of 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Academics from Swansea University say school structure can have a big impact on a child's diet, as children prepare to return to the classroom. Researchers asked eight to 11-year-olds in Welsh primary schools to do an online survey about their health and wellbeing during the first lockdown period, from April to June 2020. They found there were overall improvements in aspects of children's wellbeing, such as sleep and happiness with family, compared with similar surveys in the previous two years. However, children receiving free school meals ate fewer fruit and vegetables, while more disadvantaged children also reported a reduction in physical activity. Read more of the findingshere.

He says that is his ""strong preference"" and that instinct is shared by most people in the UK. The PM was speaking aftersome Tory backbenchers called for the planned ending of the universal credit uplift to be cancelled. The Â£20-per-week increase,brought in last year as a temporary measureduring the Covid pandemic and later extended, is set to end this autumn. Â© 2025 BBC.

Research is to be carried out into how long immunity lasts after a coronavirus vaccine. with scientists hoping this could help with the design of future jabs. Some Â£1.5 million is being invested in understanding why some people get Covid-19 despite being jabbed or having had the virus before, while others do not. Health Secretary Sajid Javid says the new research will ""help us gain valuable insights"", while public health leader Dr Susan Hopkins says the findings will be ""essential"" in concluding who is most at risk post-jab and for vaccine developers in designing boosters. Research earlier this week concluded the protection provided by two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccines starts to wane within six months. One reasonable worst-case scenario suggests protection could fall to below 50% for the elderly and healthcare workers by winter. Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent School pupils in Northern Irelandwill not have to self-isolate after coming into contact with a coronavirus case if they have recently tested positive for the virus themselves. New guidance, issued by the Public Health Agency (PHA) ahead of the school term, says as long as a pupil is well they can stay in school but must avoid visiting care homes and hospitals. Staff who are close contacts of a coronavirus case can keep working in school if they are fully vaccinated. However, unvaccinated staff have to self-isolate for 10 days. The PHA guidance for schools states: ""Pupils who are close contacts but have already had a positive test result in the previous 90 days and have no new symptoms do not need to arrange a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test or self-isolate. ""This is because it is possible for PCR tests to remain positive for some time after COVID-19 infection due to residual virus fragments (which are not infectious)."" Covid case rates in Wales have climbed tonumbers not seen since January. However, Public Health Wales figures show deaths and hospital admissions remain much lower, thanks to the vaccine rollout. Rising cases were anticipated with restrictions easing and more mixing. Case rates are currently above the ""most likely scenario"" modelled by scientists but the impact on hospitals remains within calculations. The Wales case rate has now risen to 334.1 cases per 100,000. One further death was also reported, bringing the average over the past seven days to 1.1 deaths a day. At this stage during the second wave there was an average of 23 deaths per day. Rhoda OdhiamboBBC health reporter, Nairobi Kenya says the main Covid-19 vaccine to be used in rural areas will be the one manufactured by Johnson & Johnson. Chairperson of the country's vaccine taskforce, Dr Willis Akhwale, says hospitals in these areas do not have the infrastructure to store the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, which require specialist equipment, such as very cold freezers. When properly stored, the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine can last up to two
years and can be easily distributed in hard-to-reach areas where vaccination rates
are still low. Dr Willis tells the BBC the AstraZeneca vaccine will also be
used in hospitals in rural and urbans areas. Of Kenya's 50 million population, 2.5 million people have so far received at least one jab. Of these, close to 800,000 are fully vaccinated. Yulia Putintseva complained of a mice infestation in the hotel room where she was quarantining A two-week bio-secure bubble is set to replace hotel quarantine at next year's Australian Open, tournament bosses say. At this year's Grand Slam in February, players spent 14 days in hotel rooms with limited training time, because of the country's strict Covid rules. The restrictions drew complaints from players, with some forced to isolate in their rooms for the duration. Tennis Australia chief Craig Tiley says the bubble will allow players ""to move freely between the hotel and courts"". While some players were allowed up to five hours training time on closed courts at the 2021 competition, 72 who had been in contact with positive cases on flights to Australia had to isolate entirely in their rooms.

Lochaber High School in Fort William is among sites affected A third of all schools in the Scottish Highlands havebeen affected by Covid, the area's council says. Grantown, Kingussie, Culloden and Fort William's Lochaber secondary schools have ""a significant number of year groups self-isolating"". Aviemore Primary School and Thurso's Pennyland Primary are closed to some pupils, while Kincraig's Alvie primary is requiring a one-day closure. Highland Council says the region has seen an ""exponential increase"" in cases. There are 203 schools in the Highland Council region. On Wednesday, NHS Highland warned of a ""large number of outbreaks"" of Covid in schools in its area, which includes Argyll and Bute. The health board says there have been more than 1,000 new cases in the local population in the past week - representing almost 10% of all cases in the region since the start of the pandemic. As we heard earlier, the number of people testing positive for coronavirus in England is continuing rise. Prof Tim Spector, who runs the Zoe Covid study, says the UK now has the highest Covid rates in Europe, despite the success of its vaccine rollout. ""The main difference between the UK and Europe is
our lack of restrictions. In many parts of Europe, people are still wearing
face coverings and observing some social distancing,"" the professor of genetic epidemiology
at King's College London says. ""In the UK, where we eagerly declared 'freedom' from
Covid and did away with even the most basic social measures, Covid has found an
opportunity to spread."" He adds that with schools returning ""there's a good chance cases will continue to rise from here"". We are expecting an update to the UK's travel lists later today. The lists are updated every three weeks by ministers, based on advice fromthe Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC),external, which looks at the Covid situation in each country. Last time the categories were updatedthe quarantine rules for fully-vaccinated travellers from France were dropped while Mexico was added to the red list. Other changes included India, Qatar and the UAE moving from red to amber while Germany, Austria and Norway were among those to move to green. Here is a reminder of which countries are currently in each category. Pupils will be returning to the classroom across England, Wales and Northern Ireland in September, while in Scotland the new term has already started. Many restrictions have been lifted but some safety measures will remain in place, including asking pupils to take tests before they return. For schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, social distancing measures and rules around ""bubbles"", where pupils stay in a fixed group, have been relaxed. But in Scotland, all staff must stay at least 1m (3ft) from pupils and colleagues when on school premises until the end of September. Face coverings will initially be required in classrooms in Scotland and Northern Ireland but they will no longer be routinely advised in England and Wales. You can read more about what the new school term will look like in different parts of the UK here. A campaign on radio, social and digital media to reassure parents and pupils it is safe to return to school in England has been launched by the government. Science experiments, sport, music and drama are back on the timetable, while distancing rules, ""bubble"" groups and staggered starts have been axed. All secondary pupils are also being urged to get tested either at school or in the community, before term starts. But the Association of School and College Leaders says there are still concerns about the possible impact of Covid spreading among pupils, who are largely unvaccinated.

The East Midlands has the second highest rate at 360.9, up from 351.5. London has the lowest rate with 247.3, down from 277.6. Rates in England are also continuing to rise in most age groups, PHE says, with the exceptions of children aged four and under, and adults aged between 20 and 39. The highest rate is among 10 to 19-year-olds, with 616.5 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 22 August, up sharply week-on-week from 472.5.

BBC Radio 5 Live Supply chain issues, in part due to a shortage of lorry drivers, are affecting businesses across the UK. One problem is that the pandemic has halted HGV driver training and testing for more than 12 months, according to the trade association Logistics UK. And the Road Haulage Association adds that, alongside Brexit, this has led to the current shortfall of around 100,000 HGV drivers. Trainee driver Hayley O'Beirnes has been speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live about the hurdles she has faced to get into the industry ""Any normal person would have thrown in the towel by now, what should have just taken a few months has taken nearly a year,"" she says. Ms O'Beirnes - who starting training in February - says she has always wanted to be an arctic lorry driver, but delays and rising prices of training have stopped her from completing her training. ""I couldn't afford the Â£3,000, which is the average cost of doing training up front, I was forced to find a company that did finance.""

Namibia is currently experiencing its third wave of the pandemic, which has exposed its insufficient health infrastructure. The Welsh government is also giving a further Â£500,000 grant for oxygen equipment and nurse training. But Welsh Tory health spokesman Russell George is warning that the decision will ""raise some eyebrows"" as the African nation is ""often accused of being besieged by corruption"". Thornwell Primary School in Chepstow runs sessions to teach children about healthy lifestyles Disadvantaged pupils in Wales ate less fruit and vegetables, did less exercise and had more takeaways during lockdown school closures, research suggests. Most pupils stayed home from March to June 2020 and again at the start of 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Academics from Swansea University say school structure can have a big impact on a child's diet, as children prepare to return to the classroom. Researchers asked eight to 11-year-olds in Welsh primary schools to do an online survey about their health and wellbeing during the first lockdown period, from April to June 2020. They found there were overall improvements in aspects of children's wellbeing, such as sleep and happiness with family, compared with similar surveys in the previous two years. However, children receiving free school meals ate fewer fruit and vegetables, while more disadvantaged children also reported a reduction in physical activity. Read more of the findingshere.

"The Swedish band are one of the biggest pop acts of all time. Pop group Abba have teased a major announcement for next week, as fans await their first new music in 39 years. The Swedish band launched a new website on Thursday morning titled ""Abba Voyage"", asking fans to register interest in a new project. It is expected to be a long-gestating ""hologram tour"" that Abba initially announced in 2016. The band are also expected to release five new songs to accompany the show. Allow Twitter content?

The quartet - Agnetha Faltskog, Anna-Frid Lyngstad, Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson - returned to the studio in 2018, promising two new songs later that year. Those tracks, I Still Have Faith In You and Don't Shut Me Down, have been repeatedly delayed - and the band are now planning to release five tracks to thank fans for their patience. Earlier this year, Ulvaeus confirmed the music would ""definitely"" come out this year. ""It's not a case any more of it might happen, it will happen,""he told The Herald Sun.,external Why the UK gave Abba 'nul points' at Eurovision Abba Gold spends record 1,000 weeks in UK chart Abba record first new songs since 1982 The Abba Voyage website was launched on Thursday morning, featuring a cryptic image of four glowing planets, accompanied by the date 2 September. According to The Sun, the show will involve ""Abba-tars"" of the stars performing hits like Waterloo, Dancing Queen and Mamma Mia. It said the holograms will be beamed onstage in a purpose-built east London theatre, where fans will also be able to see a documentary-style film on the band's comeback. Speaking to the BBC during the early stages of the show's production, Ulvaeus said the idea had been presented to the band by Spice Girls manager Simon Fuller. ""He came to Stockholm and he presented this idea to us that we could make identical digital copies of ourselves of a certain age and that those copies could then go on tour and they could sing our songs, you know, and lip sync. I've seen this project half-way through and it's already mind-boggling.""

But their joint project completely eclipsed their previous work. After winning the Eurovision Song Contest with Waterloo in 1974, the band sold almost 400 million singles and albums around the world. Mamma Mia!, the musical based on their hits and produced by Ulvaeus and Andersson, has also been seen by more than 50 million people. During their most successful period, the band survived marriage break-ups between Ulvaeus and Faltskog, and Lyngstad and Andersson, but they finally called it a day in 1983. Their final recording sessions, in 1982, produced the hits Under Attack and The Day Before You Came, which featured on the compilation album The Singles. Their last public performance came three years later, on the Swedish version of TV show This Is Your Life, which honoured their manager Stig Anderson.

"The actress is reprising her role as the sharp-witted technological genius Shuri in the Black Panther sequel Actress Letitia Wright was treated in hospital after an accident on the set of the upcoming Black Panther sequel. The star, who plays Shuri, Princess of Wakanda, received minor injuries in what was described as a ""stunt rig accident"". The film shoot was happening overnight in Boston, separate to the main production in Atlanta. Although the nature of her injuries was not disclosed, the actress was released from hospital after several hours. The incident is not expected to have an impact on the shooting schedule for the superhero sequel. Wright is one of several stars returning in the film, titled Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, alongside Daniel Kaluuya, Danai Gurira, Lupita Nyong'o and Angela Bassett. Plot details are being kept under wraps, but the movie is expected to continue the story of the technologically-advanced African nation of Wakanda after the death of King T'Challa, who was played by the late actor Chadwick Boseman. Film studio Marvel has confirmed that Boseman's role will not be recast, and they will not use digital effects to include his likeness in the film. Boseman will not be replaced in Black Panther 2 Why Chadwick Boseman meant so much to black fans It was recently announced that British star Michaela Coel - who created and starred in I May Destroy You - would join the cast in an unknown role. Additionally, Dominique Thorne, who will play the up-and-coming superhero Ironheart in a forthcoming Disney Plus TV series, will make her Marvel debut in the Black Panther film. Production on the sequel began in June, with Ryan Coogler back in the director's chair. He has previously spoken about the challenges of continuing the story without Boseman, who died of colon cancer last year. ""This is one of the more profound things that I've ever gone through in my life,""he told the Unbothered podcast last year,external, ""having to be a part of keeping this project going without this particular person, who was like the glue that held it together."" British star Kaluuya, who plays T'Challa's second-in-command W'Kabi, said the sequel's goal would be to honour the late star. ""For me, what's important to me is not the Black Panther legacy, it's the legacy of Chadwick Boseman, because that's a human being and a spirit that is real,"" Kaluuya told The Ringer. ""How can we honour that? Black Panther is going to do what Black Panther does, but that's a man that lived for us. He did it for us, did it our nephews, our nieces, our kids. It's our duty to honour that man the way he honoured us.""

Trainee driver Hayley O'Beirnes has been speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live about the hurdles she has faced to get into the industry ""Any normal person would have thrown in the towel by now, what should have just taken a few months has taken nearly a year,"" she says. Ms O'Beirnes - who starting training in February - says she has always wanted to be an arctic lorry driver, but delays and rising prices of training have stopped her from completing her training. ""I couldn't afford the Â£3,000, which is the average cost of doing training up front, I was forced to find a company that did finance.""

Namibia is currently experiencing its third wave of the pandemic, which has exposed its insufficient health infrastructure. The Welsh government is also giving a further Â£500,000 grant for oxygen equipment and nurse training. But Welsh Tory health spokesman Russell George is warning that the decision will ""raise some eyebrows"" as the African nation is ""often accused of being besieged by corruption"". Thornwell Primary School in Chepstow runs sessions to teach children about healthy lifestyles Disadvantaged pupils in Wales ate less fruit and vegetables, did less exercise and had more takeaways during lockdown school closures, research suggests. Most pupils stayed home from March to June 2020 and again at the start of 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Academics from Swansea University say school structure can have a big impact on a child's diet, as children prepare to return to the classroom. Researchers asked eight to 11-year-olds in Welsh primary schools to do an online survey about their health and wellbeing during the first lockdown period, from April to June 2020. They found there were overall improvements in aspects of children's wellbeing, such as sleep and happiness with family, compared with similar surveys in the previous two years. However, children receiving free school meals ate fewer fruit and vegetables, while more disadvantaged children also reported a reduction in physical activity. Read more of the findingshere.

"There have been 38,281 new Covid cases and a further 140 deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported across the UK NHS organisations in England have been told to prepare for a possible extension of the vaccine rollout to all 12 to 15-year-olds Prof Devi Sridhar, of the University of Edinburgh, says children should be vaccinated as the Delta variant is ""flying through schools"" But Prof Russell Viner of Sage says there should be caution and ""we would be vaccinating teenagers largely to protect adults"" Covid rates in England are higher among 10 to 19-year-olds than any other age group, with 616.5 cases per 100,000 people BBC Radio Newcastle presenter Lisa Shaw died due to complications from the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, a coroner finds India has given more than 600 million vaccine doses - with the most recent 100 million jabs administered in just 19 days Japan suspends use of about 1.63 million doses of Moderna jab due to contamination Edited by James Clarke That's all from our coronavirus live coverage today. We'll be back with more updates tomorrow. Today's pandemic news has been brought to you by Becky Morton, Doug Faulkner, Hamish Mackay and James Clarke. A health worker speaks to people waiting in line at a Covid-19 vaccination centre in Melbourne as authorities try to bring the virus under control in Australia We're about to close up for the day but if you are just joining us here is a reminder of what has been happening today.  Research is to be carried out into how long immunity lasts after a coronavirus vaccine. with scientists hoping this could help with the design of future jabs. Some Â£1.5 million is being invested in understanding why some people get Covid-19 despite being jabbed or having had the virus before, while others do not. Health Secretary Sajid Javid says the new research will ""help us gain valuable insights"", while public health leader Dr Susan Hopkins says the findings will be ""essential"" in concluding who is most at risk post-jab and for vaccine developers in designing boosters. Research earlier this week concluded the protection provided by two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccines starts to wane within six months. One reasonable worst-case scenario suggests protection could fall to below 50% for the elderly and healthcare workers by winter. Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent School pupils in Northern Irelandwill not have to self-isolate after coming into contact with a coronavirus case if they have recently tested positive for the virus themselves. New guidance, issued by the Public Health Agency (PHA) ahead of the school term, says as long as a pupil is well they can stay in school but must avoid visiting care homes and hospitals. Staff who are close contacts of a coronavirus case can keep working in school if they are fully vaccinated. However, unvaccinated staff have to self-isolate for 10 days. The PHA guidance for schools states: ""Pupils who are close contacts but have already had a positive test result in the previous 90 days and have no new symptoms do not need to arrange a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test or self-isolate. ""This is because it is possible for PCR tests to remain positive for some time after COVID-19 infection due to residual virus fragments (which are not infectious)."" Covid case rates in Wales have climbed tonumbers not seen since January. However, Public Health Wales figures show deaths and hospital admissions remain much lower, thanks to the vaccine rollout. Rising cases were anticipated with restrictions easing and more mixing. Case rates are currently above the ""most likely scenario"" modelled by scientists but the impact on hospitals remains within calculations. The Wales case rate has now risen to 334.1 cases per 100,000. One further death was also reported, bringing the average over the past seven days to 1.1 deaths a day. At this stage during the second wave there was an average of 23 deaths per day. Rhoda OdhiamboBBC health reporter, Nairobi Kenya says the main Covid-19 vaccine to be used in rural areas will be the one manufactured by Johnson & Johnson. Chairperson of the country's vaccine taskforce, Dr Willis Akhwale, says hospitals in these areas do not have the infrastructure to store the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, which require specialist equipment, such as very cold freezers. When properly stored, the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine can last up to two
years and can be easily distributed in hard-to-reach areas where vaccination rates
are still low. Dr Willis tells the BBC the AstraZeneca vaccine will also be
used in hospitals in rural and urbans areas. Of Kenya's 50 million population, 2.5 million people have so far received at least one jab. Of these, close to 800,000 are fully vaccinated. Yulia Putintseva complained of a mice infestation in the hotel room where she was quarantining A two-week bio-secure bubble is set to replace hotel quarantine at next year's Australian Open, tournament bosses say. At this year's Grand Slam in February, players spent 14 days in hotel rooms with limited training time, because of the country's strict Covid rules. The restrictions drew complaints from players, with some forced to isolate in their rooms for the duration. Tennis Australia chief Craig Tiley says the bubble will allow players ""to move freely between the hotel and courts"". While some players were allowed up to five hours training time on closed courts at the 2021 competition, 72 who had been in contact with positive cases on flights to Australia had to isolate entirely in their rooms. Read more. There have been 38,281 new Covid cases and a further 140 deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported across the UK, according tothe latest government figures,external. That is up from 36,572 and 113 deaths for the same day a week ago. A further 68,076 first vaccine doses have been given as well as another 161,705 second jabs. Lochaber High School in Fort William is among sites affected A third of all schools in the Scottish Highlands havebeen affected by Covid, the area's council says. Grantown, Kingussie, Culloden and Fort William's Lochaber secondary schools have ""a significant number of year groups self-isolating"". Aviemore Primary School and Thurso's Pennyland Primary are closed to some pupils, while Kincraig's Alvie primary is requiring a one-day closure. Highland Council says the region has seen an ""exponential increase"" in cases. There are 203 schools in the Highland Council region. On Wednesday, NHS Highland warned of a ""large number of outbreaks"" of Covid in schools in its area, which includes Argyll and Bute. The health board says there have been more than 1,000 new cases in the local population in the past week - representing almost 10% of all cases in the region since the start of the pandemic. As we heard earlier, the number of people testing positive for coronavirus in England is continuing rise. Prof Tim Spector, who runs the Zoe Covid study, says the UK now has the highest Covid rates in Europe, despite the success of its vaccine rollout. ""The main difference between the UK and Europe is
our lack of restrictions. In many parts of Europe, people are still wearing
face coverings and observing some social distancing,"" the professor of genetic epidemiology
at King's College London says. ""In the UK, where we eagerly declared 'freedom' from
Covid and did away with even the most basic social measures, Covid has found an
opportunity to spread."" He adds that with schools returning ""there's a good chance cases will continue to rise from here"". We are expecting an update to the UK's travel lists later today. The lists are updated every three weeks by ministers, based on advice fromthe Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC),external, which looks at the Covid situation in each country. Last time the categories were updatedthe quarantine rules for fully-vaccinated travellers from France were dropped while Mexico was added to the red list. Other changes included India, Qatar and the UAE moving from red to amber while Germany, Austria and Norway were among those to move to green. Here is a reminder of which countries are currently in each category. Pupils will be returning to the classroom across England, Wales and Northern Ireland in September, while in Scotland the new term has already started. Many restrictions have been lifted but some safety measures will remain in place, including asking pupils to take tests before they return. For schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, social distancing measures and rules around ""bubbles"", where pupils stay in a fixed group, have been relaxed. But in Scotland, all staff must stay at least 1m (3ft) from pupils and colleagues when on school premises until the end of September. Face coverings will initially be required in classrooms in Scotland and Northern Ireland but they will no longer be routinely advised in England and Wales. You can read more about what the new school term will look like in different parts of the UK here. A campaign on radio, social and digital media to reassure parents and pupils it is safe to return to school in England has been launched by the government. Science experiments, sport, music and drama are back on the timetable, while distancing rules, ""bubble"" groups and staggered starts have been axed. All secondary pupils are also being urged to get tested either at school or in the community, before term starts. But the Association of School and College Leaders says there are still concerns about the possible impact of Covid spreading among pupils, who are largely unvaccinated. Attendance fell off dramatically towards the end of the summer term, as Covid cases were rising in the younger population. Read more. Covid case rates are rising in all regions of England, except London and Yorkshire and the Humber, according to the latest data from Public Health England. South-west England has seen the highest rate with 481.7 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 22 August, up sharply from 351.8 the week before. The East Midlands has the second highest rate at 360.9, up from 351.5. London has the lowest rate with 247.3, down from 277.6. Rates in England are also continuing to rise in most age groups, PHE says, with the exceptions of children aged four and under, and adults aged between 20 and 39. The highest rate is among 10 to 19-year-olds, with 616.5 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 22 August, up sharply week-on-week from 472.5. The lowest rate is among people aged 80 and over, at 95.2, up slightly from 90.1. Over the past few weeks, Chinese sources have been amplifying a baseless claim that Covid-19 was made in the US.

"NHS England has admitted that a shortage of vials used for blood tests will worsen over the next few weeks and will last until mid-September. Itsaid supplies remain constrained,externaland are forecast ""to become even more constrained over the coming weeks"". While the NHS expects the position to improve by the middle of next month, ""overall supply is likely to remain challenging for a significant period."" Doctors had been told to stagger some blood tests due to the shortage. They are warning that patient care will suffer due to delays. It comes after Becton Dickinson, a company that makes vials for the health service, said it is experiencing serious supply chain issues. Due to the shortage, the NHS has temporarily stopped some blood testing for fertility, pre-diabetes, allergies and certain blood disorders. NHS England issuedguidance,externalurging doctors to delay regular blood tests if clinically safe and NHS Walesissued similar guidance. In its guidance, NHS England said ""alternative products are being sought to alleviate these constraints,"" as a result of the global shortages of blood tube products. Dr Farah Jameel, a GP based in north London and a representative from the British Medical Association trade body said she was having ""difficult conversations"" with patients about rationing the vials ""among the very sickest"". Dr Jameel is having ""incredibly challenging"" conversations with patients about delayed blood tests. She said there has been ""very unclear messaging from NHS England on how quickly we're going to run short and what the impact will be on patient care."" ""The NHS needs to communicate clearly with the public and with the profession so there is a clear understanding of the problems which will help us manage expectations,"" Dr Jameel said. ""These tests are a fundamental part of patient care, giving us essential insights into different conditions, warning signs and overall health."" Doctor Gavin Jamie, an GP based in Swindon agreed that preventative care is going to be slower, in addition to screening delays cause by the pandemic which he said he's still trying to catch up on. ""We've not seen the full effect yet but it looks like it could carry on for at least a few months from the time scale NHS England have been giving us,"" he added. GPs across the country have tweeted about the difficulties the shortage is causing, while patients have tweeted texts from their surgeries which have said their blood tests have been cancelled. Alison Webb's blood tests have been delayed by four months due to the shortages Alison Webb, from Wales, told the BBC she was told that she can't have her yearly thyroid and cholesterol checked due to the blood tube shortages. She has a condition which means the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones and said her blood tests are currently overdue by four months. ""Now I've been told to ring again in a month's time. Terrible,"" she said. The medical device company, Becton Dickinson, which partly manufactures its tubes in the US, said the need to test Covid-19 patients in addition to routine testing for procedures which were delayed due to the pandemic had increased demand. Responding to the new NHS guidance, theBritish Medical Association,externalsaid that healthcare staff were ""still no closer to understanding how this situation was able to develop and why there wasn't a contingency plan"". ""Today's guidance does not explain what will happen if hospitals or GP surgeries do run out of stock, and this must be addressed as a matter of urgency,"" said Dr David Wrigley, deputy chair of BMA council. ""No doctor wants the consequence of delayed diagnosis for patients due to these shortages, and they also need to know they are protected from any possible negligence claims,"" he added. Like many other industries, Becton Dickinson said in addition to increased demand, it was experiencing ""continued transportation challenges"", which included port and transport capacity, air freight capacity and UK border challenges. ""Suppliers are also challenged to meet increased demand for raw materials and components,"" the firm told the BBC. ""We are balancing the frequency of preventive maintenance leading to plant shutdown to provide continuing supply of products, and we are working closely with our raw material suppliers, transport agencies and other necessary third parties to minimize supply disruptions,"" a spokesperson added. A spokesperson for the Department for Health and Social Care told the BBC: ""Patient safety and continuity of care is our priority and we are working to ensure there is minimal possible impact on patient care. ""The health and care system is working closely with Becton Dickinson to put mitigations in place to resolve any problems if they arise,"" they added. Diabetes UK expressed concerns for the 13.6 million people in the country at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes can develop more slowly than those for type 1. Nikki Joule, policy manager at the charity, said the supply issues would make the condition ""harder to spot"" and said it's ""very important"" that those at risk ""do not fall through the cracks due to a logistical issue."" Gwenda Burns, chief executive of Fertility Network UK agrees that the logistical issue is ""extremely worrying"" for those awaiting fertility tests.

BBC Radio 5 Live Supply chain issues, in part due to a shortage of lorry drivers, are affecting businesses across the UK. One problem is that the pandemic has halted HGV driver training and testing for more than 12 months, according to the trade association Logistics UK. And the Road Haulage Association adds that, alongside Brexit, this has led to the current shortfall of around 100,000 HGV drivers. Trainee driver Hayley O'Beirnes has been speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live about the hurdles she has faced to get into the industry ""Any normal person would have thrown in the towel by now, what should have just taken a few months has taken nearly a year,"" she says. Ms O'Beirnes - who starting training in February - says she has always wanted to be an arctic lorry driver, but delays and rising prices of training have stopped her from completing her training. ""I couldn't afford the Â£3,000, which is the average cost of doing training up front, I was forced to find a company that did finance.""

Namibia is currently experiencing its third wave of the pandemic, which has exposed its insufficient health infrastructure. The Welsh government is also giving a further Â£500,000 grant for oxygen equipment and nurse training. But Welsh Tory health spokesman Russell George is warning that the decision will ""raise some eyebrows"" as the African nation is ""often accused of being besieged by corruption"". Thornwell Primary School in Chepstow runs sessions to teach children about healthy lifestyles Disadvantaged pupils in Wales ate less fruit and vegetables, did less exercise and had more takeaways during lockdown school closures, research suggests. Most pupils stayed home from March to June 2020 and again at the start of 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Academics from Swansea University say school structure can have a big impact on a child's diet, as children prepare to return to the classroom. Researchers asked eight to 11-year-olds in Welsh primary schools to do an online survey about their health and wellbeing during the first lockdown period, from April to June 2020. They found there were overall improvements in aspects of children's wellbeing, such as sleep and happiness with family, compared with similar surveys in the previous two years. However, children receiving free school meals ate fewer fruit and vegetables, while more disadvantaged children also reported a reduction in physical activity. Read more of the findingshere.

"UK car production fell sharply last month, marking the worst July performance for the industry since 1956, a trade group has said. The global microchip shortage, staff being affected by the so-called pingdemic, and shutdowns meant just 53,438 cars were built in the month. That was a drop of 37.6% compared to July last year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said. It comes as sales ofsecond-hand vehicles are soaring. Overall car production in the year to date is almost a fifth higher than during 2020 at 552,361 vehicles, but that is still 28.7% down on 2019 pre-pandemic levels. SMMT boss Mike Hawes said the July figures ""lay bare the extremely tough conditions UK car manufacturers continue to face"". ""While the impact of the 'pingdemic' will lessen as self-isolation rules change, the worldwide shortage of semiconductors shows little sign of abating,"" he said. New cars often include dozens of microchips - also called semiconductors - but a shortage has put pressure on a number of carmakers, who are competing directly with tech companies and the consumer electronics sector for supply. At the beginning of the pandemic, many car manufacturers cancelled orders due to fears of a long downturn in sales. However, as demand started to recover, companies found themselves at the back of the queue for microchips. Manufacturers have had to grapple with absent workers as coronavirus restrictions eased due to employees being pinged by the NHS Covid app. Chip shortage: Toyota to cut global production by 40% Intel chief warns of two-year chip shortage How will 'chipageddon' affect you? Analysts at Goldman Sachs have predicted that the automotive sector is set to be hit hard by the chip shortage, with up to $20bn (Â£14bn) wiped off global carmakers' operating profits in 2021. The SMMT also revealed that car exports from the UK fell 37.4% in July, with just over 45,000 vehicles shipped overseas. However, demand for alternatively-fuelled models is picking up.  More than a quarter of all cars made in July were either battery electric or hybrid electric, the SMMT said, the highest share on record. ""The UK automotive industry is doing what it can to keep production lines going, testament to the adaptability of its workforce and manufacturing processes,"" Mr Hawes added. ""But government can help by continuing the supportive Covid measures currently in place and boosting our competitiveness with a reduction in energy levies and business rates for a sector that is strategically important in delivering net zero."" The car industry is a vital part of the UK economy accounting for Â£78.9bn turnover. It employs some 180,000 people in manufacturing and 864,000 across the wider supply chain. More than 30 manufacturers build around 70 car models in the UK.

"This video can not be played The former RAF paramedic said interpreters were âvitalâ to their work A former paramedic who served in Afghanistan has described seeing her interpreter and his family arrive safely in the UK as ""very emotional"". Rachel Pompa, from Swansea, was based in Helmand province in 2006 and 2007, treating casualties during the war. One of the people she worked most closely with during that time was her Afghan interpreter. She remained friends with Mohammad - not his real name, and they have kept in touch for the past 15 years. She said: ""Our contact built more recently, from the end of 2020, as he was part of a bigger process to try to move to America or the UK, but as things have escalated so fast and they were in extreme danger, he's managed to make it to the UK."" How are councils in Wales helping Afghan refugees? Afghan working women to stay at home for now Mum hopes soldier son's death wasn't in vain Mohammad arrived in the UK a few days ago with his wife and five children. They are currently in quarantine at a hotel in England and waiting to find out where in the UK they will be able to live. Speaking via video call from his hotel room, Mohammad told Ms Pompa: ""The last couple of weeks was very difficult and no-one was expecting this. ""To get to the airport for us was very, very difficult. The Taliban was beating people but finally we get here. Unfortunately, there are still some friends stuck in Kabul. ""Getting to the British forces inside the airport is very difficult. There are like six, seven [Taliban] check points before you get there."" Mohammad also said he knew of another interpreter friend who managed to make it into the airport, but his wife was still stuck outside. Ms Pompa said much of her work as a paramedic in Afghanistan would not have been possible without the help of Afghan interpreters. ""We had a couple of interpreters attached to us and they were with us throughout, sleeping in our tents, coming on every mission, they were with us 24/7,"" she said. ""We couldn't have done our jobs without them, especially given the casualties we were picking up at the time weren't just British soldiers. ""They were sometimes Afghan nationals, French, as well as Taliban. We needed their linguistic skills to be able to interpret for us - they were absolutely vital,"" she said. Rachel Pompa served in Afghanistan where she worked with the interpreter Ms Pompa recalls a particular incident she experienced alongside Mohammad when they came under fire from the Taliban as they arrived in an area with 24 casualties. She said they managed to evacuate them all and return them safely to the field hospital. ""I can't thank everyone enough really. From the Chinook pilots, the crew and the Afghan interpreters who risked their lives to help us,"" she said. Reflecting on her time in Afghanistan and seeing the Taliban tighten its grip on the country once again, she added: ""It saddens me that 20 years ago we started making a difference. ""I think we did make a difference. ""I'm proud to have served in Afghanistan and proud to have helped. ""We did save lives. The country was in a better position for our work there and now it's just really sad and frightening about what could happen next and sad to think of the families that are there. ""The Afghan people are lovely, lovely people and no country should face what they're currently facing."" Mohammad told Ms Pompa he feels very safe now he is in the UK with his family. He said: ""I feel like I am with my own people."" Ms Pompa has already paid a short visit to see him, stopping by the hotel where Mohammad and his family remain in quarantine to drop off donations of clothes and toiletries. After posting on Facebook about the arrival of Afghan refugees in the UK, she said she has been ""overwhelmed"" by the number of donations from friends and others in the local area. She added Mohammad hopes it might be possible to move his family to Wales in the future. ""I did see them at the weekend to drop off some donations. I managed to see them from their hotel balcony for five minutes and it was very, very emotional. I don't think any of us could believe it's actually happened. ""We hope to meet up as families and help his children settle here. It's heart-warming. He has five children and I have two and they are similar ages. My girls want to help his children settle in this country if they can. It makes me proud.""

"The UK boss of Uber is to meet with the new leader of a trade union for the first time since a landmark court ruling on workers' rights. Jamie Heywood and GMB's Gary Smith seek to end years of discord over the ride-hailing giant's business practices. Uber recognised the union for the first time in Mayafter the Supreme Court ruled its drivers should be classed as workers and entitled to better rights. The bosses said ""the exploitation"" of all ride-hailing drivers must stop. In a joint statement ahead of the meeting, Uber and GMB said an estimated 230,000 drivers were not receiving ""their legal rights"" from companies such as Bolt and Addison Lee. Uber 'willing to change' as drivers get minimum wage However, Addison Lee boss Liam Griffin rejected the claims, saying drivers were ""at the heart"" of his business. ""We guarantee the drivers that work with us get the London Living Wage level of earnings, as opposed to only the National Minimum Wage paid by Uber,"" he said. ""Drivers working with Addison Lee also get access to a pension and holiday pay."" Bolt said record numbers continued to earn through Bolt ""because they can take home more money"". ""We don't take business advice from competitors motivated by their own agenda,"" it added. Former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam spearheaded a battle that began six years ago to grant Uber drivers worker status Separately, the former Uber drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, who spearheaded the Supreme Court case against Uber, accused the ride hailing giant of running a ""propaganda"" campaign. The App Drivers & Couriers Union (ADCU) leaders accused the firm of failing to implement the court's ruling by not paying drivers for waiting time, which they said made up 40% of drivers' working hours. The BBC has approached Uber for a comment. Under the May deal between Uber and GMB, the union will be able to represent up to 70,000 Uber drivers across the UK in discussions over earnings, pensions, benefits and their health and wellbeing. The agreement came after Uber lost the third and final stage of a five-year legal battle with drivers who claimed it had wrongly classified their employment status. For years, Uber resisted calls to recognise unions, which had criticised the firm for not granting drivers basic rights such as sick pay or a minimum wage. It argued it was a third-party booking agent, and its drivers were self-employed, but the Supreme Court ruled its drivers were workers, a category that means they are entitled to minimum legal, holiday and pension rights. Mr Smith, GMB's general secretary, said the deal with Uber was the ""first step towards a fairer working life for millions of people"". ""It showed that when companies and trade unions work together, standards can be raised across these industries,"" he said He said the Supreme Court ruling had set a precedent for all ride-hailing apps and urged others to follow. ""GMB and Uber today take the next step in our commitment to ending the exploitation of hundreds of thousands of ride-hailing app drivers,"" Mr Smith said. Jamie Heywood, Uber's regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe, said he hoped working with GMB would ""show the rest of the industry what can be achieved"". ""We may not seem like obvious allies, but together we made history by striking a recognition agreement to improve workers' protections and, crucially, give drivers a stronger say in how Uber operates,"" he added. Mr Heywood told the BBC that UK employment law had been ""extremely ambiguous"" on issues such as who was an employee and who was self-employed. The Supreme Court had now ""clarified"" the law and given Uber the ""mechanism"" that it needed to act, he said. When it was put to him that Uber had spent years exploiting that very ambiguity, he denied the charge, saying the firm was now able to ""keep the flexibility that workers value, but also provide them with the protection that they deserve"". On the issue of whether Uber Eats riders would receive the same protection, Mr Heywood said he was ""committed to providing good flexible work across both our Eats and our rides business"". However, he said the law was different for people in the Eats business, since the Court of Appeal had ruled in June that Deliveroo riders were self-employed and not employees of the company. Employment experts and unions have heralded Uber's deal with GMB as a big step forward for workers' rights that would be felt across the gig economy. However, the UK is the only country in which Uber has recognised a union, and it is still being challenged by drivers in other markets over similar issues. Mr Griffin, chief executive of Addison Lee, said a decline in driver earnings and wellbeing across the industry was a ""product of Uber's operating practices and predatory pricing model"", which had led to a race to the bottom and threatened driver livelihoods. Responding to the comments, Uber said its drivers were making ""more than ever before driving with Uber, so the claim of a race to the bottom is totally untrue"".

"A lack of funding for rural youth work in England is leaving young people exposed to the dangers of county lines drug-dealing gangs, it is claimed. The amount spent per head on youth work for 11- to 19-year-olds in rural England, Â£47, is 25% less than in urban areas, and half the level a decade ago. The National Youth Agency said rural employment prospects and mental-health support access were also a concern. The government said it had given youth-work charities Â£100m over the pandemic. But the National Youth Agency is calling for it to implement a long-term spending plan. County-lines gangs often use vulnerable children to help them bring illegal drugs into areas across the UK - and move money out. The National Youth Agency said it had seen an ""increasing trend"" for young people in county towns and rural areas to be targeted. Youth workers were vital in protecting those at risk by providing a known and trusted adult, chief executive Leigh Middleton told BBC News. But, he added: ""As local authority budgets have shrunk, [resources have] gone to our towns and cities."" Youth work can take many forms, supporting young people of all ages. In Bridgwater, Somerset, 17-year-old Dan has struggled for work. ""In the smaller towns, there is not really much you can do, or look into, to get a job,"" he said. ""They are mainly in the cities and bigger towns."" Dan, 17, has struggled for employment opportunities Poor social mobility is a key issue in rural areas, campaigners say. And there are often fewer vocational courses on offer. But Dan's local youth service, Young Somerset, is trying to combat this. And through the charity's provision, he has achieved a qualification in mechanics. ""It has opened up a better opportunity for me with apprenticeships,"" he said. ""It has helped me for the future."" The charity Young Somerset supports young people of all ages across the county In the Quantock Hills, a group of 12- and 13-year-olds taking part in Young Somerset's summer activities are lighting campfires and learning about habitat conservation. And as they sit smiling in the woodland, they are keen to express how much they have enjoyed their day. ""I'm glad I've done this,"" Tavey says. ""[If I was at home], I'd probably be sat on my bed watching YouTube."" Elissa, 18, says she relied on Young Somerset for mental health support during the pandemic Young Somerset also runs wellbeing services and a shop to help young people who have special educational needs learn life skills. And with services becoming stretched during the pandemic, the charity said it had seen an ""influx"" of young people seeking mental-health support. One of them, Elissa, 18, began feeling isolated while furloughed from work. ""I'd already struggled with mental wellbeing beforehand - and I think lockdown just made it worse,"" she said. Elissa joined online groups run by Young Somerset, meeting new friends - and now has a volunteering role with the charity to help others. ""Reaching out to Young Somerset, and gaining that trust with them, made it much easier [to cope with my anxiety],"" she said. Anntoinette Bramble, of the Local Government Association, told BBC News ""increasing demand and cost pressures"" meant local authorities were having to cut youth services ""to prioritise spend on looked-after children and child-protection services"". The Department for Culture, Media and Sport said its Â£500m Youth Investment Fund, ""designed to achieve levelling up across the country"", remained a manifesto commitment by the end of this Parliament, in 2024.

Police believe the man was acting alone. A Hammersmith and Fulham Council spokesman said shoppers at the three supermarkets ""are advised to bin anything bought after 18.00 BST on the evening of Wednesday 25 August,"" ""If you suspect any of the items purchased may be contaminated, please keep hold of these items and contact the police,"" the spokesman added. There was a police presence outside Tesco Express The Metropolitan Police said officers were called at about 19:40 BST after a man was reported to be shouting abuse at people in the street. The Met said: ""It is currently unknown as to how many items have been contaminated, or what with. Investigations are ongoing to establish if other businesses in the area are involved in the incident."" A Little Waitrose shopper, who lives on the same street as the stores, told the BBC: ""It is a bit a worrying because I was buying milk at the time and the police were escorting everyone out.

"Taxi driver Chris is obsessively checking his phone for updates. ""I'm set to lose almost 2,500 euros (Â£2,100) worth of cryptocurrency coins,"" he says. Chris describes himself as ""a small crypto-holder from Austria"" and is one of many victims ofa hack attack on cryptocurrency exchange Liquid Global last week. The company has insisted it will pay all customers who lost out in the $100m (Â£72.8m) attack. But until they get the money back, many customers are worried. Every time 38-year-old Chris picks up a customer in his ageing Volkswagen, he's reminded of what's at stake. ""My car is more than 20 years old and I could have bought a new used car with that money,"" says Chris. ""It's not catastrophic, but still quite a sum for me. I need at least one year to save that sum."" According to the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, there are now 2.3 million cryptocurrency investors in the UK alone, up from 1.9 million last year. In Indonesia, 27-year-old Dina says she is in shock. ""I'm feeling so angry with the hackers, and I'm feeling stress for myself. I have around $30,000 and I need that money to live on. I'm just a housewife trying to make money from crypto."" At the other end of the scale, a 42-year-old Norwegian doctor says he is struggling to concentrate, because he could lose a fortune that he's watched grow over the years. ""My Liquid balance is 969,000 euros. It's extremely worrying to me and my stress is at eight out of 10. I'm always thinking about it."" In Sydney, James describes the stress the hack has put on his parents, who managed to cash out at a loss before the company blocked transactions. ""My mum and dad had one Bitcoin on there, so about 70,000 Australian dollars (Â£37,000). It was, and is, a lot of money to them. ""There's obviously stress created. At first they had no idea what was happening, then they felt they were basically forced to sell in a panic and withdraw which means they lost about A$10,000."" Liquid Global was hacked last week, with the money unlikely to be recovered. The Japanese firm said on Wednesday that it is carrying out a robust security review and wants to ""reassure users that they will not suffer any loss due to the incident"". Many customers have complained that they were not informed directly about the hack and wouldn't have known about it unless they saw the company's tweets or read the news. Exchanges like Liquid are a vital part of the growing world of cryptocurrency. They are the websites that allow people to buy and sell digital coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and a place where many people leave their coins for safekeeping. However, the safety of exchanges is questionable. Crypto hacker offered reward after $600m heist Hackers steal nearly $100m in Japan crypto heist The new trick cyber-criminals use to cash out Earlier this month,another crypto platform called Poly Network was also hacked,and lost $610m of its customers' funds. Dozens of other hacks against cryptocurrency platforms have seen at least Â£1.6bn stolen by hackers since 2014. BitGrail: $146m was hacked from the Italian exchange in 2018. It's estimated that 230,000 BitGrail users lost funds. KuCoin:$281m was stolen by suspected North Korean hackers from this attack on the Seychelles-based exchange in 2020. The company recovered most of the funds and refunded customers. MtGox:$450m of mainly Bitcoin was hacked in 2014 which collapsed the Japanese exchange. None of the customers have been reimbursed yet. Coincheck: $534m was stolen in 2018 from the Japanese exchange. Customers were eventually reimbursed. Poly Network:$610m was hacked from the Chinese platform earlier this month in various coins. The hacker returned all the funds and customers have started being reimbursed. Incidents involving tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions, of dollars are happening almost every few months and, because these platforms are largely unregulated, there's no guarantee that customers get their money back. There have been cases of customers losing every digital penny or only being partially refunded - affectionately known as 'taking a hair cut'. ""There will be zero hair cuts,"" Seth Melamed, chief operating officer of Liquid Global,tweeted on Tuesday.,external Financial commentator Frances Coppola says cryptocurrency systems are not learning lessons about security fast enough. ""The standard banking system is incredibly protective about security and it is regulated to death about it,"" she said. ""Banks are actually suffering hacking attacks all the time. They're just better defended, and also they have responsibility to reimburse their customers, which cryptocurrency platforms don't have."" She says it's individual users who are more likely to be hacked or defrauded in traditional banking systems, which is happening all the time and costing millions. Dr Amber Ghaddar, who has worked for big banks and is now a founder at crypto platform AllianceBlock, says traditional banking has seen its fair share of big hacks too. She points to the hack of $1 billion suffered by the Bangladesh central bank in 2016 of which $81m are still missing, and the incident at Union Bank of India that same year that saw hackers steal $171m, which was later recovered. In each case, no customers lost out. This video can not be played WATCH: Inside the Bitcoin mine with its own power plant Dr Ghaddar says crypto-hacks are a symptom of a still new sector that's growing too fast. ""Part of the problem is that these systems are built on open source technology. Open source is great because it uses the collective intelligence of a community to improve software and protocols, but one of the flip sides of open source is that some brilliant mind out there might find some weakness in the code."" Dr Ghaddar thinks that the only way to prevent these attacks from happening is to bring in more regulation and rules. ""We need auditing and testing. We need to have various standards that need to be monitored in order to protect market integrity if we really want cryptocurrency to reach mass adoption."" As well as cyber-attacks, everyday investors have been stung over the years by other types of crypto-catastrophe like so-called exit scams and rug pulls. Investigators are still trying to ascertain how many millions, or maybe even hundreds of millions, were lost in the mysterious demise of the Africrypt exchange which collapsed earlier this year when the founders disappeared. Customers of Canadian exchange QuadrigaCX are also still fighting for reimbursement afterits founder died leaving $135m of coins unaccounted forin 2019. The traditional finance system is of course littered with victims of large-scale pyramid schemes and other fraud which probably outweigh the losses in the cryptocurrency world. But despite rapid growth, the crypto market is far smaller overall and recent history points to an industry-wide security problem. As the $600m hacker warned in a recent public post: ""We, the hackers, are the armed forces. If you are given weapons and guarding billions from the crowd while being anonymous, will you be a terrorist or the Batman?""

"NHS England has admitted that a shortage of vials used for blood tests will worsen over the next few weeks and will last until mid-September. Itsaid supplies remain constrained,externaland are forecast ""to become even more constrained over the coming weeks"". While the NHS expects the position to improve by the middle of next month, ""overall supply is likely to remain challenging for a significant period."" Doctors had been told to stagger some blood tests due to the shortage. They are warning that patient care will suffer due to delays. It comes after Becton Dickinson, a company that makes vials for the health service, said it is experiencing serious supply chain issues. Due to the shortage, the NHS has temporarily stopped some blood testing for fertility, pre-diabetes, allergies and certain blood disorders. NHS England issuedguidance,externalurging doctors to delay regular blood tests if clinically safe and NHS Walesissued similar guidance. In its guidance, NHS England said ""alternative products are being sought to alleviate these constraints,"" as a result of the global shortages of blood tube products. Dr Farah Jameel, a GP based in north London and a representative from the British Medical Association trade body said she was having ""difficult conversations"" with patients about rationing the vials ""among the very sickest"". Dr Jameel is having ""incredibly challenging"" conversations with patients about delayed blood tests. She said there has been ""very unclear messaging from NHS England on how quickly we're going to run short and what the impact will be on patient care."" ""The NHS needs to communicate clearly with the public and with the profession so there is a clear understanding of the problems which will help us manage expectations,"" Dr Jameel said. ""These tests are a fundamental part of patient care, giving us essential insights into different conditions, warning signs and overall health."" Doctor Gavin Jamie, an GP based in Swindon agreed that preventative care is going to be slower, in addition to screening delays cause by the pandemic which he said he's still trying to catch up on. ""We've not seen the full effect yet but it looks like it could carry on for at least a few months from the time scale NHS England have been giving us,"" he added. GPs across the country have tweeted about the difficulties the shortage is causing, while patients have tweeted texts from their surgeries which have said their blood tests have been cancelled. Alison Webb's blood tests have been delayed by four months due to the shortages Alison Webb, from Wales, told the BBC she was told that she can't have her yearly thyroid and cholesterol checked due to the blood tube shortages. She has a condition which means the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones and said her blood tests are currently overdue by four months. ""Now I've been told to ring again in a month's time. Terrible,"" she said. The medical device company, Becton Dickinson, which partly manufactures its tubes in the US, said the need to test Covid-19 patients in addition to routine testing for procedures which were delayed due to the pandemic had increased demand. Responding to the new NHS guidance, theBritish Medical Association,externalsaid that healthcare staff were ""still no closer to understanding how this situation was able to develop and why there wasn't a contingency plan"". ""Today's guidance does not explain what will happen if hospitals or GP surgeries do run out of stock, and this must be addressed as a matter of urgency,"" said Dr David Wrigley, deputy chair of BMA council. ""No doctor wants the consequence of delayed diagnosis for patients due to these shortages, and they also need to know they are protected from any possible negligence claims,"" he added. Like many other industries, Becton Dickinson said in addition to increased demand, it was experiencing ""continued transportation challenges"", which included port and transport capacity, air freight capacity and UK border challenges. ""Suppliers are also challenged to meet increased demand for raw materials and components,"" the firm told the BBC. ""We are balancing the frequency of preventive maintenance leading to plant shutdown to provide continuing supply of products, and we are working closely with our raw material suppliers, transport agencies and other necessary third parties to minimize supply disruptions,"" a spokesperson added. A spokesperson for the Department for Health and Social Care told the BBC: ""Patient safety and continuity of care is our priority and we are working to ensure there is minimal possible impact on patient care. ""The health and care system is working closely with Becton Dickinson to put mitigations in place to resolve any problems if they arise,"" they added. Diabetes UK expressed concerns for the 13.6 million people in the country at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes can develop more slowly than those for type 1. Nikki Joule, policy manager at the charity, said the supply issues would make the condition ""harder to spot"" and said it's ""very important"" that those at risk ""do not fall through the cracks due to a logistical issue."" Gwenda Burns, chief executive of Fertility Network UK agrees that the logistical issue is ""extremely worrying"" for those awaiting fertility tests.

"OnlyFans has announced that it will delay making changes to policy on content creation, following a widespread backlash by its users. The content subscription service announced plans last week toblock sexually explicit photos and videos from October. On Wednesday, it tweeted that it has ""suspended the planned 1 October policy change"". It is currently unclear if the delay will be permanent. OnlyFans wrote on twitter that it would ""continue to provide a home for all creators"". ""Thank you to everyone for making your voices heard,"" said the company. ""We have secured assurances necessary to support our diverse creator community and have suspended the planned 1 October policy change. ""OnlyFans stands for inclusion and we will continue to provide a home for all creators."" And in an email to its content creators, it said: ""The proposed 1 October 2021 changes are no longer required, due to banking partners' assurances that OnlyFans can support all genres of creators. ""OnlyFans is committed to providing a safe and dependable platform for all creators and their fans."" One OnlyFans creator, from London, welcomed the announcement but said those who had already found new homes for their content may still not return. ""So it is short-term good news for sex workers reliant on the platform - and I would like to see this as the start of increased support, celebration and championing of sex-worker rights by OnlyFans,"" he told BBC News. OnlyFans: How it handles illegal sex videos Under the skin of OnlyFans OnlyFans must act on underage use, watchdog says ""But I think there may well have been enough anxiety caused to see many models continuing the move to other platforms."" OnlyFans makes its money by taking 20% of all payments made to its content creators. The platform reported a 75% increase in new creators in May last year, during lockdown. Wariness from investors was originally claimed to be the reason for last week's announcement. But founder Tim Stokely blamed banks penalising the company for supporting sex workers. ""JPMorgan Chase is particularly aggressive in closing accounts of sex workers or...â any business that supports sex workers,"" he told theFinancial Times,externalon Tuesday. But a JPMorgan spokeswoman told BBC News it had ""no such policy"". In June, a BBC News investigation foundchildren had used fake ID to set up accounts on the site. And the children's commissioner for England said OnlyFans needed to do more to stop under-age users. In response to the investigation, OnlyFans said it had closed the accounts flagged and refunded all active subscriptions.

"UK car production fell sharply last month, marking the worst July performance for the industry since 1956, a trade group has said. The global microchip shortage, staff being affected by the so-called pingdemic, and shutdowns meant just 53,438 cars were built in the month. That was a drop of 37.6% compared to July last year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said. It comes as sales ofsecond-hand vehicles are soaring. Overall car production in the year to date is almost a fifth higher than during 2020 at 552,361 vehicles, but that is still 28.7% down on 2019 pre-pandemic levels. SMMT boss Mike Hawes said the July figures ""lay bare the extremely tough conditions UK car manufacturers continue to face"". ""While the impact of the 'pingdemic' will lessen as self-isolation rules change, the worldwide shortage of semiconductors shows little sign of abating,"" he said. New cars often include dozens of microchips - also called semiconductors - but a shortage has put pressure on a number of carmakers, who are competing directly with tech companies and the consumer electronics sector for supply. At the beginning of the pandemic, many car manufacturers cancelled orders due to fears of a long downturn in sales. However, as demand started to recover, companies found themselves at the back of the queue for microchips. Manufacturers have had to grapple with absent workers as coronavirus restrictions eased due to employees being pinged by the NHS Covid app. Chip shortage: Toyota to cut global production by 40% Intel chief warns of two-year chip shortage How will 'chipageddon' affect you? Analysts at Goldman Sachs have predicted that the automotive sector is set to be hit hard by the chip shortage, with up to $20bn (Â£14bn) wiped off global carmakers' operating profits in 2021. The SMMT also revealed that car exports from the UK fell 37.4% in July, with just over 45,000 vehicles shipped overseas. However, demand for alternatively-fuelled models is picking up.  More than a quarter of all cars made in July were either battery electric or hybrid electric, the SMMT said, the highest share on record. ""The UK automotive industry is doing what it can to keep production lines going, testament to the adaptability of its workforce and manufacturing processes,"" Mr Hawes added. ""But government can help by continuing the supportive Covid measures currently in place and boosting our competitiveness with a reduction in energy levies and business rates for a sector that is strategically important in delivering net zero."" The car industry is a vital part of the UK economy accounting for Â£78.9bn turnover. It employs some 180,000 people in manufacturing and 864,000 across the wider supply chain. More than 30 manufacturers build around 70 car models in the UK.
