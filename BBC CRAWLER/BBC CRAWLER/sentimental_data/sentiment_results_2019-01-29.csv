"The global smartphone market is contracting Apple boss Tim Cook has hinted it could lower iPhone prices in some places in an attempt to boost falling sales. Revenue from the iPhone, responsible for most of the firm's profits, fell 15% in its latest financial quarter. Overall the firm's revenue was down 5% from a year ago to about $84.3bn (Â£64.5bn). The slowdown had been expected after the tech giant warned investors earlier this month that revenue would be about $84bn, lower than expected. The firm had blamed the issuespartly on an economic slowdown in China. But chief executive Tim Cook said customers were also struggling with the firm's high prices. He said a strong dollar, which makes its products comparatively more expensive, had hurt its sales in emerging markets. At the moment, according to Apple's official website, an iPhone Xs with a 5.8in display costs from $999 (Â£763) in the US compared with Â£999 in the UK and 8,699 Yuan (Â£989) in China. Mr Cook said the tech giant had started this month to re-price its phones to shield customers from the impact of currency fluctuations. ""What we have done in January in some locations and [for] some products is essentially absorb part or all of the foreign currency move as compared to last year,"" he said. Still, executives said they expected the firm's challenges to continue. Apple predicted revenue for the three months to 31 March of $55bn-$59bn - suggesting a drop of at least 3.4% year-on-year. ""The macroeconomic environment, particularly in emerging markets, will continue to be there,"" Luca Maestri, the firm's chief financial officer, said. Apple's struggles are not unique. Global smart phone shipments contracted 5% in 2018, according to Canalys, a market analyst firm. But the firm's share price has dropped by around one third since October, amid investor concerns that buyer appetite for iPhones is weakening. Fears intensified after the firm said it would stop reporting the number of iPhones, iPads and Macs it sold each quarter. However, Apple shares gained more than 4% in after-hours trade on Tuesday, as the firm proved more resilient than expected. Quarterly sales revenue dropped by more than 25% in its Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, compared to the year before. Sales also slipped about 3% year-on-year in Europe. But in the Americas - the firm's single biggest region - sales were up almost 5%. Revenue from the services business also jumped 19% to a record $10.9bn in the quarter, which ended on the 31 December. It's Apple's worst performing quarter for years, but that's not to say investors won't be mildly relieved. After the firm's warning earlier this month that it would be posting earnings well below expectations for what is typically its blockbuster quarter, investors were well-prepared to see the drop in iPhone sales, and as a result, revenues overall. That bad news was balanced out - perhaps even cancelled out - by the good news on services. A big increase compared to this time last year - 19% - and a very healthy gross margin of 62.8%. Apple is transitioning, slowly, into a different kind of company that isn't so reliant on hardware, and these numbers show that so far that transition is going well. With $245bn cash in hand, it can afford to splash out and make investors even happier with a major acquisition or two in the entertainment space (but then, I've been saying that for a while now!). Mr Cook said he remained confident in the business, pointing to strong sales of iPad and Macs, as well as growth in its services division, which includes Apple Pay. Overall profit in the quarter fell less than 1% to $19.97bn. ""While it was disappointing to miss our revenue guidance, we manage Apple for the long term, and this quarter's results demonstrate that the underlying strength of our business runs deep and wide,""  he said.

"This video can not be played Mr GuaidÃ³ urged Venezuelans to ""choose freedom, democracy and prosperity"" Venezuela's opposition leader has told the BBC that people are living in a ""dictatorship"", and renewed his calls for fresh elections. Juan GuaidÃ³ declared himself interim president last week. While the US and others back him, President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has major allies too including Russia. Meanwhile, Attorney General Tarek William Saab has ordered that Mr GuaidÃ³ be barred from leaving Venezuela and have his assets frozen. In a statement on Tuesday, Mr Saab's office said violent incidents and interference from foreign governments suggested ""the commission of serious crimes that attack the constitutional order"". At least 40 people are believed to have died and hundreds have been arrested since 21 January, the UN says. Protests have been growing since Mr Maduro began a second term as president this month. He was elected last year during a controversial vote in which many opposition candidates were barred from running, or jailed. Why Venezuela's military is backing Maduro Venezuela crisis - in seven charts What's behind Venezuela's political crisis? Venezuela has been struggling with a massive economic crisis. Hyperinflation and shortages of essentials such as food and medicine have forced millions to flee the nation. This video can not be played Desperate Venezuelan women are selling their hair at the border Speaking to BBC Mundo in Caracas on Monday, he defended his claim to be interim leader. Mr GuaidÃ³ said the Venezuelan constitution allowed him, as the head of the National Assembly, to take power when the president was considered to be illegitimate. Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? ""My duty is to call for free elections because there is an abuse of power and we live in a dictatorship,"" Mr GuaidÃ³ said. He added: ""In Venezuela, we either accept domination, total oppression and torture... from Maduro's regime, or we choose freedom, democracy and prosperity for our people."" Mr GuaidÃ³ said the Maduro administration was ""killing young poor people"" in the streets. This video can not be played Who's really in charge in Venezuela? The BBC's Paul Adams explains He has pledged to act as interim leader to oversee fresh elections. However, his declaration of leadership has divided the international community. Mr GuaidÃ³ has called for further demonstrations this week, after tens of thousands came out to protest against Mr Maduro last Wednesday. On Monday US National Security Adviser John Bolton announced sanctions against Venezuela's state-owned oil firm PDVSA to ensure that President Maduro could ""no longer loot the assets of the Venezuelan people"". He also hinted at possible military action, reiterating that ""all options are on the table"". Mr Bolton appeared at a news briefing with a notepad containing the words ""5,000 troops to Colombia"", which borders Venezuela. On Tuesday acting US Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan declined to say whether the Pentagon was considering sending troops. ""I haven't discussed that with Secretary Bolton,"" he told reporters. Maduro: Dictator or defender of socialism? How Venezuelans stave off hunger Also on Tuesday, the United States said it has handed control of Venezuela's US bank accounts to Mr GuaidÃ³. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the sanctions violated ""all possible international norms"" and ""pledged to do everything to support the legitimate government of President Maduro"". In New York, Venezuelan ambassador to the UN Jorge Valero accused the US administration of preparing a ""military invasion"". Venezuela broke off relations with the US last week in response to its recognition of Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim leader and ordered all US diplomats to leave the country. On Tuesdaythe state department issued a travel advisory,externalurging US nationals not to go to Venezuela because of ""civil unrest, poor health infrastructure, and arbitrary arrest and detention of US citizens"". More than 20 countries have followed the US in recognising Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim president. Russia, China and Turkey are among those who have publicly backed Mr Maduro. On Saturday, several European countries including Spain, Germany, France and the UK said they would recognise Mr GuaidÃ³ as president if elections were not called within eight days.

"Bruce McArthur was arrested last January and pled guilty on 18 January 2019 A Toronto landscaper accused of killing eight men who went missing between 2010-17 has pleaded guilty to their murders. Bruce McArthur, 67, was arrested last January and charged in the deaths of two men, and police subsequently charged him in six other cases. Most of his victims had links to Toronto's Gay Village neighbourhood. Many of the victims' remains were found in plant pots on one property in Toronto's Leaside neighbourhood. Toronto serial killer destroyed gay safe space Who were Bruce McArthur's victims? Each of the first-degree murder charges carry an automatic life sentence, meaning he will not be able to apply for release until the age of 91. His sentencing hearing will begin on 4 February, in which friends and relatives will be give impact statements, describing how the killings have affected their lives. The victims clockwise from upper left: Selim Esen, Andrew Kinsman, Majeed Kayhan, Dean Lisowick, Kirushna Kumar Kanagaratnam, Abdulbasir Faizi, Skandaraj Navaratnam, Soroush Mahmudi The judge must also decide whether to sentence him to consecutive life sentences, or whether he can serve eight life sentences concurrently. In court on Tuesday, Crown prosecutor Michael Cantlon described how McArthur had ""staged"" and photographed the victims, keeping mementos such as jewellery and a notebook. He described all of the crimes as ""sexual in nature"", adding that there is evidence he tied the victims up during the murders. While many of the remains were buried in planters at 53 Mallory Crescent in Toronto, where McArthur worked as a gardener, others were buried in a nearby ravine. McArthur had an agreement with the home's elderly residents to store his landscaping equipment there in exchange for free lawn care, according to the authorities. Police say they found a duffle bag with duct tape, a surgical glove, rope, zip ties, a black bungee cord and syringes in his bedroom when they searched his property, according to court documents. They say that some of the victims were killed during a sexual assault or while being ""unlawfully confined"". The arrest launched a massive investigation that spanned Canada's largest city, one of the largest such investigations in the history of Toronto police. Investigators searched dozens of properties linked to the self-employed landscaper and looked into cold cases dating back decades. A bagpiper played a lament for victims on the one year anniversary of McArthur's arrest By Robin Levinson-King in the Toronto court In a packed courtroom, Bruce McArthur's eight guilty pleas marked the beginning of the end of a saga that has haunted Toronto's LGBT community for years. Dressed in a black cable-knit sweater and a plaid shirt, McArthur spoke softly and matter-of-factly when addressing the court, which was filled with family and friends of his victims. As the plea deal was read, they were stoic, but outside of the courtroom, many embraced with signs of relief in their eyes. For years, rumours of a serial killer stalking Toronto's Gay Village has left the city's LGBT community afraid. McArthur's conviction, and his subsequent sentencing to life in prison, will bring closure for many. But nagging questions remain: how did he get away with it for so long? Why did he do it? So far, all of the eight victims except one had ties to the city's Gay Village. Many were immigrants from South Asia or the Middle East. Members of Toronto's LGBT community have criticised police, saying they did not take their concerns about the missing men seriously. The first two alleged victims were identified in January as Andrew Kinsman, 49, and Selim Esen, 44, who both went missing in 2017. Since then, police have named Skandaraj Navaratnam, 40, who disappeared on Labour Day weekend in 2010; Soroush Mahmudi, 50, reported missing in 2015; Dean Lisowick, 47, who is believed to have been killed in April 2016; Abdulbasir Faizi, 42, who disappeared in 2010; Majeed Kayhan, 58, who disappeared in 2012; and Kirushna Kumar Kanagaratnam, 37, who police believe was killed in January 2016. Karen Fraser, one of the residents of the home where victims were recovered, told reporters outside the courthouse that the couple feels ""violated"" by the man they knew for more than a decade. ""What does remorse look like? I only saw a blank face,"" she said, calling him ""evil"" and a ""shuffling, broken man, as he should be"". She had previously met two of the victims, whom she did not name, at her property with McArthur. She said thinking about their last moments ""haunts her"". ""They're not just on a list or a photograph, they were people standing in front of me."" Mrs Fraser said that in her mind, there were two Bruce McArthurs: ""Bruce A"" and ""Bruce B"".

Alliance for South Asian AIDS Prevention Director Haran Vijayanathan, who has been speaking on behalf of many victims' families since McArthur's arrest, said they are grateful.

"Players from Arsenal and Cardiff observed a minute's silence to honour Emiliano Sala On the night he should have made his Cardiff City debut, players, staff and fans have paid an emotional tribute to missing striker Emiliano Sala. The 28-year-old is feared deadafter the plane he was on vanished eight days ago. Floral tributes were laid at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium -where Cardiff played their first gamesince Sala's disappearance. He was also named in the matchday programme squad list. A picture of a daffodil was placed next to where the former FC Nantes striker's name would have been, in a gesture described as ""an incredibly touching one"" by fans. ""It is a yellow flower, the flower of Wales and has significance to Nantes,"" said Cardiff chief executive Ken Choo. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Press Association's football correspondent Phil Blanche said the evening was a poignant one for players, staff and fans of the Welsh club. He said: ""Tonight would have been Sala's debut - he would have had a week's training and I would have expected he would have started the game. ""It's an emotional night for Cardiff City."" Despite Cardiff, losing the game 2-1, boss Neil Warnock said it was his side's best performance of the season. He added: ""We talked about Emiliano before the game and I thought it was appropriate that we gave a good account of ourselves against a good side."" Tributes were also paid at the evening's other Premier League matches - with silences taking place at the home grounds of Newcastle United, Wolves and Manchester United.

Cardiff fans who wouldn't normally travel to away games joined those who've been coming for decades. But tonight no-one seemed to care about the result. The evening belonged to one man and one man only: record signing Emilano Sala, whose disappearance has touched football fans across the globe. In and amongst the usual blue of the Cardiff City flags were Argentine flags draped over the shoulders of Bluebirds fans. He was praised in the match day programme notes by Arsenal boss Unai Emery And fans held aloft yellow signs - a reference to the Argentinean's former club FC Nantes. He may not have been on the pitch, but Sala was very much in everyone's minds and in their hearts. Salasigned for the Bluebirds from Nantes on 19 Januaryand was flying back to Wales from France when the plane disappeared from radar last Monday evening. At 19:15 GMT, pilot David Ibbotson made a request to descend before losing contact with Jersey air traffic control.

He added: ""He's a really friendly person that people loved - from both clubs and any other clubs, and that's where you see the breadth of the football community coming together in an extraordinarily short period of time to raise this type of money."" Speaking a press conference on Monday, Cardiff manager Warnock said he understood Sala's family's stance on keeping the search going. ""If it was my kid I'd want everybody looking forever,"" he added. ""It's by far the most difficult week in my career. Even now I can't get my head round the situation.""

"Lien de Jong was nine when she was taken in by Bart van Es's family A book about a young Jewish girl who was sheltered by the author's grandparents during World War Two has won the Costa Book of the Year award. Oxford professor Bart van Es picked up the Â£30,000 prize for The Cut Out Girl. He traces the story of the Dutch girl who was taken in at the age of nine by van Es's grandparents before her own parents were sent to Auschwitz. That girl was Lien de Jong, who is now in her mid-80s and attended Tuesday's ceremony in London. The judges - chaired by BBC News journalist Sophie Raworth - described the book as ""sensational and gripping - the hidden gem of the year"". De Jong told BBC Radio 4's Front Row she never realised her story could make such an impact. ""I'm very proud of this result and I never thought it could be a book,"" she said. Parents who saved their only child by giving her away Van Es said: ""There are two ways in which it could be a good book to have in the world. ""There's a scary way in which anti-Semitism and extreme nationalism and conspiracy theories are around in a way they weren't 10 years ago. But also another way in which it is quite a healing book."" The Costa Book of the Year was chosen from the winners from five individual categories. The Cut Out Girl won the biography prize, and the other category winners were: Novel - Sally Rooney, Normal People This is the second work of fiction from the 27-year-old Irish author who has taken the literary world by storm. It follows the on-off relationship between two Irish schoolfriends and won rave reviews when it was published last August. It was named the Waterstone's book of the year and is now being turned into a BBC drama. First novel - Stuart Turton, The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle Travel writer Turton's debut novel is a sci-fi murder mystery that channels Agatha Christie, Groundhog Day and Quantum Leap. Its main character relives a single day eight times - each time inhabiting a different person's body as he tries to work out who has committed murder in a country house. The TV rights were sold even before it was published last February. Poetry - JO Morgan, Assurances The Scottish poet's sixth book was inspired by his father's work as part of Bomber Command during the Cold War. It is a single long-form poem told from the perspectives of various characters, including pilots, planes, villagers and even the bombs. Children's - Hilary McKay, The Skylarks' War Clarry and Peter Penrose spend idyllic summers in Cornwall with their charismatic cousin Rupert - until he is sent to fight in World War One. The story follows Clarry from birth to adulthood and centres on the characters' quests to escape both the shadow of war and the social constraints of the time. Last year's overall winner was the late poet Helen Dunmore for her final collection, Inside the Wave.

"Another day, another critical moment for Brexit. On Tuesday evening, British MPs voted on what they want to get out of the deal to leave the European Union. It may not be clear what just happened in the British parliament, so we tried to explain it all here. The UK will leave the European Union on 29 March but British MPs still can't agree how. Prime Minister Theresa May is desperate for them to back a deal she struck and on Tuesday, they got the chance to make their own proposals for how the deal should look. Most proposals didn't get the support of the majority of MPs, but a key one did. This amendment means Mrs May has to return to the EU and try to negotiate a new deal (to sort out what kind of border there will be with Ireland). The issue? The EU says it already negotiated a deal, and won't do so again. There are only two months to go until Brexit and the British government still hasn't decided on what terms it should leave the European Union. Tuesday's events risk muddling the process even more. Brexit: A really simple guide All you need to know on Brexit Let's rewind to November 2018, when it looked like major progress had been made. In the two years after 52% of voters said they wanted the UK to leave, the British government and the EU were locked in negotiations on the terms of Brexit. Then, in November, Mrs May and EU leaders finally agreed a deal, and she said the British public did not ""want to spend any more time arguing about Brexit"". The deal had to be approved by the British parliament, but it was a tough sell to some members of her own Conservative party (more on that below), and they rejected it two weeks ago in one of the biggest defeats a government has seen. Please upgrade your browser MPs across all parties had a chance to suggest amendments to her deal, and vote on those too. In the end, MPs were allowed to vote on seven amendments, most of which didn't pass. But two of themdidpass: 1) Renegotiate the Irish border The deal Mrs May struck in Brussels ensured that there would not be a ""hard border"" between Ireland and Northern Ireland. This measure is called the backstop. This is the only place that has a border between the UK and the EU. No ""hard border"" would mean that goods would still be able to cross the border without checks. But this prospect has gone down badly with the influential hardline Brexit supporters in Mrs May's Conservative Party who want a clean break with Europe. On Tuesday, a majority of MPs said they now wanted anewdeal, one that made changes to the backstop. This is far easier said than done. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. 2) Avoid 'no deal' A majority of MPs also backed another amendment that rejected the UK leaving the EU without a deal (we explain why ""no deal"" worries people a little later). At least now we know where most MPs stand on this issue, but it doesn't really change anything: it's not as though they've suggestedhowthey hope to avoid leaving without a deal. Nor is this move legally binding: a no-deal Brexit could still happen. Who knows? In theory, Theresa May now has a mandate to ask the EU for new talks on the backstop. The problem is the EU doesn't want to, and doesn't see any reason why it should (our Europe editor Katya Adler has more detail on that here). It says the whole backstop issue has already been dealt with. Ireland, an EU member, doesn't want any change to the backstop deal either. How would 'no deal' look? Can Brexit be delayed? So if the EU doesn't want to reopen negotiations, and the British parliament can't find a compromise, what happens? We'd be facing a ""hard Brexit"": the UK would crash out of the EU on 29 March with no deal. This means the UK would leave suddenly, with no transition. There are real concerns over the damage a ""no deal"" could do: it could cause delays in bringing food and materials into the UK, and the price of some goods in British shops could shoot up. Bear in mind that the EU now alsoknowsthat a majority of British MPs don't want ""no deal"" to happen. This might strengthen their hand in any purely hypothetical negotiations that might take place. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks.

"PM clashed with Labour leader in the Commons at Prime Minister's Questions The prime minister discussed Brexit Jeremy Corbyn in Commons meeting Theresa May set for more talks with EU leaders MPs backed a proposal for her to renegotiate her Brexit deal The EU says the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation Richard Morris, Sophie Morris, Robbie Hawkins & Georgina Pattinson The EU's chief negotiator says the backstop will not be renegotiated, despite the UK's request. Irish foreign minister says preventing a hard border is ""more important than economic relationships"". The Brexit train has trundled on today, with reaction across Europe to the decision by Theresa May to return to Brussels and seek ""alternative arrangements"" to the Irish backstop. In the Commons at Prime Minister's Questions, Jeremy Corbyn and the prime minister battled over what was next, as the Labour leader sought further detail on what would change and where Mrs May was willing to compromise. Following PMQs, the two party leaders met for talks on what was next for Brexit. Labour described the talks as ""serious and engaged"", suggesting the prime minister was ""interested
in exploring details"" around a customs union. Politicians in Ireland criticised the backstop rejection, with Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney urging the prime minister to seek consensus before negotiations ""ran out of road"" and others accusing the prime minister of acting in bad faith. In the European Parliament, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and many MEPs were also critical - suggesting the withdrawal agreement would not be open for renegotiation and calling for a clearer direction of desire travel from Westminster. And the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier says the Irish backstop is ""part and parcel"" of the UK's Brexit deal and will not be renegotiated. Brexit Radio 4 PM Speaking to Radio 4's PM, Labour's Margaret Beckett says that there a lot of MPs who are ""nurturing the view...that as long as they are seen to have facilitated Brexit, even if it is a disaster, their constituents will be grateful to them"". ""We are not the government, and we are not the biggest party"" in the Commons, she says, adding that if people complain about Brexit, they will blame the Conservatives. ""The House of Commons must accept some level of culpability,"" adds political journalist and commentator Steve Richards. Ms Beckett continues that MPs are being ""driven to"" take control of the process as the government has ""mishandled"" the process. But, she warns that the PM ""is driving a coach and horses through our unwritten constitution"". She says the UK now has ""an elected dictatorship"". BBC News Channel Speaking to the BBC News Channel, former director general of the UK Border Force Tony Smith says technological solutions to the Irish border are ""available"" and ""in theory all possible"". However, the border on the island of Ireland is ""an enigma"", with no workable solution being used elsewhere in the world. Working out how a necessary system could operate and setting one up would take ""some years"", he says. The border force don't currently know what checks would be required on goods, nor what regulatory or policy framework would exist. Once that can be agreed, the technology to make it work can be bought forward. ""Smart borders"" can meet some of the requirements, he says, ""but it's hard to know what technology and what context."" There is currently ""no presence"" from the border force in Northern Ireland, he adds, and this would most likely change, whilst there would be a lot more data that needed to be analysed. On a potential no-deal Brexit, the former head of UK Border Force says that whilst he ""doesn't share the doom"", what is needed is clarity on what checks would be required, and how other countries would handle their side of the border. ""We've shut borders before and they've opened again quite quickly."" ITV political correspondent tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Radio 4 PM Carolyn Quinn, speaking from the Commons, says that ""in theory"" all options are still in the table - although in law the UK is supposed to leave the EU on 29 March. She adds that ""if [Theresa May's] revised or unrevised deal fails to pass...then she may be forced to turn to a more cross-party approach"" and look at a ""customs union"" model for leaving the EU. Again, ""in theory"", it may not be possible for MPs to be asked to agree to the same deal again, as convention is that Parliament should not be asked to vote on the same matter twice.

Brexit Radio 4 PM Katya Adler, the BBC's Europe Editor says that the EU ""does not recognise"" the timetable of two weeks for renegotiations, but is willing to extend the timetable for leaving in order to allow the UK to agree the withdrawal treaty. She adds that in Norway and Switzerland the land borders have ""some kind of physical infrastructure"", but because of the historical peace process in Northern Ireland, this raises problems there. The EU and Ireland are trying to ""avoid talking about"" having to erect a hard border if the UK leaves without a deal, she states. She points out that this is just the UK's ""phase one"" of negotiations as the country is not yet negotiating its future trade deal with the EU.

BBC News Channel Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and the party's chief whip Nick Brown walk through Portcullis House in Westminster on their way to meet Theresa May Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn says his last words to Theresa May at their meeting this afternoon were ""don't bring no-deal back to the Commons"". ""I'm suspicious she is running down the clock,"" he says, ""it is quite possible she'll come back on February 13 with absolutely nothing."" He describes his meeting with the prime minister as ""serious
and exploratory on the issues"", adding that he put forward Labour's case ""for a comprehensive customs union with the EU"", and says on the issue of the backstop ""she listened"". He says he is willing to meet the government again ""on the principle...there isn't a cliff edge exit from the EU at the end of March"". Mr Corbyn adds that he is ""very disappointed"" some Labour MPs voted in favour of the Brady amendment or abstained in the vote last night, adding that he will be ""having discussions with them"". He reiterates that the Labour position is for a customs union, a strong relationship with the single market and to ensure the protection of jobs. Radio 4 PM Sam Coates, deputy political editor at The Times, says the meeting between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May lasted 45 minutes, but no conclusions have been reached. He says it was ""inevitable"" that ""not much progress was going to be made"" because of their own opinions on how Brexit should be carried out. ""I don't think a great deal was done,"" he adds, ""this is about showing that you're doing everything you can, rather than trying to change the facts on the ground."" Brexit BBC News Channel Conservative Brexiteer John Whittingdale says that last night ""sent a very clear message"" that there is a Parliamentary majority for a deal if the backstop can be altered. He says he wants to see a ""legal assurance"" that the UK will not be held in the backstop after the transition period. He adds that there are some ""other voices in Europe"" saying that they may be willing to look again at the backstop. ""It is up to the European Union, and particularly the Irish government, to come up with an alternative,"" he says, ""I think realism will break out."" ""I don't want us to leave without a deal,"" he adds. ""I think there are going to be problems attached to a no deal."" Private Members' Bills Motion House of CommonsParliament MPs have passed a motion allocating an extra three days to discuss legislation proposed by backbenchers. The vote means that private members' bills (PMBs) will take precedence over government business when the Commons sits on Friday February 8, March 15 and March 22. Conservative MP Sir Christopher
Chope had tabled an amendment to prevent PMBs having precedence on any other
day of the current parliamentary session, although this was not selected by the Speaker John Bercow. The motion was approved unopposed. Observer policy editor tweets Allow Twitter content?

Speaking to the Irish broadcaster RTE, Ireland's Foreign Minister (and deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney, has criticised Theresa May's approach of narrowing the choice over Brexit to either granting the concessions she's seeking or going forward with no deal at all. ""That's like saying in a negotiation, 'Well, either you give me what I want or I'm jumping out the window'. We have a deal. The British government was part of that."" Describing the situation as ""extraordinary"", Mr Coveney suggested realistic alternatives lay in reaching out to the opposition ""in a real way"" and seeking a consensus across Westminster. ""She hasn't done that,"" he said. Barclays is preparing to move Â£166bn worth of assets from London to its Irish division, a High Court judgement has revealed. The reason for this is that the bank is concerned that City financial services firms could lose their special ""passporting"" rights that enable them to provide services across Europe, in the event that a no-deal Brexit comes to pass. ""Due to the continuing uncertainty over whether there might be a 'no-deal' Brexit, the Barclays Group has determined that it cannot wait any longer to implement the scheme,"" the judgement says. ""The overriding requirement, however, is that Barclays Bank Ireland must be legally and operationally ready to conduct all relevant regulated business with the in-scope clients by no later than 29 March 2019, which is the date currently set for Brexit.""

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attended a meeting of the Michelin Action Group The Duke of Cambridge has said he is ""optimistic"" about the future for workers at a tyre factory in Dundee which is set to close. Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge met staff from the Michelin premises during a visit on Tuesday. They joined workers at the Crescent community centre and asked how the closure was affecting them. The couple, known in Scotland as the Earl and Countess of Strathearn, also opened Dundee's V&A Museum of Design. Speaking at the Michelin Action Group meeting, Prince William said: ""The factory has been a huge part of Dundee's very fabric.  It has been a key employer for generations and has helped sustain the local economy for nearly 50 years. ""For everyone affected, the hope is that all of you sat in this room can find a positive way forward. ""You all deserve enormous credit for sitting around this table together to find a constructive way forward. It is understandable that there are different views about what is the right course to take."" The duke and duchess spoke to Michelin workers He added: ""As I have just heard, when a community faces uncertainty, people feel more optimistic when leaders such as yourselves work together for that community. ""Because of the collaborative approach adopted by the people in this room, I am optimistic that a good outcome is possible with the site at Michelin."" Prince William said he was encouraged by the fact that a taskforce had been established with all the key players represented. ""As a result of you working together responsibly to find a long-term solution, you have already reached agreement on developing the site into a manufacturing, recycling and low-carbon transport hub. ""The workers we spoke to just now were encouraged to hear about this. They look forward to hearing further detail about how this will affect them directly. Catherine and I look forward to learning more about your plans in this discussion. ""Both of us, and all of the people that we have spoken to today, are willing you to succeed."" This video can not be played The Earl and Countess of Strathearn officially open Dundee's V&A Museum of Design The French firmannounced the closure in Novemberwith the loss of 845 jobs. The closure will take place by mid-2020 after it was deemed ""unsuitable"" in the current climate. Since then it has joined the taskforce - along with the local authority and Scottish Enterprise, among others - to find a solution for the site and its staff. Brian Cairns is the firm's HR business partner, working on the My Future programme to help reskill and retrain staff. The 54-year-old from Alva, Clackmannanshire, said: ""(The duke) was interested in who we are and the service with Michelin. ""One of the comments he made is how there seemed to be a lot of camaraderie still at the table. ""The problem we have in Dundee is we have people who have been employed for 30, 40 years and have never written a CV, have never had an interview and the job market has changed dramatically. ""What Dundee are offering its employees I've never heard of before. It's absolutely fantastic."" The Royal couple were welcomed to the museum by Dundee lord provost Ian Borthwick Scottish Economy Secretary Derek Mackay added: ""I want to thank the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for attending the Michelin Dundee Action Group and for recognising the collaborative approach we have taken to secure a long-term future for the Michelin Dundee site. ""The Scottish government will continue to do everything we can to support the repurposing of the Michelin Dundee site as an Innovation Parc, as it becomes a key location for low carbon energy and low carbon transport development in Scotland.""

The Tory Party that was visibly split in two a fortnight ago is giving the impression of being largely united, even if that is temporary. Yet the prime minister only won because she gave into Brexiteer and DUP demands, by making a promise that she can't be sure she can keep - one the EU says at the moment is impossible. MPs back May's bid to change Brexit deal Guide: The Brexit amendments and results Will Brussels budge on the Irish backstop? Parliament made it clear that it does not want to leave the EU without a deal. Right now, that's not something No 10 is willing to promise. But MPs could have made that demand more convincingly. Parliament had the option to vote to take control of the Brexit process if the government failed to get it sorted by the end of next month, and it did not. Again, former Remainers failed to coalesce around a single plan. And again, Theresa May has had to budge to keep Brexiteers on board. But that buys her a little more time, and a little more political momentum. This video can not be played Numbers and nods: MPs back May's bid to change deal This process has for a long time been about No 10 stumbling, often seriously, then getting up again to try to take another step. There is a valid question - to what end? Neither time nor momentum provides a solution on its own.

"This video can not be played Chris Mason recaps what has happened to the Brexit deal and explains the next key vote options MPs have voted on a series of amendments designed to change the direction of Brexit. Commons Speaker John Bercow selected seven amendments to be debated and voted on. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  Here are the amendments, and the results, in the order in which they took place. Instructed the government to rule out a ""disastrous no deal"" scenario (this optionwas supported by some Brexiteers but many MPs feared it would cause chaos at ports and disruption for businesses) and allowed Parliament to consider - and vote on - options including: An alternative Brexit deal involvingLabour's plan for a permanent customs unionwith Brussels and a version of the EU's single market Legislating to hold a public vote on either a deal or a proposition that has MPs' support Called for an extension of Article 50 Ruled out a no-deal Brexit Emphasised the role of the UK nations in the Brexit process Forced the government to make time for MPs to discuss a range of alternatives to the prime minister's Brexit plan on six full days in the Commons before 26 March. MPs would have been able to table amendments to be voted on at the end of the debate, which could have included alternative Brexit options such as Labour's plan, a second referendum,no dealand theNorway-style relationshippreferred by some MPs. This had the backing of some Labour backbenchers, as well as the SNP's Philippa Whitford, Lib Dem Tom Brake, Plaid Cymru's Jonathan Edwards and Caroline Lucas, of the Greens. Attempted to rule out the UK leaving the EUwithout a formal dealby allowing Parliament time to pass a new law. The bill to bring in the new law would have required Theresa May to seek to postpone Brexit day (currently 29 March) until 31 December, if MPs did not approve her deal by 26 February. The prime minister would have had to do this by asking the EU to agree to extend the two-year limit on Article 50 - the mechanism paving the way for the UK to leave the EU. It had the backing of senior Conservative backbenchers such as Nicky Morgan and Oliver Letwin, former Lib Dem health minister Norman Lamb and Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake. The Labour leadership had also decided to get behind this amendment and ordered Labour MPs to vote for it. But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said he backed limiting any extension to a ""short window"" of three months to allow time for renegotiation. Required the government to ask the EU to postpone Brexit day (without specifying for how long). Seeks to prevent a""no-deal"" Brexitby adding to the PM's motion that Parliament ""rejects the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without aWithdrawal Agreementand aFramework for the Future Relationship"". The two MPs are in neighbouring constituencies and have raised concerns over local manufacturing supply chains. Calls for Parliament to require the backstop to be replaced with ""alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border"" but otherwise supports the prime minister's deal. Theresa May ordered Conservative MPs to vote for this amendment. Some Conservative rebels, who voted against the prime minister two weeks ago, said it was too vague and did not address their other concerns about her deal. Others, such as former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, said they would support it if Mrs May indicated that she would press the EU to re-open the withdrawal agreement to make changes to the backstop that would be legally binding - something she has told MPs that she will do. Northern Ireland's DUP, which keeps Mrs May in power, also indicated they would back the Brady amendment. Neither of the Spelman nor the Brady amendments are binding on the government, although support for them puts political pressure on Theresa May to follow their direction. Theresa May has already said she will return to Brussels to reopen negotiations on legally-binding alternatives to the ""backstop"".

"Another day, another critical moment for Brexit. On Tuesday evening, British MPs voted on what they want to get out of the deal to leave the European Union. It may not be clear what just happened in the British parliament, so we tried to explain it all here. The UK will leave the European Union on 29 March but British MPs still can't agree how. Prime Minister Theresa May is desperate for them to back a deal she struck and on Tuesday, they got the chance to make their own proposals for how the deal should look. Most proposals didn't get the support of the majority of MPs, but a key one did. This amendment means Mrs May has to return to the EU and try to negotiate a new deal (to sort out what kind of border there will be with Ireland). The issue? The EU says it already negotiated a deal, and won't do so again. There are only two months to go until Brexit and the British government still hasn't decided on what terms it should leave the European Union. Tuesday's events risk muddling the process even more. Brexit: A really simple guide All you need to know on Brexit Let's rewind to November 2018, when it looked like major progress had been made. In the two years after 52% of voters said they wanted the UK to leave, the British government and the EU were locked in negotiations on the terms of Brexit. Then, in November, Mrs May and EU leaders finally agreed a deal, and she said the British public did not ""want to spend any more time arguing about Brexit"". The deal had to be approved by the British parliament, but it was a tough sell to some members of her own Conservative party (more on that below), and they rejected it two weeks ago in one of the biggest defeats a government has seen. Please upgrade your browser MPs across all parties had a chance to suggest amendments to her deal, and vote on those too. In the end, MPs were allowed to vote on seven amendments, most of which didn't pass. But two of themdidpass: 1) Renegotiate the Irish border The deal Mrs May struck in Brussels ensured that there would not be a ""hard border"" between Ireland and Northern Ireland. This measure is called the backstop. This is the only place that has a border between the UK and the EU. No ""hard border"" would mean that goods would still be able to cross the border without checks. But this prospect has gone down badly with the influential hardline Brexit supporters in Mrs May's Conservative Party who want a clean break with Europe. On Tuesday, a majority of MPs said they now wanted anewdeal, one that made changes to the backstop. This is far easier said than done. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. 2) Avoid 'no deal' A majority of MPs also backed another amendment that rejected the UK leaving the EU without a deal (we explain why ""no deal"" worries people a little later). At least now we know where most MPs stand on this issue, but it doesn't really change anything: it's not as though they've suggestedhowthey hope to avoid leaving without a deal. Nor is this move legally binding: a no-deal Brexit could still happen. Who knows? In theory, Theresa May now has a mandate to ask the EU for new talks on the backstop. The problem is the EU doesn't want to, and doesn't see any reason why it should (our Europe editor Katya Adler has more detail on that here). It says the whole backstop issue has already been dealt with. Ireland, an EU member, doesn't want any change to the backstop deal either. How would 'no deal' look? Can Brexit be delayed? So if the EU doesn't want to reopen negotiations, and the British parliament can't find a compromise, what happens? We'd be facing a ""hard Brexit"": the UK would crash out of the EU on 29 March with no deal. This means the UK would leave suddenly, with no transition. There are real concerns over the damage a ""no deal"" could do: it could cause delays in bringing food and materials into the UK, and the price of some goods in British shops could shoot up. Bear in mind that the EU now alsoknowsthat a majority of British MPs don't want ""no deal"" to happen. This might strengthen their hand in any purely hypothetical negotiations that might take place. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks.

"Feeling a little lost on Brexit? Never really got your head around it in the first place? Let us walk you through it. Brexit is short for ""British exit"" - and is the word people use to talk about the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU). The EU is a political and economic union of 28 countries that trade with each other and allow citizens to move easily between the countries to live and work(click here if you want to see the full list).,external The UK joined the EU, then known as the EEC (European Economic Community), in 1973. A public vote - calleda referendum- was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. TheLeave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m- but the exit didn't happen straight away. It was due to take place on 29 March 2019 - but the departure date has been delayed (we will explain in more detail below). The 2016 vote was just the start. Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries. The discussions have been mainly over the ""divorce"" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves - not what will happen afterwards. This deal is known as theWithdrawal Agreement. The withdrawal agreement covers some of these key points: How much money the UK will have to pay the EU in order to break the partnership - that's about Â£39bn What will happen to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and, equally, what will happen to EU citizens living in the UK How to avoid the return of a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU This video can not be played Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) It also includes atransition period,which has been agreed to allow the UK and EU to agree a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust. That means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will be no huge changes between the date of Brexit and 31 December 2020. Click here for more on the draft withdrawal agreement Another, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview of what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term. This is thepolitical declaration.However, neither side has to stick exactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for future talks. Click here for more on the political declaration The deal was agreed by the UK and the EU in November 2018, but it also has to be approved by British MPs. Well, no. They have voted against it three times. On 15 January they rejected the dealby 432 votes to 202- a record defeat. Then on 12 March, after Theresa May - the prime minister at the time - had gone back to the EU to secure further legal assurances,they rejected it again. And on 29 March - the original day that the UK was due to leave the EU -MPs rejected it for a third time(this vote was slightly different as it did not include the political declaration). Yes. As MPs did not approve Mrs May's withdrawal deal, she was forced to ask other EU leaders to delay Brexit. The deadline was delayed until 31 October- but, unable to see a way forward, Mrs May stepped down as PM and was replaced by Boris Johnson. There isa broad range of complaints, many of which claim the deal fails to give back to the UK control of its own affairs from the EU. One of the biggest sticking points has been over what happens at the Irish border. Both the EU and UK want to avoid the return of guard posts and checks (here's why), so something calledthe backstop- a sort of safety net - was included in the deal. The backstop is meant to be a last resort to keep an open border on the island of Ireland - whatever happens in the Brexit negotiations. It would mean that Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products. Theresa May insisted that, if all went as planned, it would never be used. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop But it has annoyed some MPs, who are angry that the UK would not be able to end it without the EU's permission and so EU rules could remain in place for good. Other MPs would prefer the UK to stay closer to the EU - or even still in it. And others say Northern Ireland should not be treated separately from the rest of the UK. Boris Johnson has said he wants to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with the EU - and remove the backstop. If he succeeds in doing this, it will still have to be approved by MPs before being passed into UK law. However, EU leaders have consistently said they will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and that the backstop is an essential part of any deal. If the prime minister fails to convince the EU to change the withdrawal agreement, he has promised to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement would be known as a ""no-deal Brexit"". New PM Boris Johnson has promised to take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal ""No deal"" means the UK will have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement. It would mean there would be no transition period after the UK leaves and EU laws would stop applying to the UK immediately(more on that here). The government says it is preparing for this potential situation. It expects some food prices could rise and customs checks at borders could cost businesses billions of pounds.(Read the government's report here),external. It has published a series of guides,external- which cover everything from mobile roaming on holiday to the impact on electricity supplies. Here is a list of10 ways you could be affectedby a no-deal Brexit. It is still written into law that the UK will be leaving, even though the deadline has shifted.

"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

"Evidence has emerged of a government agency's role in the Royal Bank of Scotland's (RBS) controversial Global Restructuring Group (GRG). The Asset Protection Agency influenced GRG's strategy including decisions that determined business customers' fortunes, the BBC has learnt. Separate court evidence suggests the agency told RBS to withdraw customer support, when the bank did not want to. RBS said it disagreed with the claims while the Treasury declined to comment. More than 16,000 small business customers were transferred to RBS's Global Restructuring Group. In what MPs have referred to as the worst scandal since the financial crash, GRG was found in a leaked official report for the Financial Conduct Authority to have mistreated thousands of business customers. Many of them were ruined and others lost not only their livelihoods but their marriages and their physical and mental health. The extent of Treasury influence in the scandal is underlined by previously unnoticed Asset Protection Agency (APA) documents showing the Treasury agency influenced GRG's strategy and its approach to customers' loans. Official APA documents also suggest the bank was prohibited from releasing GRG customers from secured loans without its approval, giving the Treasury an effective veto on any re-financing by business customers wanting to exit GRG. Meanwhile, Oliver Morley Estates, an industrial warehousing company based in the north west of England, which is taking legal action against RBS, has suggested GRG relationship managers rejected a proposal to re-finance much of the business because of the Asset Protection Agency's (APA) views. Emails quoted in court reveal that RBS wanted to support the rescue proposal, arranged by founder Oliver Morley to re-finance more than Â£70m of loans to his property group with the help of another bank, believing it to be ""the best option for the bank"". However, the Treasury's Asset Protection Agency blocked the bank from doing so, according to evidence disclosed in court. Instead it wanted the property to be sold to RBS's own property division, West Register. The court heard RBS managers saw the APA's view as ""certainly their craziest decision yet"". Yet RBS staff thought ""the APA's views are clear and unlikely to change."" Under the Asset Protection Scheme, part of the government bailout in the financial crisis, loans worth Â£282bn were insured against default by taxpayers, limiting the potential losses to which RBS was exposed. Between 2009 and 2012 the Asset Protection Agency staff were in charge of overseeing the scheme. Its stated goal was ""to maximize the value of the assets in the scheme and reduce the probability of payouts"". Hugh Sims QC, for the former GRG customer, Oliver Morley, told the High Court that internal bank emails disclosed as part of civil proceedings also suggested that within GRG ""things had become increasingly personal."" In one internal email exchange discussing Mr Morley's attempts to hold on to his business, GRG staff say ""the borrower is toast"". In another they are looking forward to ""the Morley massacre"" the following Tuesday. In another email discussing their proposal to force him to sell his properties to the banks' own property division, GRG staff say if he disagrees ""it's his head on a spike"", the court heard. RBS said it ""fundamentally disagrees with Mr Morley's claims and does not believe they have any merit"". ""It is contesting them vigorously in court. The bank incurred around Â£30m of losses on the Â£75m it lent Mr Morley, who was a sophisticated customer in receipt of extensive professional advice."" However, it added: ""The language used in these internal communications from 2009 was clearly unacceptable and would have no place in the bank we are today. These communications did not reflect or lead to customer detriment."" While GRG told customers it was there to help them turn around the fortunes of their business, a report,leaked to the BBC in 2017, found the bank was seeking to make profits from distressed businesses and had systematically broken rules on fair treatment of customers. Promontory, the consultants who authored the leaked report, told MPs they were expecting to conduct a further review on which individual culpability would have been examined. However, Financial Conduct Authority chief executive Andrew Bailey said it would conduct its own inquiry. In the summer of 2018, he announced the FCA would not be taking its investigation further, prompting accusations from small business victims of GRG of a cover-up. The evidence unearthed about the Asset Protect Agency's role suggests the executives would have been able to point to government involvement, potentially exposing the Treasury to large compensation claims.

"This video can not be played Chris Mason recaps what has happened to the Brexit deal and explains the next key vote options MPs have voted on a series of amendments designed to change the direction of Brexit. Commons Speaker John Bercow selected seven amendments to be debated and voted on. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  Here are the amendments, and the results, in the order in which they took place. Instructed the government to rule out a ""disastrous no deal"" scenario (this optionwas supported by some Brexiteers but many MPs feared it would cause chaos at ports and disruption for businesses) and allowed Parliament to consider - and vote on - options including: An alternative Brexit deal involvingLabour's plan for a permanent customs unionwith Brussels and a version of the EU's single market Legislating to hold a public vote on either a deal or a proposition that has MPs' support Called for an extension of Article 50 Ruled out a no-deal Brexit Emphasised the role of the UK nations in the Brexit process Forced the government to make time for MPs to discuss a range of alternatives to the prime minister's Brexit plan on six full days in the Commons before 26 March. MPs would have been able to table amendments to be voted on at the end of the debate, which could have included alternative Brexit options such as Labour's plan, a second referendum,no dealand theNorway-style relationshippreferred by some MPs. This had the backing of some Labour backbenchers, as well as the SNP's Philippa Whitford, Lib Dem Tom Brake, Plaid Cymru's Jonathan Edwards and Caroline Lucas, of the Greens. Attempted to rule out the UK leaving the EUwithout a formal dealby allowing Parliament time to pass a new law. The bill to bring in the new law would have required Theresa May to seek to postpone Brexit day (currently 29 March) until 31 December, if MPs did not approve her deal by 26 February. The prime minister would have had to do this by asking the EU to agree to extend the two-year limit on Article 50 - the mechanism paving the way for the UK to leave the EU. It had the backing of senior Conservative backbenchers such as Nicky Morgan and Oliver Letwin, former Lib Dem health minister Norman Lamb and Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake. The Labour leadership had also decided to get behind this amendment and ordered Labour MPs to vote for it. But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said he backed limiting any extension to a ""short window"" of three months to allow time for renegotiation. Required the government to ask the EU to postpone Brexit day (without specifying for how long). Seeks to prevent a""no-deal"" Brexitby adding to the PM's motion that Parliament ""rejects the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without aWithdrawal Agreementand aFramework for the Future Relationship"". The two MPs are in neighbouring constituencies and have raised concerns over local manufacturing supply chains. Calls for Parliament to require the backstop to be replaced with ""alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border"" but otherwise supports the prime minister's deal. Theresa May ordered Conservative MPs to vote for this amendment. Some Conservative rebels, who voted against the prime minister two weeks ago, said it was too vague and did not address their other concerns about her deal. Others, such as former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, said they would support it if Mrs May indicated that she would press the EU to re-open the withdrawal agreement to make changes to the backstop that would be legally binding - something she has told MPs that she will do. Northern Ireland's DUP, which keeps Mrs May in power, also indicated they would back the Brady amendment. Neither of the Spelman nor the Brady amendments are binding on the government, although support for them puts political pressure on Theresa May to follow their direction.

"The NHS fears Operation Stack may be enforced on the M20, when part of it is closed to accommodate waiting lorries A move to cancel blood donor sessions because of fears Brexit will cause major traffic congestion at Channel ports has been reversed. NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) had said sessions would not take place in Dover and Folkestone for the two weeks before Britain leaves the EU on 29 March and the six weeks afterwards. It followed concerns congestion could stop teams reaching donation venues. But the Department of Health did not agree and said sessions would continue. Dover MP Charlie Elphicke had condemned the move as creating unnecessary worry. And after NHS Blood and Transplant announced the move, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she had been told the decision was not cleared nationally and would be ""reversed straight away"". Health chiefs said blood stocks will not be affected Mr Stredder had said it was possible Operation Stack could be brought in after Brexit - when part of the M20 is closed to hold lorries waiting to cross the Channel. ""This could lead to significant traffic in Kent and may prevent donation teams from reaching venues in the area or a donation leaving,"" he said. But he said the move would only affect six sessions and about 2,700 sessions would be held elsewhere across the country. He said: ""There will be no effect on blood stocks or on our ability to supply hospitals."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Kingdom Hearts 3 takes players on the adventure of a lifetime through a vast array of worlds Highly anticipated game Kingdom Hearts 3 has been launched with a twist - the ending comes separately. The move was made to prevent spoilers from leaked versions of the long-awaited sequel. Excerpts of the game, which allows users to fight alongside Disney characters, have already been leaked online. Once installed and completed, the game automatically downloads the epilogue. ""It's definitely an unusual move. It is the first time I've heard of a game doing this,"" said Caspar Stewart, media analyst at research company Enders. The game, which was first announced at the E3 conference in 2013, has been a long time in the making. It blends characters from Disney's animated films - including Buzz and Woody, from Toy Story, and Elsa, Anna and Olaf, from Frozen - with Square Enix's science-fiction franchise Final Fantasy. Players go on a journey with protagonist Sora through a variety of Disney-themed worlds. After some copies were leaked last month, Square Enix director Tetsuya Nomura told fans: ""The game's epilogue and secret movie, which are the biggest spoilers in this game, are planned to be released at a later date just in case, so they will not be shown before the game's release."" The epilogue aims to tie together all three versions of the game, the last of which was released 14 years ago. ""It's been a long wait and the game is heavy on narrative with lots of video, so the epilogue will be important to the die-hard fans,"" said Mr Stewart. ""As a deterrent to piracy, I'm not sure how effective it will be, but the real value lies in the publicity this will generate on the day it is released,"" he said. 5 things to expect from Kingdom Hearts III New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attended a meeting of the Michelin Action Group The Duke of Cambridge has said he is ""optimistic"" about the future for workers at a tyre factory in Dundee which is set to close. Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge met staff from the Michelin premises during a visit on Tuesday. They joined workers at the Crescent community centre and asked how the closure was affecting them. The couple, known in Scotland as the Earl and Countess of Strathearn, also opened Dundee's V&A Museum of Design. Speaking at the Michelin Action Group meeting, Prince William said: ""The factory has been a huge part of Dundee's very fabric.  It has been a key employer for generations and has helped sustain the local economy for nearly 50 years. ""For everyone affected, the hope is that all of you sat in this room can find a positive way forward. ""You all deserve enormous credit for sitting around this table together to find a constructive way forward. It is understandable that there are different views about what is the right course to take."" The duke and duchess spoke to Michelin workers He added: ""As I have just heard, when a community faces uncertainty, people feel more optimistic when leaders such as yourselves work together for that community. ""Because of the collaborative approach adopted by the people in this room, I am optimistic that a good outcome is possible with the site at Michelin."" Prince William said he was encouraged by the fact that a taskforce had been established with all the key players represented. ""As a result of you working together responsibly to find a long-term solution, you have already reached agreement on developing the site into a manufacturing, recycling and low-carbon transport hub. ""The workers we spoke to just now were encouraged to hear about this. They look forward to hearing further detail about how this will affect them directly. Catherine and I look forward to learning more about your plans in this discussion. ""Both of us, and all of the people that we have spoken to today, are willing you to succeed.""

Brian Cairns is the firm's HR business partner, working on the My Future programme to help reskill and retrain staff. The 54-year-old from Alva, Clackmannanshire, said: ""(The duke) was interested in who we are and the service with Michelin. ""One of the comments he made is how there seemed to be a lot of camaraderie still at the table. ""The problem we have in Dundee is we have people who have been employed for 30, 40 years and have never written a CV, have never had an interview and the job market has changed dramatically. ""What Dundee are offering its employees I've never heard of before. It's absolutely fantastic."" The Royal couple were welcomed to the museum by Dundee lord provost Ian Borthwick Scottish Economy Secretary Derek Mackay added: ""I want to thank the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for attending the Michelin Dundee Action Group and for recognising the collaborative approach we have taken to secure a long-term future for the Michelin Dundee site. ""The Scottish government will continue to do everything we can to support the repurposing of the Michelin Dundee site as an Innovation Parc, as it becomes a key location for low carbon energy and low carbon transport development in Scotland.""

"The European Union (EU) has accepted the UK's request for a Brexit delay until 31 January 2020, with an option to leave sooner if a deal is approved by Parliament. Delaying the UK's exit date requires an extension to Article 50, the part of the Lisbon Treaty that sets out what happens when a country decides it wants to leave the EU. Article 50 allows an initial two-year period for negotiations on the terms of exiting. It was triggered by then Prime Minister Theresa May on 29 March 2017, giving an exit date of 29 March 2019. But this date was extended twice, first to 12 April and then until 31 October, after Mrs May's deal was rejected in successive votes in the House of Commons. Now it is being extended for a third time - so how does this process work? The UK cannot make a decision about extending Article 50 on its own - it has to send a request to the 27 other EU countries. All 27 have to agree in order to secure an extension. On Saturday 19 October, Mr Johnson sent a letter, as he was compelled to by alaw known as the Benn Act. The law stated he must send an extension request should he fail to get a Brexit deal through the House of Commons by the end of 19 October. Mr Johnson also sent a second letter saying he believed that a ""further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners"". Nevertheless, on 28 October the EU agreed to the extension proposed in his first letter. The EU was not obliged to say yes. Once it received the UK's delay request, in the form of a letter, the 27 leaders consulted with each other on their decision. It was then made following a meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels. If EU leaders had decided to offer a longer extension they would have been likely to have met in person to set conditions of the extension. It's worth pointing out that Article 50 can also be revoked - effectively cancelling Brexit. The UK can in theory do that without consulting anyone else. That would mean that Brexit would not happen and the UK would remain in the EU on the same terms it has now. The Liberal Democrats are the only party to say that would they would revoke Article 50 without a referendum if they won a majority in a general election. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that a revocation should be ""unequivocal and unconditional"", suggesting that the ECJ would take a dim view of any attempt to withdraw an Article 50 notification and then resubmit it again a short time later.

"There is strong opposition to a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland Boris Johnson insists on them, Graham Brady is pushing hard for them, Prime Minister Theresa May seems to be praying for them and Dublin is deeply worried at the thought of them but will the EU ever actually ""give in"" and make changes to the backstop - that guarantee post-Brexit to avoid a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland? It's a tough one. The EU certainly never intended to budge on the backstop - painfully negotiated with the UK over 18 months and signed off last November by Mrs May and her cabinet. But Europe's leaders didn't imagine the UK would still be in such flux over Brexit so very close to B-day on 29 March. Conversations I had with EU figures before Christmas saw my contacts confidently predicting that 2019 would see a no-deal Brexit (which they didn't believe UK MPs would allow to happen), Theresa May's Brexit deal being passed by parliament with cross-party support when MPs realised the looming risk of no deal (they thought this outcome the most likely), or no Brexit at all. Brexit: A really simple guide Kuenssberg: Is Parliament's Brexit fog about to clear? No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' But now there is spreading concern, as the EU's deputy chief Brexit negotiator, Sabine Weyand, pointed out on Monday, that the UK could end up ""crashing out"" of the EU - not intentionally but simply because time allotted by law for exit negotiations could run out before any agreement is reached. This video can not be played Sabine Weyand: Risk of a 'crash out' is high ""The only reason there's still relative calm in EU circles about a no-deal Brexit is because we still have the popcorn out,"" one EU diplomat told me. ""We're mesmerised by the goings on in the House of Commons. But give it a few weeks: if nothing has changed, you'll soon see signs of panic in the (European) capitals."" Of course the EU wants to concentrate minds - for negotiating purposes - on the pain a no-deal Brexit will cause the UK but it will inevitably be costly and difficult for European citizens and businesses too. EU leaders won't want to be punished at the ballot box back home for not having done their best in the view of their voters to avoid all that, but you would be mistaken to then conclude Brussels will - when push comes to shove - pay any price to head off a no-deal Brexit. Behind closed doors, of course, there is a certain amount of game planning going on but the EU is currently in watch and wait mode. EU leaders believe the Brexit debate still has a way to run in parliament and they want to see which way the wind is blowing. They hope if they stand firm and refuse to reopen the Brexit withdrawal agreement, then MPs could be tempted to unite around a softer Brexit than the one advocated by Theresa May - in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit. This video can not be played Brexit vote explained in one minute Some EU leaders dream of a second referendum, resulting - perhaps - in a Brexit reversal. So put yourself in the EU's shoes for a moment: why make a move now as long as the above options appear (to varying degrees) to still be possibilities in the UK? This is why we've recently heard the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, insisting that there is flexibility in the Brexit text on EU-UK future relations, whereas the backstop text is unchangeable. The EU, as I mentioned earlier, wants very, very, very much to avoid making changes to the backstop. A reminder again as to why: Though sometimes scoffed at in the UK as an idea, the EU does indeed feel very much wedded to the Northern Ireland peace process, including cross-border co-operation, which it sees as having been very much facilitated by EU money and EU membership The provisions in the backstop are not being forced by the EU on the UK. The text was negotiated bilaterally and no other alternative found. Brussels feels it's often forgotten that the UK-wide customs provision in the backstop was a UK request rather than an EU imposition The EU will not want to sacrifice the concerns of member state Ireland ""just"" to achieve an exit deal (not even a final trade deal) with departing club member UK. Remember how the EU stood by Spain over Gibraltar when it came to the wording of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement? Well, solidarity with Ireland over the Brexit backstop is considerably stronger amongst EU leaders than it was with Madrid at the time The backstop is also a guarantee for the EU's single market. Don't forget, the land border between the single market and post-Brexit UK will run through the island of Ireland. And the EU is thinking bigger picture too. If Brussels ""caves in"" to the UK over the backstop, there's a fear that could encourage Brussels-sceptic governments in member states Hungary, Italy and Poland, for example, to flout club rules. It could also send a message of weakness to international trade partners. Yet despite all that, if EU leaders were staring into the no-deal Brexit abyss come 1 March, then blink they might over the backstop. And there are the beginnings of whispers to that effect in some EU corridors. Who knows now what changes the EU might eventually accept and it's very hard indeed to imagine them doing it without the OK from Dublin. But mindful of the ticking clock, the European Commission appears to be trying to focus minds in the Irish government and beyond (remember Theresa May's repeated pledge to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland?) on harsh realities. Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas - a man known to be extremely careful about what he does or doesn't say - last week pointedly announced that a no-deal Brexit would inevitably lead to some kind of hard border/ie physical checks. Margaritis Schinas (r) said if he was pushed to speculate it was ""pretty obvious you will have a hard border"" But anyone in Westminster who thinks the backstop issue could magically disappear should definitely think again. Not just in the context of the Brexit agreement but what comes after. Ireland - as every other EU member - has a veto over any future EU-UK trade deal and could use it if Dublin felt the border wasn't adequately protected. In conclusion, the EU will wait until the last minute to make concessions over the Brexit deal on the table. It's not in the market to make changes here and there only for Theresa May to come back again and demand more. That's why the message from EU leaders to the prime minister has been loud and clear. They have told her: ""Don't bother coming back to us in Brussels until you can convincingly (i.e. not just by a couple of votes) show us once and for all that the majority of parliament is behind you.""

"She blinked. Whatever else happens in the next two hours, Theresa May did what she previously said was impossible, and committed herself to try to reopen the divorce deal, the legal text negotiated over two years with 27 other countries. After a fortnight of swearing it was not going to happen, her dire predicament and continued protest from Eurosceptics moved the prime minister to this point. This path was probably, in the end, the one that she would always have to choose, having made clear in recent days that she would aim to preserve Tory party unity, to try to stay in power, rather than switch to pursue a closer relationship with the EU. Government supports Irish backstop change A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' With the bulk of Brexiteers and the unionist DUP now on side, it was a straightforward political choice - even if, as a policy, it's been dismissed as chasing a fantasy. Having promised to change part of it, the prime minister is likely to have more support for her deal, by the end of tonight. But there are still strong demands for her to rule out leaving without a formal deal across Parliament. There is still no sign that the EU is ready straight away to grant any of the revisions she may demand. The move, as ever, is designed to get the prime minister more smoothly through the day.

"Evidence has emerged of a government agency's role in the Royal Bank of Scotland's (RBS) controversial Global Restructuring Group (GRG). The Asset Protection Agency influenced GRG's strategy including decisions that determined business customers' fortunes, the BBC has learnt. Separate court evidence suggests the agency told RBS to withdraw customer support, when the bank did not want to. RBS said it disagreed with the claims while the Treasury declined to comment. More than 16,000 small business customers were transferred to RBS's Global Restructuring Group. In what MPs have referred to as the worst scandal since the financial crash, GRG was found in a leaked official report for the Financial Conduct Authority to have mistreated thousands of business customers. Many of them were ruined and others lost not only their livelihoods but their marriages and their physical and mental health. The extent of Treasury influence in the scandal is underlined by previously unnoticed Asset Protection Agency (APA) documents showing the Treasury agency influenced GRG's strategy and its approach to customers' loans. Official APA documents also suggest the bank was prohibited from releasing GRG customers from secured loans without its approval, giving the Treasury an effective veto on any re-financing by business customers wanting to exit GRG. Meanwhile, Oliver Morley Estates, an industrial warehousing company based in the north west of England, which is taking legal action against RBS, has suggested GRG relationship managers rejected a proposal to re-finance much of the business because of the Asset Protection Agency's (APA) views. Emails quoted in court reveal that RBS wanted to support the rescue proposal, arranged by founder Oliver Morley to re-finance more than Â£70m of loans to his property group with the help of another bank, believing it to be ""the best option for the bank"". However, the Treasury's Asset Protection Agency blocked the bank from doing so, according to evidence disclosed in court. Instead it wanted the property to be sold to RBS's own property division, West Register. The court heard RBS managers saw the APA's view as ""certainly their craziest decision yet"". Yet RBS staff thought ""the APA's views are clear and unlikely to change."" Under the Asset Protection Scheme, part of the government bailout in the financial crisis, loans worth Â£282bn were insured against default by taxpayers, limiting the potential losses to which RBS was exposed. Between 2009 and 2012 the Asset Protection Agency staff were in charge of overseeing the scheme. Its stated goal was ""to maximize the value of the assets in the scheme and reduce the probability of payouts"". Hugh Sims QC, for the former GRG customer, Oliver Morley, told the High Court that internal bank emails disclosed as part of civil proceedings also suggested that within GRG ""things had become increasingly personal."" In one internal email exchange discussing Mr Morley's attempts to hold on to his business, GRG staff say ""the borrower is toast"". In another they are looking forward to ""the Morley massacre"" the following Tuesday. In another email discussing their proposal to force him to sell his properties to the banks' own property division, GRG staff say if he disagrees ""it's his head on a spike"", the court heard. RBS said it ""fundamentally disagrees with Mr Morley's claims and does not believe they have any merit"". ""It is contesting them vigorously in court. The bank incurred around Â£30m of losses on the Â£75m it lent Mr Morley, who was a sophisticated customer in receipt of extensive professional advice."" However, it added: ""The language used in these internal communications from 2009 was clearly unacceptable and would have no place in the bank we are today. These communications did not reflect or lead to customer detriment."" While GRG told customers it was there to help them turn around the fortunes of their business, a report,leaked to the BBC in 2017, found the bank was seeking to make profits from distressed businesses and had systematically broken rules on fair treatment of customers. Promontory, the consultants who authored the leaked report, told MPs they were expecting to conduct a further review on which individual culpability would have been examined. However, Financial Conduct Authority chief executive Andrew Bailey said it would conduct its own inquiry. In the summer of 2018, he announced the FCA would not be taking its investigation further, prompting accusations from small business victims of GRG of a cover-up. The evidence unearthed about the Asset Protect Agency's role suggests the executives would have been able to point to government involvement, potentially exposing the Treasury to large compensation claims. In the light of the new evidence, Oliver Morley Estates has given notice that it intends to sue Her Majesty's Treasury for compensation for its role in dismantling its business. The FCA said it would shortly be publishing a full report about the findings of an enforcement investigation into RBS's GRG division.

"Gas from Glengorm could be tied back to the Elgin-Franklin or Culzean platforms A significant gas discovery in the central North Sea is being described as the biggest find in more than a decade. Chinese state-owned company CNOOC said it made the gas discovery - equivalent to 250 million barrels of oil - in its Glengorm project, east of Aberdeen. Further appraisal work is planned, but it is understood it could be extracted using existing infrastructure. Friends of the Earth Scotland said the find was terrible news for the climate. Glengorm sits 118 miles (190km) east of Aberdeen, close to Total's Elgin-Franklin and Culzean fields, and could be tied back to one of their platforms. Total owns a 25% stake in the Glengorm field. Glengorm sits close to Total's Elgin-Franklin and Culzean fields, and could be tied back to one of their platforms Xie Yuhong, of CNOOC, said the company was ""looking forward to further appraisal"". Kevin McLachlan, of Total, added: ""Glengorm is another great success for Total in the North Sea, with results at the top end of expectations and a high condensate yield in addition to the gas. ""Our strong position in the region will enable us to leverage existing infrastructures nearby and optimise the development of this discovery. ""Glengorm is an achievement that demonstrates our capacity to create value in a mature environment thanks to our in-depth understanding of the basin."" Analysts Wood Mackenzie described the find as the largest in the North Sea since the Culzean field was discovered in 2008. Senior analyst Kevin Swann said: ""There is a lot of hype around frontier areas like West of Shetland, whereTotal discovered the Glendronach field last year. But Glengorm is in the Central North Sea and this find shows there is still life in some of the more mature UK waters."" Environmental groups have criticised the discovery which, they say, will further contribute to climate change. They want energy companies to leave oil and gas in the ground and focus instead on renewable sources. Caroline Rance, from Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: ""It's a disgrace that oil and gas exploration is still going ahead in the seas off Scotland. ""It's high time our governments stopped supporting fossil fuel development, and get serious about planning a just transition away from this industry. ""These companies know all too well that their business is built on the destruction of the climate, which is devastating for millions of people around the world but they continue to seek profit from driving this catastrophe."" The Oil and Gas Authority has welcomed the discover, and said it demonstrated the considerable potential the industry still had to offer. Chief executive Andy Samuel said: ""This is very exciting news. Glengorm was first mapped as a prospect around 20 years ago and it is great to see CNOOC taking up the exploration opportunity and completing a difficult high-pressure, high-temperature exploration well. ""Our official estimate is that there still remains between 10 and 20 billion barrels plus to be recovered, so there is every chance of yet more significant finds, provided industry can increase exploration drilling and capitalise on the real value to be had here in the UK."" Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse said the announcement, ""highlights the significant potential for oil and gas which still exists beneath Scotland's waters"". He added:  ""Scotland's offshore oil and gas industry has an important role to play with up to 20 billion barrels of oil equivalent remaining under the North Sea and in the wider basin and discoveries such as this help to support security of supply as we make the transition to a low carbon energy system.""

"This video can not be played Chris Mason recaps what has happened to the Brexit deal and explains the next key vote options MPs have voted on a series of amendments designed to change the direction of Brexit. Commons Speaker John Bercow selected seven amendments to be debated and voted on. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  Here are the amendments, and the results, in the order in which they took place. Instructed the government to rule out a ""disastrous no deal"" scenario (this optionwas supported by some Brexiteers but many MPs feared it would cause chaos at ports and disruption for businesses) and allowed Parliament to consider - and vote on - options including: An alternative Brexit deal involvingLabour's plan for a permanent customs unionwith Brussels and a version of the EU's single market Legislating to hold a public vote on either a deal or a proposition that has MPs' support Called for an extension of Article 50 Ruled out a no-deal Brexit Emphasised the role of the UK nations in the Brexit process Forced the government to make time for MPs to discuss a range of alternatives to the prime minister's Brexit plan on six full days in the Commons before 26 March. MPs would have been able to table amendments to be voted on at the end of the debate, which could have included alternative Brexit options such as Labour's plan, a second referendum,no dealand theNorway-style relationshippreferred by some MPs. This had the backing of some Labour backbenchers, as well as the SNP's Philippa Whitford, Lib Dem Tom Brake, Plaid Cymru's Jonathan Edwards and Caroline Lucas, of the Greens. Attempted to rule out the UK leaving the EUwithout a formal dealby allowing Parliament time to pass a new law. The bill to bring in the new law would have required Theresa May to seek to postpone Brexit day (currently 29 March) until 31 December, if MPs did not approve her deal by 26 February. The prime minister would have had to do this by asking the EU to agree to extend the two-year limit on Article 50 - the mechanism paving the way for the UK to leave the EU. It had the backing of senior Conservative backbenchers such as Nicky Morgan and Oliver Letwin, former Lib Dem health minister Norman Lamb and Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake. The Labour leadership had also decided to get behind this amendment and ordered Labour MPs to vote for it. But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said he backed limiting any extension to a ""short window"" of three months to allow time for renegotiation. Required the government to ask the EU to postpone Brexit day (without specifying for how long). Seeks to prevent a""no-deal"" Brexitby adding to the PM's motion that Parliament ""rejects the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without aWithdrawal Agreementand aFramework for the Future Relationship"". The two MPs are in neighbouring constituencies and have raised concerns over local manufacturing supply chains. Calls for Parliament to require the backstop to be replaced with ""alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border"" but otherwise supports the prime minister's deal. Theresa May ordered Conservative MPs to vote for this amendment. Some Conservative rebels, who voted against the prime minister two weeks ago, said it was too vague and did not address their other concerns about her deal. Others, such as former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, said they would support it if Mrs May indicated that she would press the EU to re-open the withdrawal agreement to make changes to the backstop that would be legally binding - something she has told MPs that she will do. Northern Ireland's DUP, which keeps Mrs May in power, also indicated they would back the Brady amendment. Neither of the Spelman nor the Brady amendments are binding on the government, although support for them puts political pressure on Theresa May to follow their direction.

"""It might not be 326 that matters"". According to one cabinet minister, that's the strange situation that Brexit has led us to. The government's ambition is so low - or its hurdles so high - that what No 10 seeks to do on Tuesday is not to win (326 is a majority in the House of Commons), but to reduce the scale of resistance to their central policy that, in the words of another cabinet minister, only the ""hardliners oppose"", so that Theresa May can get the rebels down to a ""few dozen"", so then they can crack on. But crack on with what, I hear you ask? Government supports Irish backstop change A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' The EU has been clear again and again that it won't budge on the backstop unless the UK ""evolves its position"", to use the posh phrase. In other words it won't budge until there is a clearer picture from the UK, even though, in the end, budge it well might (NB, shifting a bit is not the same as junking it, before you get too excited, remember). But reducing the scale of discomfort is important for the government on Tuesday. That's why, although Sir Graham Brady's amendment is unlikely to get through - it doesn't have the support of the ardent Brexiteer core in the ERG, and maybe or maybe not the DUP, which won't decide until the morning - ministers are forcing their MPs to do something very weird. They are trying to make them vote FOR a plan that says the prime minister's deal needs to be changed, in the hope that message is conveyed strongly across the Channel into continental ears. And if the level of opposition shrinks to be a molehill rather than a mountain, maybe then, in time, Brussels can conclude there is something worth working with. That is still a huge ""if"". And there is also still the possibility on Tuesday that MPs, either through Yvette Cooper's plan or the less dramatic (in terms of process) idea from Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, might vote to try to force No 10 to rule out leaving without a deal at the end of March. Only Ms Cooper's plan would actually be binding, and it's not clear how the government would respond in either case. But again, that kind of result would send its own message to the rest of the EU - one the prime minister is keen to avoid for fear it would weaken her bargaining hand. For No 10, the obvious way of ruling out no deal is to back Mrs May's agreement. But takers for that plan are still, for her, in too short supply. Parliament may push her in that direction on Tuesday against her will. But at the risk of depressing you about Tuesday providing a clear conclusion, it is also quite feasible that none of the plans will pass. After months of saying, ""ask us, ask us!"", MPs have a real opportunity to vote for Brexit plans they have brewed up. But if none of them is able to get a majority, Parliament may yet just prove itself, again, a place where trust is low, tension is high, but agreement is hard to find. Late on Monday evening, maybe, just maybe, there was a sign that all of this Parliamentary turmoil might be about to be usurped by something that has felt until now absolutely out of reach. Rival factions of the Tory party who until now have been so often trying to knock lumps out of each other, have, we can report, been meeting and talking, trying to thrash out a compromise. Brexiteers Steve Baker and Jacob Rees-Mogg have met the prime minister alongside former Remainers like Nicky Morgan and Damian Green, accompanied by government ministers like Robert Buckland, the solicitor general. They have, together, come up with what looks like, at a very early stage, what might be two potential compromises that the Tory party as a group might be able to get around. Whether they'd get backing from other parties, or the EU, is another question. But it is a potential way forward, that has lit up Tory messaging groups with emojis of champagne bottles, and claims that it might be the way out of their mess. You can see the plan for yourselfhere,external, or below. Number 10 is not ready to back it yet, although the group of unlikely compadres has discussed it with her.

"Didsbury Mosque said the BBC investigation was ""misleading"" An investigation into a sermon at a mosque where the Manchester Arena bomber worshipped has found no offences were committed. Two Muslim scholars claimed the sermon by Imam Mustafa Graf at Didsbury Mosque in 2016called for the support of fighters in Syria. Six months later Salman Abedi killed 22 people after an Ariana Grande concert. Mr Graf denied preaching Islamic extremism and police have said their investigation has now ended. The sermon was held in December 2016 when the Syrian city of Aleppo had beencaught in a four-year deadlock. The BBC obtained a recording where Mr Graf was heard saying: ""Jihad for the sake of Allah is the source of pride and dignity for this nation."" Didsbury Mosque previously said the BBC investigation was ""a misleading report, out of context, which appears to create an association between the criminal act of Salman Abedi and a dated sermon at the mosque"". It said the sermon encouraged people ""to pray to God to help those victims of oppression"" and ""there was no call for any military Jihad"". Mr Graf also denied he had called for armed jihad. Imam Mustafa Graf has denied ever preaching Islamic extremism A joint statement from Manchester City Council and Counter Terrorism Policing North West confirmed no offences had been committed.

The word ""jihad"" is widely used, though often inaccurately - and it can be interpreted differently, depending on who is using it and why In Arabic, the word means ""effort"" or ""struggle"" In Islam, it could be an individual's internal struggle against baser instincts or the struggle to be a good citizen and build a strong society Jihad is also used to refer to religiously-justified military action or self-defence of civilians against an aggressor - similar to the Christian concept of a ""Just War"" A mujahideen is a term usually used for someone who engages in the latter form of jihad The term is also widely used by groups that carry out terrorist attacks - such as al-Qaeda and the self-styled Islamic State group Confusingly, terrorist groups also describe themselves as mujahideen Muslim jurists agree there are conditions for armed jihad, says Dr Emman El-Badawy, a counter-extremism expert, including that it can only be declared by a Muslim leader, not an individual, and only enemy combatants are legitimate targets, not innocent civilians Abedi killed 22 people and injured hundreds more when he detonated a suicide bomb at the Manchester Arena concert on 22 May 2017.

"This video can not be played Faith Wilthew said she self-harmed and attempted suicide A teenager has said she felt like a ""caged animal"" during a four-year spell at a mental health hospital which is under investigation. Faith Wilthew, 18, said she self-harmed and attempted suicide at West Lane Hospital in Middlesbrough. She said she was ""told it was my own choice if I wanted to self-harm"". Hospital bosses said they expected staff to treat patients with respect, while the care and safety of ""service users"" was ""first priority"". Twenty staff members have been suspended at the hospital over claims they used ""non-approved"" techniques to move patients. The investigation is being overseen by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Concerns were raised in November about care at West Lane, amid allegations staff used techniques for moving patients which were ""not taught and not in line with trust policy"". Miss Wilthew claimed she was not offered any support by staff when she displayed signs of self-harming. She said: ""Most of the time I felt like I was in prison. I went in there at 14 with not a scar on my body and I came out at 18 full of scars. ""I was just told it was my own choice if I wanted to self-harm. ""Sometimes they would lift me off my bed by my hands and feet and just drop me onto the floor and restrain me. Things need to change."" Faith Wilthew's mother said her daughter banged her head against a wall for 72 hours Miss Wilthew's mother Kelly said the years that followed her admission saw her daughter sectioned before she won a fight to get her home. Mrs Wilthew said: ""At one point she started banging her head against the wall. ""She did it for about 72 hours and they told her that it was her choice if she wanted to go on doing that. ""When I went in to see her there was still blood on the wall."" Mental health: UK could ban social media over suicide images Too many children 'not being treated for mental health problems' Social media and reality TV is 'bad for body image' The trust has declined to speak about any specific allegations involving individual cases. However, Elizabeth Moody, Tees, Esk and Wear Valley NHS Foundation Trust's director of nursing, said: ""The care and safety of all our service users is our first priority and we expect our staff to show respect for their dignity and well-being. ""We take any allegations that could suggest otherwise extremely seriously. ""Our staffing levels are reviewed on a twice-daily basis by senior clinical leaders to ensure the quality of care delivered to the young people at all times.""

"A police officer who allegedly failed to pass on images of a suspected acid attacker is under investigation. The Met Police detective was investigating an acid attack in March 2017 in north London in which a woman suffered hand and leg injuries. The officer obtained CCTV footage of the incident but allegedly did not circulate it until 20 months later. The suspect was identified as Xeneral Webster, who went on to commit a second attack, killing a 47-year-old woman. Xeneral Webster was jailed for the manslaughter of Joanne Rand who died after being splashed with acid In June 2017, during an argument with a man in High Wycombe, Webster took out a bottle of acid which splashed 47-year-old bystander Joanne Rand head-to-toe. She died of her injuries 11 days later. Webster was jailed for17 years for Ms Rand's manslaughter in July. Ms Rand's family believe she would not have been attacked if Webster had been dealt with at the time. In a statement, the family said: ""Had this acid attack in March 2017 been investigated properly at the time, Webster... would have been dealt with and may not have been free to carry out the horrific attack in June 2017 on Jo and she may still be with us."" They added: ""We feel very concerned for the lady who was the victim of this (original) attack. We feel let down by the Metropolitan Police."" The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it was investigating the police officer in a gross misconduct case, for alleged breaches of professional standards relating to his duties and responsibilities.

"Ian Hindle (right) wants to raise awareness about ovarian cancer BBC journalist Dianne Oxberry died from ovarian cancer, her husband has said. The former Radio 1 presenter died aged 51 at the Christie Hospital in Manchester earlier this month. Her husband Ian Hindle said he wanted to raise awareness about the disease and hoped to set up a charity in his wife's memory. Mr Hindle said money raised would ""help families and individuals... suffering from this aggressive disease"". He added: ""The aim is also to raise awareness about ovarian cancer and its after-effects, particularly where families have suffered sudden loss which can often be the case with this appalling disease."" Radio 1 DJs, including Dianne Oxberry, gathered for the station's 25th birthday in 1992 Oxberry's death on 10 January prompted an outpouring of tributes and reaction, including BBC radio presenter Simon Mayo, who worked with her on the Radio 1 Breakfast Show in the 1980s. ""There was a spark in the studio when she was there and I think everyone is very devastated that she has gone,"" he said. ""She was very intelligent, she was very sharp and very charismatic and that huge warmth is what listeners and viewers will take away."" Dianne Oxberry took part in a 100-mile relay walk for BBC Children in Need in November According to Cancer Research UK there are about 7,400 new ovarian cancer cases in the UK every year, with almost six in 10 diagnosed at a late stage.

"More than 600 people were arrested in raids targeting ""county lines"" Children as young as 11 are being exploited by gangs running ""county lines"" drug networks, MPs have heard. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said there had been a rapid rise of ""county lines"", where city-based gangs exploit people to sell drugs in smaller towns. It told the Commons Home Affairs Committee that more than 2,000 phone lines are being operated by gangs across the UK - up from 720 a year ago. Twenty-three police force areas were now involved, the NCA said. Most of the vulnerable people exploited were children aged 15-17. ""County lines"" is a tactic whereby gangs in places such as London, Liverpool and Birmingham introduce untraceable phones to a different area to sell drugs at street level. Local runners - often teenagers - are used to transport the drugs. Teen orphan forced to be heroin dealer Drugs violence 'at unprecedented level' Victim's 'terrifying' cuckooing ordeal Nikki Holland, director of investigations at the NCA, told MPs that the latest assessment showed law enforcement agencies had ""greater awareness"" of the problem. But she warned that the issue had spread from London, the West Midlands and Merseyside to involve more than half of the UK's police force areas. In an annual report on the issue, the NCA said that data from last year showed that victims were younger than previously identified, with ages ranging between 11 and 56. This video can not be played What is County Lines? Gangs establish contact and build relationships before the exploitation takes place, so some may have been approached at an even younger age, the NCA said. They targeted children with backgrounds of poverty, family breakdown, exclusion from school or behavioural and developmental disorders, the agency said, but children of ""seemingly stable backgrounds"" were also exploited. Profits of more than Â£800,000 can be generated from an individual phone number, known as a ""deal line"", according to the NCA. Mass marketing text messages are used to advertise drugs along with two-for-one deals and free samples offered in exchange for the contact details of potential customers, the report said. The NCA also identified an ""emerging trend"" of using app-based taxi services to transport gang members and potential victims of exploitation. After a week of raids, police said that 600 people have been arrested and over 140 weapons seized, including 12 firearms, swords, machetes, axes and knives. Police referred 40 people as potential victims of human trafficking or modern slavery and discovered 400 vulnerable adults and 600 children in need of support. In a statement, Ms Holland said: ""We know that criminal networks use high levels of violence, exploitation and abuse to ensure compliance from the vulnerable people they employ to do the day-to-day drug supply activity."" She said law enforcement agencies aimed ""disrupt their activity and take away their assets"" to block the cash flow of organised crime groups. Children aged between 15 and 17 were the majority of those exploited in county lines, with both boys and girls involved, the NCA said. It said the ""grooming techniques"" were similar to ""child sexual exploitation and abuse"", with gifts and attention as well as threats of violence.

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attended a meeting of the Michelin Action Group The Duke of Cambridge has said he is ""optimistic"" about the future for workers at a tyre factory in Dundee which is set to close. Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge met staff from the Michelin premises during a visit on Tuesday. They joined workers at the Crescent community centre and asked how the closure was affecting them. The couple, known in Scotland as the Earl and Countess of Strathearn, also opened Dundee's V&A Museum of Design. Speaking at the Michelin Action Group meeting, Prince William said: ""The factory has been a huge part of Dundee's very fabric.  It has been a key employer for generations and has helped sustain the local economy for nearly 50 years. ""For everyone affected, the hope is that all of you sat in this room can find a positive way forward. ""You all deserve enormous credit for sitting around this table together to find a constructive way forward. It is understandable that there are different views about what is the right course to take."" The duke and duchess spoke to Michelin workers He added: ""As I have just heard, when a community faces uncertainty, people feel more optimistic when leaders such as yourselves work together for that community. ""Because of the collaborative approach adopted by the people in this room, I am optimistic that a good outcome is possible with the site at Michelin."" Prince William said he was encouraged by the fact that a taskforce had been established with all the key players represented. ""As a result of you working together responsibly to find a long-term solution, you have already reached agreement on developing the site into a manufacturing, recycling and low-carbon transport hub. ""The workers we spoke to just now were encouraged to hear about this. They look forward to hearing further detail about how this will affect them directly. Catherine and I look forward to learning more about your plans in this discussion. ""Both of us, and all of the people that we have spoken to today, are willing you to succeed.""

The closure will take place by mid-2020 after it was deemed ""unsuitable"" in the current climate. Since then it has joined the taskforce - along with the local authority and Scottish Enterprise, among others - to find a solution for the site and its staff. Brian Cairns is the firm's HR business partner, working on the My Future programme to help reskill and retrain staff. The 54-year-old from Alva, Clackmannanshire, said: ""(The duke) was interested in who we are and the service with Michelin. ""One of the comments he made is how there seemed to be a lot of camaraderie still at the table. ""The problem we have in Dundee is we have people who have been employed for 30, 40 years and have never written a CV, have never had an interview and the job market has changed dramatically. ""What Dundee are offering its employees I've never heard of before. It's absolutely fantastic."" The Royal couple were welcomed to the museum by Dundee lord provost Ian Borthwick Scottish Economy Secretary Derek Mackay added: ""I want to thank the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for attending the Michelin Dundee Action Group and for recognising the collaborative approach we have taken to secure a long-term future for the Michelin Dundee site. ""The Scottish government will continue to do everything we can to support the repurposing of the Michelin Dundee site as an Innovation Parc, as it becomes a key location for low carbon energy and low carbon transport development in Scotland.""

"""It might not be 326 that matters"". According to one cabinet minister, that's the strange situation that Brexit has led us to. The government's ambition is so low - or its hurdles so high - that what No 10 seeks to do on Tuesday is not to win (326 is a majority in the House of Commons), but to reduce the scale of resistance to their central policy that, in the words of another cabinet minister, only the ""hardliners oppose"", so that Theresa May can get the rebels down to a ""few dozen"", so then they can crack on. But crack on with what, I hear you ask? Government supports Irish backstop change A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' The EU has been clear again and again that it won't budge on the backstop unless the UK ""evolves its position"", to use the posh phrase. In other words it won't budge until there is a clearer picture from the UK, even though, in the end, budge it well might (NB, shifting a bit is not the same as junking it, before you get too excited, remember). But reducing the scale of discomfort is important for the government on Tuesday. That's why, although Sir Graham Brady's amendment is unlikely to get through - it doesn't have the support of the ardent Brexiteer core in the ERG, and maybe or maybe not the DUP, which won't decide until the morning - ministers are forcing their MPs to do something very weird. They are trying to make them vote FOR a plan that says the prime minister's deal needs to be changed, in the hope that message is conveyed strongly across the Channel into continental ears. And if the level of opposition shrinks to be a molehill rather than a mountain, maybe then, in time, Brussels can conclude there is something worth working with. That is still a huge ""if"". And there is also still the possibility on Tuesday that MPs, either through Yvette Cooper's plan or the less dramatic (in terms of process) idea from Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, might vote to try to force No 10 to rule out leaving without a deal at the end of March. Only Ms Cooper's plan would actually be binding, and it's not clear how the government would respond in either case. But again, that kind of result would send its own message to the rest of the EU - one the prime minister is keen to avoid for fear it would weaken her bargaining hand. For No 10, the obvious way of ruling out no deal is to back Mrs May's agreement. But takers for that plan are still, for her, in too short supply. Parliament may push her in that direction on Tuesday against her will. But at the risk of depressing you about Tuesday providing a clear conclusion, it is also quite feasible that none of the plans will pass. After months of saying, ""ask us, ask us!"", MPs have a real opportunity to vote for Brexit plans they have brewed up. But if none of them is able to get a majority, Parliament may yet just prove itself, again, a place where trust is low, tension is high, but agreement is hard to find. Late on Monday evening, maybe, just maybe, there was a sign that all of this Parliamentary turmoil might be about to be usurped by something that has felt until now absolutely out of reach. Rival factions of the Tory party who until now have been so often trying to knock lumps out of each other, have, we can report, been meeting and talking, trying to thrash out a compromise. Brexiteers Steve Baker and Jacob Rees-Mogg have met the prime minister alongside former Remainers like Nicky Morgan and Damian Green, accompanied by government ministers like Robert Buckland, the solicitor general. They have, together, come up with what looks like, at a very early stage, what might be two potential compromises that the Tory party as a group might be able to get around. Whether they'd get backing from other parties, or the EU, is another question. But it is a potential way forward, that has lit up Tory messaging groups with emojis of champagne bottles, and claims that it might be the way out of their mess. You can see the plan for yourselfhere,external, or below. Number 10 is not ready to back it yet, although the group of unlikely compadres has discussed it with her. Nor will it be what MPs vote on, on Tuesday. But it might, just might, be the start of something - a whisper of a compromise, perhaps, after months and months where division has ruled the day.

"A police officer who allegedly failed to pass on images of a suspected acid attacker is under investigation. The Met Police detective was investigating an acid attack in March 2017 in north London in which a woman suffered hand and leg injuries. The officer obtained CCTV footage of the incident but allegedly did not circulate it until 20 months later. The suspect was identified as Xeneral Webster, who went on to commit a second attack, killing a 47-year-old woman. Xeneral Webster was jailed for the manslaughter of Joanne Rand who died after being splashed with acid In June 2017, during an argument with a man in High Wycombe, Webster took out a bottle of acid which splashed 47-year-old bystander Joanne Rand head-to-toe. She died of her injuries 11 days later. Webster was jailed for17 years for Ms Rand's manslaughter in July. Ms Rand's family believe she would not have been attacked if Webster had been dealt with at the time. In a statement, the family said: ""Had this acid attack in March 2017 been investigated properly at the time, Webster... would have been dealt with and may not have been free to carry out the horrific attack in June 2017 on Jo and she may still be with us."" They added: ""We feel very concerned for the lady who was the victim of this (original) attack. We feel let down by the Metropolitan Police."" The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it was investigating the police officer in a gross misconduct case, for alleged breaches of professional standards relating to his duties and responsibilities.

"Gas from Glengorm could be tied back to the Elgin-Franklin or Culzean platforms A significant gas discovery in the central North Sea is being described as the biggest find in more than a decade. Chinese state-owned company CNOOC said it made the gas discovery - equivalent to 250 million barrels of oil - in its Glengorm project, east of Aberdeen. Further appraisal work is planned, but it is understood it could be extracted using existing infrastructure. Friends of the Earth Scotland said the find was terrible news for the climate. Glengorm sits 118 miles (190km) east of Aberdeen, close to Total's Elgin-Franklin and Culzean fields, and could be tied back to one of their platforms. Total owns a 25% stake in the Glengorm field. Glengorm sits close to Total's Elgin-Franklin and Culzean fields, and could be tied back to one of their platforms Xie Yuhong, of CNOOC, said the company was ""looking forward to further appraisal"". Kevin McLachlan, of Total, added: ""Glengorm is another great success for Total in the North Sea, with results at the top end of expectations and a high condensate yield in addition to the gas. ""Our strong position in the region will enable us to leverage existing infrastructures nearby and optimise the development of this discovery. ""Glengorm is an achievement that demonstrates our capacity to create value in a mature environment thanks to our in-depth understanding of the basin."" Analysts Wood Mackenzie described the find as the largest in the North Sea since the Culzean field was discovered in 2008. Senior analyst Kevin Swann said: ""There is a lot of hype around frontier areas like West of Shetland, whereTotal discovered the Glendronach field last year. But Glengorm is in the Central North Sea and this find shows there is still life in some of the more mature UK waters."" Environmental groups have criticised the discovery which, they say, will further contribute to climate change. They want energy companies to leave oil and gas in the ground and focus instead on renewable sources. Caroline Rance, from Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: ""It's a disgrace that oil and gas exploration is still going ahead in the seas off Scotland. ""It's high time our governments stopped supporting fossil fuel development, and get serious about planning a just transition away from this industry. ""These companies know all too well that their business is built on the destruction of the climate, which is devastating for millions of people around the world but they continue to seek profit from driving this catastrophe."" The Oil and Gas Authority has welcomed the discover, and said it demonstrated the considerable potential the industry still had to offer. Chief executive Andy Samuel said: ""This is very exciting news. Glengorm was first mapped as a prospect around 20 years ago and it is great to see CNOOC taking up the exploration opportunity and completing a difficult high-pressure, high-temperature exploration well. ""Our official estimate is that there still remains between 10 and 20 billion barrels plus to be recovered, so there is every chance of yet more significant finds, provided industry can increase exploration drilling and capitalise on the real value to be had here in the UK."" Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse said the announcement, ""highlights the significant potential for oil and gas which still exists beneath Scotland's waters"". He added:  ""Scotland's offshore oil and gas industry has an important role to play with up to 20 billion barrels of oil equivalent remaining under the North Sea and in the wider basin and discoveries such as this help to support security of supply as we make the transition to a low carbon energy system.""

"More than 600 people were arrested in raids targeting ""county lines"" Children as young as 11 are being exploited by gangs running ""county lines"" drug networks, MPs have heard. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said there had been a rapid rise of ""county lines"", where city-based gangs exploit people to sell drugs in smaller towns. It told the Commons Home Affairs Committee that more than 2,000 phone lines are being operated by gangs across the UK - up from 720 a year ago. Twenty-three police force areas were now involved, the NCA said. Most of the vulnerable people exploited were children aged 15-17. ""County lines"" is a tactic whereby gangs in places such as London, Liverpool and Birmingham introduce untraceable phones to a different area to sell drugs at street level. Local runners - often teenagers - are used to transport the drugs. Teen orphan forced to be heroin dealer Drugs violence 'at unprecedented level' Victim's 'terrifying' cuckooing ordeal Nikki Holland, director of investigations at the NCA, told MPs that the latest assessment showed law enforcement agencies had ""greater awareness"" of the problem. But she warned that the issue had spread from London, the West Midlands and Merseyside to involve more than half of the UK's police force areas. In an annual report on the issue, the NCA said that data from last year showed that victims were younger than previously identified, with ages ranging between 11 and 56. This video can not be played What is County Lines? Gangs establish contact and build relationships before the exploitation takes place, so some may have been approached at an even younger age, the NCA said. They targeted children with backgrounds of poverty, family breakdown, exclusion from school or behavioural and developmental disorders, the agency said, but children of ""seemingly stable backgrounds"" were also exploited. Profits of more than Â£800,000 can be generated from an individual phone number, known as a ""deal line"", according to the NCA. Mass marketing text messages are used to advertise drugs along with two-for-one deals and free samples offered in exchange for the contact details of potential customers, the report said. The NCA also identified an ""emerging trend"" of using app-based taxi services to transport gang members and potential victims of exploitation. After a week of raids, police said that 600 people have been arrested and over 140 weapons seized, including 12 firearms, swords, machetes, axes and knives. Police referred 40 people as potential victims of human trafficking or modern slavery and discovered 400 vulnerable adults and 600 children in need of support. In a statement, Ms Holland said: ""We know that criminal networks use high levels of violence, exploitation and abuse to ensure compliance from the vulnerable people they employ to do the day-to-day drug supply activity."" She said law enforcement agencies aimed ""disrupt their activity and take away their assets"" to block the cash flow of organised crime groups. Children aged between 15 and 17 were the majority of those exploited in county lines, with both boys and girls involved, the NCA said. It said the ""grooming techniques"" were similar to ""child sexual exploitation and abuse"", with gifts and attention as well as threats of violence.

"Norwegian Air wants to raise 3bn Norwegian kroner (Â£268m) through a rights issue to improve its finances. The news comes as the company announced that its preliminary earnings for 2018 showed an operating loss of roughly 3.8bn kroner. The budget carrier said it was not in talks with any potential buyers after British Airways owner IAG abandoned its plans to buy it last week. In early trading on Tuesday, the company's shares plunged by 16%. Billionaire John Fredriksen and the airline's chief executive Bjorn Kjos and chairman Bjorn Kise have all agreed to underwrite the issue. Mr Kjos explained that the airline was going to change its strategic focus from growth to making cost savings. ""We will now get in place a strengthened balance sheet that supports the further development of the company,"" he said. In a statement, the airline added that this would ""increase its competitiveness and stand-alone financial strength"". The carrier confirmed that flights were unaffected by the news. A rights issue happens when existing shareholders of a company are offered the chance to buy new shares at a special price. Theo Leggett, business correspondent Norwegian is in a race against time. The company is nothing if not ambitious - and it has certainly made an impact in Europe's cut-throat aviation market. But it needs to become consistently profitable, before the money runs out. Norwegian's chief executive, Bjorn Kjos, has overseen a major expansion of the airline over the past five years, doubling the size of its fleet and expanding its route network dramatically. But his biggest gambit has been a major play into the low-cost long-haul market. Cheap transatlantic travel is not a new idea: Freddie Laker tried it in the 1970s. But it was only with the development of highly fuel-efficient aircraft like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner - which Norwegian is using - and the Airbus A350 that the idea really took off. Now others are following Norwegian's example. But all of this has come at a price. Norwegian has debts of $3.5bn and expects to rack up a sizeable loss for 2018. Problems with engines on its shiny new Dreamliners clearly haven't helped either. Small wonder Mr Kjos now says the carrier will focus on cost-cutting and profitability, rather than growth. His airline has shaken up the market - now it needs to show it can consistently make money from it as well. Last year, Norwegian Air launched the first-ever budget flight from London to South America Fares on the 14-hour trip to Buenos Aires started from Â£259 one-way. The company started as a small regional airline flying between Bergen and Trondheim in 1993. Bjorn Kjos is a former paratrooper and pilot Mr Kjos turned it into Scandinavia's largest airline and the third-biggest budget carrier in Europe. Norwegian's price strategy has been based on flying a young fleet of aircraft such as Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, which burn less fuel per passenger compared with other long-haul aircraft. These offer passengers a more upmarket experience than they may have come to expect from a budget airline, with modern interiors and the benefit of free wi-fi on all routes in the future. It flies from Gatwick, Manchester and Edinburgh airports to more than 150 destinations across Europe and worldwide including Boston, Dubai and San Francisco. But in the second quarter of last year, the Civil Aviation Authority's most recent data,Norwegian was the airline with the second highest number of complaints from UK passengers,,externalof those still in business. It received 526 complaints per million travellers carried in that three-month period to June 2018, behind Tui Airways with 663, but ahead of TAP Portugal, with 430, and Ryanair, with 319. Small Planet Airlines, which had its licence suspended by the CAA in November after filing for insolvency the previous month, had received 27,998 complaints per million customers in the same period. Budget airlines have had differing fortunes in recent months. In November,EasyJet announced a 41% rise in pre-tax profits to Â£578mfor the year to 30 September. And earlier this month, it said that it expected its full-year profits to meet City forecasts. However,Ryanair cut its profit forecast, blaming lower-than-expected air fares.

"This video can not be played John Malkovich says the new play might ""upset people, something does everyday"" John Malkovich is to star in a new play inspired by the disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein - and the actor says it may ""upset"" people. Bitter Wheat is being written by the Pulitzer prize-winning David Mamet, who will also direct the production. It will receive its world premiere in London's West End in June. It is ""a black farce about a very badly behaved media mogul,"" Malkovich told BBC News. Scores of women accused Weinstein of rape or sexual assault, and the allegations led to what becamethe #MeToo movement. Weinstein denies any claims of non-consensual sex and has described many allegations against him as ""patently false"". More than 70 women have accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct Malkovich, 65, says Harvey Weinstein was the ""starting point"" for the play and ""a reaction to the all the news that came out last year"" about him. But it has subsequently developed and now explores how people of positions of power in the entertainment industry have behaved badly for decades. Bitter Wheat, which will also star Doon Mackichan, is set in the present day and Malkovich plays Barney Fein, a depraved Hollywood producer. ""Of course it might upset people who've experienced the kind of treatment that the play contains and shows and describes,"" the former Oscar nominee says, adding: ""A lot of people may not like it. ""But what can I do about that? Personally I think it's a terrific piece of writing."" Malkovich is best known for films including Dangerous Liaisons, Being John Malkovich, Con Air and Mulholland Falls. The actor also gained a new audience of young fans over Christmas, as he starred in Netflix film Bird Box alongside Sandra Bullock. He recently appeared on television playing Hercule Poirot in a new BBC Agatha Christie adaptation, The ABC Murders. Malkovich plays Hercule Poirot in an adaptation of Agatha Christie's The ABC Murders He says he ""loved"" doing it. But he is aware ""it was a bit controversial and not appreciated in all quarters,"" and thinks that may make it unlikely that he would be asked to reprise the role. Back in 1998, Malkovich co-starred in the film Rounders -  which was financed by Weinstein. But he says beyond that ""I didn't really have any connection with him"". ""They say everyone in Hollywood knew [about his behaviour]. ""But that's not true - it was never a topic of conversation any time the name Harvey Weinstein came around with me."" Nonetheless, Malkovich says he hopes he is not ""complicit"" by being part of an industry which has allowed abuse of power to flourish unchallenged for years. ""Do I wish in retrospect I would have known a little more or said a little more?"" he muses. ""Yes, I suppose."" And although he thinks it is highly unlikely, he says it is not impossible that Harvey Weinstein could work in Hollywood again. ""It seems a long trip from where I'm sitting now, but nothing would surprise me about the movie business, nothing. ""One of the foundations of our society is the notion of redemption. ""It's a very tough topic. Could he be forgiven? That's not up to me. He didn't do anything to me. That's up to the individuals whose lives he affected."" Malkovich says its not impossible to think Harvey Weinstein could work in Hollywood again Other casting has yet to be announced but Malkovich says one of Harvey Weinstein's accusers did ask to read the Bitter Wheat, with a view to appearing in it. She later decided against it and he says he does not know why. The author, director and playwright David Mamet is no stranger to the subject of sexual harassment allegations in his work. In his play Oleanna, a student accuses her professor of misconduct. He has also written about Hollywood many times including Speed the Plow. He has described Bitter Wheat as a comedy, which given the subject matter may surprise people. But Malkovich argues: ""A lot of people will laugh. ""A lot of comedy for me exists at the crossroads between pain and farce,"" he says. ""In the end that's what theatre is for. A lot of great plays, done well, elicit the question do I laugh or do I cry?"" Bitter Wheat runs at the Garrick Theatre from Friday 7 June until  Saturday 21 September 2019.

"Passenger satisfaction with rail services has fallen to a 10-year low, according to the independent transport watchdog, Transport Focus. A survey of 25,000 people found 79% were satisfied overall with services,,externalthe lowest since 2008, with more than one in five passengers not satisfied. Worsening punctuality, last summer's timetable chaos and strikes are among the reasons for the fall. Rail firms Northern and Great Northern saw the biggest drops in satisfaction. Comparing autumn 2018 with autumn 2017, two of the 25 train operating companies (TOCs), Heathrow Express and Chiltern Railways, ""significantly improved"". Heathrow Express scored the highest rating of 96%. But over the same period seven operators ""significantly declined"": Great Northern, which had the lowest rating of 68%, Northern, TransPennine Express, Greater Anglia, Thameslink, ScotRail and London North Eastern Railway. Last year, Northern services were affected by engineering overruns, an unusually high amount of leaves on tracks and strikes, as well as the timetable chaos in May that affected all train operators. Other findings from the Transport Focus survey included: 71% were satisfied with levels of punctuality and reliability 46% were satisfied with value for money The value for money measure fell to 31% for commuter journeys Anthony Smith, chief executive of Transport Focus, said: ""Government and the industry must continue to focus on performance. In the longer term, the government's Rail Review must bring about fundamental change. ""Passenger irritation at poor performance erodes their most basic trust in the industry. Passenger frustration at continual fare increases saps confidence in the system to reform itself. ""Passenger anger during the summer timetable crisis was palpable."" A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""Passenger satisfaction is an absolute priority for the department, which is why we've introduced new measures on compensation, an independent rail ombudsman and commissioned an independent root and branch review of our railway. ""The survey did find that four out of five journeys are rated satisfactory, and our record Â£48bn investment will help to modernise the network and deliver significant improvements in performance, punctuality and capacity across the country."" Jacqueline Starr, managing director of customer experience at industry body the Rail Delivery Group, said: ""Punctuality is the bedrock of satisfaction for our customers and at the moment in too many places, we are not getting it right. ""Working together, we are investing billions of pounds in a long-term plan to rebuild key parts of the network to improve punctuality while putting thousands of new and refurbished carriages on track to make journeys more comfortable.""

"Asia Bibi's case had been hugely divisive in religiously conservative Pakistan Pakistan's top court has rejected a challenge to the acquittal of a Christian woman on blasphemy charges. The Supreme Court upheld its decision to overturn Asia Bibi's conviction and death sentence. She was originally convicted in 2010 after being accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad in a row with her neighbours, and spent eight years on death row. She has always maintained her innocence in a case that has polarised Pakistan.  Why are Pakistan's Christians targeted? The Supreme Court's quashing of her sentence last October led to violent protests by religious hardliners who support strong blasphemy laws, while more liberal sections of society urged her release. Hardliners had petitioned to overturn this ruling. ""Based on merit, this petition is dismissed,"" Chief Justice Asif Saeed Khosa said in court on Tuesday. Asia Bibi - also known as Asia Noreen - was unable to leave Pakistan while an appeal request was pending. ""She should now be free to reunite with her family and seek safety in a country of her choice,"" Amnesty International said in a statement. By M Ilyas Khan, Islamabad Asia Bibi is being kept by authorities at a secret location in Islamabad. The ruling clears the way for her to leave Pakistan, though it is not clear when that will happen and where she will go. She has been offered asylum by a number of countries, and some unconfirmed reports say several members of her family may already be abroad. Meanwhile, the court ruling will test the resolve of the far right Tehrik-e-Labbaik Pakistan group, which has conducted a violent anti-blasphemy campaign in the past, though many of its leaders have been under arrest since October when the court first acquitted Asia Bibi. In a concerted move to forestall public unrest, Pakistani electronic media is underplaying the story. Many observers believe the ruling will revive the practice of applying standard legal tests of criminal procedure while adjudicating blasphemy cases, as they had increasingly become hostage to vigilante justice by extremists. The trial stems from an argument Asia Bibi had with a group of women in June 2009. They were harvesting fruit when a row broke out about a bucket of water. The women said that because she had used a cup, they could no longer touch it, as her faith had made it unclean. Prosecutors alleged that in the row which followed, the women said Asia Bibi should convert to Islam and that she made offensive comments about the Prophet Muhammad in response. She was later beaten up at her home, during which her accusers say she confessed to blasphemy. She was arrested after a police investigation. Acquitting her, the Supreme Court said that the case was based on unreliable evidence and her confession was delivered in front of a crowd ""threatening to kill her"". There is widespread support for severe punishments for blasphemy in Pakistan Islam is Pakistan's national religion and underpins its legal system. Public support for the strict blasphemy laws is strong. Hardline politicians have often backed severe punishments, partly as a way of shoring up their support base. But critics say the laws have often been used to exact revenge after personal disputes, and that convictions are based on thin evidence. The vast majority of those convicted are Muslims or members of the Ahmadi community who identify themselves as Muslims but are regarded as heretical by orthodox Islam. Since the 1990s scores of Christians have also been convicted. They make up just 1.6% of the population. The Christian community has been targeted by numerous attacks in recent years, leaving many feeling vulnerable to a climate of intolerance. Since 1990, at least 65 people have reportedly been killed in Pakistan over claims of blasphemy. Asia Bibi, who was born in 1971 and has four children, was the first woman to be sentenced to death under the blasphemy laws. Pakistan Christian cleared of blasphemy Asia Bibi: Christmas in a prison cell Pakistani Christians fear blasphemy laws.

"The Old Bailey was told Fiona Onasanya had been texting on her phone when she was spotted speeding, in July 2017 An MP has become the first sitting member of parliament in nearly three decades to be jailed after she lied to police over a speeding ticket. Solicitor Fiona Onasanya had denied being behind the wheel when her car was spotted being driven at 41mph in a 30mph zone, in July 2017. The Peterborough MP was thrown out of the Labour Party after being convicted of perverting the course of justice. She has been jailed for three months after a re-trial at the Old Bailey. The court heard evidence Onasanya was texting as well as speeding, during the summer recess. Onasanya is the first sitting MP to be jailed since Terry Fields was sentenced to 60 days for refusing to pay his Â£373 poll tax bill in 1991. Festus Onasanya was jailed for 10 months after admitting perverting the course of justice She has stated she intends to appeal against her conviction. Her brother Festus was jailed for 10 months for his involvement, after pleading guilty to the same charge. Onasanya was elected as Labour MP for Peterborough in June 2017, six weeks before committing the offence, in Thorney, Cambridgeshire. She had ousted Conservative Stewart Jackson, who had held the seat for 12 years. The MP's Nissan Micra was caught by a speed camera in Thorney As he sentenced her, Mr Justice Stuart-Smith told Onasanya: ""You have not simply let yourself down, you have let down those who look to you for inspiration, your party, your profession and Parliament."" Her life as a new MP in 2017 was ""extremely hectic and chaotic"" and she had just been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when police began to pursue her, he noted. After Festus falsely filled out her Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP), she made the ""disastrous decision"" to keep up the lie from November 2017, he said. The prosecution told the court she went on to collude with her brother to avoid being subject to the speeding ticket. Fiona Onasanya now faces calls to resign by both the Labour and Conservative parties Tom Barton, BBC political reporter If Onasanya had been jailed for 12 months or more, parliamentary rules state she would have automatically lost her seat. With a three month jail term however, she will instead face what's known as a Recall Petition. Under new rules introduced in 2015, it means residents can force a by-election if the petition is signed by more than 10 per cent of the Peterborough electorate - around 7,000 people. However, because Onasanya has lodged an application to appeal against her conviction, the petition can't be opened until that process is complete. Once it is open, voters will have six weeks to sign it before a result is declared. Of course, she could choose to resign her seat before that point - if she did a by-election would follow a few weeks later. Mitigating, Christine Agnew QC said: ""Regardless of the sentence it will have a disastrous effect on every aspect of her life and career, a career she has worked very hard for. ""She has already been expelled from the Labour Party. At the moment she continues as an independent MP and the reason for that is it is her only income. ""It is highly likely as a result of today's sentencing hearing that she will lose her seat as an MP. ""It's a very public fall from grace. She will inevitably be struck off as a solicitor."" MP convicted of speeding driver lie MP 'was passenger' in speeding car MP speeding case 'became about lying' A spokesman for the Labour Party said Onasanya had ""let the voters of Peterborough down"". ""When she was found guilty she should have immediately done the decent thing and resigned,"" he said. ""Today's sentence gives Fiona one last opportunity to act honourably and resign from parliament. ""If Fiona does not resign, Labour will support local residents in their efforts to trigger a by-election through a recall petition."" The Conservatives also called for Onasanya to resign as an MP. ""She cannot possibly represent her constituents from prison and should do the decent thing and immediately step down,"" a spokesman said. ""If she doesn't, we will campaign to use a recall petition to ensure that the residents of Peterborough can have their say in a by-election for a new MP.""

"There is strong opposition to a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland Boris Johnson insists on them, Graham Brady is pushing hard for them, Prime Minister Theresa May seems to be praying for them and Dublin is deeply worried at the thought of them but will the EU ever actually ""give in"" and make changes to the backstop - that guarantee post-Brexit to avoid a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland? It's a tough one. The EU certainly never intended to budge on the backstop - painfully negotiated with the UK over 18 months and signed off last November by Mrs May and her cabinet. But Europe's leaders didn't imagine the UK would still be in such flux over Brexit so very close to B-day on 29 March. Conversations I had with EU figures before Christmas saw my contacts confidently predicting that 2019 would see a no-deal Brexit (which they didn't believe UK MPs would allow to happen), Theresa May's Brexit deal being passed by parliament with cross-party support when MPs realised the looming risk of no deal (they thought this outcome the most likely), or no Brexit at all. Brexit: A really simple guide Kuenssberg: Is Parliament's Brexit fog about to clear? No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' But now there is spreading concern, as the EU's deputy chief Brexit negotiator, Sabine Weyand, pointed out on Monday, that the UK could end up ""crashing out"" of the EU - not intentionally but simply because time allotted by law for exit negotiations could run out before any agreement is reached. This video can not be played Sabine Weyand: Risk of a 'crash out' is high ""The only reason there's still relative calm in EU circles about a no-deal Brexit is because we still have the popcorn out,"" one EU diplomat told me. ""We're mesmerised by the goings on in the House of Commons. But give it a few weeks: if nothing has changed, you'll soon see signs of panic in the (European) capitals."" Of course the EU wants to concentrate minds - for negotiating purposes - on the pain a no-deal Brexit will cause the UK but it will inevitably be costly and difficult for European citizens and businesses too. EU leaders won't want to be punished at the ballot box back home for not having done their best in the view of their voters to avoid all that, but you would be mistaken to then conclude Brussels will - when push comes to shove - pay any price to head off a no-deal Brexit. Behind closed doors, of course, there is a certain amount of game planning going on but the EU is currently in watch and wait mode. EU leaders believe the Brexit debate still has a way to run in parliament and they want to see which way the wind is blowing. They hope if they stand firm and refuse to reopen the Brexit withdrawal agreement, then MPs could be tempted to unite around a softer Brexit than the one advocated by Theresa May - in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit. This video can not be played Brexit vote explained in one minute Some EU leaders dream of a second referendum, resulting - perhaps - in a Brexit reversal. So put yourself in the EU's shoes for a moment: why make a move now as long as the above options appear (to varying degrees) to still be possibilities in the UK? This is why we've recently heard the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, insisting that there is flexibility in the Brexit text on EU-UK future relations, whereas the backstop text is unchangeable. The EU, as I mentioned earlier, wants very, very, very much to avoid making changes to the backstop. A reminder again as to why: Though sometimes scoffed at in the UK as an idea, the EU does indeed feel very much wedded to the Northern Ireland peace process, including cross-border co-operation, which it sees as having been very much facilitated by EU money and EU membership The provisions in the backstop are not being forced by the EU on the UK. The text was negotiated bilaterally and no other alternative found. Brussels feels it's often forgotten that the UK-wide customs provision in the backstop was a UK request rather than an EU imposition The EU will not want to sacrifice the concerns of member state Ireland ""just"" to achieve an exit deal (not even a final trade deal) with departing club member UK. Remember how the EU stood by Spain over Gibraltar when it came to the wording of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement? Well, solidarity with Ireland over the Brexit backstop is considerably stronger amongst EU leaders than it was with Madrid at the time The backstop is also a guarantee for the EU's single market. Don't forget, the land border between the single market and post-Brexit UK will run through the island of Ireland. And the EU is thinking bigger picture too. If Brussels ""caves in"" to the UK over the backstop, there's a fear that could encourage Brussels-sceptic governments in member states Hungary, Italy and Poland, for example, to flout club rules. It could also send a message of weakness to international trade partners. Yet despite all that, if EU leaders were staring into the no-deal Brexit abyss come 1 March, then blink they might over the backstop. And there are the beginnings of whispers to that effect in some EU corridors. Who knows now what changes the EU might eventually accept and it's very hard indeed to imagine them doing it without the OK from Dublin. But mindful of the ticking clock, the European Commission appears to be trying to focus minds in the Irish government and beyond (remember Theresa May's repeated pledge to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland?) on harsh realities. Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas - a man known to be extremely careful about what he does or doesn't say - last week pointedly announced that a no-deal Brexit would inevitably lead to some kind of hard border/ie physical checks. Margaritis Schinas (r) said if he was pushed to speculate it was ""pretty obvious you will have a hard border"" But anyone in Westminster who thinks the backstop issue could magically disappear should definitely think again. Not just in the context of the Brexit agreement but what comes after. Ireland - as every other EU member - has a veto over any future EU-UK trade deal and could use it if Dublin felt the border wasn't adequately protected. In conclusion, the EU will wait until the last minute to make concessions over the Brexit deal on the table. It's not in the market to make changes here and there only for Theresa May to come back again and demand more. That's why the message from EU leaders to the prime minister has been loud and clear. They have told her: ""Don't bother coming back to us in Brussels until you can convincingly (i.e. not just by a couple of votes) show us once and for all that the majority of parliament is behind you.""

"The European Union (EU) has accepted the UK's request for a Brexit delay until 31 January 2020, with an option to leave sooner if a deal is approved by Parliament. Delaying the UK's exit date requires an extension to Article 50, the part of the Lisbon Treaty that sets out what happens when a country decides it wants to leave the EU. Article 50 allows an initial two-year period for negotiations on the terms of exiting. It was triggered by then Prime Minister Theresa May on 29 March 2017, giving an exit date of 29 March 2019. But this date was extended twice, first to 12 April and then until 31 October, after Mrs May's deal was rejected in successive votes in the House of Commons. Now it is being extended for a third time - so how does this process work? The UK cannot make a decision about extending Article 50 on its own - it has to send a request to the 27 other EU countries. All 27 have to agree in order to secure an extension. On Saturday 19 October, Mr Johnson sent a letter, as he was compelled to by alaw known as the Benn Act. The law stated he must send an extension request should he fail to get a Brexit deal through the House of Commons by the end of 19 October. Mr Johnson also sent a second letter saying he believed that a ""further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners"". Nevertheless, on 28 October the EU agreed to the extension proposed in his first letter. The EU was not obliged to say yes. Once it received the UK's delay request, in the form of a letter, the 27 leaders consulted with each other on their decision. It was then made following a meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels. If EU leaders had decided to offer a longer extension they would have been likely to have met in person to set conditions of the extension. It's worth pointing out that Article 50 can also be revoked - effectively cancelling Brexit. The UK can in theory do that without consulting anyone else. That would mean that Brexit would not happen and the UK would remain in the EU on the same terms it has now. The Liberal Democrats are the only party to say that would they would revoke Article 50 without a referendum if they won a majority in a general election. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that a revocation should be ""unequivocal and unconditional"", suggesting that the ECJ would take a dim view of any attempt to withdraw an Article 50 notification and then resubmit it again a short time later.

"Apple placed this billboard at the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Apple has acknowledged a flaw in its FaceTime software that allowed for brief eavesdropping - even if the recipient did not pick up. In some cases the target iPhone could send video without the receiver's knowledge. The company said it had developed a fix and an update would be rolled out this week. In the meantime,Apple's status page shows it has disabled the ability,externalfor users to make group calls on FaceTime. The flaw,first revealed by the 9to5Mac blog,external, appears to occur when both users are running version 12.1 of Apple's mobile operating system iOS, or newer. It also affects Mac users when they are called from an iPhone. The technique involves using the software's group chat function, apparently confusing the software into activating the target's microphone, even if the call has not been accepted. The eavesdropping ends when the call is cut after too many rings. In addition to audio, 9to5Mac reported that pressing buttons to block the call or turn off the device would result in video being sent to the call-maker, without the recipient's knowledge. In a statement, Apple told journalists: âWeâre aware of this issue and we have identified a fix that will be released in a software update later this week.â On social media, concerned users -including Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey,external- suggested disabling the FaceTime function altogether, which can be done via the device's settings menu. Discovery of the flaw coincided with National Privacy Day in the US, a day heralded by Apple boss Tim Cook. âOn this #DataPrivacyDay let us all insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections,â hewrote on Twitter,external. âThe dangers are real and the consequences are too important.â New York governor Andrew Cuomo advised his state's residents ""to disable their FaceTime app until a fix is made available"", He said: ""The FaceTime bug is an egregious breach of privacy that puts New Yorkers at risk. ""In New York, we take consumer rights very seriously and I am deeply concerned by this irresponsible bug that can be exploited for unscrupulous purposes."" Apple also recently made a big play of its privacy credentials at the recent CES tech expo in Las Vegas. The company did not attend but placed a billboard near the event, reading: ""What happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone."" The timing of the revelations about the bug is awkward for Apple, which is due to announce its latest earning report on Tuesday. Analysts may question Mr Cook about the flaw.

"Didsbury Mosque said the BBC investigation was ""misleading"" An investigation into a sermon at a mosque where the Manchester Arena bomber worshipped has found no offences were committed. Two Muslim scholars claimed the sermon by Imam Mustafa Graf at Didsbury Mosque in 2016called for the support of fighters in Syria. Six months later Salman Abedi killed 22 people after an Ariana Grande concert. Mr Graf denied preaching Islamic extremism and police have said their investigation has now ended. The sermon was held in December 2016 when the Syrian city of Aleppo had beencaught in a four-year deadlock. The BBC obtained a recording where Mr Graf was heard saying: ""Jihad for the sake of Allah is the source of pride and dignity for this nation."" Didsbury Mosque previously said the BBC investigation was ""a misleading report, out of context, which appears to create an association between the criminal act of Salman Abedi and a dated sermon at the mosque"". It said the sermon encouraged people ""to pray to God to help those victims of oppression"" and ""there was no call for any military Jihad"". Mr Graf also denied he had called for armed jihad. Imam Mustafa Graf has denied ever preaching Islamic extremism A joint statement from Manchester City Council and Counter Terrorism Policing North West confirmed no offences had been committed. It said: ""We recognise that mosques have a very important and valuable role to play within our communities and we will always seek to work with trustees to strengthen those community relationships. ""Although at all times freedom of expression must be respected we understand that people may be concerned by the content of the BBC report, in particular the tone of the speech. ""We have engaged with the Mosque Trustees for several months and they have committed themselves to monitoring and dealing with behaviours which could be considered extreme while maintaining their right to freedom of expression. ""We will continue to work with these trustees."" The word ""jihad"" is widely used, though often inaccurately - and it can be interpreted differently, depending on who is using it and why In Arabic, the word means ""effort"" or ""struggle"" In Islam, it could be an individual's internal struggle against baser instincts or the struggle to be a good citizen and build a strong society Jihad is also used to refer to religiously-justified military action or self-defence of civilians against an aggressor - similar to the Christian concept of a ""Just War"" A mujahideen is a term usually used for someone who engages in the latter form of jihad The term is also widely used by groups that carry out terrorist attacks - such as al-Qaeda and the self-styled Islamic State group Confusingly, terrorist groups also describe themselves as mujahideen Muslim jurists agree there are conditions for armed jihad, says Dr Emman El-Badawy, a counter-extremism expert, including that it can only be declared by a Muslim leader, not an individual, and only enemy combatants are legitimate targets, not innocent civilians Abedi killed 22 people and injured hundreds more when he detonated a suicide bomb at the Manchester Arena concert on 22 May 2017. Abedi and his family regularly attended the mosque and his father sometimes led the call to prayer. A BBC spokesman said: ""We co-operated with Great Manchester Police in their investigation and we note their findings."" Didsbury Mosque has been approached for comment.

"Apple placed this billboard at the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Apple has acknowledged a flaw in its FaceTime software that allowed for brief eavesdropping - even if the recipient did not pick up. In some cases the target iPhone could send video without the receiver's knowledge. The company said it had developed a fix and an update would be rolled out this week. In the meantime,Apple's status page shows it has disabled the ability,externalfor users to make group calls on FaceTime. The flaw,first revealed by the 9to5Mac blog,external, appears to occur when both users are running version 12.1 of Apple's mobile operating system iOS, or newer. It also affects Mac users when they are called from an iPhone. The technique involves using the software's group chat function, apparently confusing the software into activating the target's microphone, even if the call has not been accepted. The eavesdropping ends when the call is cut after too many rings. In addition to audio, 9to5Mac reported that pressing buttons to block the call or turn off the device would result in video being sent to the call-maker, without the recipient's knowledge. In a statement, Apple told journalists: âWeâre aware of this issue and we have identified a fix that will be released in a software update later this week.â On social media, concerned users -including Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey,external- suggested disabling the FaceTime function altogether, which can be done via the device's settings menu. Discovery of the flaw coincided with National Privacy Day in the US, a day heralded by Apple boss Tim Cook. âOn this #DataPrivacyDay let us all insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections,â hewrote on Twitter,external. âThe dangers are real and the consequences are too important.â New York governor Andrew Cuomo advised his state's residents ""to disable their FaceTime app until a fix is made available"", He said: ""The FaceTime bug is an egregious breach of privacy that puts New Yorkers at risk. ""In New York, we take consumer rights very seriously and I am deeply concerned by this irresponsible bug that can be exploited for unscrupulous purposes."" Apple also recently made a big play of its privacy credentials at the recent CES tech expo in Las Vegas. The company did not attend but placed a billboard near the event, reading: ""What happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone."" The timing of the revelations about the bug is awkward for Apple, which is due to announce its latest earning report on Tuesday. Analysts may question Mr Cook about the flaw.

"The 53 year old was trapped all weekend in a lift at the Upper East Side property A woman has been rescued after spending an entire weekend trapped in her billionaire employer's lift, authorities said. The woman, reported to be 53-year-old Marites Fortaliza, entered the elevator at the Manhattan townhouse owned by investment banker Warren Stephens on Friday evening. Firefighters responded to an emergency call at 10:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on Monday and forced the lift open. Ms Fortaliza is recovering in hospital. According to a family statementreported by the Associated Press,externalMs Fortaliza was dehydrated but in a stable condition at Weill Cornell Medical Center. She has been ""a valued member of the Stephens extended family for 18 years"" and a family member accompanied her to the hospital, they are quoted as saying. Mr Stephens is the head of Stephens Inc,external, an investment bank based in Little Rock, Arkansas. Authorities said Ms Fortaliza was trapped between the second and third floors of the house, on the Upper East Side of the city near Central Park. The family were apparently away for the weekend, and nobody else was home while Ms Fortaliza was working. Mr Stephens' building has been flagged for a violation by the Department of Buildings,the New York Times reports,external, until the elevator can be inspected.

"GPs with patients who have a persistent sore throat, combined with shortness of breath, trouble swallowing or earache, should consider cancer as the cause, according to new research. Currently, it is recommended patients with persistent hoarseness or an unexplained neck lump are investigated for throat or laryngeal cancer. However, Cancer Research UK's Weilin Wu said patients should not be alarmed. ""A sore throat on its own wasn't linked to laryngeal cancer,"" he said. ""But importantly, this study also provides the best evidence to date to support the current recommendation to refer older patients with persistent hoarseness."" The larynx is part of the throat found at the entrance of the windpipe that helps you breathe and speak. In the UK, there are around 2,000 new cases of laryngeal cancer each year. The research, led by the University of Exeter, looked at patient records from more than 600 GP practices and studied 806 patients diagnosed with cancer of the larynx and 3,559 control patients. It is published in theBritish Journal of General Practice,external. Lead author Dr Elizabeth Shephard said it was the first real look at all the symptoms that might be important for laryngeal cancer. ""The significance of the study really is that we've found that hoarseness is important for laryngeal cancer, but significantly the risk of having laryngeal cancer greatly increases when it's combined with a recurrent sore throat,"" she said. More common in men Strongly linked to tobacco and alcohol use Early diagnosis improves outcomes Radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy are the main treatments If the cancer is advanced, the patient may have to have surgery to remove part or all of the larynx These patients will no longer be able to speak or breathe in the usual way They will breathe through a permanent hole in their neck (stoma) and will need additional treatment to help restore their voice This may include a throat implant or an electrical device you hold against your throat to produce sound Source:NHS Choices,external One of the study authors, Prof Willie Hamilton, was the clinical lead for the current guidelines from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). He said their research is important because it ""has shown the potential severity of some symptom combinations previously thought to be low risk."" ""When NICE guidance for cancer investigation was published, there was no evidence from GP practices to guide this - nor to inform GPs,"" he said. Smoking can increase the risk of cancer of the larynx But he points out they are not talking about just any sore throat  - ""the sore throat has to be significant enough to go to the GP"". ""We're all used to sore throats, but the sore throats that are reported to GPs are already unusual because it's gone outside the patient's norms."" And it is the combination of persistent symptoms - sore throat, hoarseness and breathing or swallowing problems - that could be a warning sign, he said. Dr Shephard said the study will feed into the NICE guidelines when they are updated. ""It's vital for selecting the right patients for referral.

"PM clashed with Labour leader in the Commons at Prime Minister's Questions The prime minister discussed Brexit Jeremy Corbyn in Commons meeting Theresa May set for more talks with EU leaders MPs backed a proposal for her to renegotiate her Brexit deal The EU says the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation Richard Morris, Sophie Morris, Robbie Hawkins & Georgina Pattinson The EU's chief negotiator says the backstop will not be renegotiated, despite the UK's request. Irish foreign minister says preventing a hard border is ""more important than economic relationships"". The Brexit train has trundled on today, with reaction across Europe to the decision by Theresa May to return to Brussels and seek ""alternative arrangements"" to the Irish backstop. In the Commons at Prime Minister's Questions, Jeremy Corbyn and the prime minister battled over what was next, as the Labour leader sought further detail on what would change and where Mrs May was willing to compromise. Following PMQs, the two party leaders met for talks on what was next for Brexit. Labour described the talks as ""serious and engaged"", suggesting the prime minister was ""interested
in exploring details"" around a customs union. Politicians in Ireland criticised the backstop rejection, with Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney urging the prime minister to seek consensus before negotiations ""ran out of road"" and others accusing the prime minister of acting in bad faith. In the European Parliament, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and many MEPs were also critical - suggesting the withdrawal agreement would not be open for renegotiation and calling for a clearer direction of desire travel from Westminster. And the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier says the Irish backstop is ""part and parcel"" of the UK's Brexit deal and will not be renegotiated. Brexit Radio 4 PM Speaking to Radio 4's PM, Labour's Margaret Beckett says that there a lot of MPs who are ""nurturing the view...that as long as they are seen to have facilitated Brexit, even if it is a disaster, their constituents will be grateful to them"". ""We are not the government, and we are not the biggest party"" in the Commons, she says, adding that if people complain about Brexit, they will blame the Conservatives. ""The House of Commons must accept some level of culpability,"" adds political journalist and commentator Steve Richards. Ms Beckett continues that MPs are being ""driven to"" take control of the process as the government has ""mishandled"" the process. But, she warns that the PM ""is driving a coach and horses through our unwritten constitution"". She says the UK now has ""an elected dictatorship"". BBC News Channel Speaking to the BBC News Channel, former director general of the UK Border Force Tony Smith says technological solutions to the Irish border are ""available"" and ""in theory all possible"". However, the border on the island of Ireland is ""an enigma"", with no workable solution being used elsewhere in the world. Working out how a necessary system could operate and setting one up would take ""some years"", he says. The border force don't currently know what checks would be required on goods, nor what regulatory or policy framework would exist. Once that can be agreed, the technology to make it work can be bought forward. ""Smart borders"" can meet some of the requirements, he says, ""but it's hard to know what technology and what context."" There is currently ""no presence"" from the border force in Northern Ireland, he adds, and this would most likely change, whilst there would be a lot more data that needed to be analysed. On a potential no-deal Brexit, the former head of UK Border Force says that whilst he ""doesn't share the doom"", what is needed is clarity on what checks would be required, and how other countries would handle their side of the border. ""We've shut borders before and they've opened again quite quickly."" ITV political correspondent tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Radio 4 PM Carolyn Quinn, speaking from the Commons, says that ""in theory"" all options are still in the table - although in law the UK is supposed to leave the EU on 29 March. She adds that ""if [Theresa May's] revised or unrevised deal fails to pass...then she may be forced to turn to a more cross-party approach"" and look at a ""customs union"" model for leaving the EU. Again, ""in theory"", it may not be possible for MPs to be asked to agree to the same deal again, as convention is that Parliament should not be asked to vote on the same matter twice.

Brexit Radio 4 PM Katya Adler, the BBC's Europe Editor says that the EU ""does not recognise"" the timetable of two weeks for renegotiations, but is willing to extend the timetable for leaving in order to allow the UK to agree the withdrawal treaty. She adds that in Norway and Switzerland the land borders have ""some kind of physical infrastructure"", but because of the historical peace process in Northern Ireland, this raises problems there. The EU and Ireland are trying to ""avoid talking about"" having to erect a hard border if the UK leaves without a deal, she states. She points out that this is just the UK's ""phase one"" of negotiations as the country is not yet negotiating its future trade deal with the EU.

BBC News Channel Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and the party's chief whip Nick Brown walk through Portcullis House in Westminster on their way to meet Theresa May Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn says his last words to Theresa May at their meeting this afternoon were ""don't bring no-deal back to the Commons"". ""I'm suspicious she is running down the clock,"" he says, ""it is quite possible she'll come back on February 13 with absolutely nothing."" He describes his meeting with the prime minister as ""serious
and exploratory on the issues"", adding that he put forward Labour's case ""for a comprehensive customs union with the EU"", and says on the issue of the backstop ""she listened"". He says he is willing to meet the government again ""on the principle...there isn't a cliff edge exit from the EU at the end of March"". Mr Corbyn adds that he is ""very disappointed"" some Labour MPs voted in favour of the Brady amendment or abstained in the vote last night, adding that he will be ""having discussions with them"". He reiterates that the Labour position is for a customs union, a strong relationship with the single market and to ensure the protection of jobs. Radio 4 PM Sam Coates, deputy political editor at The Times, says the meeting between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May lasted 45 minutes, but no conclusions have been reached. He says it was ""inevitable"" that ""not much progress was going to be made"" because of their own opinions on how Brexit should be carried out. ""I don't think a great deal was done,"" he adds, ""this is about showing that you're doing everything you can, rather than trying to change the facts on the ground."" Brexit BBC News Channel Conservative Brexiteer John Whittingdale says that last night ""sent a very clear message"" that there is a Parliamentary majority for a deal if the backstop can be altered. He says he wants to see a ""legal assurance"" that the UK will not be held in the backstop after the transition period. He adds that there are some ""other voices in Europe"" saying that they may be willing to look again at the backstop. ""It is up to the European Union, and particularly the Irish government, to come up with an alternative,"" he says, ""I think realism will break out."" ""I don't want us to leave without a deal,"" he adds. ""I think there are going to be problems attached to a no deal."" Private Members' Bills Motion House of CommonsParliament MPs have passed a motion allocating an extra three days to discuss legislation proposed by backbenchers. The vote means that private members' bills (PMBs) will take precedence over government business when the Commons sits on Friday February 8, March 15 and March 22. Conservative MP Sir Christopher
Chope had tabled an amendment to prevent PMBs having precedence on any other
day of the current parliamentary session, although this was not selected by the Speaker John Bercow. The motion was approved unopposed. Observer policy editor tweets Allow Twitter content?

Speaking to the Irish broadcaster RTE, Ireland's Foreign Minister (and deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney, has criticised Theresa May's approach of narrowing the choice over Brexit to either granting the concessions she's seeking or going forward with no deal at all. ""That's like saying in a negotiation, 'Well, either you give me what I want or I'm jumping out the window'. We have a deal. The British government was part of that."" Describing the situation as ""extraordinary"", Mr Coveney suggested realistic alternatives lay in reaching out to the opposition ""in a real way"" and seeking a consensus across Westminster. ""She hasn't done that,"" he said. Barclays is preparing to move Â£166bn worth of assets from London to its Irish division, a High Court judgement has revealed. The reason for this is that the bank is concerned that City financial services firms could lose their special ""passporting"" rights that enable them to provide services across Europe, in the event that a no-deal Brexit comes to pass. ""Due to the continuing uncertainty over whether there might be a 'no-deal' Brexit, the Barclays Group has determined that it cannot wait any longer to implement the scheme,"" the judgement says. ""The overriding requirement, however, is that Barclays Bank Ireland must be legally and operationally ready to conduct all relevant regulated business with the in-scope clients by no later than 29 March 2019, which is the date currently set for Brexit.""

"Police believe Luke Jobson was involved in an altercation outside a pub Six teenagers have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after a man seen being chased was found dead in a river. Luke Jobson, 22, went missing after his family said he was ""chased"" by a group outside a pub in Yarm in Teesside early on Saturday. Police said six males, all aged 16 to 18, came forward following appeals for information about his disappearance. Officers confirmed a body recovered in a river on Monday was Mr Jobson's. On Monday, Cleveland Police said it was believed Mr Jobson had been involved in an altercation outside The Keys pub. Hundreds of people came to pay their respects A fundraising page for his family which had a target of Â£2,000 has raised more than Â£50,000.

"Singer Amy Shark tweeted about the discovery of two stowaways Australian musician Amy Shark says two stowaways were found hiding in her tour bus as it prepared to cross a border into the UK, describing the discovery as ""scary"" and ""heartbreaking"". Shark said the pair were found in the vehicle's luggage compartment on a trip from Brussels to London. Both intruders swiftly left the bus after being discovered, Shark tweeted. She said it had given her crew a scare, but that she felt for those choosing a ""dangerous way to chase a new life"". ""They didn't threaten us or say a word - they just walked away when found,"" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Tuesday. Shark, whose real name is Amy Louise Billings, is a prominent singer-songwriter in Australia best known for her songs Adore and I Said Hi. She wrote on Twitter that she had ""no idea"" how the pair had entered the bus. She did not say where they had exited. ""I didn't think this stuff happened I'm so naive hey,"" she wrote.

"Jack Shepherd appeared in an extradition hearing in the Georgian capital Tbilisi last week A judge has ruled against a petition to quickly extradite speedboat killer Jack Shepherd back to the UK. He was convictedof the manslaughter by gross negligence of Charlotte Brown, but fled to Georgia. After months on the run, he surrendered himself to Georgian police and was jailed for three months ahead of an extradition hearing. Attempts were made by Georgian prosecutors to return Shepherd ""within days rather than months"". His lawyer Mariam Kublashvili says the charge he was convicted of does not apply under Georgian law. This video can not be played Charlotte Brownâs father Graham told BBC Radio 5 Live he felt an âoverwhelming sense of emotionâ following the arrest The comments came as Shepherd appeared in Tbilisi City Court to hear whether he would be extradited earlier than thought. Speaking from inside a glass box, he declined the opportunity to return to the UK. In a previous appearance at the same court, Shepherd was jailed for three months ahead of an extradition hearing. However, the Georgian prosecutor's office is asking the court to grant ""simplified"" procedures so Shepherd can be sent back to the UK sooner. His defence team say they oppose the expedited extradition. Shepherd was jailed for three months when he appeared in court in Georgia last week Shepherd's lawyers told the judge there was a risk to Shepherd's safety in Britain andcited recent Nazi death threats made to his solicitor, Richard Egan, in the UK. Both prosecution and defence lawyers in Georgia said they are yet to receive all the documents from the British authorities related to the case. In an interview with the BBC, Mrs Kublashvili said Shepherd ""preferred"" to serve his sentence in Georgia. She added: ""What happened in the river of Thames is not a crime by Georgian law. ""If their behaviour which the person made or did not make is not in Georgian law a crime, the person must be not extradited. ""He prefers to serve his sentence in Georgia. For him it is better to stay here if it is possible."" This video can not be played Jack Shepherd told police he never asked if Charlotte Brown could swim Shepherd was convicted in his absence at the Old Bailey and sentenced to six years following the death of Ms Brown when the pair were thrown overboard in December 2015.

"Up to 1,000 defence workers could be redeployed to help the government cope with a no-deal Brexit, according to a memo seen by the BBC. The message, sent to staff in the Defence Equipment and Support agency, appeals for volunteers. The note said it was ""uncertain"" what work would be required if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement. But it said redeployment in these circumstances would offer a ""real development opportunity"". The SNP said Brexit was causing ""chaos and uncertainty"", but the government said the civil service had the ""flexibility to deliver"". Liberal Democrats Brexit spokesman Tom Brake accused the Conservative party of ""scaremongering about a no-deal Brexit when the prime minister could easily take the option off the table"". He called for another referendum, adding: ""Theresa May is attempting to run down the clock, tinker with unviable solutions to the Irish border and frighten MPs, businesses and the public into supporting her already defeated deal."" EU negotiator: High risk of UK crashing out No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' Brexit: A really simple guide Defence Equipment and Support is the agency within the Ministry of Defence that supplies the Army, Royal Navy and RAF with everything from food to fighter jets. It employs almost 12,000 civil servants and military personnel at 150 bases across the UK and abroad. The memo, issued by senior manager Neville Parton, said up to 1,000 staff might be needed for redeployment. He said the agency had been asked to identify volunteers ""across all levels and role profiles"" as part of contingency planning for a no-deal Brexit. Mr Parton said defence workers could be needed to support other government departments and local government. Defence Equipment and Support is an agency within the Ministry of Defence ""This provides a real development opportunity to take on a fresh challenge - developing new skills and experience,"" he wrote. ""It's currently uncertain what type of support might be required, for how long and where people might be required"". The memo suggested any redeployment should not last for not more than six months. The deadline for applications was 25 January - nine weeks before the UK's scheduled departure from the EU on 29 March. This video can not be played What happens in the event of no deal? The SNP's foreign affairs spokesman, Stephen Gethins, said ""the chaos and uncertainty is all-consuming"". He added: ""The government wants to divert 1,000 officials away from vital work supporting our armed forces, without the slightest clue what they're going to be doing. ""The UK government's contingency planning for a no deal is the very definition of too little, too late"". The redeployment request appears to be part of wider government efforts to prepare for Brexit and a possible no-deal scenario. There have already been reports of staff from the departments for education and international development shifting to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to help with farming and fisheries. There will be much work to do in these areas when the UK pulls out of the EU's common fisheries and agriculture policies. A government spokesperson said: ""The civil service has the flexibility to deliver government priorities and deploy resource appropriately to do this. ""This includes departments sharing staff and working together on joint projects"". In January 2019, the Institute for Government said that the UK civil service had expanded by 20,000 since the EU referendum,external. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks.

"Huawei is the world's second biggest smartphone maker by volume Chinese telecoms giant Huawei has denied any wrongdoing after US prosecutors filed a host of criminal charges against the firm. Huawei has also rejected criminal claims against its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, who was arrested in Canada last month. The charges filed against Huawei in the USinclude bank fraud, obstruction of justice and theft of technology. The case could escalate tensions between China and the US. In a statement, Huawei said it was ""disappointed to learn of the charges brought against the company today"". 'Huawei engineer tried to take a robot's arm' It said it did not commit ""any of the asserted violations"" and that it ""is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms Meng"". The statement said the allegations of stealing trade secrets were the subject of a settled civil suit, in which a jury found ""neither damages nor wilful and malicious conduct"". The indictment,external, announced on Monday, alleges Huawei misled the US and a global bank about its relationship with two subsidiaries, Huawei Device USA and Skycom Tech, to conduct business with Iran. The US announced charges against Huawei, several of its subsidiaries, and its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou US President Donald Trump's administration has reinstated all sanctions on Iran removed under a 2015 nuclear deal and recently imposedeven stricter measures, hitting oil exports, shipping and banks. A second indictment alleges Huawei stole,externaltechnology from phone company T-Mobile used to test smartphone durability, as well as obstructing justice and committing wire fraud. Huawei said it settled the dispute with T-Mobile in a civil case filed in 2014. The firm's technology, known as Tappy, mimicked human fingers to test phones. Timeline: What's going on with Huawei? All you need to know about Huawei's problems Should we worry about Huawei? Meng Wanzhou: Trapped in a gilded cage In all, the US has laid 23 charges against the company. ""These charges lay bare Huawei's alleged blatant disregard for the laws of our country and standard global business practices,"" said FBI Director Christopher Wray. Mr Wray said companies like Huawei ""pose a dual threat to both our economic and national security"". This video can not be played Will US charges sink China's Huawei? At a briefing in Beijing, government spokesperson Geng Shuang said there were ""political motivations"" behind US attempts to ""smear and suppress certain Chinese companies"". ""We urge them to treat Chinese enterprises in a fair and just way."" Huawei is one of the largest telecommunications equipment and services providers in the world, recently passing Apple to become the second biggest smartphone maker by volume after Samsung. But the US andother Western nations have been concerned that the Chinese government could use Huawei's technologyto expand its spying ability, although the firm insists there is no government control. The arrest of Ms Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, infuriated China. Meng Wanzhou is the daughter of the company's founder She was arrested on 1 December in Canada's western city of Vancouver at the request of the US. She was later granted a C$10m (Â£5.7m; $7.6m) bail by a local court. But she is under surveillance 24 hours a day and must wear an electronic ankle tag. Analysis by Karishma Vaswani, Asia business correspondent Huawei is what the Chinese call a national champion. A private firm, tasked with China's ambitions to go into the world and lead the way. But now the full force of the US justice system is being hurled at the firm. The allegations by the US Department of Justice are the most serious Huawei has ever seen, and go to the heart of the trade war between China and the US. Huawei has consistently denied the allegations, and the firm's boss says it is being used as a pawn in power games between the US and China. While the US says the charges against Huawei aren't about trade war, it is unlikely the Chinese will see it the same way. The charges come as the US and China prepare to hold high-level trade talks in Washington this week. US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross stated that the Huawei charges were ""wholly separate"" from ongoing trade negotiations with China. Why China is under pressure to make a trade deal US-China trade war in 300 words Firms look to new factories as tariffs bite However, the indictment focuses on the alleged theft of US technology, which has been amajor sticking point in trade negotiations. President Trump's administration has imposed tariffs on $250bn (Â£190bn) worth of Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to respond with its own tariffs. Both countries agreed last month to suspend new tariffsfor 90 days to allow talks. What is Huawei and why is it being banned?

"Apple placed this billboard at the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Apple has acknowledged a flaw in its FaceTime software that allowed for brief eavesdropping - even if the recipient did not pick up. In some cases the target iPhone could send video without the receiver's knowledge. The company said it had developed a fix and an update would be rolled out this week. In the meantime,Apple's status page shows it has disabled the ability,externalfor users to make group calls on FaceTime. The flaw,first revealed by the 9to5Mac blog,external, appears to occur when both users are running version 12.1 of Apple's mobile operating system iOS, or newer. It also affects Mac users when they are called from an iPhone. The technique involves using the software's group chat function, apparently confusing the software into activating the target's microphone, even if the call has not been accepted. The eavesdropping ends when the call is cut after too many rings. In addition to audio, 9to5Mac reported that pressing buttons to block the call or turn off the device would result in video being sent to the call-maker, without the recipient's knowledge. In a statement, Apple told journalists: âWeâre aware of this issue and we have identified a fix that will be released in a software update later this week.â On social media, concerned users -including Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey,external- suggested disabling the FaceTime function altogether, which can be done via the device's settings menu. Discovery of the flaw coincided with National Privacy Day in the US, a day heralded by Apple boss Tim Cook. âOn this #DataPrivacyDay let us all insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections,â hewrote on Twitter,external. âThe dangers are real and the consequences are too important.â New York governor Andrew Cuomo advised his state's residents ""to disable their FaceTime app until a fix is made available"", He said: ""The FaceTime bug is an egregious breach of privacy that puts New Yorkers at risk. ""In New York, we take consumer rights very seriously and I am deeply concerned by this irresponsible bug that can be exploited for unscrupulous purposes."" Apple also recently made a big play of its privacy credentials at the recent CES tech expo in Las Vegas. The company did not attend but placed a billboard near the event, reading: ""What happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone."" The timing of the revelations about the bug is awkward for Apple, which is due to announce its latest earning report on Tuesday. Analysts may question Mr Cook about the flaw.

"This video can not be played John Malkovich says the new play might ""upset people, something does everyday"" John Malkovich is to star in a new play inspired by the disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein - and the actor says it may ""upset"" people. Bitter Wheat is being written by the Pulitzer prize-winning David Mamet, who will also direct the production. It will receive its world premiere in London's West End in June. It is ""a black farce about a very badly behaved media mogul,"" Malkovich told BBC News. Scores of women accused Weinstein of rape or sexual assault, and the allegations led to what becamethe #MeToo movement. Weinstein denies any claims of non-consensual sex and has described many allegations against him as ""patently false"". More than 70 women have accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct Malkovich, 65, says Harvey Weinstein was the ""starting point"" for the play and ""a reaction to the all the news that came out last year"" about him. But it has subsequently developed and now explores how people of positions of power in the entertainment industry have behaved badly for decades. Bitter Wheat, which will also star Doon Mackichan, is set in the present day and Malkovich plays Barney Fein, a depraved Hollywood producer. ""Of course it might upset people who've experienced the kind of treatment that the play contains and shows and describes,"" the former Oscar nominee says, adding: ""A lot of people may not like it. ""But what can I do about that? Personally I think it's a terrific piece of writing."" Malkovich is best known for films including Dangerous Liaisons, Being John Malkovich, Con Air and Mulholland Falls. The actor also gained a new audience of young fans over Christmas, as he starred in Netflix film Bird Box alongside Sandra Bullock. He recently appeared on television playing Hercule Poirot in a new BBC Agatha Christie adaptation, The ABC Murders. Malkovich plays Hercule Poirot in an adaptation of Agatha Christie's The ABC Murders He says he ""loved"" doing it. But he is aware ""it was a bit controversial and not appreciated in all quarters,"" and thinks that may make it unlikely that he would be asked to reprise the role. Back in 1998, Malkovich co-starred in the film Rounders -  which was financed by Weinstein. But he says beyond that ""I didn't really have any connection with him"". ""They say everyone in Hollywood knew [about his behaviour]. ""But that's not true - it was never a topic of conversation any time the name Harvey Weinstein came around with me."" Nonetheless, Malkovich says he hopes he is not ""complicit"" by being part of an industry which has allowed abuse of power to flourish unchallenged for years. ""Do I wish in retrospect I would have known a little more or said a little more?"" he muses. ""Yes, I suppose."" And although he thinks it is highly unlikely, he says it is not impossible that Harvey Weinstein could work in Hollywood again. ""It seems a long trip from where I'm sitting now, but nothing would surprise me about the movie business, nothing. ""One of the foundations of our society is the notion of redemption. ""It's a very tough topic. Could he be forgiven? That's not up to me. He didn't do anything to me. That's up to the individuals whose lives he affected."" Malkovich says its not impossible to think Harvey Weinstein could work in Hollywood again Other casting has yet to be announced but Malkovich says one of Harvey Weinstein's accusers did ask to read the Bitter Wheat, with a view to appearing in it.

In his play Oleanna, a student accuses her professor of misconduct. He has also written about Hollywood many times including Speed the Plow. He has described Bitter Wheat as a comedy, which given the subject matter may surprise people. But Malkovich argues: ""A lot of people will laugh. ""A lot of comedy for me exists at the crossroads between pain and farce,"" he says. ""In the end that's what theatre is for.

"Greater Anglia has frustrated passengers by reducing carriages while it prepares for new trains A rail firm has told a commuter it is still running shorter trains because of last year's ""Beast from the East"" as parts of the UK brace for snow again. In October, Greater Anglia (GA) said it had reduced carriages on trains as a temporary measure, while it fixed those damaged by""slippery"" leaves. But this month, a commuter complaining about continued over-crowding was told last February's snowfall was to blame. In a statement, GA said the passenger had been sent the wrong explanation. Anglia Rail Users Group,external(ARUG) said it was ""laughable"" to blame fewer carriages in 2019 on 2018'sheavy snowfall. Snow has beenforecast for this week, with warnings it could disrupt travel. Tony Knight from Witham in Essex, who received the snow-based explanation this month, said: ""Greater Anglia are a complete joke."" The rail firm wrote to him saying there were ""a combination of factors currently affecting the level of maintenance required"". In the letter to Mr Knight, it said: ""Firstly we are still recovering from the damage done to our trains from the snowfall which resulted in over 25-plus units requiring new traction motors."" Commuters on a Greater Anglia train in October It added that it was having trouble getting motor parts and was juggling the ""challenges"" of introducing new trains in 2020 and attempting ""not to impact on availability of trains for our service requirements"". But in a statement to the BBC, the rail firm said: ""A member of staff was using the wrong information to answer this customer's enquiry."" A spokeswoman said the company was ""very sorry"" about this. She added that the number of shortened trains had fallen ""significantly"" since December and efforts were being made to reduce it further. ARUG claimed Greater Anglia had been runningshort-form trains for the past nine months,,externalin particular across Essex and Suffolk, and accused it of using maintenance staff to prepare for the new fleet instead. ""It's a shambles,"" said Derek Cox of ARUG, who claimed the company had failed to build in additional capacity to cope with carriages needing maintenance and repairs. ""Despite repeated requests, the company has been unable to confirm that a full capacity service will be restored before the completion of the rollout of the new trains, currently scheduled for the end of 2020,"" said Mr Cox. Commuters cannot claim compensation for short-formed trains or overcrowding The Witham MP, Priti Patel, has taken up the issue of overcrowding and short-form trains on behalf of constituents. In a letter dated 21 December she was told by GA's managing director James Burles: ""The number of trains which are shorter than usual has gone down compared to earlier in the year. ""But on some lines there have still been shorter trains than usual, which we're very sorry about.""

"This video can not be played Chris Mason recaps what has happened to the Brexit deal and explains the next key vote options MPs have voted on a series of amendments designed to change the direction of Brexit. Commons Speaker John Bercow selected seven amendments to be debated and voted on. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  Here are the amendments, and the results, in the order in which they took place. Instructed the government to rule out a ""disastrous no deal"" scenario (this optionwas supported by some Brexiteers but many MPs feared it would cause chaos at ports and disruption for businesses) and allowed Parliament to consider - and vote on - options including: An alternative Brexit deal involvingLabour's plan for a permanent customs unionwith Brussels and a version of the EU's single market Legislating to hold a public vote on either a deal or a proposition that has MPs' support Called for an extension of Article 50 Ruled out a no-deal Brexit Emphasised the role of the UK nations in the Brexit process Forced the government to make time for MPs to discuss a range of alternatives to the prime minister's Brexit plan on six full days in the Commons before 26 March. MPs would have been able to table amendments to be voted on at the end of the debate, which could have included alternative Brexit options such as Labour's plan, a second referendum,no dealand theNorway-style relationshippreferred by some MPs. This had the backing of some Labour backbenchers, as well as the SNP's Philippa Whitford, Lib Dem Tom Brake, Plaid Cymru's Jonathan Edwards and Caroline Lucas, of the Greens. Attempted to rule out the UK leaving the EUwithout a formal dealby allowing Parliament time to pass a new law. The bill to bring in the new law would have required Theresa May to seek to postpone Brexit day (currently 29 March) until 31 December, if MPs did not approve her deal by 26 February. The prime minister would have had to do this by asking the EU to agree to extend the two-year limit on Article 50 - the mechanism paving the way for the UK to leave the EU. It had the backing of senior Conservative backbenchers such as Nicky Morgan and Oliver Letwin, former Lib Dem health minister Norman Lamb and Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake. The Labour leadership had also decided to get behind this amendment and ordered Labour MPs to vote for it. But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said he backed limiting any extension to a ""short window"" of three months to allow time for renegotiation. Required the government to ask the EU to postpone Brexit day (without specifying for how long). Seeks to prevent a""no-deal"" Brexitby adding to the PM's motion that Parliament ""rejects the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without aWithdrawal Agreementand aFramework for the Future Relationship"". The two MPs are in neighbouring constituencies and have raised concerns over local manufacturing supply chains. Calls for Parliament to require the backstop to be replaced with ""alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border"" but otherwise supports the prime minister's deal. Theresa May ordered Conservative MPs to vote for this amendment. Some Conservative rebels, who voted against the prime minister two weeks ago, said it was too vague and did not address their other concerns about her deal. Others, such as former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, said they would support it if Mrs May indicated that she would press the EU to re-open the withdrawal agreement to make changes to the backstop that would be legally binding - something she has told MPs that she will do. Northern Ireland's DUP, which keeps Mrs May in power, also indicated they would back the Brady amendment. Neither of the Spelman nor the Brady amendments are binding on the government, although support for them puts political pressure on Theresa May to follow their direction. Theresa May has already said she will return to Brussels to reopen negotiations on legally-binding alternatives to the ""backstop"".

"Facebook's popularity among children fell during 2018, according to the media regulator Ofcom. It has published its annual report looking at the types of services and devices children in the UK are using. Its report suggests 72% of 12- to 15-year-olds with a social media account use Facebook, down from 74% in 2017. But Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, gained popularity. In 2018, 23% named it as their main social network, up from 14% in 2017. Facebook was named as the ""main"" social network by 31% of 12- to 15-year-olds, down from 40% in 2017. WhatsApp, which is also owned by Facebook, and rival Snapchat also saw increased use among 12- to 15-year-olds. Although most social networks do not allow children under 13 to register for an account, the report found 18% of eight- to 11-year-olds had a profile of their own. Facebook pledges to do more on self-harm Screen time 'may harm toddlers' Do your children have a balanced diet of play? Less than a third of parents who knew their child had a social media profile could correctly state the minimum age limit of the social networks. Teenagers were also aware of the pressures of social media, with 78% saying they felt there was pressure to ""look popular"". Ofcom's annual report is compiled by analysing the media use of about 2,000 three- to 15-year-olds across the UK. Its latest research suggests 94% still use a television set, although they tend to spend less time using it to watch TV programmes. Time spent online was broadly the same as in 2017, although average TV viewing fell by eight minutes a day. For the first time, children were asked whether they used subscription streaming services such as Amazon Prime Video, Netflix and Now TV. Among 12- to 15-year-olds, 58% watched programmes on subscription services, while 89% of this age group watched YouTube regularly. Children were also more likely to watch vloggers than in 2017, with 52% of YouTube-viewing 12- to 15-year-olds watching vlogs. Parents were also asked questions about their children's media habits.  Just over half of parents felt the benefits of the internet outweighed the risks. 5%have their own smartphone 42%have their own tablet 97%watch television programmes on their TV set, for an average of more than 13 hours a week 44%watch television programmes on other devices 63%play video games, for an average of about seven hours a week 82%go online,67%of those mostly using their tablet 44%watch subscription video services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Now TV 4%have a social media profile 70%watch YouTube Ofcom's snapshot of12- to 15-year-olds 83%have their own smartphone 50%have their own tablet 90%watch television programmes on their TV set, for an average of more than 13 hours a week 62%watch television programmes on other devices 76%play video games, for an average of about 14 hours a week 53%mostly use a mobile phone to go online 58%watch subscription video services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Now TV 69%have a social media profile 89%watch YouTube Screen time 'may harm toddlers' Do your children have a balanced diet of play?

"""It might not be 326 that matters"". According to one cabinet minister, that's the strange situation that Brexit has led us to. The government's ambition is so low - or its hurdles so high - that what No 10 seeks to do on Tuesday is not to win (326 is a majority in the House of Commons), but to reduce the scale of resistance to their central policy that, in the words of another cabinet minister, only the ""hardliners oppose"", so that Theresa May can get the rebels down to a ""few dozen"", so then they can crack on. But crack on with what, I hear you ask? Government supports Irish backstop change A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' The EU has been clear again and again that it won't budge on the backstop unless the UK ""evolves its position"", to use the posh phrase. In other words it won't budge until there is a clearer picture from the UK, even though, in the end, budge it well might (NB, shifting a bit is not the same as junking it, before you get too excited, remember). But reducing the scale of discomfort is important for the government on Tuesday. That's why, although Sir Graham Brady's amendment is unlikely to get through - it doesn't have the support of the ardent Brexiteer core in the ERG, and maybe or maybe not the DUP, which won't decide until the morning - ministers are forcing their MPs to do something very weird. They are trying to make them vote FOR a plan that says the prime minister's deal needs to be changed, in the hope that message is conveyed strongly across the Channel into continental ears. And if the level of opposition shrinks to be a molehill rather than a mountain, maybe then, in time, Brussels can conclude there is something worth working with. That is still a huge ""if"". And there is also still the possibility on Tuesday that MPs, either through Yvette Cooper's plan or the less dramatic (in terms of process) idea from Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, might vote to try to force No 10 to rule out leaving without a deal at the end of March. Only Ms Cooper's plan would actually be binding, and it's not clear how the government would respond in either case. But again, that kind of result would send its own message to the rest of the EU - one the prime minister is keen to avoid for fear it would weaken her bargaining hand. For No 10, the obvious way of ruling out no deal is to back Mrs May's agreement. But takers for that plan are still, for her, in too short supply. Parliament may push her in that direction on Tuesday against her will. But at the risk of depressing you about Tuesday providing a clear conclusion, it is also quite feasible that none of the plans will pass. After months of saying, ""ask us, ask us!"", MPs have a real opportunity to vote for Brexit plans they have brewed up. But if none of them is able to get a majority, Parliament may yet just prove itself, again, a place where trust is low, tension is high, but agreement is hard to find. Late on Monday evening, maybe, just maybe, there was a sign that all of this Parliamentary turmoil might be about to be usurped by something that has felt until now absolutely out of reach. Rival factions of the Tory party who until now have been so often trying to knock lumps out of each other, have, we can report, been meeting and talking, trying to thrash out a compromise. Brexiteers Steve Baker and Jacob Rees-Mogg have met the prime minister alongside former Remainers like Nicky Morgan and Damian Green, accompanied by government ministers like Robert Buckland, the solicitor general. They have, together, come up with what looks like, at a very early stage, what might be two potential compromises that the Tory party as a group might be able to get around. Whether they'd get backing from other parties, or the EU, is another question. But it is a potential way forward, that has lit up Tory messaging groups with emojis of champagne bottles, and claims that it might be the way out of their mess. You can see the plan for yourselfhere,external, or below. Number 10 is not ready to back it yet, although the group of unlikely compadres has discussed it with her.

"David Woodhouse removed a painful tooth with a pair of pliers A man has claimed he pulled out one of his own teeth after waiting more than 18 months to find an NHS dentist. David Woodhouse, 62, from Truro, said he had been unable to find a NHS surgery in Cornwall. An NHS emergency treatment centre offered to extract the tooth in December 2018 but Mr Woodhouse said that would not deal with his long-term problem with a dental plate. Three weeks later he took out the tooth himself with a pair of pliers. Mr Woodhouse said: ""I had a loose one and it was causing me a little bit of pain, so I got the needle-nose pliers and out it came. ""I could have had the tooth extracted but what I need is a term of treatment from the dentist."" NHS England encouraged those in need of urgent dental care to contact its emergency helpline. The British Dental Association said NHS dental care was ""increasingly a postcode lottery"" with problems across the country. Healthwatch Cornwall, the county's health watchdog, said access to NHS dentists was the number one issue people contacted them about. It said some people had been waiting more than three years to register with a dentist.  48,382patients on the waiting list in Devon and Cornwall 26,958patients  placed with NHS dentists in the previous 12 months 52%of adults in Devon and Cornwall had seen an NHS dentist in the past two years 51%of adults in England had seen one in the same period Mr Woodhouse used to go for regular check-ups at his local practice, but returned from a period working abroad to find that he had lost his place. He said: ""The removal itself was considerably less painful than the long-term pain I was experiencing. ""I'm not looking forward to the next tooth coming loose, I may have to consider a bank loan to go private, but why should I?"" There are more than 48,000 people on the waiting list in Devon and Cornwall, according to NHS England. Asearch on the NHS website,externalreveals that just one practice in Cornwall is accepting new patients. Mr Woodhouse said the notifications on the website were often out of date. Latest NHS figures showed about 52% of adults in Devon and Cornwall had seen an NHS dentist in the past two years, slightly above the average for England. ""It's like looking for gold dust. When you go on the waiting list you have to specify three towns, but I would go anywhere within 100 miles of Truro,"" Mr Woodhouse said. ""I would go anywhere within half a day's drive - I do not care."" A spokesperson for NHS England said: ""We would encourage anyone with an urgent dental need to contact the emergency dental helpline in Cornwall."" About 27,000 people have been placed with NHS dentists in Devon and Cornwall in the past 12 months.

"The US has laid 23 charges against Chinese telecoms firm Huawei The US Justice Department has filed a host of criminal charges against Chinese telecoms giant Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou. The charges against the world's second largest smartphone maker include bank fraud, obstruction of justice and theft of technology. The case could ratchet up tensions between China and the US, and impact the firm's global expansion efforts. Both Ms Meng and Huawei deny the allegations. Ms Meng was arrested in Canada last month at the request of the US for allegedly evading sanctions on Iran. ""For years, Chinese firms have broken our export laws and undermined sanctions, often using US financial systems to facilitate their illegal activities. This will end,"" said US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. In a statement, Huawei rejected the charges, saying it didn't commit ""any of the asserted violations"" and that it ""is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms Meng"". It said the allegations were already the subject of a settled civil suit, in which a jury found ""neither damages nor willful and malicious conduct on the trade secret claim"". The indictment alleges Huawei misled the US,externaland a global bank about its relationship with two subsidiaries, Huawei Device USA and Skycom Tech, to conduct business with Iran. US President Donald Trump's administration has reinstated all sanctions on Iran removed under a 2015 nuclear deal and recently imposedeven stricter measures, hitting oil exports, shipping and banks. A second case alleges Huawei stole technology from T Mobile used to test smartphone durability, as well as obstructing justice and committing wire fraud. Timeline: What's going on with Huawei? Should we worry about Huawei? The T-Mobile tech, known as Tappy, mimicked human fingers to test phones. In all, the US has laid 23 charges against the company. ""These charges lay bare Huawei's alleged blatant disregard for the laws of our country and standard global business practices,"" said FBI Director Christopher Wray. Mr Wray said companies like Huawei ""pose a dual threat to both our economic and national security"". Huawei is one of the largest telecommunications equipment and services providers in the world, recently passing Apple to become the second biggest smartphone maker by volume after Samsung. But the US andother Western nations have been concerned that the Chinese government could use Huawei's technologyto expand its spying ability, although the firm insists there is no government control. The arrest of Ms Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, infuriated China. Meng Wanzhou is the daughter of the company's founder She was arrested on 1 December in Canada's western city of Vancouver at the request of the US. She was later granted a C$10m (Â£5.7m; $7.6m) bail by a local court. But she is under surveillance 24 hours a day and must wear an electronic ankle tag. Analysis by Karishma Vaswani, Asia business correspondent Huawei is what the Chinese call a national champion. A private firm, tasked with China's ambitions to go into the world and lead the way. But now the full force of the US justice system is being hurled at the firm. The allegations by the US Department of Justice are the most serious Huawei has ever seen, and go to the heart of the trade war between China and the US. Huawei has consistently denied the allegations, and the firm's boss says it is being used as a pawn in power games between the US and China. While the US says the charges against Huawei aren't about trade war, it is unlikely the Chinese will see it the same way. The charges come as the US and China prepare to hold high-level trade talks in Washington this week. US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross stated that the Huawei charges were ""wholly separate"" from ongoing trade negotiations with China. Why China is under pressure to make a trade deal US-China trade war in 300 words However, the indictment focuses on the alleged theft of US technology, which has been amajor sticking point in trade negotiations. President Trump's administration has imposed tariffs on $250bn (Â£190bn) worth of Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to respond with its own tariffs. Both countries agreed last month to suspend new tariffsfor 90 days to allow talks.

"Amber Peat ""always had a sad face"", according to a former class teacher A 13-year-old girl was found hanged after she went missing from home following an argument about chores, an inquest has heard. Amber Peat's body was found in bushes three days after she walked out of her home in Mansfield on 30 May 2015. She left at about 17:10 GMT and was reported missing almost eight hours later, at 00:56 on 31 May. Amber ""always had a sad face"" and ""felt very put upon"" at home, her former teacher told the inquest. Joanne Holt told Nottinghamshire Coroner's Court: ""She had lots of jobs to do that her siblings perhaps weren't expected to do in the same way. ""She didn't feel she was treated fairly in comparison to her siblings. ""She felt her siblings perhaps got away with things that she perhaps didn't get away with."" Amber's body was found in Westfield Lane, about a mile from her home in Bosworth Street Amber lived with her mother Kelly Peat and stepfather Daniel Peat, while her biological father Adrian Cook lived in Scotland. Mrs Holt was Amber's class teacher at John Davies Primary in Huthwaite for just over a term, from January 2013 onwards, until the teenager moved schools during the summer term. The inquest heard how Amber went to many different schools as she had moved house ""no less than 11 times"", according to assistant coroner Laurinda Bower. The coroner asked Mrs Holt to tell her what she remembered about Amber. Amber's mother and stepfather appealed for information when she went missing Mrs Holt said: ""I remember she was quite an unhappy child. That's what stands out mostly in my head. ""She never really seemed happy. She was usually alone. She always had a sad face."" Mrs Holt said she had tried to talk to Amber's mother about her problems ""on a number of occasions"" after school. ""I think on two occasions we had a meeting with mum but couldn't get much response from her,"" she said. ""I didn't feel that anything was acted upon or really acknowledged that there was a problem."" Floral tributes and messages to Amber Peat were left near where her body was found Det Con Tina Gilfoyle, who investigated Amber's death for Nottinghamshire Police, said she had been ""troubled quite a lot"" while on a family holiday to Cornwall in the week before her death. Family members told police ""there had been arguments"" and Amber ""had been prevented from going to the beach,"" the detective said. While there, Amber and her cousin wrote a ""Run Away List"" containing items such as a torch and a wig, but her cousin apparently thought it was a joke. Amber's stepfather allegedly threatened to hit her if she continued scowling at him while on the drive home from holiday, the court heard. That is what one of Amber's siblings told police, but Mr Peat has not yet given his evidence and has not been questioned about the allegation. Volunteers from the community helped police search for Amber Posters were put in the windows of shops and houses as the public joined the search for Amber Amber was apparently made to clear the car out when they arrived home from holiday, and on the day she died she had been asked to clean a cool box. ""She wasn't happy about it,"" Det Con Gilfoyle said. ""She is reported as complaining and trying to get mum's attention, and so mum shuts the door leaving Amber alone in the hallway. A short while later the door slams and Amber is gone."" The officer said Amber's family went to look for her, but also went to Tesco and did some shopping before finally reporting her missing.

"Singer Amy Shark tweeted about the discovery of two stowaways Australian musician Amy Shark says two stowaways were found hiding in her tour bus as it prepared to cross a border into the UK, describing the discovery as ""scary"" and ""heartbreaking"". Shark said the pair were found in the vehicle's luggage compartment on a trip from Brussels to London. Both intruders swiftly left the bus after being discovered, Shark tweeted. She said it had given her crew a scare, but that she felt for those choosing a ""dangerous way to chase a new life"". ""They didn't threaten us or say a word - they just walked away when found,"" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Tuesday. Shark, whose real name is Amy Louise Billings, is a prominent singer-songwriter in Australia best known for her songs Adore and I Said Hi. She wrote on Twitter that she had ""no idea"" how the pair had entered the bus. She did not say where they had exited. ""I didn't think this stuff happened I'm so naive hey,"" she wrote.

"The government will support a backbench amendment to the Brexit deal that calls for the planned Irish backstop to be replaced by ""alternative arrangements"". Tory MPs will be told to vote for Sir Graham Brady's proposal when the Commons votes on a series of amendments to Theresa May's plan on Tuesday. The government will also order its MPs to vote against a move which could delay Brexit by up to nine months. But Commons Speaker John Bercow will decide which amendments get voted on. Senior EU representatives have repeatedly ruled out re-opening negotiations with the UK over Brexit, and insisted the backstop - the insurance policy against a return of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland - must be included in any deal. Meanwhile, the governmentannounced its plans for EU citizens coming to the UK,externalin the case of a no-deal Brexit, saying it would ""seek to end free movement as soon as possible"". The Home Office said that for a ""transitional period"" after Brexit - set for 29 March - EU citizens will be able to enter the UK to visit, work or study as they do now, but after three months they would need to apply for ""European Temporary Leave to Remain"", which would last three years. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said it was a ""practical approach"" and would ""minimise disruption to ensure the UK stays open for business"". Brexit: A really simple guide A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments Kuenssberg: Is Parliament's Brexit fog about to clear? No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' MPs have been tabling amendments to the government's plans to try to influence the direction of Brexit since Mrs May lost the vote on her original deal earlier this month. After Mr Bercow decides on Tuesday which ones are put forward, voting will take place on them from 19:00 GMT. The prime minister's official spokesman said it will be followed ""as soon as possible"" by a second meaningful vote on whatever deal has been secured with Brussels. Mrs May addressed a meeting of her backbench MPs on Monday night and numerous sources told the BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson that she would be backing what is known as the ""Brady amendment"" -  a measure put forward by Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee of Conservative MPs. Sir Graham wants to see the Irish backstop replaced by what he calls ""alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border"", but would otherwise support the prime minister's deal. As a result of government support, Tory MPs John Baron and Andrew Murrison have dropped their amendments - which proposed a time limit to the backstop and the ability to leave the arrangement at a time of the UK's choosing.

The prime minister appealed to her MPs to give her something to take back to Brussels for further discussions, saying ""don't just talk about it - you have to vote for it"". Speaking to BBC News, Sir Graham said he hoped the backing from the government would see the DUP - who Mrs May relies on for support in Parliament - get behind his amendment. And some Labour MPs had already expressed their support to him as well. ""This is a sensible way of reaching some compromise and trying to move things on in the national interest,"" he added. But Eurosceptic Tories have already said they will not back the amendment. The European Research Group, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, said they want the government to table its own amendment that would commit to reopening the withdrawal agreement - the part of Mrs May's deal that lays out how the UK will leave the EU - to remove the backstop. By Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent Behind closed doors, Theresa May made an impassioned plea to her own MPs to send a clear message to Brussels - backing the amendment from the chairman of the Conservative backbench committee Sir Graham Brady would signal that Parliament could pass her deal, if the EU was wiling to make changes to the backstop. While Conservative MPs will be instructed to give the amendment their backing, long-standing Leave campaigners in the European Research Group have announced they won't support it. They are insisting on specific legal changes to the 585-page withdrawal agreement. And the pro-Leave DUP has yet to declare how its MPs will vote. Tory MPs are also being told they should vote against an amendment which would delay Brexit unless a deal is agreed in the next month - with some ministers pressing for a free vote. But for all the talk, it will not be until Tuesday night that we see the amendments they can support or reject. Mrs May has also faced calls from Labour, and a number of other MPs, to rule out the scenario in which the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal. A number of Remain-backing MPs are supporting an amendment by Labour MP Yvette Cooper that would create a bill enabling Article 50 - the mechanism by which the UK leaves the EU on 29 March - to be delayed by up to nine months if the government does not have a plan agreed in Parliament by the end of February. Some, including Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, had called for a free vote on such an amendment, allowing them to give it their backing. And in an interview with BBC's Newsnight last week, Ms Rudd said she would not rule out resigning over the issue. Justice Secretary David Gauke also said MPs should be able to vote according to their personal views. But Mrs May told the meeting that the government would be whipping against it - meaning it would not be a free vote. Mrs May took the deal she had negotiated with the EU to Parliament on 15 January for a ""meaningful vote"" - having delayed it from December - but MPs rejected it by 432 votes to 202. The main sticking point was the backstop - the ""insurance policy"" intended to ensure that whatever else happens, there will be no return to a visible border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after Brexit. Both the UK and the EU believe that bringing back border checks could put the peace process at risk, but critics of the plan say the backstop could tie the UK to many EU rules indefinitely. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But the Irish deputy PM Simon Coveney has said changes to the backstop proposal would not be acceptable. This video can not be played Sabine Weyand: Risk of a 'crash out' is high The EU's deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand also said on Monday that there was a high risk of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal by accident and that other options for the Irish border had been extensively discussed with her UK counterparts during negotiations. She said there was ""full ownership of what was agreed"" in the EU, but ""no ownership"" of it in the UK Parliament. And she added that the EU side were agreed that a time-limit to the Irish backstop defeated the purpose of having one. Ms Weyand said: ""There is a very high risk of a crash-out, not by design, but by accident... ""The crash-out is the only scenario that does not require anyone to take any action or take any decisions."" A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks.

"This video can not be played Theresa May says it is time MPs needed ""to send a message about what we do want"" MPs have voted against a proposal to delay Brexit in order to prevent the UK leaving without a deal. The amendment had been put forward by Labour MP Yvette Cooper, but was rejected by 23 votes. MPs are voting on changes to Theresa May's Brexit plan before she seeks a re-negotiation of it with the EU. The prime minister has urged MPs to back another amendment that would propose ""alternative arrangements"" to the controversial Irish backstop plan. The backstop is the insurance policy in Mrs May's plan to prevent checks on goods and people returning to the Northern Ireland border, which some MPs fear could leave the UK tied to the EU's rules indefinitely. It was a key part in seeing her original Brexit deal voted down in Parliament by an historic margin earlier in January. Mrs May said she knew there was a ""limited appetite"" in the EU for changes to the deal, but she believed she could ""secure"" it. She had phone calls with key EU leaders throughout the day ahead of the Commons votes and has already spoken to the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker and the Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar. But the EU has said it will not re-open negotiations and change the legal text agreed with the UK PM. MPs are currently voting on an amendment put forward by Tory MP Caroline Spelman and Labour MP Jack Dromey with the aim of preventing a no deal Brexit. Kuenssberg: Theresa May blinked Latest updates: MPs to debate Brexit plans Brexit: A really simple guide A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments Brexit delay 'inevitable', says Corbyn Three amendments - tabled by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford and Tory backbencher Dominic Grieve - had already been voted down by the House.You can read the detail of all the amendments here. Mr Corbyn's amendment was voted down by 327 votes to 296, Mr Blackford's only saw 39 votes of support, compared to 327 votes against, and Mr Grieve, who wanted MPs to be given six days to debate Brexit alternatives, lost by 321 votes to 301. This was followed by Ms Cooper's, which lost by 321 votes to 298, and one by Labour MP Rachel Reeves - also trying to postpone Brexit - which lost by 322 votes to 290. There are two more amendments to be tabled that could be voted on - including one from Tory MP Sir Graham Brady, calling for an ""alternative"" to the Irish backstop, which Tory MPs have been ordered to back. This video can not be played Theresa May says it is time MPs needed ""to send a message about what we do want"" Mrs May earlier appealed for the backing of the ""Brady"" amendment, saying it would ""give the mandate I need to negotiate with Brussels an arrangement that commands a majority in this House - not a further exchange of letters, but a significant and legally binding change to the withdrawal agreement"". Nigel Dodds, the Westminster leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - whose MPs Mrs May's government relies on to win key votes - welcomed the announcement, saying: ""From day one... we rejected the backstop and argued for legally binding change within the withdrawal agreement."" And the pro-Leave European Research Group, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, has said it will vote in favour of Sir Graham's amendment. If MPs back Sir Graham's amendment, it could pave the way for a plan known as the ""Malthouse Compromise"". Engineered by both Leavers and Remainers, the proposal includes extending the transition period for a year and protecting EU citizens' rights, instead of using the backstop. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. Mrs May also promised MPs the votes on Tuesday would not be the last chance for them to express their views over Brexit. She said that if no new deal is reached by 13 February, she will make a statement to Parliament that day and table an amendable motion for debate the following day, re-opening discussions on how to move forward with Brexit. By Katya Adler, Europe editor The excitable interventions we're witnessing in Parliament will convince EU leaders even more deeply that MPs are still very divided over Brexit and that now is not the decisive moment for Brussels to budge. The EU wants to avoid an endless process of Theresa May shuttling to and from Brussels, getting a tweak or two, returning to Parliament, having the deal still rejected, coming back to Brussels and so on. It's right to think the EU sometimes insists one thing, then does something rather different. But the Irish backstop is a hugely sensitive issue, painfully co-negotiated over months with UK negotiators and almost impossible to fudge (as the EU prefers to do in difficult situations). EU leaders are unlikely to touch the conditions of the backstop until a no-deal Brexit is well and truly staring them in the face. And even then they are unlikely to entertain changes unless Dublin is on board. We're nowhere near there yet, if we ever get there.

"Is Parliament, finally, at long last, really on the verge of giving a clear signal about what it wants to do about Brexit? As much as I can feel your pain, don't bet on it. You've probably heard a lot of noise about the amendments that MPs will be voting on tomorrow night, not least from me. But there is no guarantee at all that any of them will pass. First, some Tory MPs are coming round to the government's deal, if they can cut out the bit they don't like (yes, of course, the backstop.) A lot of them have signed up to a way of making that clear, by supporting Sir Graham Brady's amendment. And if enough of them get on board it would allow the prime minister, in theory, to go back to the EU and say, tah dah! Look! I can get this deal through apart from this really pesky part, which might, as we've been reporting in the last few days, move things forward, despite the very strong warnings from Dublin that it can't happen. But, I wouldn't bet very much that Brexiteers will switch to back it in a coherent and decisive way. Brexit: A really simple guide May urged to secure backstop concessions No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' As I wrote last week, some Tory insiders are pushing for the prime minister to put her own amendment forward to say what she really wants. And if she doesn't, well, she may well be simply stuck in the same predicament. By the end of today it will be clearer where the numbers might lie. Iain Duncan Smith, the influential Brexiteer, has just told me: ""The government should now place its own amendment setting out what it wants to achieve in the negotiations. This is the time when the PM must make clear her intentions in the negotiation, to seek support. We need more than back bench amendments with nods and winks from the government, we need clarity and purpose."" In other words, if the PM is willing to front-up and say she will go and demand Brussels changes the backstop, they might play ball. But if she doesn't, don't expect the Brexiteer votes she needs to be suddenly forthcoming. But the government has an additional dilemma. If they try to stop MPs voting for the Brady plan (you can read more about it and the other amendments here) there's likely to be a rebellion against that attempt too. On the other side, there are MPs trying to create and take control of a set of brakes to stop the government from heading towards leaving the EU without a formal deal. Labour's Yvette Cooper's attempt is the most prominent and would be the most significant because it would commit to changing the law in a bill that would put Parliament in charge if the government can't get things sorted out by the end of February. But it doesn't have much of a hope of passing if Labour's frontbench team don't get behind it. They have made supportive noises about it, because their priority is to remove the possibility of a 'no deal' Brexit. But they have reservations about potentially delaying Brexit until Christmas, and indeed, just like the Tories, if they try to get MPs to vote for it officially by whipping the vote, they too would face their own rebellion because some MPs are implacably opposed. Again, by this evening we should have more sense of where the decisions might land. You wouldn't be blamed for thinking that all seems like Parliamentary fog. But until we see the numbers in the votes tomorrow, this week may not be the occasion when Parliament's view on Brexit becomes that much clearer.  (Sorry!)

"""It might not be 326 that matters"". According to one cabinet minister, that's the strange situation that Brexit has led us to. The government's ambition is so low - or its hurdles so high - that what No 10 seeks to do on Tuesday is not to win (326 is a majority in the House of Commons), but to reduce the scale of resistance to their central policy that, in the words of another cabinet minister, only the ""hardliners oppose"", so that Theresa May can get the rebels down to a ""few dozen"", so then they can crack on. But crack on with what, I hear you ask? Government supports Irish backstop change A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' The EU has been clear again and again that it won't budge on the backstop unless the UK ""evolves its position"", to use the posh phrase. In other words it won't budge until there is a clearer picture from the UK, even though, in the end, budge it well might (NB, shifting a bit is not the same as junking it, before you get too excited, remember). But reducing the scale of discomfort is important for the government on Tuesday. That's why, although Sir Graham Brady's amendment is unlikely to get through - it doesn't have the support of the ardent Brexiteer core in the ERG, and maybe or maybe not the DUP, which won't decide until the morning - ministers are forcing their MPs to do something very weird. They are trying to make them vote FOR a plan that says the prime minister's deal needs to be changed, in the hope that message is conveyed strongly across the Channel into continental ears. And if the level of opposition shrinks to be a molehill rather than a mountain, maybe then, in time, Brussels can conclude there is something worth working with. That is still a huge ""if"". And there is also still the possibility on Tuesday that MPs, either through Yvette Cooper's plan or the less dramatic (in terms of process) idea from Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, might vote to try to force No 10 to rule out leaving without a deal at the end of March. Only Ms Cooper's plan would actually be binding, and it's not clear how the government would respond in either case. But again, that kind of result would send its own message to the rest of the EU - one the prime minister is keen to avoid for fear it would weaken her bargaining hand. For No 10, the obvious way of ruling out no deal is to back Mrs May's agreement. But takers for that plan are still, for her, in too short supply. Parliament may push her in that direction on Tuesday against her will. But at the risk of depressing you about Tuesday providing a clear conclusion, it is also quite feasible that none of the plans will pass. After months of saying, ""ask us, ask us!"", MPs have a real opportunity to vote for Brexit plans they have brewed up. But if none of them is able to get a majority, Parliament may yet just prove itself, again, a place where trust is low, tension is high, but agreement is hard to find. Late on Monday evening, maybe, just maybe, there was a sign that all of this Parliamentary turmoil might be about to be usurped by something that has felt until now absolutely out of reach. Rival factions of the Tory party who until now have been so often trying to knock lumps out of each other, have, we can report, been meeting and talking, trying to thrash out a compromise. Brexiteers Steve Baker and Jacob Rees-Mogg have met the prime minister alongside former Remainers like Nicky Morgan and Damian Green, accompanied by government ministers like Robert Buckland, the solicitor general. They have, together, come up with what looks like, at a very early stage, what might be two potential compromises that the Tory party as a group might be able to get around. Whether they'd get backing from other parties, or the EU, is another question. But it is a potential way forward, that has lit up Tory messaging groups with emojis of champagne bottles, and claims that it might be the way out of their mess. You can see the plan for yourselfhere,external, or below. Number 10 is not ready to back it yet, although the group of unlikely compadres has discussed it with her. Nor will it be what MPs vote on, on Tuesday. But it might, just might, be the start of something - a whisper of a compromise, perhaps, after months and months where division has ruled the day.

"This video can not be played Chris Mason recaps what has happened to the Brexit deal and explains the next key vote options MPs have voted on a series of amendments designed to change the direction of Brexit. Commons Speaker John Bercow selected seven amendments to be debated and voted on. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  Here are the amendments, and the results, in the order in which they took place. Instructed the government to rule out a ""disastrous no deal"" scenario (this optionwas supported by some Brexiteers but many MPs feared it would cause chaos at ports and disruption for businesses) and allowed Parliament to consider - and vote on - options including: An alternative Brexit deal involvingLabour's plan for a permanent customs unionwith Brussels and a version of the EU's single market Legislating to hold a public vote on either a deal or a proposition that has MPs' support Called for an extension of Article 50 Ruled out a no-deal Brexit Emphasised the role of the UK nations in the Brexit process Forced the government to make time for MPs to discuss a range of alternatives to the prime minister's Brexit plan on six full days in the Commons before 26 March. MPs would have been able to table amendments to be voted on at the end of the debate, which could have included alternative Brexit options such as Labour's plan, a second referendum,no dealand theNorway-style relationshippreferred by some MPs. This had the backing of some Labour backbenchers, as well as the SNP's Philippa Whitford, Lib Dem Tom Brake, Plaid Cymru's Jonathan Edwards and Caroline Lucas, of the Greens. Attempted to rule out the UK leaving the EUwithout a formal dealby allowing Parliament time to pass a new law. The bill to bring in the new law would have required Theresa May to seek to postpone Brexit day (currently 29 March) until 31 December, if MPs did not approve her deal by 26 February. The prime minister would have had to do this by asking the EU to agree to extend the two-year limit on Article 50 - the mechanism paving the way for the UK to leave the EU. It had the backing of senior Conservative backbenchers such as Nicky Morgan and Oliver Letwin, former Lib Dem health minister Norman Lamb and Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake. The Labour leadership had also decided to get behind this amendment and ordered Labour MPs to vote for it. But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said he backed limiting any extension to a ""short window"" of three months to allow time for renegotiation. Required the government to ask the EU to postpone Brexit day (without specifying for how long). Seeks to prevent a""no-deal"" Brexitby adding to the PM's motion that Parliament ""rejects the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without aWithdrawal Agreementand aFramework for the Future Relationship"". The two MPs are in neighbouring constituencies and have raised concerns over local manufacturing supply chains. Calls for Parliament to require the backstop to be replaced with ""alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border"" but otherwise supports the prime minister's deal. Theresa May ordered Conservative MPs to vote for this amendment. Some Conservative rebels, who voted against the prime minister two weeks ago, said it was too vague and did not address their other concerns about her deal. Others, such as former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, said they would support it if Mrs May indicated that she would press the EU to re-open the withdrawal agreement to make changes to the backstop that would be legally binding - something she has told MPs that she will do. Northern Ireland's DUP, which keeps Mrs May in power, also indicated they would back the Brady amendment. Neither of the Spelman nor the Brady amendments are binding on the government, although support for them puts political pressure on Theresa May to follow their direction.

"This video can not be played Sabine Weyand: Risk of a 'crash out' is high There is a high risk of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal by accident, the EU's deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand has said. She said there was ""full ownership of what was agreed"" in the EU, but ""no ownership"" of it in the UK Parliament. And it was a challenge to see how a majority for any deal could be built among MPs, she added. The EU side were agreed that a time-limit to the Irish backstop defeated the purpose of having one, she added. It comes as Theresa May addressed a meeting of Tory MPs, the day before all MPs vote on a series of amendments to the PM's plans that could shape the future direction of Brexit. BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said numerous sources at the meeting revealed the government would be whipping its MPs to vote for one amendment that proposes the backstop be replaced by ""alternative arrangements"". The Irish backstop - the ""insurance policy"" in the withdrawal deal - has been the controversial sticking point. It is intended to ensure that whatever else happens, there will be no return to a visible border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after the UK leaves the EU. Both the UK and the EU believe that bringing back border checks could put the peace process at risk. But the current wording of the backstop plan has proved unpopular with many Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs who are concerned that it could tie the UK to many EU rules indefinitely. Brexit: A really simple guide A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments Kuenssberg: Is Parliament's Brexit fog about to clear? No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' Speaking at an event in Brussels, Ms Weyand - deputy to the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier - said other options for the Irish border had been extensively discussed and referred to the months-long negotiations with her UK counterparts. She said that a lot of the discussion of the withdrawal agreement in the UK was ""uninhibited by any knowledge"" of what it actually contained. EU leaders were concerned about extending the two-year Article 50 process, she said, because Brexit was ""eating up the political energy"" for solving other issues. She added that Mrs May's secrecy and reliance on a small group of people had been a ""handicap"" in getting support for the deal. She said: ""There is a very high risk of a crash-out, not by design, but by accident... ""The crash-out is the only scenario that does not require anyone to take any action or take any decisions."" By Adam Fleming, BBC Brussels correspondent In Brussels, Sabine Weyand is known for her cheerful bluntness. Now the public have seen it too. She lobbed a series of truth bombs at Westminster, saying MPs are criticising an agreement many of them haven't read and the cabinet's failure to ""own"" the deal is making it harder to approve. And she contrasted her style of regular consultations with EU leaders and the European Parliament with Theresa May's reliance on a small circle of advisors - ""a big handicap."" She will be accused in the UK of being undiplomatic, but many of her colleagues on the EU side of the negotiations feel equally fed up. And maybe she was also trying to tell her ultimate bosses - EU leaders - that things are not looking good. Meanwhile, Mrs May is being urged to secure changes from the EU to the Northern Irish backstop as part of her Brexit deal to get it past Parliament. Ex-foreign secretary Boris Johnson says winning a ""freedom clause"" would be ""unadulterated good Brexit news"". But the Irish deputy PM Simon Coveney says changes to the backstop - aimed at preventing a hard border - would not be acceptable. The DUP's Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson called on the government to ""be tough"" and ""face down the stubbornness of Dublin and Brussels"". ""It's time for the Irish to work constructively and advocate for a sensible trading arrangement with their biggest market in Great Britain,"" he said. Is Parliament, finally, at long last, really on the verge of giving a clear signal about what it wants to do about Brexit? As much as I can feel your pain, don't bet on it. You've probably heard a lot of noise about the amendments that MPs will be voting on tomorrow night, not least from me. But there is no guarantee at all that any of them will pass.

But, I wouldn't bet very much that Brexiteers will switch to back it in a coherent and decisive way. Read more from Laura After Mrs May's deal was rejected in the Commons on 15 January by 432 votes to 202, opposition and backbench MPs have been tabling amendments to the plans. While MPs will not deliver their final verdict on the deal on Tuesday, they will vote on the amendments and, if one is passed, show the PM what changes to the deal might be enough to get a modified version of the deal through Parliament. The prime minister's official spokesman said it will be followed ""as soon as possible"" by a second meaningful vote on whatever deal has been secured with Brussels. ""The prime minister is absolutely committed to leaving the EU with a deal, but clearly if we are to obtain parliamentary support for that deal some changes are going to have to be made,"" the spokesman said. One amendment that has the backing of senior Tory Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, calls for the backstop to be replaced by ""alternative arrangements"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Graham said: ""I'm hoping that the way in which the amendment is crafted, it can attract that very broad support. And if we can win the vote on my amendment I think it gives the prime minister enormous firepower."" He said the looming exit date is helping to ""focus minds"", adding: ""I think we've already seen across the European Union a little bit more flexibility and a little creativity creeping in."" A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls.

But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. Brexiteers say if the non-binding amendment is passed it will give the PM more leeway to win concessions from the EU. But the European Research Group, a group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs headed by Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, has said it would not back the amendment from Sir Graham on Tuesday. Is Rees-Mogg ready to compromise? Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Johnson suggested,externalMrs May could get the EU to change the text of her agreement to include an expiry date for the backstop, or include a mechanism allowing the UK to unilaterally withdraw from it. Mr Johnson said: ""If the PM secures that change - a proper UK-sized perforation in the fabric of the backstop itself - I have no doubt that she will have the whole country full-throatedly behind her."" This video can not be played ""If we leave without a deal we will be less safe... than remaining part of the EU""  former head of the Security Service MI5 tells The World at One One of the architects of the Good Friday Agreement, Lord Bew, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the backstop must be made ""explicitly temporary and in legally binding terms"" in order to avoid undermining the Agreement. He said: ""There is a conflict, the backstop advertises itself as defending the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects. ""But you only have to look at what it says about agricultureâ¦ and you will see that you have a totally different top-down approach to dealing with matters of agriculture concern north and south to that in the Good Friday Agreement, where incidentally it's the very top item for co-operation."" Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop No change to backstop, Ireland insists Reiteratingearlier comments that the EU would not ratify a deal without the backstop being included, the Irish Republic's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Simon Coveney said:  ""Even in a no-deal Brexit situation every party and every MP in the UK will have a responsibility to ensure there is no return to a hard border and Northern Ireland is protected."" He added: ""The EU has been clear that the backstop is an integral part of the withdrawal agreement."" And European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas reiterated that the withdrawal agreement had been agreed with the UK government, was endorsed by EU leaders and was ""not open for renegotiation"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, and the prime minister has faced repeated calls to rule out the prospect of leaving without a deal if her agreement does not win approval. It is also possible that MPs will back amendments on Tuesday which call on Mrs May to rule out no deal or to delay the UK's departure from the EU. An amendment tabled by Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Conservative MP Nick Boles could extend Article 50 - which triggers the UK's withdrawal from the EU - by nine months, unless the prime minister can secure a deal by the end of February. Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Ms Cooper said she was not seeking to ""block Brexit"", adding that the bill would be amendable - meaning MPs could vote on how long any extension would be. Mr Boles told the Today programme that Tuesday's vote would be ""very, very close"", adding: ""We are going to need support from all sides of the house. Jeremy Corbyn has made some warm noises."" Mr Boles, who said he would support Sir Graham's amendment if it is selected, said MPs must ""seize the moment"" at the vote, as it offers ""probably the only motion of its kind that's going to be amendable"". Meanwhile, areport from MPs on the Exiting the EU Committee,externalsays the government must rule out a no-deal Brexit. Committee chairman Hilary Benn said: ""The suggestion that the UK might opt for a no-deal outcome but assume that the EU will continue to act in a co-operative manner to avoid disruption, cannot seriously constitute the policy of any responsible government."" However, a Tory member of the committee, Craig Mackinlay, said he ""disowned"" the report findings as  ""just more Project Fear from a group of MPs who have never wanted the UK to leave the EU"".

"The European Union (EU) has accepted the UK's request for a Brexit delay until 31 January 2020, with an option to leave sooner if a deal is approved by Parliament. Delaying the UK's exit date requires an extension to Article 50, the part of the Lisbon Treaty that sets out what happens when a country decides it wants to leave the EU. Article 50 allows an initial two-year period for negotiations on the terms of exiting. It was triggered by then Prime Minister Theresa May on 29 March 2017, giving an exit date of 29 March 2019. But this date was extended twice, first to 12 April and then until 31 October, after Mrs May's deal was rejected in successive votes in the House of Commons. Now it is being extended for a third time - so how does this process work? The UK cannot make a decision about extending Article 50 on its own - it has to send a request to the 27 other EU countries. All 27 have to agree in order to secure an extension. On Saturday 19 October, Mr Johnson sent a letter, as he was compelled to by alaw known as the Benn Act. The law stated he must send an extension request should he fail to get a Brexit deal through the House of Commons by the end of 19 October. Mr Johnson also sent a second letter saying he believed that a ""further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners"". Nevertheless, on 28 October the EU agreed to the extension proposed in his first letter. The EU was not obliged to say yes. Once it received the UK's delay request, in the form of a letter, the 27 leaders consulted with each other on their decision. It was then made following a meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels. If EU leaders had decided to offer a longer extension they would have been likely to have met in person to set conditions of the extension. It's worth pointing out that Article 50 can also be revoked - effectively cancelling Brexit. The UK can in theory do that without consulting anyone else. That would mean that Brexit would not happen and the UK would remain in the EU on the same terms it has now. The Liberal Democrats are the only party to say that would they would revoke Article 50 without a referendum if they won a majority in a general election. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that a revocation should be ""unequivocal and unconditional"", suggesting that the ECJ would take a dim view of any attempt to withdraw an Article 50 notification and then resubmit it again a short time later.

"There is strong opposition to a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland Boris Johnson insists on them, Graham Brady is pushing hard for them, Prime Minister Theresa May seems to be praying for them and Dublin is deeply worried at the thought of them but will the EU ever actually ""give in"" and make changes to the backstop - that guarantee post-Brexit to avoid a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland? It's a tough one. The EU certainly never intended to budge on the backstop - painfully negotiated with the UK over 18 months and signed off last November by Mrs May and her cabinet. But Europe's leaders didn't imagine the UK would still be in such flux over Brexit so very close to B-day on 29 March. Conversations I had with EU figures before Christmas saw my contacts confidently predicting that 2019 would see a no-deal Brexit (which they didn't believe UK MPs would allow to happen), Theresa May's Brexit deal being passed by parliament with cross-party support when MPs realised the looming risk of no deal (they thought this outcome the most likely), or no Brexit at all. Brexit: A really simple guide Kuenssberg: Is Parliament's Brexit fog about to clear? No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' But now there is spreading concern, as the EU's deputy chief Brexit negotiator, Sabine Weyand, pointed out on Monday, that the UK could end up ""crashing out"" of the EU - not intentionally but simply because time allotted by law for exit negotiations could run out before any agreement is reached. This video can not be played Sabine Weyand: Risk of a 'crash out' is high ""The only reason there's still relative calm in EU circles about a no-deal Brexit is because we still have the popcorn out,"" one EU diplomat told me. ""We're mesmerised by the goings on in the House of Commons. But give it a few weeks: if nothing has changed, you'll soon see signs of panic in the (European) capitals."" Of course the EU wants to concentrate minds - for negotiating purposes - on the pain a no-deal Brexit will cause the UK but it will inevitably be costly and difficult for European citizens and businesses too. EU leaders won't want to be punished at the ballot box back home for not having done their best in the view of their voters to avoid all that, but you would be mistaken to then conclude Brussels will - when push comes to shove - pay any price to head off a no-deal Brexit. Behind closed doors, of course, there is a certain amount of game planning going on but the EU is currently in watch and wait mode. EU leaders believe the Brexit debate still has a way to run in parliament and they want to see which way the wind is blowing. They hope if they stand firm and refuse to reopen the Brexit withdrawal agreement, then MPs could be tempted to unite around a softer Brexit than the one advocated by Theresa May - in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit. This video can not be played Brexit vote explained in one minute Some EU leaders dream of a second referendum, resulting - perhaps - in a Brexit reversal. So put yourself in the EU's shoes for a moment: why make a move now as long as the above options appear (to varying degrees) to still be possibilities in the UK? This is why we've recently heard the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, insisting that there is flexibility in the Brexit text on EU-UK future relations, whereas the backstop text is unchangeable. The EU, as I mentioned earlier, wants very, very, very much to avoid making changes to the backstop. A reminder again as to why: Though sometimes scoffed at in the UK as an idea, the EU does indeed feel very much wedded to the Northern Ireland peace process, including cross-border co-operation, which it sees as having been very much facilitated by EU money and EU membership The provisions in the backstop are not being forced by the EU on the UK. The text was negotiated bilaterally and no other alternative found. Brussels feels it's often forgotten that the UK-wide customs provision in the backstop was a UK request rather than an EU imposition The EU will not want to sacrifice the concerns of member state Ireland ""just"" to achieve an exit deal (not even a final trade deal) with departing club member UK. Remember how the EU stood by Spain over Gibraltar when it came to the wording of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement? Well, solidarity with Ireland over the Brexit backstop is considerably stronger amongst EU leaders than it was with Madrid at the time The backstop is also a guarantee for the EU's single market. Don't forget, the land border between the single market and post-Brexit UK will run through the island of Ireland. And the EU is thinking bigger picture too. If Brussels ""caves in"" to the UK over the backstop, there's a fear that could encourage Brussels-sceptic governments in member states Hungary, Italy and Poland, for example, to flout club rules. It could also send a message of weakness to international trade partners. Yet despite all that, if EU leaders were staring into the no-deal Brexit abyss come 1 March, then blink they might over the backstop. And there are the beginnings of whispers to that effect in some EU corridors. Who knows now what changes the EU might eventually accept and it's very hard indeed to imagine them doing it without the OK from Dublin. But mindful of the ticking clock, the European Commission appears to be trying to focus minds in the Irish government and beyond (remember Theresa May's repeated pledge to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland?) on harsh realities. Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas - a man known to be extremely careful about what he does or doesn't say - last week pointedly announced that a no-deal Brexit would inevitably lead to some kind of hard border/ie physical checks. Margaritis Schinas (r) said if he was pushed to speculate it was ""pretty obvious you will have a hard border"" But anyone in Westminster who thinks the backstop issue could magically disappear should definitely think again. Not just in the context of the Brexit agreement but what comes after. Ireland - as every other EU member - has a veto over any future EU-UK trade deal and could use it if Dublin felt the border wasn't adequately protected. In conclusion, the EU will wait until the last minute to make concessions over the Brexit deal on the table. It's not in the market to make changes here and there only for Theresa May to come back again and demand more. That's why the message from EU leaders to the prime minister has been loud and clear. They have told her: ""Don't bother coming back to us in Brussels until you can convincingly (i.e. not just by a couple of votes) show us once and for all that the majority of parliament is behind you.""

"Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson (right) The family of missing Cardiff City footballer Emiliano Sala are planning an underwater search. Family spokesman David Mearns told a press conference that a private search of the English Channel, paid for by fundraisers, also included fishing boats and other vessels. The underwater search is expected to begin on Sunday. Meanwhile the family has been taken on a plane to see the area that rescuers have been searching. They left Guernsey Airport at about 09:30 GMT on a chartered flight with harbourmaster David Barker. Sala's sister Romina and mother Mercedes arrived on the island on Sunday and a family spokesman said they were struggling for answers. The family travelled on a twin-engine Dornier 228-212 plane which flew from Guernsey and circled the island of Alderney. The family's flight leaving Guernsey Airport Mr Mearns told a press conference on Monday: ""We would like to thank all the people and all the companies that have offered their help,"" he said. ""We have been planning an underwater search as a next phase... there are still boats on the water... and people are still looking."" Speaking of Sala and the football community's reaction, Mr Mearns added: ""He's a really friendly person that people loved - from both clubs and any other clubs, and that's where you see the breath of the football community coming together in an extraordinarily short period of time to raise this type of money. ""So, obviously the family appreciate that, but their minds have been in a different place this week."" The family was shown the search area which included Burhou Island near Alderney An official search for 28-year-old Sala and pilot David Ibbotson, 59, of Crowle, Lincolnshire, was called off on Thursday, with Mr Barker saying the chance of them being alive was ""extremely remote"". But, after a plea from his sister not to give up, more than Â£290,000 was raised for a private search to continue - which is being led by Mr Mearns, said to be a renowned shipwreck hunter. High-profile donors to the GoFundMe page include France and PSG forward Kylian Mbappe, former West Ham midfielder Dimitri Payet and Leicester City winger Demarai Gray. More than 4,000 people have donated to the page.

He's a very humble, family man. ""He was always joking, he was very keen to stay with the family all the time and we know he's here somewhere and we are here to bring him back"". This video can not be played Neil Warnock said he remembered Mr Ibbotson as a ""fabulous pilot"" Speaking for the first time since Sala disappeared, Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock said he could understand Sala's family's stance on keeping the search going. ""If it was my kid I'd want everybody looking forever,""he said at a press conferenceon Monday. ""It's by far the most difficult week in my career. Even now I can't get my head round the situation,"" he said. ""When I look at Romina and the family, it's such a difficult time. I keep looking at my own children and thinking what I would be doing now, as well."" Mr Warnock added he believed he had also been flown by Mr Ibbotson. ""I'd been on a couple of planes like that, but I think the ones I'd be on might have had two engines. ""But I'd been over the top to Nantes a couple of times, and I do think I had that pilot - who I thought was a fabulous pilot. ""So I just can't comprehend it."" Emiliano Sala was on board a plane bound for Cardiff from Nantes when it disappeared from radar Argentine striker Salasigned for the Bluebirds from Nantes on Saturday, 19 Januaryand was flying back to Wales from France when the plane disappeared from radar last Monday evening. At 19:15 GMT, Mr Ibbotson made a request to descend before losing contact with Jersey air traffic control. Mr Mearns said they had travelled to Guernsey to be near where the plane was last located and to find out about the investigation and what happens next. He said: ""This is a family that has come from Argentina with this huge shock out of nowhere and is struggling with very, very few answers about an unexplained loss."" He added the family ""still have some hope"", saying: ""They're looking at this as a missing person, a missing plane and until they are satisfied, that's the mode that we are in."" Sala's family arrived at Guernsey Airport on Sunday Romina Sala visited Cardiff last week and said she believes both Emiliano and the pilot are alive Mr Mearns said the private search would entail ""more investigative technical searches underwater"" at some point. The family have also thanked donors for their ""exceptional generosity"" after money was raised to pay for a private search. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch has begun an investigation which will look at ""all operational aspects,"" including licensing and flight plans.
