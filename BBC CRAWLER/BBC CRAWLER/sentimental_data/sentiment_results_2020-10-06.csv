"Rebel Tories have clashed with a health minister over the ban on gatherings of more than six people in England, arguing it doesn't make sense. The government easily won a vote on retaining the rule by 287 votes to 17. Sir Graham Brady - one of 14 Tories to oppose the rule - told minister Helen Whately the ""rule of six"" was not based on scientific evidence. Ms Whately hit back, saying the government could not allow coronavirus to ""rip"" through communities. But the comment angered Tory former minister Mark Harper. He said all MPs ""want the government to be successful"" in combating coronavirus, but they did not appreciate being accused of ""wanting to let it rip and kill tens of thousands of people"" every time they suggested an alternative strategy. Report 'rule of six' breaches, minister urges How can I meet other people safely? Labour agreed with many of the backbenchers' points in the Commons debate, but the party abstained in the vote on the restrictions, which came into force three weeks ago. However, five DUP MPs joined the Tory rebels in voting against the restriction. There could be a bigger rebellion coming if MPs vote on England's 22:00 hospitality curfew. Tory rebels are confident that dozens of backbenchers would be prepared to retrospectively vote down the measure. In the Commons debate leading up to the vote on the rule of six, MPs on all sides demanded to know why children had not been excluded from the restriction - as they have in Scotland and Wales. Sir Graham, who chairs the influential 1922 committee of Tory MPs, said: ""Can she (Ms Whately) share with us her estimate of the efficacy of the rule of six compared to that of a rule of eight, had that been introduced instead? ""Is the rule of six more or less effective than a ban on household mixing?"" He added: ""These rules are a massive intrusion into the liberty and private lives of the whole British people, and they're having a devastating economic effect as well, which will result in big job losses and masses of business failures."" Tory MP Huw Merriman said he feared the rule of six would ""do more harm than good"" as people might end up ignoring rules ""that do make sense"" - adding he had not seen any evidence it would reduce rates of Covid-19. Tory former minister Steve Baker added: ""We're hearing about people who are being destroyed by this lockdown. Strong, confident people, outgoing people, gregarious people, who are being destroyed and reduced to repeated episodes of tears on the phone. ""This is a devastating social impact on our society and I believe that people would make different choices were they the ones able to take responsibility for themselves."" Shadow health minister Justin Madders reeled off a list of questions to Ms Whately on the policy, echoing many of the criticisms made by Tory and Lib Dem MPs. He said Labour would support ""whatever reasonable steps are necessary to protect the NHS and save lives"", but said the government was guilty of ""mixed messages and confused communications"". But Ms Whately said the rule of six gave ""a clear steer"" and made the guidance ""simple and absolutely clear for everybody"". She added: ""We are also taking a path of on the one hand trying to enable a level of socialising for the sake of people's quality of life, while taking steps to control the virus. ""That is where we have taken the position that the rule of six achieves that balance.""

"The inquiry's chair, Prof Alexis Jay, also led investigations into child abuse in Rotherham The Church of England failed to protect children from sexual abuse, and created a culture where abusers ""could hide"", a report has concluded. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuse's report,externalsays the Church's failure to respond consistently to abuse victims added to their trauma. It added that alleged perpetrators were often given more support than victims. The Church said it felt ""shame"" over the failings detailed in the ""shocking"" report. The report, which is the latest in a series of publications from the IICSA, said 390 clergy members and other church leaders were convicted of abuse between the 1940s and 2018. The Church defended alleged perpetrators instead of protecting children and young people from sexual predators, the report added. It cited the example of the late cathedral dean, Robert Waddington, about whomserious allegations were made in 1999. The then Archbishop of York said there was ""simply no possibility"" of the claims being correct. It also cited Reverend Ian Hughes, from Merseyside,who was convicted in 2014 for downloading 8,000 indecent images of children. His offending was played down by a senior colleague. The report also found examples of clergymen being ordained despite a history of child sexual offences. The inquiry said the Church did not take allegations seriously and neglected the ""physical, emotional and spiritual wellbeing of children and young people in favour of protecting its reputation"" - which was in direct conflict with its mission ""of love and care for the innocent and the vulnerable"". Several claims of historical abuse had been made about Robert Waddington before his death, from cancer, in 2007 In 2018 there were 2,504 safeguarding concerns reported to dioceses in England about either children or vulnerable adults. The IICSA's report is based on the inquiry's public hearings held in July 2019, and investigated safeguarding issues in the Church of England and the Church in Wales - each of which sit within the worldwide Anglican Communion. How the child sexual abuse inquiry works Bishop praises 'courageous' victims Vicar had 8,200 child abuse images The inquiry's chairwoman, Prof Alexis Jay, said: ""Over many decades, the Church of England failed to protect children and young people from sexual abusers, instead facilitating a culture where perpetrators could hide and victims faced barriers to disclosure that many could not overcome. ""Within the Church in Wales, there were simply not enough safeguarding officers to carry out the volume of work required of them. Record-keeping was found to be almost non-existent and of little use in trying to understand past safeguarding issues."" The report conceded there had been ""a number of important improvements"" in child protection practices in the Church of England in recent years, but Prof Jay added it was ""vital"" that the Church improved how it responded to allegations of child sexual abuse. Gilo, who was abused by a clergyman when he was young, says survivors are still angry with the Church One victim of abuse, who says he was raped by a clergyman in London more than 40 years ago, told the BBC it would take ""courage"" from the Church and its leaders to ""salvage itself and redeem itself"". Gilo - who asked us not to use his surname - previously told the BBC he had made more than 20 attempts to contact senior members of the Church after his decision to report the assaults, but often received no reply. The Church eventually agreed it was at fault and reached a financial settlement with him. On Tuesday, Gilo said many survivors still felt a ""tremendous sense of anger and lack of trust"" in the Church. Gilo, whose abuser has since died, said he believed the Church's recently-appointed lead safeguarding bishop, Reverend Dr Jonathan Gibbs, was keen to make a difference - but that ""there needs to be a real turnaround"" in the Church's culture. ""Once survivors see real help, and real support beginning to reach them from a Church that has mouthed support for a long time but not delivered it... there could be a turning point."" By Callum May, BBC News The explicit moral purpose of the Church is to teach right from wrong, this inquiry states in its conclusions. It failed and it is still failing. In 2018, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 449 concerns raised about recent child sexual abuse. A significant number of these involved the downloading or possession of indecent images of children. The Archbishops of Canterbury and York have said they will not make excuses, and offer their sincere and heartfelt apologies. The Church of England, they say, is ready to support anyone who comes forward and will honour its commitment to change. The independent inquiry's recommendations are likely to be endorsed in full by the House of Bishops, and put to its governing General Synod in November. This will probably lead to an extension of a pilot support scheme for a small number of survivors who are already receiving financial help. But survivors' groups say the inquiry's findings represent only the tip of an iceberg. Today's findings will prove a heavy cost for the Church. Home Secretary Priti Patel praised the strength and courage of victims and survivors and pledged to review the report before considering how to respond ""in due course"". The report made several recommendations, including: the Church of England should improve how it responds to safeguarding complaints - by, for example, reintroducing a rule to expel any member of the clergy found guilty of child sexual abuse offences responsibility for safeguarding should be taken out of the hands of diocesan bishops and given to safeguarding officers employed by the central hierarchy of the Church the Church of England and Church in Wales should share information about clergy who move between the two institutions both Churches should introduce policies for funding and support of survivors of child sexual abuse whose perpetrators had a connection to the Church Prof Jay said she hoped the report and its recommendations would help to ""ensure these failures never happen again"". The Church of England said the report ""makes shocking reading"" and that the entire institution ""must learn lessons from this inquiry"". ""While apologies will never take away the effects of abuse on victims and survivors, we today want to express our shame about the events that have made those apologies necessary,"" said Dr Gibbs, the Church's lead safeguarding bishop, and Melissa Caslake, the Church's national director of safeguarding. In a joint statement, the pair said there had been some improvements to safeguarding in the Church in recent years, but added: ""We wholeheartedly regret that in some areas, most importantly support for victims and survivors, progress has been too slow."" They said the Church endorsed and was ""completely committed"" to the report's recommendations for improving such support. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) in England and Wales is investigating claims against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces and public and private institutions - as well as people in the public eye. Following the death of BBC presenter Jimmy Savile in 2011, hundreds of people came forward to say he had abused them as children. The spotlight has also fallen on sexual assaults carried out in schools, children's homes and at NHS sites. At the same time, there have been claims of past failures by police and prosecutors to properly investigate allegations. The IICSA was established in 2015, with the then Home Secretary Theresa May saying it would ""expose those failures and learn the lessons"" from the past. In 2018 the inquiry published aninterim report,externalwith 18 recommendations - some of which have been acted upon.

"Facebook has deleted a post in which President Trump had claimed Covid-19 was ""less lethal"" than the flu. Mr Trump is at the White House after three days of hospital treatment having tested positive for the virus. He wrote the US had ""learned to live with"" flu season, ""just like we are learning to live with Covid, in most populations far less lethal!!!"" Twitter hid the same message behind a warning about ""spreading misleading and potentially harmful information"". Users have to click past the alert to read the tweet. ""We remove incorrect information about the severity of Covid-19, and have now removed this post,"" said Andy Stone, policy communications manager at Facebook. An exact mortality rate for Covid-19 is not known, but it is thought to be substantially higher - possible 10 times or more - than most flu strains,according to Johns Hopkins University,external. The Presidenthas reacted by posting,external: ""REPEAL SECTION 230!!!"" This is a reference to a law that says social networks are not responsible for the content posted by their users. But it allows the firms to engage in ""good-Samaritan blocking"", including the removal of content they judge to be offensive, harassment or violent. If the law were to be repealed, social media companies would face being sued over the edits and changes of user content they made. This is the second time that Facebook has deleted a post from the president. Twitter has intervened more often with deletions and warnings. Users do not see Trump's tweet in his timeline unless they click on the View link Both social networks have vowed to combat potentially dangerous misinformation around the virus. But Mr Trump has taken issue with what he sees as editorialising by the companies. Shortly after Twitter put a warning label on his posts for the first time in May, Mr Trump signed an executive order to repeal Section 230. The proposal has attracted cross-party support - but for different reasons. The Republicans say there is a bias against or even outright censorship of conservative views online and want this to stop. The Democrats say they are more interested in the spread of misinformation. Last week,the US Senate Commerce Committee issued subpoenas for the heads of Facebook, Twitter and Googleto probe the matter further. Pressure has been mounting on Facebook and Twitter to do more to tackle misinformation both about the pandemic and the US election. For that reason, their decisive action on Trump's recent post promoting false claims about the severity of coronavirus will be welcomed. That said, Trump's comments about the flu - and those yesterday saying ""Don't be afraid of Covid"" - have already started to fuel conspiracy theories online. Posts in pro-Trump and anti-mask Facebook groups have shared the comments with captions about the pandemic not being real, or not very serious. They have also used it to encourage others not to follow health guidance like wearing a mask or social distancing. Early on in the pandemic, the BBC investigated the human cost of misinformation, including those who fell seriously ill because social media posts led them to doubt the reality or severity of the pandemic and ignore advice. The hope will be that this action from social media sites could reduce the risk of that happening - but those who may have already been exposed to this disinformation could be impacted. And all eyes will be on social media sites to see if they keep up this approach to tackling disinformation - coronavirus, political or otherwise - especially from the US Election candidates as polling day nears.

Both Nikki Sixx of Motley Crue and Pearl Jam's Mike McCready likened him to Mozart, with the latter saying he had ""changed everything and played with soul,external"". Born in Amsterdam, Netherlands, Van Halen was the son of Eugenia Van Halen and Jan Van Halen, a clarinettist, saxophonist and pianist. The musical influence rubbed off on Van Halen, who was taught to play piano as a child. When the family emigrated to Pasadena, California in 1962, they brought a piano on the boat. ""We actually played music on the boat on the way over here, you know? I'm serious! It wasn't like, 'so what do you want to do in life?'. Dad said, 'we've got to make a living'. So if it weren't for music, we wouldn't have survived,""Van Halen said in a 2012 interview with Esquire,external. Alex Van Halen, Michael Anthony and Eddie Van Halen were reunited with former lead singer David Lee Roth on stage at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards As he grew up, Van Halen switched to drums and then guitar, initially playing alongside his father and brother at weddings and bar mitzvahs. As an adult, Van Halen formed Van Halen in the early 1970s in Los Angeles. He was the guitarist, his brother Alex was the drummer, David Lee Roth was the singer and Michael Anthony was the bassist. Van Halen was said to be the main song-writing force behind the band's eponymous debut album, released in 1978. The album shot to number 19 on the Billboard charts, becoming one of the most successful debuts of the decade. But Van Halen's biggest success came with their sixth album, 1984, which saw Van Halen focus on synths over guitars. It produced the band's only number one single, Jump, and the MTV favourite Hot For Teacher. Jump was also the band's biggest hit in the UK, reaching number seven in 1984. That aside, the guitarist was possibly just as well known in the UK for playing the solo on Michael Jackson's 1983 hit Beat It. Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007, Van Halen received great acclaim for his distinctive guitar parts in many of the band's hits, from Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love to Panama. He refined and popularised a style of playing known as the ""two-handed tap""; and his lightning-fast technique influenced countless rock guitarists in the 80s. Van Halen had been battling separate bouts of cancer for years. He first confirmed he had tongue cancer in 2001, telling fans he would beat the disease. He received treatment and the subsequent surgery removed about a third of his tongue. He was declared cancer-free in 2002. ButTMZ reported last year,externalthat Van Halen had been privately battling throat cancer for five years, flying between the US and Germany for radiation treatment.

"Conwy was among the areas put into lockdown The first minister has accused political rivals in north Wales of encouraging people not to abide by lockdown laws imposed last week. Mark Drakeford told the Senedd that a statement signed by Conservative MSs and MPs in the region objecting to travel restrictions was a ""disgrace"". The group had claimed the restrictions in Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham weredisproportionate. Tory MS Darren Millar accused Mr Drakeford of an ""absolute fabrication"". Later, lockdown laws for Cardiff, Swansea and three other south Wales counties failed to win the support of opposition parties in a Senedd vote. The backing of Labour members keeps the lockdowns in place, but the Conservatives said ministers had not justified the need for county-wide restrictions and the Brexit Party also opposed the regulations while Plaid Cymru abstained. Under the restrictionsin north Wales and elsewhere people are not able to leave or enter the areas without a ""reasonable excuse"", such as work or education. Also on Tuesday: The first minister said people who flout Covid-19 rules by holding house parties could face bigger fines. Advisers to the Welsh Government have also said that the transmission rate of the virus, the R rate, in Wales is now between 1.3 and 1.6. Mr Drakeford's comments in the Senedd came after he explained the Welsh Government's threshold for taking local action - 50 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. He said his government was ""disgracefully"" criticised by Conservatives, ""when we took action in north Wales, because we hadn't yet reached those 50 thresholds"". ""It was absolutely obvious to anybody who studied the figures that north Wales was on its way to that threshold and sadly today is well past it."" Later Brexit Party group leader Mark Reckless cautioned the first minister against ""describing people as disgraceful"" because they ""take a different view to coronavirus restrictions than you have"". Mr Drakeford doubled down on his criticism in response. Mark Drakeford, pictured in an earlier video, said the statement was ""disgraceful"". Mr Drakeford said: ""The letter that was publishedâ¦ was an encouragement to people in north Wales not to abide by the law that is passed here in Wales."" He claimed it encouraged others to think the restrictions ""were unnecessary and unjustified"". ""None of that was true, and it undermines the willingness of other people who want to make sure they are making their contribution from making that as well."" Darren Millar, Tory MS for Clwyd West, accused the first minister of ""claptrap and cobblers"" over a statement he signed criticising the north Wales lockdowns. In an angry contribution to a debate on restrictions elsewhere, Mr Millar said that in ""no way whatsoever did any member of the Conservative Party encourage people to break the law, and to disregard those coronavirus restrictions"". He said it was an ""absolute fabrication"" that had been ""thrown arbitrarily onto the floor of the chamber"". He asked for the first minister to apologise and ""take back"". The Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart has said he thinks it is ""a bit odd that the first minister is almost suggesting people shouldn't be able to express a view."" In a joint statement, the group of Conservative MPs and MSs wrote: ""We accept that Covid-19 infection rates have generally risen across north Wales during September - although they remain significantly lower than those within local lockdown areas elsewhere. ""It is understood that raised case numbers largely relate to household transmission, as well as an element within the hospitality and healthcare sectors.  There is very limited evidence that either travel or tourism is driving raised infection rates. ""For this reason, travel restrictions have not generally been introduced for local lockdowns in England. ""Bearing this in mind, we believe that the Welsh Government's proposed ""within county"" travel restrictions are disproportionate."" They ""strongly urged"" the Welsh Government to reconsider. BBC Wales was told north Wales Conservatives are unhappy that the first minister responded to their concerns in the Senedd chamber, rather than to them directly. Could police be given powers to impose larger fines on house parties? Last week Sam Rowlands, Conservative leader of Conwy Council, said the lockdown measures in his county would ""help reduce the spread of the virus in Conwy"", while calling for more help for tourism businesses. On Tuesday Mr Rowlands issued a letter to the first minister calling for travel restrictions in his county to be lifted. ""As I shared with you, it is clear that there is no evidence which points to the movement of people in North Wales as a major contributing factor for the increase in cases of Covid-19. ""Therefore, this restriction does not appear to be based on any evidence and seems completely disproportionate to the reality of the situation."" He added that travel restrictions do not ""take into consideration the natural cross border necessity of life in North Wales"". Conwy is one of 15 counties in Wales now in lockdown, together with the town of Llanelli. What can I do during local lockdowns? 'Rolling lockdowns' will become the norm in Wales The Welsh Government has powers to place restrictions on hotspot areas, with Senedd members getting a chance to vote on them after they come into force. Lockdowns on Wales' two biggest cities, together with Neath Port Talbot, Vale of Glamorgan and Torfaen, were approved with the support of Labour MSs on Tuesday. But the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru only voted for restrictions in Llanelli, saying ministers had not provided enough evidence to rule out smaller lockdowns in other parts of south Wales. Tory health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said: ""The data is there and has been used, so you have to question why the minister is not using it, but is hell-bent on shutting down whole counties, which will lead to local economies being even more adversely affected."" Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the Conservatives had taken a ""serious step"" by deciding to vote down the regulations. ""We all have role to play in keeping Wales safe,"" he said. ""These regulations are necessary to our continued efforts to tackle this unfinished pandemic."" Ministers were also told an influential group of Senedd members will start looking at the reasons given for any further local lockdowns. Legislation Committee chairman Mick Antoniw said: ""In the future the committee intends to consider the extent to which the explanatory memoranda include evidence about why certain areas are placed in lockdown and the reasons for that urgency."" Earlier, during First Minister's Questions Mark Drakeford was asked whether the Welsh Government would place larger penalties on rule breakers. He told the Senedd that ministers were considering whether the regime ""needs to be adapted to address specific issues such as the holding of house parties"". Parties have been blamed for helping spread the disease in hotspot areas. Breaking restrictions leads to a Â£60 fixed penalty for a first offence. It doubles for repeat offences to a maximum of Â£1,920. Independent MS Caroline Jones said current fines were too low and it was ""high time we crack down on rule breakers"". The latest report of the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell (TAC) has put the R rate - which describes how much the virus is reproducing - between 1.3 and 1.6. An R rate of 1 estimates that every person with the virus transmits it to one other person. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price told the Senedd the report made ""sobering reading."" Mark Drakeford said it should be a ""real warning"" to those who think the Welsh Government is imposing restrictions unnecessarily on Wales. The report said the transmission rate of the virus is ""likely"" to be growing, though there ""may still be high degrees of variability, for example, in a localised outbreak"". TAC also warn that unless the R rate is brought back below 1, infection incidence and hospital admissions ""may exceed scenario planning levels"". The group points to a recent ONS study which suggests that, during the week of 18-24 September, approximately 1 in every 500 people in Wales may have had coronavirus - equating to around 6,400 people. But there are signs, says the report, that things might be ""levelling off"" - with evidence of reduced travel and greater adherence to rules like wearing face coverings and not meeting people indoors.

"The inquiry's chair, Prof Alexis Jay, also led investigations into child abuse in Rotherham The Church of England failed to protect children from sexual abuse, and created a culture where abusers ""could hide"", a report has concluded. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuse's report,externalsays the Church's failure to respond consistently to abuse victims added to their trauma. It added that alleged perpetrators were often given more support than victims. The Church said it felt ""shame"" over the failings detailed in the ""shocking"" report. The report, which is the latest in a series of publications from the IICSA, said 390 clergy members and other church leaders were convicted of abuse between the 1940s and 2018. The Church defended alleged perpetrators instead of protecting children and young people from sexual predators, the report added. It cited the example of the late cathedral dean, Robert Waddington, about whomserious allegations were made in 1999. The then Archbishop of York said there was ""simply no possibility"" of the claims being correct. It also cited Reverend Ian Hughes, from Merseyside,who was convicted in 2014 for downloading 8,000 indecent images of children. His offending was played down by a senior colleague. The report also found examples of clergymen being ordained despite a history of child sexual offences. The inquiry said the Church did not take allegations seriously and neglected the ""physical, emotional and spiritual wellbeing of children and young people in favour of protecting its reputation"" - which was in direct conflict with its mission ""of love and care for the innocent and the vulnerable"". Several claims of historical abuse had been made about Robert Waddington before his death, from cancer, in 2007 In 2018 there were 2,504 safeguarding concerns reported to dioceses in England about either children or vulnerable adults. The IICSA's report is based on the inquiry's public hearings held in July 2019, and investigated safeguarding issues in the Church of England and the Church in Wales - each of which sit within the worldwide Anglican Communion. How the child sexual abuse inquiry works Bishop praises 'courageous' victims Vicar had 8,200 child abuse images The inquiry's chairwoman, Prof Alexis Jay, said: ""Over many decades, the Church of England failed to protect children and young people from sexual abusers, instead facilitating a culture where perpetrators could hide and victims faced barriers to disclosure that many could not overcome. ""Within the Church in Wales, there were simply not enough safeguarding officers to carry out the volume of work required of them. Record-keeping was found to be almost non-existent and of little use in trying to understand past safeguarding issues."" The report conceded there had been ""a number of important improvements"" in child protection practices in the Church of England in recent years, but Prof Jay added it was ""vital"" that the Church improved how it responded to allegations of child sexual abuse. Gilo, who was abused by a clergyman when he was young, says survivors are still angry with the Church One victim of abuse, who says he was raped by a clergyman in London more than 40 years ago, told the BBC it would take ""courage"" from the Church and its leaders to ""salvage itself and redeem itself"". Gilo - who asked us not to use his surname - previously told the BBC he had made more than 20 attempts to contact senior members of the Church after his decision to report the assaults, but often received no reply. The Church eventually agreed it was at fault and reached a financial settlement with him. On Tuesday, Gilo said many survivors still felt a ""tremendous sense of anger and lack of trust"" in the Church. Gilo, whose abuser has since died, said he believed the Church's recently-appointed lead safeguarding bishop, Reverend Dr Jonathan Gibbs, was keen to make a difference - but that ""there needs to be a real turnaround"" in the Church's culture. ""Once survivors see real help, and real support beginning to reach them from a Church that has mouthed support for a long time but not delivered it... there could be a turning point."" By Callum May, BBC News The explicit moral purpose of the Church is to teach right from wrong, this inquiry states in its conclusions. It failed and it is still failing. In 2018, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 449 concerns raised about recent child sexual abuse. A significant number of these involved the downloading or possession of indecent images of children. The Archbishops of Canterbury and York have said they will not make excuses, and offer their sincere and heartfelt apologies. The Church of England, they say, is ready to support anyone who comes forward and will honour its commitment to change. The independent inquiry's recommendations are likely to be endorsed in full by the House of Bishops, and put to its governing General Synod in November. This will probably lead to an extension of a pilot support scheme for a small number of survivors who are already receiving financial help. But survivors' groups say the inquiry's findings represent only the tip of an iceberg. Today's findings will prove a heavy cost for the Church. Home Secretary Priti Patel praised the strength and courage of victims and survivors and pledged to review the report before considering how to respond ""in due course"". The report made several recommendations, including: the Church of England should improve how it responds to safeguarding complaints - by, for example, reintroducing a rule to expel any member of the clergy found guilty of child sexual abuse offences responsibility for safeguarding should be taken out of the hands of diocesan bishops and given to safeguarding officers employed by the central hierarchy of the Church the Church of England and Church in Wales should share information about clergy who move between the two institutions both Churches should introduce policies for funding and support of survivors of child sexual abuse whose perpetrators had a connection to the Church Prof Jay said she hoped the report and its recommendations would help to ""ensure these failures never happen again"". The Church of England said the report ""makes shocking reading"" and that the entire institution ""must learn lessons from this inquiry"". ""While apologies will never take away the effects of abuse on victims and survivors, we today want to express our shame about the events that have made those apologies necessary,"" said Dr Gibbs, the Church's lead safeguarding bishop, and Melissa Caslake, the Church's national director of safeguarding. In a joint statement, the pair said there had been some improvements to safeguarding in the Church in recent years, but added: ""We wholeheartedly regret that in some areas, most importantly support for victims and survivors, progress has been too slow."" They said the Church endorsed and was ""completely committed"" to the report's recommendations for improving such support. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) in England and Wales is investigating claims against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces and public and private institutions - as well as people in the public eye. Following the death of BBC presenter Jimmy Savile in 2011, hundreds of people came forward to say he had abused them as children. The spotlight has also fallen on sexual assaults carried out in schools, children's homes and at NHS sites. At the same time, there have been claims of past failures by police and prosecutors to properly investigate allegations. The IICSA was established in 2015, with the then Home Secretary Theresa May saying it would ""expose those failures and learn the lessons"" from the past. In 2018 the inquiry published aninterim report,externalwith 18 recommendations - some of which have been acted upon.

"This video can not be played Britain has gone through âtoo much frustration and hardship just to settle for the status quoâ says Boris Johnson. Boris Johnson has vowed to defeat Covid and build a better country over the next decade in his leader's speech to the virtual Conservative conference. Evoking the UK's recovery from World War Two, he said he wanted to build a ""new Jerusalem"", with opportunity for all, improved housing and healthcare. He warned the UK could not return to normal after the pandemic, which would be a ""catalyst"" for major change. And he rejected suggestions he had ""lost his mojo"" as ""drivel"". In his speech, delivered without the usual conference audience, he said he wanted to see the back of coronavirus and the ""erosion of liberties"" it had led to and to see the country flourishing again. He said: ""Even in the darkest moments we can see the bright future ahead. And we can see how to build it and we will build it together."" Wind farms could power every home by 2030 - PM The week Boris Johnson turned green, or did he? The PM praised the UK's fight against the virus, saying he had had ""more than enough"" of the disease - which he insisted would be overcome by ""collective effort"". He insisted the pandemic could not be allowed to ""hold us back or slow us down"" and the country that emerged from the crisis would be very different from the one that preceded it. Insisting that ""we will not content ourselves with a repair job"" after the pandemic, he said the government would: Make the UK a ""world leader"" in green energy, announcing Â£160m of investment in ports and factories to increase electricity generation from offshore wind ""Fix the injustice"" of care home funding, adding the crisis had ""shone a spotlight"" on the plight of the sector Boost housebuilding through changes to England's ""sclerotic"" planning system, and improving access to low-deposit mortgages for first-time buyers Explore greater provision of one-to-one teaching for pupils who had fallen behind during the pandemic, or those of ""exceptional abilities"". The PM said wind power could generate enough electricity to power every UK home by 2030 Mr Johnson said the pandemic had ""forced"" the government into massively expanding the role of the state, but warned against drawing the ""wrong economic conclusion from this crisis"". He said for Conservatives, the increased bail-outs and subsidies to prop up the economy ""go against our instincts,"" but there was ""simply no reasonable alternative"". ""There are many who regard this state expansion as progress, who want to keep the state supporting furlough forever, keep people in suspended animation,"" he said. ""We Conservatives believe that way lies disaster, and that we must build back better by becoming more competitive, both in tax and regulation."" Pledging to rebuild the dream of home ownership for the young, he vowed to help get more 20 to 30-year-olds on the housing ladder by offering fixed-rate mortgages available to those with just 5% deposits. He added: ""In the depths of the Second World War, in 1942 when just about everything had gone wrong, the government sketched out a vision of the post-war new Jerusalem that they wanted to build. ""And that is what we are doing now - in the teeth of this pandemic. ""We are resolving not to go back to 2019, but to do better: to reform our system of government; to renew our infrastructure; to spread opportunity more widely and fairly and to create the conditions for a dynamic recovery that is led not by the state but by free enterprise."" Although the current situation is about as far from standard as anything in recent history, the PM's conference speech was, well, rather standard. It was a familiar Johnson cocktail: the kind of gags you might hear during an after-dinner speech, and the political message we have heard from him already on several big set-piece occasions. Namely, that the government was fighting a war against this disease but it will be vanquished, and he will lead the country to a happier peace. His speech was not short of ambition - including promises on everything from green jobs, to education, productivity, housing, even to planting trees. It was though short on detail of how the country will make it to his ""New Jerusalem"", and how his promises would actually be made to happen. Does that matter? While conference speeches are often a big shop window for leaders to talk to the country, it felt today that the prime minister didn't really take that opportunity. Instead, perhaps to try to calm activists' nerves, he pointed out that he was uncomfortable with the expansion of the state to deal with Covid-19, still a believer in traditional Tory values, and even claimed it was ""seditious"" to suggest that he had lost some of his normal mojo. Read more from Laura Mr Johnson also addressed those who have criticised his leadership during the pandemic, saying it was wrong to suggest he has not fully recovered from his battle with the disease, which saw him hospitalised for a week. ""I have read a lot of nonsense recently, about how my own bout of Covid has somehow robbed me of my mojo. ""And of course this is self-evident drivel, the kind of seditious propaganda that you would expect from people who don't want this government to succeed, who wanted to stop us delivering Brexit and all our other manifesto pledges."" He attacked Labour's response during the crisis, labelling its leader Sir Keir Starmer as ""Captain Hindsight"", and suggesting the opposition saw the crisis as an opportunity to make the huge extension of the reach of the state a permanent feature of British life. Angela Rayner, deputy leader of the Labour Party, said the prime minister had not set out a plan for the months ahead. She said: ""We end this Conservative conference as we started it: with a shambolic testing system, millions of jobs at risk and an incompetent government that has lost control of this virus and is holding Britain back.""

"Doctors are being told to ""think carefully"" before ordering any tests for their patients, amid shortages caused by a supply chain failure at a major diagnostics company. Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche said problems with a move to a new warehouse had led to a ""very significant"" drop in its processing capacity. A spokesman said Covid-19 tests would be prioritised. But the backlog could affect tests including for cancer and heart disease. One NHS trust in the south west has already advised its GPs to stop all non-urgent blood tests. A memo seen by the BBC, sent to clinicians within a large hospital trust in London, said leaders were ""preparing for a sustained disruption"". ""We urgently need all clinical teams to only send tests that are absolutely essential for immediate patient care, delaying testing where possible,"" it said. Thyroid and cortisol tests were unavailable, while certain cholesterol, liver function and inflammation tests were ""severely restricted"". In a statement, Roche said: ""We deeply regret that there has been a delay in the dispatch of some products. ""We are prioritising the dispatch of Covid-19 PCR [diagnostic] and antibody tests and doing everything we can to ensure there is no impact on the supply of these to the NHS."" How to get a Covid test It did not comment on the impact on other specific tests including for kidney, liver and thyroid function, sepsis and infection. Dr Tom Lewis, lead clinician for pathology at North Devon District Hospital, said his hospital's trust had sent out communications that all non-urgent blood tests in the community should be stopped. Without rationing these non-urgent tests, he said, they would run out of swabs in ""three to four days"". Even with rationing, essential equipment could run short by next week, he said. A scientist at a major London hospital's lab said they had already stopped doing thyroid tests, and expected an important test of liver function, and another for inflammation, to run out within the day. Many of the London labs are supplied by Roche, he said, with reagents - substances used to analyse test results -  proving a particular problem. Allan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, said if the problem continued for days ""it probably will have minimal impact, but if it's weeks then yes it could have a considerable impact on our ability to deliver tests,"" across a whole range of conditions in the UK. The main issue appears to be with the supply of reagents - used to detect the presence of a substance whether that's pregnancy hormones, blood glucose or coronavirus. Because these have such wide application, the number of different diagnostic tests that could be affected is vast. If you go to your GP with a hormonal imbalance, chest infection or sexually-transmitted infection (STI), your test will end up being processed in the lab using these materials. If you're admitted to hospital, you will have your electrolytes tested again relying on the same kind of materials. And your organ function may also be monitored in the same way. Kit supplied by Roche is crucial in testing the health of your liver, heart and kidneys. They also supply antibodies which are used in cancer diagnosis. For NHS trusts which use the company as their main supplier of these types of diagnostic equipment, the work of whole departments could be at risk. Roche initially told trusts it could take more than a fortnight to resolve the problem. But a spokesperson later said they were confident there would be ""significant improvements by the weekend"" and that they would be ""well on the way to resolution by the end of next week"". The company is one of the main suppliers of diagnostic testing equipment and materials in the UK. The affected warehouse in West Sussex is Roche's only distribution centre in the UK and covers the whole country. In September it moved from another warehouse in East Sussex as part of its Brexit preparations, the BBC understands. It is ""not a problem with the volume of product available"" but a logistical issue affecting their ability to distribute it, a spokesperson said. Dr Lewis said perhaps most concerning was the shortage of electrolyte tests supplied by Roche, since these were ""the key test"" for critically ill patients, as well as being extremely commonly used by GPs to check people's medications were safe. One virologist in the Midlands tweeted that her service had not received Hepatitis C testing kits, and was now running short. Materials used in cancer diagnostics could also be affected. In a letter sent to NHS trusts, seen by the BBC, Roche said: ""In September we moved from our old warehouse to a new automated warehouse capable of much higher volumes. ""However, during the transition we encountered some unforeseen issues and a very significant drop in our processing capacity. Since then we have worked around the clock to prioritise and manage orders as well as increase this capacity"". The letter went on to advise local NHS services to ""activate [their] local contingency plans"" and ""look to prioritise essential services only"". But one clinician pointed out that local contingency plans often involve sending tests to a nearby lab, which in this case might also be affected. An NHS spokesperson said:""Roche has alerted hospitals to an issue with their supply chain, and they will be working urgently to resolve this issue.""

"The UK can and will ""build back better"". The Conservatives' theme at their virtual party conference this week is a message that Boris Johnson has sought to impart continuously since the country emerged from lockdown in early July. But as the prime minister prepares to deliver his leader's speech on Tuesday, his party is facing up to the impact that the worst public health crisis for a century is likely to have on its ability to deliver on its promises to voters. The PM has insisted his mission of national renewal, the ""levelling-up"" agenda which was a key backdrop to the Tories'  thumping victory in December's election, has not been put to one side in the national struggle against Covid. He says the programme, which the party describes on its conference website as ""driving lasting change in parts of the country forgotten by successive governments"", is being accelerated, rather than slowed, by the pandemic. And the rush of announcements made during the four-day event and beforehand suggest the government knows it cannot afford to lose sight of its over-riding objective, that is to give those living outside London and the south of England a better chance in life and bigger slice of the economic cake. In his own speech, the PM will earmark Â£160m to upgrade ports and infrastructure in Teesside, the Humber and other areas as part of a drive to make the UK a world-leader in low-cost green energy. Action on left behind parts of England 'delayed' Conservatives to set up second HQ in Leeds Conservative MPs launch 'levelling up' taskforce Elsewhere, the lion's share of a Â£80m fund for local regeneration projects is going to towns in the North East, North West and Yorkshire, a review of transport links will look at upgrading the A1 in Northumberland, while a shake-up of vocational education will pay for all 18-year-olds without an A-level to take a college course. These are all consistent with the Tories' promises in their election manifesto to share prosperity and opportunities more equally across the UK and to boost economic performance beyond the capital. The party is also seeking to leave a more permanent imprint of its own by opening a second HQ in Leeds while creating a fighting fund to help its MPs defend the dozens of ""Red Wall"" seats snatched from Labour in December, some of which turned blue for the first time in electoral history. But as Conservative activists grapple with the role that transport, green and digital technologies will play in the UK's post-Covid recovery, the legacy of what is the UK's deepest post-war recession cannot be ignored. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the government faces a ""daunting task"" if it is to reverse deep-seated regional inequalities, among the most pronounced in Europe, in the current climate. In a recent analysis,external, the respected think tank warned that inequalities within regions are often more acute, with towns in post-industrial regions, coastal resorts and isolated rural areas among those which have fallen furthest behind, a situation which could be exacerbated by Covid and any disruption to post-Brexit trade with Europe. It would cost Â£22bn to level up transport spending, the IFS has said Even ""well-designed policies could take years or even decades to have a meaningful effect"", it says. While the government is right to focus on addressing decades of under-investment in transport and R&D outside London and the South East, it says the cost of closing the gap cannot be underestimated, with Â£22bn alone being needed to bring per person spending on transport across England in line with that in the capital. The government, it adds, ""cannot be all things to all places"". Whatever improvements can be made in infrastructure, housing and skills, the IFS says the success of the levelling-up agenda will inevitably be judged on how far employment and pay disparities can be closed. Middlesbrough, identified by the think tank as one of the five most ""left-behind"" towns in terms of working-age employment rates, has had some recent success stories to celebrate. Start-up bank GBB announced recently it would set up its headquarters in the town, creating more than 120 jobs, while the National Hydrogen Transport Centre is also basing itself there - consolidating the Teesside's market-leading position in the emerging clean technology. PM promises 'radical' shake-up of adult education Sunak vows to 'balance books' despite pandemic But, at the same time, Covid is casting a long shadow over the North East, with the Mayor of Middlesbrough warning that thousands of jobs in hospitality and retail are ""hanging by a thread"" due to local restrictions. The North East hopes to become a world leader in hydrogen transport technology Speaking to the BBC's Newscast podcastlast week, Andy Preston - who despite being an independent is admired by local Tories - said the implications of the virtual lockdown for the local economy were ""monstrous"". He said he had been left ""fuming"" at what he said was the lack of consultation and dialogue with ministers over restrictions, which have prompted claims of a growing North-South divide in the second wave of the disease. The fraying in relations between local leaders and ministers does not augur well at a time when the government's blueprint for further devolution in England hasreportedly been shelved until next year. Far-reaching plans to create more combined authorities and directly elected mayors, while at the same time abolishing a raft of district councils, have caused unease in some Tory heartlands. Former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine, who championed English devolution while advising David Cameron, has urged the government to get on with it, saying a lack of local delivery mechanisms is hampering progress. ""There should be no presumption that civil servants in London devising schemes which seem sensible to ministers should be imposed on local economies,"" he told a recent meeting of the Lords Economic Affairs Committee. But the former Tory, who lost the party whip after rebelling against the government over Brexit, has urged ministers to get the capital on board and not give the impression that London is being penalised for its success. ""It is very difficult to see how you level up without levelling down somebody,"" he said. ""You are never going to make a success of an economy by holding back the most successful core part.""

"Can the government see its way to a greener future? A huge breakthrough in climate policy was signalled this week when  China announced it will reduce its emissions to net zero by 2060. It's a potentially game-changing leap, following in the footsteps of the UK's existing 2050 net zero target. But promises are easy, actions are more challenging - and the UK has been steadily slipping from its climate targets. It's consistently promised tougher policies for the future, but for a few years, Britain's long-term climate strategy has lain buried in fog. We know the net zero carbon destination point, but we can't yet see how the government intends to get there. UK can be 'Saudi Arabia of wind power' - PM China sets surprise 2060 carbon neutrality goal At last, in a contribution to the UN General Assembly (UNGA) on Thursday, the prime minister did briefly illuminate several paths towards carbon Nirvana. But they're only tantalising pointers to the direction of travel, when a full, clear properly funded roadmap is urgently needed. Mr Johnson speaking this week to the UN General Assembly In previous years, climate policy was typically held up in different government departments. But environmentalists say key policies are now stuck in a Downing Street logjam awaiting sign-off from the prime minister himself. It prompts John Sauven from Greenpeace to plead: ""Some of the ideas the government is proposing are really impressive â but the prime minister needs to resolve disputes within government on environmental policies. Now is the time for him to lead."" No 10 insists that deadlines for decisions on climate and the environment will be met in key policy areas like those in the long list below: The National Infrastructure Strategy will lay out plans for government to spend Â£100bn on big projects. Past spending might have been dominated by newroads, but the government has gone quiet over itsÂ£27bn roads programme,external. New roads will increase emissions, andthe Covid experiencesuggests some of the roads cash might be more wisely invested inbroadbandinstead. Radical ideas are under discussion for redesigning city centres, and for providing new electricity networks thatâll be needed to powerelectric vehicles(EVs). Emissions from transport remain high, but Mr Johnson is pinning his hopes on EVs. He told UNGA he'd spring forward the phase-out date for diesel and petrol cars. It's thought 2030 will be the new date, with plug-in hybrids allowed until 2035 - although that's still in the fog. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps accepts that overall car use must also fall because even battery-powered cars contribute to pollution. But that will need some behaviour change, which is against the PM's instincts. On aviation,the Citizens' Assembly UKsaid people would support a tax onfrequent fliers. That would be truly radical, but Mr Shapps and Mr Johnson hope clean technology will allow travellers to escape guilt-free to the sunshine. There are planning issues in transport, too. How does the government stophousebuildersbuilding inplaces where people need their carto get a pint of milk? Heatis a Cinderella problem â more than a third of UK carbon emissions are created by heat production. Ministers are being pressed to announce a date when gashome boilerswill be phased out. Industries want incentives for low-carbon heat, and Mr Johnson's UN remarks suggest he has been persuaded by the well-funded lobby trumpeting the role ofhydrogenin heating and some transport, although that looks expensive. The nuclear giant EDF is suggesting that nukes might be harnessed to generate heat, but there's scepticism about this. The government is also under pressureto stop buildings being demolishedwhere possible, because new building materials create a lot of carbon emissions. Mr Johnson told UNGA the UK could become the ""Saudi Arabia of wind"". Offshore windno longer needs subsidy but progress is being delayed by a host of other factors, including their impact on birds, or fishing. It does need help. To the dismay of some green campaigners, Mr Johnson also committed himself to nuclear power â although it's not clear if that means the behemoth Sizewell C, or multiples ofmini-nukes called SMRs. Perhaps we'll have both. But neither will happen unless the PM agreesgovernment-backed funding. The PM also declared himself for ""evangelist"" to thecarbon capturetechnology that catches CO2 emissions from industry, albeit at a heavy cost. He said he'd previously been sceptical.How will this be funded? Under international climate rules, each nation is obliged to produceits own decarbonisation plan. Mr Johnson is urging nations to join the UK in doing that on 12 December, the fifth anniversary of the successful Paris climate conference. But what will Britain's revised target be? In the past, the Treasury has often blocked climate policies, but since the net zero law was passed, observers say it's been generally supportive. It needs to lay out how much the many commitments will cost. Campaigners say it should go further, with a""green"" reformoftax policyâ especially on gas. The UK lies bottom of Europe'swarm homes league table,external. The chancellor has earmarked Â£3bn for energy efficiency -Â£2bn of it for households. It's a huge job-creating measure, and the fund was due to be spent by the end of March. But theinsulationindustry, which shrank when ministers previously withdrew funding, can't now absorb all that cash. So the scheme is likely to be extended. Experts demand a 10-year funding plan. The PM told UNGA a ""green industrial revolution"" would create hundreds of thousands of jobs, and quipped the UK ""would never be lagging on lagging"" (insulation). While the PM was hailing the UK's green leadership, he's been accused of hypocrisy at home because he's refused to ban the burning of peat moorland and the sale of peat for gardens. Peat is the biggest store of carbon in the UK, but policies to protect it have been delayed after protests from country landowners. Nearly two years ago the government published its outlineEnvironment Bill, hailing it a flagship of legislation. But the PM has left this flagship becalmed in the Commons without a breath of Parliamentary time for nearly 200 days. The Bill will set targets for improving air, water, waste and wildlife. It will also create an Office ofEnvironmental Protectionto replace the European courts. But until it's passed, that office doesn't exist, so, on Brexit day, British citizens will lose their ability to appeal if their government breaks environmental laws. Ruth Chambers from the pressure group Greener UK has lost patience. ""Nature is in freefall,"" she says. ""The governmentâs promises look hollow."" The Bill sets out the framework forUK farm policy after Brexit. The Lords are insisting itbans imports of chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beefinto the UK. The National Farmers Union (NFU) president, Minette Batters, said allowing these imports would be ""morally bankrupt"". The government has repeatedly said it doesnât want to import those goods â but insists it can't have its hands tied in trade negotiations. Farming is a major source of carbon emissions, and the government has been wrestling with policies that will cut CO2 from the land whilst alsosupporting farm businessesandrestoring wildlife. This isan issue of dizzying complexityâ especially for farmers facing the shock of leaving the EU. Ministers will be under pressure to risk riling their own supporters to eatless red meat to protect the planet- as well as their own health. This long list â by no means comprehensive - demonstrates how seriously many departments are addressing what used to be considered a peripheral problem â the environment. It also reveals how difficult it will be to enact policies. Chris Stark from the Climate Change Committee told me: ""We're in an unprecedented time. ""We look to the PM for some leadershipâ¦ it's desperately needed. But this feels like a very important and exciting period."" Mr Stark is optimistic about the political outcome of next year's Glasgow climate conference. But he admits a caveat: we've got climate disruption with just one degree of warming so far, and the way things are looking we'e still heading towards a highly dangerous three degrees.

"US President Donald Trump is coming under fire for downplaying the severity of coronavirus on his return to the White House Election rival Joe Biden, former First Lady Michelle Obama and medics criticise his upbeat statements PM Boris Johnson says the UK cannot return to normal post-pandemic, but needs better housing and healthcare New coronavirus restrictions for Scotland will be announced on Wednesday - but it will not be another full lockdown More than 35.4 million cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed globally, with more than one million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Claire Heald Many thanks for joining us on our live page coverage today. The latest updates on coronavirus were brought to you by: David Walker, Lauren Turner, Joshua Nevett, Max Matza, Emma Harrison, Victoria Bisset, Paul Kirby and Claire Heald. President Trump removed his mask as he returned to the White House on Monday night Weâre pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic soon. In case you missed them, here are some of todayâs major developments from around the world: It's been another busy day of news in the UK. Here's what's been happening so far:  Donald Trump has returned to the White House after being treated by medics for coronavirus. Before leaving Walter Reed medical centre for home, he first drove by his supporters, who had gathered outside. So what do people make of his actions? Scott Pio says Trump is showing love to his supporters by visiting them Scott Pio, a 36-year-old software engineer who lives in Loudoun County, Virginia, was one of those who gathered outside of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, to show their support for the president. Pio applauded the presidentâs decision to go for a drive and does not think it was a risky move. The president, he says, ventured outside of the gates of the military hospital because he wanted âto show his supporters love for being out there"". Pio adds: âHe wouldnât have done it if he didnât really care about the people who are supporting him.â Neil Melton says Trump shows a 'winning spirit' even when ill Neil Melton, a construction-project manager who lives in Prairie Village, Kansas, says he appreciates the way Trump has been candid about his experience with coronavirus. âHeâs trying to be one-on-one with the American people, and heâs trying to show: âHey, Iâm just like you.âââ At the same time, says Melton, he likes to see the president project strength â such as when he walked to the top of a White House staircase and stood at a balcony and took off his mask. âPeople want to see that winning spirit,â says Melton. âThey donât want to live with this Covid lifestyle forever.â Melton adds: âHe wants to show some symbolism: âHey, we can come out of this.ââ Stevie Storck says Trump is not taking the virus seriously âAfter three days, he was saying: âYou donât need to be afraid of it,ââ says Stevie Storck of Windsor, Pennsylvania. She lives on a block with Trump signs (âMake Liberals Cry Againâ), and she says people in her community do not always follow public-health guidelines. People are sometimes cavalier about wearing masks in the post office and in shops, she says, and she is concerned they will be emboldened by the presidentâs actions. âThe misinformation he spread about the virus is a big danger to our community,â she says. âHeâs just furthering that attitude of not taking it seriously.â The World at OneBBC Radio 4 Issues with the England's contact tracing system have been reported since it started. And now, one volunteer has told the BBC what it's been like on the ground. Colin, a volunteer at the local authority centre in Calderdale, West Yorkshire, told The World at One: âCases are still coming through to us too slowly, it is often five or six days after they have been tested, which is too long.â He also said they are only speaking to those people the national system has failed to contact - meaning ""we are not able to build up a complete picture, but we can bring a knowledge of the local geography, the businesses that work here, and the way that the community works"". And Colin added: ""The problem is that the national system works on the basis of test results, so each positive test is treated as an isolated case, not collated into households. âIf you have got a household of maybe five people, three of whom have tested positive, each of those is going to get a phone call as a case in their own right.â This, he said, led to one family receiving 75 separate calls - and disconnecting their phones. Angelica CasasVideo journalist, BBC News Monica MuÃ±oz's father died three months ago from Covid-19 I first met Monica MuÃ±oz, who lost her father and grandfather to Covid-19, while reporting on how Latino-Americans have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Today she says she is not offended by Trump's Twitter advice this morning, advising people to ""learn to live"" with Covid-19 as they have with seasonal flu. ""Today marks three months since my dad passed away. People say that with time things get easier, but Iâm not there yet,"" she says from her home in Texas. ""I agree with President Trump that we cannot be afraid of Covid-19. Life does not stop because of risks. ""We know more about the virus now than we did in the past several months. We have a personal responsibility to take necessary precautions to care for ourselves and protect others. ""We have to continuously inform ourselves about the virus. My dad would always say:Ni modo, la vida sigue(Oh well, life goes on)."" Watch our original piece on Monica's family here: 'Weâre still waiting at home for them to come back' Doctors from three intensive-care units in the Czech Republic have issued an emotional appeal to protect life from Covid-19 to âwin this warâ. A Czech hospital shared the message of doctors Hynek BartoÅ¡, JiÅÃ­ Sagan and AleÅ¡ Chrdle in a social media post on Tuesday. In it, the doctors expressed dismay at the recent resurgence of the virus, which âhas returned with even greater potency than beforeâ. âWe don't want to cause panic and horror, but you must listen to us,â the doctors wrote in the viral post. âOn our wards, we are fighting for the lives of people who - if they had not contracted the coronavirus - would have looked forward to another 10-20 years of quality life ahead of them.â The doctors added that experts, the government and citizens need to do more âif we want to win this warâ. To citizens, they asked for respect for âthe fact that Covid-19 is an insidious opponentâ, adding that âfrequent hand washing, masks and social distancing are the minimum you can do for yourself and others without major sacrificesâ. Coronavirus infections have been rising rapidly since the start of September in the Czech Republic. So far,the country has recorded 85,566 cases and 758 deaths,external. With the pandemic disrupting education for young people around the world, students at the University of Vienna have been given an unusual option to revise. From this week, they are able to study in one of the city's biggest churches, the Votivkirche. The Austrian Catholic Press Agency reported last week that the university had agreed to rent the church when it's not being used for religious services, offering students ""a quiet place to study and stay between courses"". While the location might not be what students are used to, the church has wifi, heaters and toilets. We've heard today how daily hospital admissions are rising in the UK. Here are graphics showing the latest picture. Mark Milley oversees the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Top US General Mark Milley, who oversees the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is in quarantineafter a military aide to President Trump tested positive for the coronavirus. Several other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which runs the US military branches, are also self-isolating and working from home. One of the five military aides that travels with the president - (itâs their job to carry the suitcase containing the nuclear launch codes known as âthe footballâ) - tested positive earlier today. The newly infected military aide is reportedly a member of the Coast Guard. The Vice Commandant of the US Coast Guard, Admiral Charles Ray tested positive, according to a statement released today. Over the weekend, one of Trumpâs military valets also tested positive, US media reported on Tuesday. Also on Tuesday, the Washington Post confirmed New York Times reports that said White House housekeeping staff who tested positive for the virus weeks ago were told to use ""discretion"" when publicly discussing their diagnosis. Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News A group of 400 freelance musicians has played outside Parliament to highlight the plight of the music industry during the pandemic. Violinists Nicola Benedetti and Tasmin Little were among the performers who played a short segment of Mars, from Holst's The Planets, in central London. They then held a two-minute silence, to put pressure on the government to give more support to self-employed artists. There was also a protest outside Birmingham's Symphony Hall. The events were organised by the Musicians Union, which represents more than 32,000 performers in the UK. It says 70% of its members have lost more than three-quarters of their regular work during the lockdown, leaving many in financial hardship. Freelance musicians, who make up 72% of the sector, are particularly affected. Almost half of them are not eligible for grants under the government's current self-employed income support scheme, the union says. Read more here. President Trump has been criticised for saying Americans should not fear Covid-19 President Trump was discharged from hospital on Monday night, allowing him to return to the White House in typically theatrical style. The president will continue his recovery there. Here are some of the key moments in Trumpâs illness so far: Friday: Saturday: Sunday: Monday: Monday evening: Tuesday: President Trump met with his team of doctors at the White House earlier today, according to a statement. ""He had a restful first night at home, and today he reports no symptoms,"" wrote Dr Sean Conley. His vital signs are stable, the doctor continued, adding that ""overall he continues to do extremely well"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has refused to back his deputy's call for Matt Hancock to ""consider his position"". Instead, he says the health secretary needs to ""get on with the job"". Deputy party leader Angela Rayner had been expressing ""frustration"" when she called on Mr Hancock to quit, said Sir Keir. ""I think Angela was probably expressing a frustration that is deeply felt across the country,"" he told reporters. ""What I want is for the government to concentrate on the job in hand and for Matt Hancock and others to get on and deliver what they are promising."" Sir Keir also spoke about the test and trace scheme - see his comments in this video. This video can not be played Keir Starmer on coronavirus testing and tracing plans He said the prime minister should give a ""frank acknowledgement there are real problems"" with the governmentâs approach to dealing with coronavirus, claiming the testing regime âjust isnât workingâ. Facebook said the post breached its rules on misinformation Facebook has removed one of President Trumpâs postsfor breaching its rules on coronavirus misinformation. In the post, President Trump falsely claimed that Covid-19 is less deadly than the seasonal flu. âWe remove incorrect information about the severity of Covid-19, and have now removed this post,âa Facebook spokesperson told CNBC,external. Trump has routinely played down the threat of the virus, telling Americans on Monday they had nothing to fear, after he spent time in hospital with Covid-19. The president shared a similar post about the flu to his Twitter account on Tuesday. The tweet remains accessible, but Twitter has flagged it for violating its rules about âspreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to Covid-19â. Experts say the mortality rate of Covid-19 it is thought to be far higher than that of most strains of the flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates,externalthat 22,000 people in the US died from the flu during the last flu season from late 2019 into 2020. By comparison, the coronavirus outbreak in the US has killed more than 210,000 people so far this year alone,data from Johns Hopkins University shows,external. The White House shot down a proposed rule from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that would have required vaccines be tested on patients for at least two months before they can be approved for public use. The rule would have effectively made it impossible for a vaccine to hit the market before the 3 November presidential election. Trump has said a vaccine could be released any day now, and that it could be available before election day. Polls show that growing numbers of Americans fear that a vaccine may be released too early under less-stringent ""emergency use authorisation"" and will not be deemed safe by medical experts. According to a CNN poll released on Tuesday, 51% of Americans say they would receive a vaccine once one becomes available. Seven former FDA commissioners last week penned a Washington Post article in which they attacked the Trump administration for âundermining the credibilityâ of the regulatory agency. Meanwhile, Democratic candidate Joe Biden has warned of a vaccine being released too early and before it can be properly studied. The position has led Republicans to attack him as ""anti-vax,"" - a term for people opposed to vaccinations. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The number of new Covid cases admitted to hospital hasjumped by a quarter in England in a day. There were 478 hospitalisations on Sunday, up from 386 the day before. It is the largest daily figure since early June. There were no admissions in Northern Ireland, while the data for Scotland is not yet available for Sunday - and Wales counts cases differently. There are now nearly 2,800 patients in hospital in England with Covid. At the peak, it topped 17,000. Orthodox Jews in New York City have been violating social distancing protocols New York is forcing hundreds of schools in Queens and Brooklyn to shut for in-person teaching amid persistently high positive rates in nine neighbourhoods with large populations of Orthodox Jews. The city's mayor had asked the governor for permission to close non-essential businesses as well, but he declined. According to the local media, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo have a longstanding political feud. On Monday, Cuomo threatened: ""I have to say to the Orthodox community tomorrow, if you're not willing to live with these rules, then I'm going to close the synagogues."" The order affects about 200 private schools and 100 public schools for two weeks. It represents the first major reversal to the city's rollback of virus mitigation measures. The UK coronavirus death figure is a sharp increase from Monday - when there were 19 deaths recorded, and 12,594 new cases. And they come after a technical glitch which led to there being a high number of cases recorded over the weekend. It emerged that nearly 16,000 cases of coronavirus had gone unreported, delaying efforts to trace contacts of people who tested positive. Public Health England said 15,841 cases between 25 September and 2 October were left out of the UK daily case figures. They were then added to reach Saturday's figure of 12,872 new cases and Sunday's figure of 22,961. PHE said all those who tested positive had been informed. But it means others in close contact with them were not. Read more about the missing cases here. Workers sanitise the White House press briefing room Reporters have described the White House as a ""ghost town"" as many staff members have been told to work from home and journalists who were exposed to the infected press secretary isolate at home. Trump is back after a highly-choreographed helicopter arrival on Monday evening. He has vowed to return to the campaign trail soon, but has no official events on his public schedule today. He is considering making a nationally-televised address to the nation, according to reports, even as he continues to fight off illness caused by the coronavirus. Trump's doctors and outside experts say there is still a risk that his condition can reverse and worsen, as he is only about five days out from his positive diagnosis. He has downplayed his illness and the danger of the virus, comparing it on Tuesday to seasonal influenza, which experts say is far less lethal than Covid-19. That move has drawn criticism. Meanwhile, the Trump administration rejected an offer from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to contact trace the Supreme Court event at the White House Rose Garden which caused several Republicans to become infected.

The president, he says, ventured outside of the gates of the military hospital because he wanted âto show his supporters love for being out there"". Pio adds: âHe wouldnât have done it if he didnât really care about the people who are supporting him.â Neil Melton says Trump shows a 'winning spirit' even when ill Neil Melton, a construction-project manager who lives in Prairie Village, Kansas, says he appreciates the way Trump has been candid about his experience with coronavirus. âHeâs trying to be one-on-one with the American people, and heâs trying to show: âHey, Iâm just like you.âââ At the same time, says Melton, he likes to see the president project strength â such as when he walked to the top of a White House staircase and stood at a balcony and took off his mask. âPeople want to see that winning spirit,â says Melton. âThey donât want to live with this Covid lifestyle forever.â Melton adds: âHe wants to show some symbolism: âHey, we can come out of this.ââ Stevie Storck says Trump is not taking the virus seriously âAfter three days, he was saying: âYou donât need to be afraid of it,ââ says Stevie Storck of Windsor, Pennsylvania. She lives on a block with Trump signs (âMake Liberals Cry Againâ), and she says people in her community do not always follow public-health guidelines. People are sometimes cavalier about wearing masks in the post office and in shops, she says, and she is concerned they will be emboldened by the presidentâs actions. âThe misinformation he spread about the virus is a big danger to our community,â she says. âHeâs just furthering that attitude of not taking it seriously.â The World at OneBBC Radio 4 Issues with the England's contact tracing system have been reported since it started. And now, one volunteer has told the BBC what it's been like on the ground. Colin, a volunteer at the local authority centre in Calderdale, West Yorkshire, told The World at One: âCases are still coming through to us too slowly, it is often five or six days after they have been tested, which is too long.â He also said they are only speaking to those people the national system has failed to contact - meaning ""we are not able to build up a complete picture, but we can bring a knowledge of the local geography, the businesses that work here, and the way that the community works"". And Colin added: ""The problem is that the national system works on the basis of test results, so each positive test is treated as an isolated case, not collated into households. âIf you have got a household of maybe five people, three of whom have tested positive, each of those is going to get a phone call as a case in their own right.â This, he said, led to one family receiving 75 separate calls - and disconnecting their phones. Angelica CasasVideo journalist, BBC News Monica MuÃ±oz's father died three months ago from Covid-19 I first met Monica MuÃ±oz, who lost her father and grandfather to Covid-19, while reporting on how Latino-Americans have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Today she says she is not offended by Trump's Twitter advice this morning, advising people to ""learn to live"" with Covid-19 as they have with seasonal flu. ""Today marks three months since my dad passed away. People say that with time things get easier, but Iâm not there yet,"" she says from her home in Texas. ""I agree with President Trump that we cannot be afraid of Covid-19. Life does not stop because of risks. ""We know more about the virus now than we did in the past several months. We have a personal responsibility to take necessary precautions to care for ourselves and protect others. ""We have to continuously inform ourselves about the virus. My dad would always say:Ni modo, la vida sigue(Oh well, life goes on)."" Watch our original piece on Monica's family here: 'Weâre still waiting at home for them to come back' Doctors from three intensive-care units in the Czech Republic have issued an emotional appeal to protect life from Covid-19 to âwin this warâ. A Czech hospital shared the message of doctors Hynek BartoÅ¡, JiÅÃ­ Sagan and AleÅ¡ Chrdle in a social media post on Tuesday. In it, the doctors expressed dismay at the recent resurgence of the virus, which âhas returned with even greater potency than beforeâ. âWe don't want to cause panic and horror, but you must listen to us,â the doctors wrote in the viral post. âOn our wards, we are fighting for the lives of people who - if they had not contracted the coronavirus - would have looked forward to another 10-20 years of quality life ahead of them.â The doctors added that experts, the government and citizens need to do more âif we want to win this warâ. To citizens, they asked for respect for âthe fact that Covid-19 is an insidious opponentâ, adding that âfrequent hand washing, masks and social distancing are the minimum you can do for yourself and others without major sacrificesâ. Coronavirus infections have been rising rapidly since the start of September in the Czech Republic. So far,the country has recorded 85,566 cases and 758 deaths,external. With the pandemic disrupting education for young people around the world, students at the University of Vienna have been given an unusual option to revise. From this week, they are able to study in one of the city's biggest churches, the Votivkirche. The Austrian Catholic Press Agency reported last week that the university had agreed to rent the church when it's not being used for religious services, offering students ""a quiet place to study and stay between courses"". While the location might not be what students are used to, the church has wifi, heaters and toilets. We've heard today how daily hospital admissions are rising in the UK. Here are graphics showing the latest picture. Mark Milley oversees the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Top US General Mark Milley, who oversees the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is in quarantineafter a military aide to President Trump tested positive for the coronavirus. Several other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which runs the US military branches, are also self-isolating and working from home. One of the five military aides that travels with the president - (itâs their job to carry the suitcase containing the nuclear launch codes known as âthe footballâ) - tested positive earlier today. The newly infected military aide is reportedly a member of the Coast Guard. The Vice Commandant of the US Coast Guard, Admiral Charles Ray tested positive, according to a statement released today. Over the weekend, one of Trumpâs military valets also tested positive, US media reported on Tuesday. Also on Tuesday, the Washington Post confirmed New York Times reports that said White House housekeeping staff who tested positive for the virus weeks ago were told to use ""discretion"" when publicly discussing their diagnosis. Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News A group of 400 freelance musicians has played outside Parliament to highlight the plight of the music industry during the pandemic. Violinists Nicola Benedetti and Tasmin Little were among the performers who played a short segment of Mars, from Holst's The Planets, in central London. They then held a two-minute silence, to put pressure on the government to give more support to self-employed artists. There was also a protest outside Birmingham's Symphony Hall. The events were organised by the Musicians Union, which represents more than 32,000 performers in the UK. It says 70% of its members have lost more than three-quarters of their regular work during the lockdown, leaving many in financial hardship. Freelance musicians, who make up 72% of the sector, are particularly affected. Almost half of them are not eligible for grants under the government's current self-employed income support scheme, the union says. Read more here. President Trump has been criticised for saying Americans should not fear Covid-19 President Trump was discharged from hospital on Monday night, allowing him to return to the White House in typically theatrical style. The president will continue his recovery there. Here are some of the key moments in Trumpâs illness so far: Friday: Saturday: Sunday: Monday: Monday evening: Tuesday: President Trump met with his team of doctors at the White House earlier today, according to a statement. ""He had a restful first night at home, and today he reports no symptoms,"" wrote Dr Sean Conley. His vital signs are stable, the doctor continued, adding that ""overall he continues to do extremely well"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has refused to back his deputy's call for Matt Hancock to ""consider his position"". Instead, he says the health secretary needs to ""get on with the job"". Deputy party leader Angela Rayner had been expressing ""frustration"" when she called on Mr Hancock to quit, said Sir Keir. ""I think Angela was probably expressing a frustration that is deeply felt across the country,"" he told reporters. ""What I want is for the government to concentrate on the job in hand and for Matt Hancock and others to get on and deliver what they are promising."" Sir Keir also spoke about the test and trace scheme - see his comments in this video. This video can not be played Keir Starmer on coronavirus testing and tracing plans He said the prime minister should give a ""frank acknowledgement there are real problems"" with the governmentâs approach to dealing with coronavirus, claiming the testing regime âjust isnât workingâ. Facebook said the post breached its rules on misinformation Facebook has removed one of President Trumpâs postsfor breaching its rules on coronavirus misinformation. In the post, President Trump falsely claimed that Covid-19 is less deadly than the seasonal flu. âWe remove incorrect information about the severity of Covid-19, and have now removed this post,âa Facebook spokesperson told CNBC,external. Trump has routinely played down the threat of the virus, telling Americans on Monday they had nothing to fear, after he spent time in hospital with Covid-19. The president shared a similar post about the flu to his Twitter account on Tuesday. The tweet remains accessible, but Twitter has flagged it for violating its rules about âspreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to Covid-19â. Experts say the mortality rate of Covid-19 it is thought to be far higher than that of most strains of the flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates,externalthat 22,000 people in the US died from the flu during the last flu season from late 2019 into 2020. By comparison, the coronavirus outbreak in the US has killed more than 210,000 people so far this year alone,data from Johns Hopkins University shows,external. The White House shot down a proposed rule from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that would have required vaccines be tested on patients for at least two months before they can be approved for public use. The rule would have effectively made it impossible for a vaccine to hit the market before the 3 November presidential election. Trump has said a vaccine could be released any day now, and that it could be available before election day. Polls show that growing numbers of Americans fear that a vaccine may be released too early under less-stringent ""emergency use authorisation"" and will not be deemed safe by medical experts. According to a CNN poll released on Tuesday, 51% of Americans say they would receive a vaccine once one becomes available. Seven former FDA commissioners last week penned a Washington Post article in which they attacked the Trump administration for âundermining the credibilityâ of the regulatory agency. Meanwhile, Democratic candidate Joe Biden has warned of a vaccine being released too early and before it can be properly studied. The position has led Republicans to attack him as ""anti-vax,"" - a term for people opposed to vaccinations. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The number of new Covid cases admitted to hospital hasjumped by a quarter in England in a day. There were 478 hospitalisations on Sunday, up from 386 the day before. It is the largest daily figure since early June. There were no admissions in Northern Ireland, while the data for Scotland is not yet available for Sunday - and Wales counts cases differently. There are now nearly 2,800 patients in hospital in England with Covid. At the peak, it topped 17,000. Orthodox Jews in New York City have been violating social distancing protocols New York is forcing hundreds of schools in Queens and Brooklyn to shut for in-person teaching amid persistently high positive rates in nine neighbourhoods with large populations of Orthodox Jews. The city's mayor had asked the governor for permission to close non-essential businesses as well, but he declined. According to the local media, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo have a longstanding political feud. On Monday, Cuomo threatened: ""I have to say to the Orthodox community tomorrow, if you're not willing to live with these rules, then I'm going to close the synagogues."" The order affects about 200 private schools and 100 public schools for two weeks. It represents the first major reversal to the city's rollback of virus mitigation measures. The UK coronavirus death figure is a sharp increase from Monday - when there were 19 deaths recorded, and 12,594 new cases. And they come after a technical glitch which led to there being a high number of cases recorded over the weekend. It emerged that nearly 16,000 cases of coronavirus had gone unreported, delaying efforts to trace contacts of people who tested positive. Public Health England said 15,841 cases between 25 September and 2 October were left out of the UK daily case figures. They were then added to reach Saturday's figure of 12,872 new cases and Sunday's figure of 22,961. PHE said all those who tested positive had been informed. But it means others in close contact with them were not. Read more about the missing cases here. Workers sanitise the White House press briefing room Reporters have described the White House as a ""ghost town"" as many staff members have been told to work from home and journalists who were exposed to the infected press secretary isolate at home. Trump is back after a highly-choreographed helicopter arrival on Monday evening. He has vowed to return to the campaign trail soon, but has no official events on his public schedule today. He is considering making a nationally-televised address to the nation, according to reports, even as he continues to fight off illness caused by the coronavirus. Trump's doctors and outside experts say there is still a risk that his condition can reverse and worsen, as he is only about five days out from his positive diagnosis. He has downplayed his illness and the danger of the virus, comparing it on Tuesday to seasonal influenza, which experts say is far less lethal than Covid-19. That move has drawn criticism. Meanwhile, the Trump administration rejected an offer from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to contact trace the Supreme Court event at the White House Rose Garden which caused several Republicans to become infected.

"Recent visualisation of a black hole by Nasa Three scientists have been awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics for work to understand black holes. Sir Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez were announced as this year's winners at a news conference in Stockholm. The winners will share the prize money of 10 million krona (Â£864,200). David Haviland, chair of the physics prize committee, said this year's award ""celebrates one of the most exotic objects in the Universe"". Black holes are regions of space where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape from them. UK-born mathematical physicist Sir Roger, from the University of Oxford, demonstrated that black holes were an inevitable consequence of Albert's Einstein's general theory of relativity. Reacting to the win, he told the BBC: ""It was an extreme honour and great pleasure to hear the news this morning, in a slightly unusual way - I had to get out of my shower to hear it."" Among scientific awards, he said, this is ""the prime one"". Sir Roger Penrose: The man who proved black holes weren't 'impossible' Listen to the BBC's Life Scientific: Sir Roger Penrose Hepatitis C discovery wins the Nobel Prize History-making black hole seen to do a shimmy L-R: Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel, Andrea Ghez Penrose receives half of this year's prize, with the other half being shared by Genzel and Ghez. Prof Ghez is only the fourth woman to win the physics prize, out of more than 200 laureates since 1901. The other female recipients are Marie Curie (1903), Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963) and Donna Strickland (2018). ""The history of black holes goes way back in time to the end of the 18th Century. Then, through Einstein's general relativity, we had the tools to describe these objects for real,"" said Ulf Danielsson, a member of the Nobel Committee. But the mathematics of black holes was incredibly complex. Many researchers believed they were nothing more than mathematical artefacts, existing only on paper. It took researchers decades to realise they could persist in the real world. ""That's what Roger Penrose did,"" said Danielsson. ""He understood the mathematics, he introduced new tools and then could actually prove this is a process you can naturally expect to happen - that a star collapses and turns into a black hole."" Sir Roger explained: ""People were very sceptical at the time, it took a long time before black holes were accepted... their importance is, I think, only partially appreciated."" Sir Roger showed that black holes always hide a singularity - a boundary where space and time ends Penrose was born in 1931 in Colchester and comes from a distinguished scientific family. He is the son of the psychiatrist and geneticist Lionel Penrose and Margaret Leathes, who was the daughter of a well-known English physiologist. His brother Jonathan is a chess grandmaster. Sir Roger shied away from competition as a child and struggled in exams. He toldBBC Radio 4's The Life Scientific programmein 2016: ""I was good at maths, but I didn't necessarily do very well in my tests."" However, he added: ""The teacher realised if he gave me enough time, I would do well. ""I think I had to do all my arithmetic working it out from first principles,"" he chuckled, adding: ""I just was slow, and I'm slow at writing."" In the 1950s, he came up with the Penrose triangle, an impossible object which could be depicted in a perspective drawing but could not exist in reality. The triangle, along with other observations by Sir Roger and his father Lionel, influenced the Dutch artist MC Escher, who incorporated them into his artworks Waterfall, and Ascending and Descending. Inspired by the British scientist Dennis Sciama, Penrose next applied his mathematical ability to physics. In 1965, he published a landmark paper in which he was able to show that a black hole always hides a singularity, a boundary where space and time ends. A black hole,externalis a region of space where matter has collapsed in on itself The gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape Black holes will emerge from the explosive demise of certain large stars But some are truly gargantuan, billions of times the mass of our Sun How these monsters - found at galaxy centres - formed is unknown Black holes are detected from the way they influence their surroundings The mathematical concept of ""trapped surfaces,"" was crucial to this giant leap in understanding. A trapped surface forces all rays to point towards a centre, regardless of whether the surface curves outwards or inwards. Once matter begins to collapse, as in the formation of a black hole, and a trapped surface forms, nothing can stop the process from continuing. Similarly, all matter crosses a black hole's event horizon in one direction, with everything carried towards an inescapable end at the singularity. Sir Roger held a lectureship at Birkbeck College (now Birkbeck, University of London) at the time of the breakthrough, and it was on the way to his workplace that he had a moment of inspiration. It occurred as he was in conversation with the physicist Ivor Robinson. The pair crossed a road and an image popped into Sir Roger's head of the trapped surfaces. He told the BBC: ""Maybe it was having myself be a bit distracted from [the black hole problem] which led to me thinking about it in a different way."" Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez provided the most convincing evidence yet of a supermassive black hole at the centre of our galaxy - the Milky Way. At the announcement of this year's recipients, Ulf Danielsson demonstrates the concept of a black hole using a ball They found that this huge object, known as Sagittarius A*, was tugging on the jumble of stars orbiting it. American Prof Ghez, from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), said: ""I'm thrilled to receive the prize and I take very seriously the responsibility of being the fourth woman to win the Nobel prize [in physics]."" For more than 50 years, physicists had suspected that there may be a black hole at the centre of the Milky Way. But the technology had to catch up before this idea could be demonstrated. In the 1990s, Prof Genzel, from the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany, and Ghez started using the world's largest telescopes to see through huge clouds of interstellar gas and dust to the centre of the Milky Way. They stretched the limits of technology, having to develop new techniques to compensate for distortions to their observations caused by the Earth's atmosphere. In 1988, Sir Roger was awarded the prestigious Wolf Prize in physics along with Stephen Hawking for the Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems, an attempt to answer the question of when singularities are produced.

An exact mortality rate for Covid-19 is not known, but it is thought to be substantially higher - possible 10 times or more - than most flu strains,according to Johns Hopkins University,external. The Presidenthas reacted by posting,external: ""REPEAL SECTION 230!!!"" This is a reference to a law that says social networks are not responsible for the content posted by their users. But it allows the firms to engage in ""good-Samaritan blocking"", including the removal of content they judge to be offensive, harassment or violent. If the law were to be repealed, social media companies would face being sued over the edits and changes of user content they made. This is the second time that Facebook has deleted a post from the president. Twitter has intervened more often with deletions and warnings. Users do not see Trump's tweet in his timeline unless they click on the View link Both social networks have vowed to combat potentially dangerous misinformation around the virus. But Mr Trump has taken issue with what he sees as editorialising by the companies. Shortly after Twitter put a warning label on his posts for the first time in May, Mr Trump signed an executive order to repeal Section 230. The proposal has attracted cross-party support - but for different reasons. The Republicans say there is a bias against or even outright censorship of conservative views online and want this to stop. The Democrats say they are more interested in the spread of misinformation. Last week,the US Senate Commerce Committee issued subpoenas for the heads of Facebook, Twitter and Googleto probe the matter further. Pressure has been mounting on Facebook and Twitter to do more to tackle misinformation both about the pandemic and the US election. For that reason, their decisive action on Trump's recent post promoting false claims about the severity of coronavirus will be welcomed. That said, Trump's comments about the flu - and those yesterday saying ""Don't be afraid of Covid"" - have already started to fuel conspiracy theories online. Posts in pro-Trump and anti-mask Facebook groups have shared the comments with captions about the pandemic not being real, or not very serious. They have also used it to encourage others not to follow health guidance like wearing a mask or social distancing. Early on in the pandemic, the BBC investigated the human cost of misinformation, including those who fell seriously ill because social media posts led them to doubt the reality or severity of the pandemic and ignore advice. The hope will be that this action from social media sites could reduce the risk of that happening - but those who may have already been exposed to this disinformation could be impacted. And all eyes will be on social media sites to see if they keep up this approach to tackling disinformation - coronavirus, political or otherwise - especially from the US Election candidates as polling day nears.

"The age at which most people start to receive the state pension has now officially hit 66 after steady rises in the qualifying age in recent years. Men and women born between 6 October, 1954, and 5 April, 1960, will start receiving their pension on their 66th birthday. For those born after that, there will be a phased increase in state pension age to 67, and eventually 68. It comes as the chancellor vowed the ""triple lock"" pledge is safe. Use the government's calculator to find out your state pension age,external Under this pledge, the state pension increases each year in line with the highest of average earnings, prices (as measured by inflation) or 2.5%. Coronavirus and the furlough scheme is set to distort the calculations for average wages and could mean one bumper year of pension increases. This has ledMPs and economists to discuss how this could be smoothed out. But, when asked by LBC radio whether the triple lock was safe, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Yes, our manifesto commitments are there and that is very much the legislative position. ""We care very much about pensioners and making sure they have security and that's indeed our policy."" The full state pension for new recipients is worth Â£175.20 a week. To receive the full amount, various criteria including 35 qualifying years of national insurance must be satisfied. The age at which people receive the state pension has been increasing as people live longer, and the government has plans for theincrease to 68 to be brought forward. However, the increases have been controversial, particularly for women who have seen the most significant rise. Campaigners took their fight to court Campaigners claim women born in the 1950s have been treated unfairly by rapid changes and the way they were communicated to those affected. Some of those involved in the campaignrecently lost a legal challenge, claiming the move was unlawful discrimination. The coronavirus crisis has led many people to reconsider retirement plans, especially those who feel they are more at risk from the outbreak. Former pensions minister Ros Altmann argued that the crisis meant there was a ""strong case"" for people to be given early access to their state pension, even if it were at a reduced rate. She also pointed out the large differences in life expectancy in different areas of the UK. Millions of people who will rely on their state pension in retirement need to know two things: how much will they receive, and when. The future for both is not entirely clear. Firstly, the age at which the state pension begins has been rising, and will continue to do so. MPs will decide on how quickly this happens, fully aware of the strength of feeling from the WASPI (Women Against State Pension Inequality) campaign over how this has been handled in the past. Secondly, there is always plenty of debate over the future of the triple lock - the pledge to ensure the state pension rises by a minimum of 2.5% each year. And if young workers think this has nothing to do with them, they should think again. How long we work before we receive state financial support in retirement is a vital issue for long-term financial planning. Younger workers have also been urged by pension providers to consider their retirement options, with a strong likelihood of state pension age rising further as time passes. ""As people live longer, it's clear many will also have to work for longer,"" said Pete Glancy, head of policy at Scottish Widows. ""The increase to the state pension age provides a timely reminder to everyone to check your pension pots and ask yourself whether the savings you've built up are enough for the kind of life you want in retirement."" Tom Selby, senior analyst at AJ Bell, said: ""As average life expectancy continues to increase, the state pension age will inevitably follow suit. ""This means younger savers probably need to plan assuming they might not reach their state pension age until 70 or even beyond. Anyone who aspires to more than the bare minimum in retirement needs to take responsibility as early as possible to build their own retirement pot.""

"The inquiry's chair, Prof Alexis Jay, also led investigations into child abuse in Rotherham The Church of England failed to protect children from sexual abuse, and created a culture where abusers ""could hide"", a report has concluded. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuse's report,externalsays the Church's failure to respond consistently to abuse victims added to their trauma. It added that alleged perpetrators were often given more support than victims. The Church said it felt ""shame"" over the failings detailed in the ""shocking"" report. The report, which is the latest in a series of publications from the IICSA, said 390 clergy members and other church leaders were convicted of abuse between the 1940s and 2018. The Church defended alleged perpetrators instead of protecting children and young people from sexual predators, the report added. It cited the example of the late cathedral dean, Robert Waddington, about whomserious allegations were made in 1999. The then Archbishop of York said there was ""simply no possibility"" of the claims being correct. It also cited Reverend Ian Hughes, from Merseyside,who was convicted in 2014 for downloading 8,000 indecent images of children. His offending was played down by a senior colleague. The report also found examples of clergymen being ordained despite a history of child sexual offences. The inquiry said the Church did not take allegations seriously and neglected the ""physical, emotional and spiritual wellbeing of children and young people in favour of protecting its reputation"" - which was in direct conflict with its mission ""of love and care for the innocent and the vulnerable"". Several claims of historical abuse had been made about Robert Waddington before his death, from cancer, in 2007 In 2018 there were 2,504 safeguarding concerns reported to dioceses in England about either children or vulnerable adults. The IICSA's report is based on the inquiry's public hearings held in July 2019, and investigated safeguarding issues in the Church of England and the Church in Wales - each of which sit within the worldwide Anglican Communion. How the child sexual abuse inquiry works Bishop praises 'courageous' victims Vicar had 8,200 child abuse images The inquiry's chairwoman, Prof Alexis Jay, said: ""Over many decades, the Church of England failed to protect children and young people from sexual abusers, instead facilitating a culture where perpetrators could hide and victims faced barriers to disclosure that many could not overcome. ""Within the Church in Wales, there were simply not enough safeguarding officers to carry out the volume of work required of them. Record-keeping was found to be almost non-existent and of little use in trying to understand past safeguarding issues."" The report conceded there had been ""a number of important improvements"" in child protection practices in the Church of England in recent years, but Prof Jay added it was ""vital"" that the Church improved how it responded to allegations of child sexual abuse. Gilo, who was abused by a clergyman when he was young, says survivors are still angry with the Church One victim of abuse, who says he was raped by a clergyman in London more than 40 years ago, told the BBC it would take ""courage"" from the Church and its leaders to ""salvage itself and redeem itself"". Gilo - who asked us not to use his surname - previously told the BBC he had made more than 20 attempts to contact senior members of the Church after his decision to report the assaults, but often received no reply. The Church eventually agreed it was at fault and reached a financial settlement with him. On Tuesday, Gilo said many survivors still felt a ""tremendous sense of anger and lack of trust"" in the Church. Gilo, whose abuser has since died, said he believed the Church's recently-appointed lead safeguarding bishop, Reverend Dr Jonathan Gibbs, was keen to make a difference - but that ""there needs to be a real turnaround"" in the Church's culture. ""Once survivors see real help, and real support beginning to reach them from a Church that has mouthed support for a long time but not delivered it... there could be a turning point."" By Callum May, BBC News The explicit moral purpose of the Church is to teach right from wrong, this inquiry states in its conclusions. It failed and it is still failing. In 2018, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 449 concerns raised about recent child sexual abuse. A significant number of these involved the downloading or possession of indecent images of children. The Archbishops of Canterbury and York have said they will not make excuses, and offer their sincere and heartfelt apologies. The Church of England, they say, is ready to support anyone who comes forward and will honour its commitment to change. The independent inquiry's recommendations are likely to be endorsed in full by the House of Bishops, and put to its governing General Synod in November. This will probably lead to an extension of a pilot support scheme for a small number of survivors who are already receiving financial help. But survivors' groups say the inquiry's findings represent only the tip of an iceberg. Today's findings will prove a heavy cost for the Church. Home Secretary Priti Patel praised the strength and courage of victims and survivors and pledged to review the report before considering how to respond ""in due course"". The report made several recommendations, including: the Church of England should improve how it responds to safeguarding complaints - by, for example, reintroducing a rule to expel any member of the clergy found guilty of child sexual abuse offences responsibility for safeguarding should be taken out of the hands of diocesan bishops and given to safeguarding officers employed by the central hierarchy of the Church the Church of England and Church in Wales should share information about clergy who move between the two institutions both Churches should introduce policies for funding and support of survivors of child sexual abuse whose perpetrators had a connection to the Church Prof Jay said she hoped the report and its recommendations would help to ""ensure these failures never happen again"". The Church of England said the report ""makes shocking reading"" and that the entire institution ""must learn lessons from this inquiry"". ""While apologies will never take away the effects of abuse on victims and survivors, we today want to express our shame about the events that have made those apologies necessary,"" said Dr Gibbs, the Church's lead safeguarding bishop, and Melissa Caslake, the Church's national director of safeguarding. In a joint statement, the pair said there had been some improvements to safeguarding in the Church in recent years, but added: ""We wholeheartedly regret that in some areas, most importantly support for victims and survivors, progress has been too slow."" They said the Church endorsed and was ""completely committed"" to the report's recommendations for improving such support. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) in England and Wales is investigating claims against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces and public and private institutions - as well as people in the public eye. Following the death of BBC presenter Jimmy Savile in 2011, hundreds of people came forward to say he had abused them as children. The spotlight has also fallen on sexual assaults carried out in schools, children's homes and at NHS sites. At the same time, there have been claims of past failures by police and prosecutors to properly investigate allegations. The IICSA was established in 2015, with the then Home Secretary Theresa May saying it would ""expose those failures and learn the lessons"" from the past. In 2018 the inquiry published aninterim report,externalwith 18 recommendations - some of which have been acted upon.

The banking giant said in a statement: ""We are sorry for any offence caused."" The New York Times said,externallast November's Studio 54-themed party also included chairman Urs Rohner's friends dancing on stage wearing afro wigs. Mr Thiam revived the bank's fortunes but was ousted this year. He left in February after it emerged that two former employees of the bank had been put under surveillance, although Mr Thiam denied knowledge of the operations. Credit Suisse stressed that the birthday party was neither organised by the company nor its chairman, Mr Rohner. The bank stressed its commitment to diversity, saying it had put in place ""a number of initiatives to improve ethnic diversity across the bank"". It said it had signed up to the UK's Business in the Community Race at Work Charter, which requires firms to adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards racial harassment or bullying, and in the US it has a programme to hire, retain and advance black talent. ""Credit Suisse is strongly committed to equality, diversity and supporting all our employees,"" the investment bank said. ""As a company, we are proud to be a geographically and culturally diverse group, and we strive to further strengthen this culture, which supports all our colleagues."" The Guardian reported that a friend,externalof Mr Thiam said the former executive had not received a personal apology. Mr Thiam could not be reached for comment. Mr Thiam, who ran Credit Suisse between 2015 and February this year, has had an illustrious and varied career. The French Ivorian studied in France and worked in management consultancy before serving as Ivory Coast's Minister of Planning and Development, until a military coup led to him being placed under house arrest. He later became boss of financial services firms Aviva Europe and Prudential before joining Credit Suisse five years ago. In doing so he became the only black executive at the top of a major global bank. Mr Thiam, who also holds French citizenship, has appeared on Desert Island Discs as the first ever black chief executive of a top 100 UK company. He is on record saying he was heavily courted for his role at Credit Suisse and had strong backing from Mr Rohner. That backing was withdrawn along with that of the rest of the board after the spying scandal, although some leading shareholders retained their support.

"Boris Johnson has announced new investment in offshore wind energy Mr Johnson was addressing the final day of the Conservative party's annual conference The PM vowed to defeat coronavirus and 'build back better' over the next decade Mr Johnson said the UK will become ""the world leader in clean wind energy"" Speaking of his own brush with the virus, Boris Johnson said it was ""drivel"" that he had ""lost his mojo"" He said the pandemic would be a ""catalyst"" for major change in the UK Kate Whannel, Paul Seddon and Richard Morris BBC Politics Thanks for following the PM's speech along with us here today. We'll be back tomorrow for our weekly coverage of prime minister's questions. Hope to see you then. Boris Johnson has finished his online speech to the Conservative party conference. Here's what you missed: Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent This was a virtual conference speech in which the prime minister's gaze extended over the horizon -- to the point when our national conversation is no longer dominated by Coronavirus. It was clearly an attempt to reassure Conservative MPs and activists that the Boris Johnson they elected as their leader, and the country enthusiastically embraced as prime minister at the last election, hadn't disappeared. So there were the colourful turns of phrase, the sentences that would have generated laughter in the hall, the reassurance he had fully recovered from his bout of the virus. And then it was the big picture: the agenda, alongside delivering Brexit, that delivered that thumping majority back in December last year. So: talk of enterprise, talk of home ownership, a green tinged economic recovery. Was there less in this than a conventional conference speech? Yes: it was shorter, there was no audience, no razzmatazz. It was also delivered in the teeth of a pandemic, with a grim autumn and winter beckoning - where the government, like the rest of us, remain hostages to the fortune, or lack of it, of what the pandemic might bring.

Vicki YoungDeputy Political Editor He was obviously speaking to his Conservative audience - offering them a reassurance that he doesn't want to be closing pubs early and putting restrictions on peoples' lives. And he was making the point that the type of state intervention we've seen during the pandemic is not going to be forever. It is also interesting that he has a very optimistic message. But there is an awful lot to fix. Lots of people are still focused on what is happening with coronavirus now. Seeing the problems that have happened - do people trust his government to deliver these very ambitious things. Responding to Mr Johnson's speech, deputy Labour leader Angela
Rayner says: ""The
British people needed to hear the prime minister set out how he and his
government will get a grip of the crisis. ""Instead we got the usual bluster and
no plan for the months ahead. âWe end this
Conservative conference as we started it: with a shambolic testing system,
millions of jobs at risk and an incompetent government that has lost control of
this virus and is holding Britain back.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Coming to the end of his speech Boris Johnson acknowledges that times are tough but adds ""it is a measure of the greatness of this country that we are simply not going to let it hold us back or slow us down."" ""Even in the darkest moments we can see the bright future ahead. ""And we can see how to build it and we will build it together."" And with that he leaves the podium. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent A de-rigueur chunk of any leader's speech at a party conference is the big principles thing, what we stand for compared to the other lot. It reminds the audience in the hall why they were drawn to the party in the first place, and reassures them those at the top believe the same stuff they do, whatever the pressures of leadership, government or budgets. So the Prime Minister talks of the importance of enterprise, the desire for home ownership, a pride in British history, his commitment to keeping the United Kingdom together: big picture Conservative values, in contrast to Labour and the Scottish National Party.  Boris Johnson accuses the Labour Party of wanting ""to edit our national CV to make it more politically correct"". He says the Conservative Party ""believe passionately"" in the UK, and says Labour ""flirt with those who want to tear our country apart"". He accuses Labour of wanting to try and take the UK back into the EU, and he says the party has ""sniped from the sidelines"" during the pandemic. He says that he hopes people arriving in the country in 2030 will arrive on British made zero carbon jets, and rent clean energy powered electric vehicles. He adds that in 2030, the UK will be a country which is more united, outside of the EU. He says it should be a country where people are ""embraced"" no matter what their race, gender or orientation. Reality Check The
prime minister confirmed his partyâs manifesto pledge to increase the UKâs
capacity to produce energy from offshore wind to 40GW by 2030. Thatâs
a big increase â last year the UK capacity from offshore windwas just under 10GW,external He
also wants to increase the amount of the wind turbines that are made in the UK. The
most recent figures on this come from the industry association Renewables UK,
which said in a 2017 report that48% of the content was made domestically.,external Mr Johnson now turns to housing. He says it is a ""disgraceful truth"" that home ownership levels among younger people has plummeted. ""Millions of people are forced to pay through the nose for a home they can't truly love,"" he says. He promises to change the planning system but also says first time buyers will be able to take out a long-term fixed-rate mortgages of up to 95% of the value of the home. He says it will be the biggest expansion of home ownership since 1980s and promises to turn ""generation rent into generation buy"". He then accuses Labour of disliking home ownership. Mr Johnson cautions against ""drawing the wrong conclusions"" from the pandemic, and relying permanently on the ""uncle sugar"" of the taxpayer. He says it was ""the private sector"" that stepped in to manufacturer things like masks during the early days of the crisis. He says the expansion of the state seen this year would only be expected in ""times of war or disaster"". He says the government has been ""forced"" into ""erosions of liberty"" that would not normally be the case. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Johnson now moves on to his pre-trailed announcement about investment in wind farms. He urges the audience to imagine a future of ""green collar jobs in wind, solar nuclear, hydrogen and carbon capture storage"". ""With help of basic natural phenomena we will build back greener,"" he promises. ""This government will lead this green industrial revolution."" ""It is in crises like this that new approaches evolve,"" the prime minister says. ""Last week we grasped a nettle... and broke down barrier between further education and higher education,"" he says referring to government moves to make it easier for people to accessfunding for further education courses. He goes on to say that ""the Covid crisis is a catalyst for change"" adding ""we need to give people the chance to train for the new jobs that are being created every day."" Boris Johnson says the government is ""pressing on with its plan for 48 hospitals"" between now and 2030. He says the government needs to ""get on"" with hiring 40,000 more nurses, and states there are 14,000 more nurses under the current government in the past year. He says the UK needs to ""care for the carers, as they care for us"". The government has recruited 5,000 of the additional 20,000 police officers they want on the streets, he adds. He says he and the Home Secretary believe the UK justice system is ""hamstrung"" by ""lefty do-gooders"" meaning that justice cannot always be served. The government wants to look at more ""one to one teaching"" for those who are falling behind, and those who have extra abilities, he adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Britain has gone through âtoo much frustration and hardship just to settle for the status quoâ says Boris Johnson. Boris Johnson has vowed to defeat Covid and build a better country over the next decade in his leader's speech to the virtual Conservative conference. Evoking the UK's recovery from World War Two, he said he wanted to build a ""new Jerusalem"", with opportunity for all, improved housing and healthcare. He warned the UK could not return to normal after the pandemic, which would be a ""catalyst"" for major change. And he rejected suggestions he had ""lost his mojo"" as ""drivel"". In his speech, delivered without the usual conference audience, he said he wanted to see the back of coronavirus and the ""erosion of liberties"" it had led to and to see the country flourishing again. He said: ""Even in the darkest moments we can see the bright future ahead. And we can see how to build it and we will build it together."" Wind farms could power every home by 2030 - PM The week Boris Johnson turned green, or did he? The PM praised the UK's fight against the virus, saying he had had ""more than enough"" of the disease - which he insisted would be overcome by ""collective effort"". He insisted the pandemic could not be allowed to ""hold us back or slow us down"" and the country that emerged from the crisis would be very different from the one that preceded it. Insisting that ""we will not content ourselves with a repair job"" after the pandemic, he said the government would: Make the UK a ""world leader"" in green energy, announcing Â£160m of investment in ports and factories to increase electricity generation from offshore wind ""Fix the injustice"" of care home funding, adding the crisis had ""shone a spotlight"" on the plight of the sector Boost housebuilding through changes to England's ""sclerotic"" planning system, and improving access to low-deposit mortgages for first-time buyers Explore greater provision of one-to-one teaching for pupils who had fallen behind during the pandemic, or those of ""exceptional abilities"". The PM said wind power could generate enough electricity to power every UK home by 2030 Mr Johnson said the pandemic had ""forced"" the government into massively expanding the role of the state, but warned against drawing the ""wrong economic conclusion from this crisis"". He said for Conservatives, the increased bail-outs and subsidies to prop up the economy ""go against our instincts,"" but there was ""simply no reasonable alternative"". ""There are many who regard this state expansion as progress, who want to keep the state supporting furlough forever, keep people in suspended animation,"" he said. ""We Conservatives believe that way lies disaster, and that we must build back better by becoming more competitive, both in tax and regulation."" Pledging to rebuild the dream of home ownership for the young, he vowed to help get more 20 to 30-year-olds on the housing ladder by offering fixed-rate mortgages available to those with just 5% deposits. He added: ""In the depths of the Second World War, in 1942 when just about everything had gone wrong, the government sketched out a vision of the post-war new Jerusalem that they wanted to build. ""And that is what we are doing now - in the teeth of this pandemic. ""We are resolving not to go back to 2019, but to do better: to reform our system of government; to renew our infrastructure; to spread opportunity more widely and fairly and to create the conditions for a dynamic recovery that is led not by the state but by free enterprise."" Although the current situation is about as far from standard as anything in recent history, the PM's conference speech was, well, rather standard. It was a familiar Johnson cocktail: the kind of gags you might hear during an after-dinner speech, and the political message we have heard from him already on several big set-piece occasions. Namely, that the government was fighting a war against this disease but it will be vanquished, and he will lead the country to a happier peace. His speech was not short of ambition - including promises on everything from green jobs, to education, productivity, housing, even to planting trees. It was though short on detail of how the country will make it to his ""New Jerusalem"", and how his promises would actually be made to happen. Does that matter? While conference speeches are often a big shop window for leaders to talk to the country, it felt today that the prime minister didn't really take that opportunity. Instead, perhaps to try to calm activists' nerves, he pointed out that he was uncomfortable with the expansion of the state to deal with Covid-19, still a believer in traditional Tory values, and even claimed it was ""seditious"" to suggest that he had lost some of his normal mojo. Read more from Laura Mr Johnson also addressed those who have criticised his leadership during the pandemic, saying it was wrong to suggest he has not fully recovered from his battle with the disease, which saw him hospitalised for a week. ""I have read a lot of nonsense recently, about how my own bout of Covid has somehow robbed me of my mojo. ""And of course this is self-evident drivel, the kind of seditious propaganda that you would expect from people who don't want this government to succeed, who wanted to stop us delivering Brexit and all our other manifesto pledges."" He attacked Labour's response during the crisis, labelling its leader Sir Keir Starmer as ""Captain Hindsight"", and suggesting the opposition saw the crisis as an opportunity to make the huge extension of the reach of the state a permanent feature of British life. Angela Rayner, deputy leader of the Labour Party, said the prime minister had not set out a plan for the months ahead. She said: ""We end this Conservative conference as we started it: with a shambolic testing system, millions of jobs at risk and an incompetent government that has lost control of this virus and is holding Britain back.""

"Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson star in Dune Denis Villeneuve's Dune is the latest Hollywood blockbuster to have its release date delayed. The Warner Bros sci-fi epic featuring a star-studded cast including Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya was due for release in December. The premiere has now been pushed back to October 2021,according to Variety.,external Warner Bros has also delayed The Batman,external, now due in March 2022, but the company has brought forward Matrix 4 to December 2021. The Batman, starring Robert Pattinson, was set for release on 1 October 2021, so would have clashed with the new release date for Dune. Robert Pattinson plays the Gotham City superhero The Matrix 4 was originally due out in May this year but was postponed to April 2022. It's now coming just over three months earlier, taking the slot intended for Black Adam, the DC Comics movie starring Dwayne Johnson. That film has been taken off the schedule altogether, as has Minecraft: The Movie, which was due to open in March next year. Moving The Matrix 4 to December next year will also allow The Batman to hold the blockbuster limelight the following spring. The Keanu Reeves action/sci-fi franchise is also thought to have completed most of its shooting before the coronavirus pandemic shut down much of the world's movie production, including The Batman. The Matrix's next outing has been brought forward The Batman re-started principal photography at the start of September but had to shut down again when a member of the production team tested positive for Covid-19. Some media outlets reported it wasRobert Pattinson, although that has never been confirmed. Hollywood studios have been deterred from putting out their major releases due to the pandemic but cinema chains had been banking on these films to draw back audiences. Cineworld has confirmed plans to temporarily close its theatres in the UK and US due to a lack of new releases. The Regal chain followed suit, while Odeon and Vue have shared their concerns over the situation. The Odeon will open a quarter of its cinemasonly at weekends. The changes announced by Odeon and Cineworld come after the release of the new James Bond film was delayed again. The premiere of No Time To Die had already been moved from April to November because of the pandemic. The film has now been further delayed until 2 April 2021""in order to be seen by a worldwide theatrical audience"", astatement on the film's website said,external. Robert Mitchell, director of theatrical insights at Gower Street Analytics, said: ""Bond was really the one that UK exhibitors were really relying on more than any."" The film's starDaniel Craig told Jimmy Fallon on the Tonight Show,externalthat ""this thing is just bigger than all of us"". ""We want to release the movie at the same time all around the world and this isn't the right time. So fingers crossed 2 April is going to be our date."" Meanwhile the British Film Institute (BFI) has said it is ""deeply concerned"" about the challenges facing the cinema industry. No Time to Die, starring Daniel Craig as James Bond, will now be released in 2021 Ben Roberts, the BFI's chief executive, warned the impact of the release date delays and closures would be felt across the whole sector. He added: ""The BFI will continue to work with the distribution and exhibition sector over this difficult time. ""However, many cinemas across the UK are still open and welcoming audiences. The government-backed Culture Recovery Fund is giving vital support to struggling independent cinemas in England.""

""We were delighted to start reopening our cinemas back in July, and are committed to keeping them open,"" said Mark Barlow, Showcase's UK general manager said. Film producer Rebecca O'Brien, known best for her collaborations with director Ken Loach, told Radio 4's Today programme she thought Cineworld's decision to close its screens and put at risk the jobs of 5,500 employees in the UK alone was a ""cynical"" move. ""They demonstrate here that they don't have the best duty of care to their employees and that they don't really care,"" she added.

Hollywood had hoped Christopher Nolan's blockbuster Tenet would entice customers back into cinemas after months of closures. Cineworld chief executive Mooky Greidinger said it had been ""very successful internationally and the movie will reach something like $300m gross in the international market... but I would say also the studios have their side of the story, the investment today of the movies is huge"". Mr Greidinger also pointed to the fact that cinemas in Los Angeles and New York, the two biggest movie-going markets in the US, remain largely closed due to the pandemic, putting studios off releasing films.

"Sue Taylor and Lola Mitchell haven't been able to travel because of coronavirus restrictions Train customers have expressed their anger at being unable to get refunds for tickets they can no longer use because of UK coronavirus restrictions. In some parts of the UK, people have been advised against all but essential travel after a spike in Covid-19 cases. However, passengers who bought advance tickets to travel to or from these areas are not entitled to refunds. The passenger watchdog said customers shouldn't be left ""out of pocket for doing the right thing"". Advance tickets are usually non-refundable, althoughthose restrictions were temporarily relaxed,externalwhen the UK went into a nationwide lockdown in March. UK train companies have been propped up during the pandemic by money from the government, which has set the advance ticket policy. The Department for Transport said it was focusing investment ""on maintaining services"" to ""ensure we are fair to taxpayers"". Rail franchises axed as help for train firms grows Passengers to be warned when trains are busy What's the risk on public transport? What are the Covid rules where you live? Lola Mitchell, 41, from Brighton, said it was ""unbelievable"" she hadn't been able to get a refund for her Â£106.50 tickets for a return journey from London to Newcastle. She was due to travel to the North East last month for a socially-distanced concert, which was cancelled whennew restrictions were introduced in Newcastleon 17 September. Those measures included advising people in the area to only use public transport for essential purposes. Lola cancelled her trip and has been trying to get her money back from LNER for her advance tickets, which are sold as non-refundable. She was offered the option of changing her date of travel for a Â£10 fee before her scheduled departure - but not a refund. The government-owned train company has told customers that the Department for Transport has told it that ""normal ticket restrictions are still to be upheld"" despite the local lockdowns. Lola said that the day before her planned travel date, LNER emailed her to ask her to consider whether making her journey was essential. ""What a wind-up, if they are not prepared to offer a refund,"" she said. Aaron, from London, had also planned a trip to Newcastle with his girlfriend. They were going to celebrate their first anniversary and had booked their train tickets ""months before the restrictions came in"" for the first weekend in October. He says he was ""shocked"" when LNER wouldn't refund his ""non-essential journey"", and instead told him to choose another time, for a Â£10 admin fee - although LNER currently only sells tickets up until November. That isn't an option for him, he says, because ""who knows if they'll be out of lockdown - and secondly I have no reason to travel to Newcastle any more"". Another rail customer, Sue Taylor, 46, who lives in Fulham in London, was planning on staying with friends in Glasgow. She had bought a Â£33 advance ticket with Avanti for the return journey to London at the end of October. Last monthindoor visits between householdswere banned, first in Glasgow, and then extended to the rest of Scotland, until further notice. The train companies will allow customers to change their advance tickets to a different day for a Â£10 administration fee, although Avanti has only released tickets until mid-December. Sue said she would settle for a credit note, or the ability to be able to change the date of the ticket without a charge. ""As it stands the only options I have are to either lose the ticket or pay another Â£10 to change, to a date of who knows when. So much uncertainty. ""Do I change it now for Â£10, only to have that date become unworkable and have to pay another Â£10 to change again? There's no winning for me."" She added: ""I do understand that the advance single ticket is, under normal circumstances, non-refundable, but we know nothing about the current situation is normal."" Another train company offering long-distance travel across the UK, CrossCountry Trains, doesn't charge the Â£10 admin fee - although that was a policy it introduced before the coronavirus outbreak. Anthony Smith, chief executive of independent passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said: ""Passengers no longer able to travel because of local lockdowns shouldn't be out of pocket for doing the right thing. ""If they are asked not to travel, it seems unfair that they will lose the money for pre-booked journeys. ""While the government continues to provide high levels of support to make sure the day to day railway keeps operating, advance tickets must be made more flexible or the railway will lose both custom and goodwill."" Taxpayer money was used to plug the shortfall in ticket revenues after passenger numbers fell during lockdown The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said the government initially offered refunds on advance tickets ""due to the exceptional circumstances the country faced"". A spokesman added: ""Significant taxpayer funding continues to help maintain rail services which is supporting the country's recovery from the pandemic and, after careful consideration, the government does not intend to allow refunds for non-refundable advance tickets."" Last month the Department for Transportextended emergency measuresto cover the losses of train firms by 18 months in England, while extra funding has also been provided inScotland,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland. A Department for Transport spokeswoman said the government took immediate action at the outbreak of the pandemic to support the rail industry and delivered ""refunds on all advance fares, as well as removing charges for cancellations"". She added: ""With fares revenue having fallen to less than 5% of pre-Covid levels, we must ensure we are fair to taxpayers and focus investment on maintaining services, to enable social distancing and support our economic recovery.""

"The inquiry's chair, Prof Alexis Jay, also led investigations into child abuse in Rotherham The Church of England failed to protect children from sexual abuse, and created a culture where abusers ""could hide"", a report has concluded. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuse's report,externalsays the Church's failure to respond consistently to abuse victims added to their trauma. It added that alleged perpetrators were often given more support than victims. The Church said it felt ""shame"" over the failings detailed in the ""shocking"" report. The report, which is the latest in a series of publications from the IICSA, said 390 clergy members and other church leaders were convicted of abuse between the 1940s and 2018. The Church defended alleged perpetrators instead of protecting children and young people from sexual predators, the report added. It cited the example of the late cathedral dean, Robert Waddington, about whomserious allegations were made in 1999. The then Archbishop of York said there was ""simply no possibility"" of the claims being correct. It also cited Reverend Ian Hughes, from Merseyside,who was convicted in 2014 for downloading 8,000 indecent images of children. His offending was played down by a senior colleague. The report also found examples of clergymen being ordained despite a history of child sexual offences. The inquiry said the Church did not take allegations seriously and neglected the ""physical, emotional and spiritual wellbeing of children and young people in favour of protecting its reputation"" - which was in direct conflict with its mission ""of love and care for the innocent and the vulnerable"". Several claims of historical abuse had been made about Robert Waddington before his death, from cancer, in 2007 In 2018 there were 2,504 safeguarding concerns reported to dioceses in England about either children or vulnerable adults. The IICSA's report is based on the inquiry's public hearings held in July 2019, and investigated safeguarding issues in the Church of England and the Church in Wales - each of which sit within the worldwide Anglican Communion. How the child sexual abuse inquiry works Bishop praises 'courageous' victims Vicar had 8,200 child abuse images The inquiry's chairwoman, Prof Alexis Jay, said: ""Over many decades, the Church of England failed to protect children and young people from sexual abusers, instead facilitating a culture where perpetrators could hide and victims faced barriers to disclosure that many could not overcome. ""Within the Church in Wales, there were simply not enough safeguarding officers to carry out the volume of work required of them. Record-keeping was found to be almost non-existent and of little use in trying to understand past safeguarding issues."" The report conceded there had been ""a number of important improvements"" in child protection practices in the Church of England in recent years, but Prof Jay added it was ""vital"" that the Church improved how it responded to allegations of child sexual abuse. Gilo, who was abused by a clergyman when he was young, says survivors are still angry with the Church One victim of abuse, who says he was raped by a clergyman in London more than 40 years ago, told the BBC it would take ""courage"" from the Church and its leaders to ""salvage itself and redeem itself"". Gilo - who asked us not to use his surname - previously told the BBC he had made more than 20 attempts to contact senior members of the Church after his decision to report the assaults, but often received no reply. The Church eventually agreed it was at fault and reached a financial settlement with him. On Tuesday, Gilo said many survivors still felt a ""tremendous sense of anger and lack of trust"" in the Church. Gilo, whose abuser has since died, said he believed the Church's recently-appointed lead safeguarding bishop, Reverend Dr Jonathan Gibbs, was keen to make a difference - but that ""there needs to be a real turnaround"" in the Church's culture. ""Once survivors see real help, and real support beginning to reach them from a Church that has mouthed support for a long time but not delivered it... there could be a turning point."" By Callum May, BBC News The explicit moral purpose of the Church is to teach right from wrong, this inquiry states in its conclusions. It failed and it is still failing. In 2018, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 449 concerns raised about recent child sexual abuse. A significant number of these involved the downloading or possession of indecent images of children. The Archbishops of Canterbury and York have said they will not make excuses, and offer their sincere and heartfelt apologies. The Church of England, they say, is ready to support anyone who comes forward and will honour its commitment to change. The independent inquiry's recommendations are likely to be endorsed in full by the House of Bishops, and put to its governing General Synod in November. This will probably lead to an extension of a pilot support scheme for a small number of survivors who are already receiving financial help. But survivors' groups say the inquiry's findings represent only the tip of an iceberg. Today's findings will prove a heavy cost for the Church. Home Secretary Priti Patel praised the strength and courage of victims and survivors and pledged to review the report before considering how to respond ""in due course"". The report made several recommendations, including: the Church of England should improve how it responds to safeguarding complaints - by, for example, reintroducing a rule to expel any member of the clergy found guilty of child sexual abuse offences responsibility for safeguarding should be taken out of the hands of diocesan bishops and given to safeguarding officers employed by the central hierarchy of the Church the Church of England and Church in Wales should share information about clergy who move between the two institutions both Churches should introduce policies for funding and support of survivors of child sexual abuse whose perpetrators had a connection to the Church Prof Jay said she hoped the report and its recommendations would help to ""ensure these failures never happen again"". The Church of England said the report ""makes shocking reading"" and that the entire institution ""must learn lessons from this inquiry"". ""While apologies will never take away the effects of abuse on victims and survivors, we today want to express our shame about the events that have made those apologies necessary,"" said Dr Gibbs, the Church's lead safeguarding bishop, and Melissa Caslake, the Church's national director of safeguarding. In a joint statement, the pair said there had been some improvements to safeguarding in the Church in recent years, but added: ""We wholeheartedly regret that in some areas, most importantly support for victims and survivors, progress has been too slow."" They said the Church endorsed and was ""completely committed"" to the report's recommendations for improving such support. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) in England and Wales is investigating claims against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces and public and private institutions - as well as people in the public eye. Following the death of BBC presenter Jimmy Savile in 2011, hundreds of people came forward to say he had abused them as children. The spotlight has also fallen on sexual assaults carried out in schools, children's homes and at NHS sites. At the same time, there have been claims of past failures by police and prosecutors to properly investigate allegations. The IICSA was established in 2015, with the then Home Secretary Theresa May saying it would ""expose those failures and learn the lessons"" from the past. In 2018 the inquiry published aninterim report,externalwith 18 recommendations - some of which have been acted upon.

"Recent visualisation of a black hole by Nasa Three scientists have been awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics for work to understand black holes. Sir Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez were announced as this year's winners at a news conference in Stockholm. The winners will share the prize money of 10 million krona (Â£864,200). David Haviland, chair of the physics prize committee, said this year's award ""celebrates one of the most exotic objects in the Universe"". Black holes are regions of space where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape from them. UK-born mathematical physicist Sir Roger, from the University of Oxford, demonstrated that black holes were an inevitable consequence of Albert's Einstein's general theory of relativity. Reacting to the win, he told the BBC: ""It was an extreme honour and great pleasure to hear the news this morning, in a slightly unusual way - I had to get out of my shower to hear it."" Among scientific awards, he said, this is ""the prime one"". Sir Roger Penrose: The man who proved black holes weren't 'impossible' Listen to the BBC's Life Scientific: Sir Roger Penrose Hepatitis C discovery wins the Nobel Prize History-making black hole seen to do a shimmy L-R: Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel, Andrea Ghez Penrose receives half of this year's prize, with the other half being shared by Genzel and Ghez. Prof Ghez is only the fourth woman to win the physics prize, out of more than 200 laureates since 1901. The other female recipients are Marie Curie (1903), Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963) and Donna Strickland (2018). ""The history of black holes goes way back in time to the end of the 18th Century. Then, through Einstein's general relativity, we had the tools to describe these objects for real,"" said Ulf Danielsson, a member of the Nobel Committee. But the mathematics of black holes was incredibly complex. Many researchers believed they were nothing more than mathematical artefacts, existing only on paper. It took researchers decades to realise they could persist in the real world. ""That's what Roger Penrose did,"" said Danielsson. ""He understood the mathematics, he introduced new tools and then could actually prove this is a process you can naturally expect to happen - that a star collapses and turns into a black hole."" Sir Roger explained: ""People were very sceptical at the time, it took a long time before black holes were accepted... their importance is, I think, only partially appreciated."" Sir Roger showed that black holes always hide a singularity - a boundary where space and time ends Penrose was born in 1931 in Colchester and comes from a distinguished scientific family. He is the son of the psychiatrist and geneticist Lionel Penrose and Margaret Leathes, who was the daughter of a well-known English physiologist. His brother Jonathan is a chess grandmaster. Sir Roger shied away from competition as a child and struggled in exams. He toldBBC Radio 4's The Life Scientific programmein 2016: ""I was good at maths, but I didn't necessarily do very well in my tests."" However, he added: ""The teacher realised if he gave me enough time, I would do well. ""I think I had to do all my arithmetic working it out from first principles,"" he chuckled, adding: ""I just was slow, and I'm slow at writing."" In the 1950s, he came up with the Penrose triangle, an impossible object which could be depicted in a perspective drawing but could not exist in reality. The triangle, along with other observations by Sir Roger and his father Lionel, influenced the Dutch artist MC Escher, who incorporated them into his artworks Waterfall, and Ascending and Descending. Inspired by the British scientist Dennis Sciama, Penrose next applied his mathematical ability to physics. In 1965, he published a landmark paper in which he was able to show that a black hole always hides a singularity, a boundary where space and time ends. A black hole,externalis a region of space where matter has collapsed in on itself The gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape Black holes will emerge from the explosive demise of certain large stars But some are truly gargantuan, billions of times the mass of our Sun How these monsters - found at galaxy centres - formed is unknown Black holes are detected from the way they influence their surroundings The mathematical concept of ""trapped surfaces,"" was crucial to this giant leap in understanding. A trapped surface forces all rays to point towards a centre, regardless of whether the surface curves outwards or inwards. Once matter begins to collapse, as in the formation of a black hole, and a trapped surface forms, nothing can stop the process from continuing. Similarly, all matter crosses a black hole's event horizon in one direction, with everything carried towards an inescapable end at the singularity. Sir Roger held a lectureship at Birkbeck College (now Birkbeck, University of London) at the time of the breakthrough, and it was on the way to his workplace that he had a moment of inspiration. It occurred as he was in conversation with the physicist Ivor Robinson. The pair crossed a road and an image popped into Sir Roger's head of the trapped surfaces. He told the BBC: ""Maybe it was having myself be a bit distracted from [the black hole problem] which led to me thinking about it in a different way."" Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez provided the most convincing evidence yet of a supermassive black hole at the centre of our galaxy - the Milky Way. At the announcement of this year's recipients, Ulf Danielsson demonstrates the concept of a black hole using a ball They found that this huge object, known as Sagittarius A*, was tugging on the jumble of stars orbiting it. American Prof Ghez, from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), said: ""I'm thrilled to receive the prize and I take very seriously the responsibility of being the fourth woman to win the Nobel prize [in physics]."" For more than 50 years, physicists had suspected that there may be a black hole at the centre of the Milky Way. But the technology had to catch up before this idea could be demonstrated. In the 1990s, Prof Genzel, from the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany, and Ghez started using the world's largest telescopes to see through huge clouds of interstellar gas and dust to the centre of the Milky Way. They stretched the limits of technology, having to develop new techniques to compensate for distortions to their observations caused by the Earth's atmosphere. In 1988, Sir Roger was awarded the prestigious Wolf Prize in physics along with Stephen Hawking for the Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems, an attempt to answer the question of when singularities are produced. Swedish industrialist and chemist Alfred Nobel founded the prizes in his will, written in 1895 - a year before his death.

"Boris Johnson has announced new investment in offshore wind energy Mr Johnson was addressing the final day of the Conservative party's annual conference The PM vowed to defeat coronavirus and 'build back better' over the next decade Mr Johnson said the UK will become ""the world leader in clean wind energy"" Speaking of his own brush with the virus, Boris Johnson said it was ""drivel"" that he had ""lost his mojo"" He said the pandemic would be a ""catalyst"" for major change in the UK Kate Whannel, Paul Seddon and Richard Morris BBC Politics Thanks for following the PM's speech along with us here today. We'll be back tomorrow for our weekly coverage of prime minister's questions. Hope to see you then. Boris Johnson has finished his online speech to the Conservative party conference. Here's what you missed: Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent This was a virtual conference speech in which the prime minister's gaze extended over the horizon -- to the point when our national conversation is no longer dominated by Coronavirus. It was clearly an attempt to reassure Conservative MPs and activists that the Boris Johnson they elected as their leader, and the country enthusiastically embraced as prime minister at the last election, hadn't disappeared. So there were the colourful turns of phrase, the sentences that would have generated laughter in the hall, the reassurance he had fully recovered from his bout of the virus. And then it was the big picture: the agenda, alongside delivering Brexit, that delivered that thumping majority back in December last year. So: talk of enterprise, talk of home ownership, a green tinged economic recovery. Was there less in this than a conventional conference speech? Yes: it was shorter, there was no audience, no razzmatazz. It was also delivered in the teeth of a pandemic, with a grim autumn and winter beckoning - where the government, like the rest of us, remain hostages to the fortune, or lack of it, of what the pandemic might bring.

Vicki YoungDeputy Political Editor He was obviously speaking to his Conservative audience - offering them a reassurance that he doesn't want to be closing pubs early and putting restrictions on peoples' lives. And he was making the point that the type of state intervention we've seen during the pandemic is not going to be forever. It is also interesting that he has a very optimistic message. But there is an awful lot to fix. Lots of people are still focused on what is happening with coronavirus now. Seeing the problems that have happened - do people trust his government to deliver these very ambitious things. Responding to Mr Johnson's speech, deputy Labour leader Angela
Rayner says: ""The
British people needed to hear the prime minister set out how he and his
government will get a grip of the crisis. ""Instead we got the usual bluster and
no plan for the months ahead. âWe end this
Conservative conference as we started it: with a shambolic testing system,
millions of jobs at risk and an incompetent government that has lost control of
this virus and is holding Britain back.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Coming to the end of his speech Boris Johnson acknowledges that times are tough but adds ""it is a measure of the greatness of this country that we are simply not going to let it hold us back or slow us down."" ""Even in the darkest moments we can see the bright future ahead. ""And we can see how to build it and we will build it together."" And with that he leaves the podium. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent A de-rigueur chunk of any leader's speech at a party conference is the big principles thing, what we stand for compared to the other lot. It reminds the audience in the hall why they were drawn to the party in the first place, and reassures them those at the top believe the same stuff they do, whatever the pressures of leadership, government or budgets. So the Prime Minister talks of the importance of enterprise, the desire for home ownership, a pride in British history, his commitment to keeping the United Kingdom together: big picture Conservative values, in contrast to Labour and the Scottish National Party.  Boris Johnson accuses the Labour Party of wanting ""to edit our national CV to make it more politically correct"". He says the Conservative Party ""believe passionately"" in the UK, and says Labour ""flirt with those who want to tear our country apart"". He accuses Labour of wanting to try and take the UK back into the EU, and he says the party has ""sniped from the sidelines"" during the pandemic. He says that he hopes people arriving in the country in 2030 will arrive on British made zero carbon jets, and rent clean energy powered electric vehicles. He adds that in 2030, the UK will be a country which is more united, outside of the EU. He says it should be a country where people are ""embraced"" no matter what their race, gender or orientation. Reality Check The
prime minister confirmed his partyâs manifesto pledge to increase the UKâs
capacity to produce energy from offshore wind to 40GW by 2030. Thatâs
a big increase â last year the UK capacity from offshore windwas just under 10GW,external He
also wants to increase the amount of the wind turbines that are made in the UK. The
most recent figures on this come from the industry association Renewables UK,
which said in a 2017 report that48% of the content was made domestically.,external Mr Johnson now turns to housing. He says it is a ""disgraceful truth"" that home ownership levels among younger people has plummeted. ""Millions of people are forced to pay through the nose for a home they can't truly love,"" he says. He promises to change the planning system but also says first time buyers will be able to take out a long-term fixed-rate mortgages of up to 95% of the value of the home. He says it will be the biggest expansion of home ownership since 1980s and promises to turn ""generation rent into generation buy"". He then accuses Labour of disliking home ownership. Mr Johnson cautions against ""drawing the wrong conclusions"" from the pandemic, and relying permanently on the ""uncle sugar"" of the taxpayer. He says it was ""the private sector"" that stepped in to manufacturer things like masks during the early days of the crisis. He says the expansion of the state seen this year would only be expected in ""times of war or disaster"". He says the government has been ""forced"" into ""erosions of liberty"" that would not normally be the case. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He goes on to say that ""the Covid crisis is a catalyst for change"" adding ""we need to give people the chance to train for the new jobs that are being created every day."" Boris Johnson says the government is ""pressing on with its plan for 48 hospitals"" between now and 2030. He says the government needs to ""get on"" with hiring 40,000 more nurses, and states there are 14,000 more nurses under the current government in the past year. He says the UK needs to ""care for the carers, as they care for us"". The government has recruited 5,000 of the additional 20,000 police officers they want on the streets, he adds. He says he and the Home Secretary believe the UK justice system is ""hamstrung"" by ""lefty do-gooders"" meaning that justice cannot always be served. The government wants to look at more ""one to one teaching"" for those who are falling behind, and those who have extra abilities, he adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

"For most people, Covid-19 is a brief and mild disease but some are left struggling with symptoms including lasting fatigue, persistent pain and breathlessness for months. The condition known as ""long Covid"" is having a debilitating effect on people's lives, and stories of being left exhausted after even a short walk are now common. So far, the focus has been on saving lives during the pandemic, but there is now a growing recognition that people are facing long-term consequences of a Covid infection. Yet even basic questions - such as why people get long Covid or whether everyone will fully recover - are riddled with uncertainty. There is no medical definition or list of symptoms shared by all patients - two people with long Covid can have very different experiences. However, the most common feature is crippling fatigue. Others symptoms include: breathlessness, a cough that won't go away, joint pain, muscle aches, hearing and eyesight problems, headaches, loss of smell and taste as well as damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys and gut. Mental health problems have been reported including depression, anxiety and struggling to think clearly. It can utterly destroy people's quality of life. ""My fatigue was like nothing I've experienced before,""said one sufferer Jade Gray-Christie, Long Covid: 'My fatigue was like nothing I've experienced before' Long Covid: 'I donât have a life, I currently have an existence' Coronavirus patient unable to work six months on Long Covid is not just people taking time to recover from a stay in intensive care. Even people with relatively mild infections can be left with lasting and severe health problems. ""We've got no doubt long Covid exists,"" Prof David Strain, from the University of Exeter, who is already seeing long-Covid patients at his Chronic Fatigue Syndrome clinic, told the BBC. A study of 143 people in Rome's biggest hospital,published in the Journal of the American Medical Association,external, followed hospital patients after they were discharged. It showed 87% had at least one symptom nearly two months later and more than half still had fatigue. However, such studies focus only on the minority of people who end up needing hospital treatment. TheCovid Symptom Tracker App,external- used by around four million people in the UK - found 12% of people still had symptoms after 30 days. Its latest, unpublished data, suggests as many as one in 50 (2%) of all people infected have long-Covid symptoms after 90 days. It appears not. Half of peoplein a study in Dublin,externalstill had fatigue 10 weeks after being infected with coronavirus. A third were physically unable to return to work. Crucially, doctors found no link between the severity of the infection and fatigue. However, extreme exhaustion is only one symptom of long Covid. Prof Chris Brightling, from the University of Leicester and the chief investigator in the PHOSP-Covid projectwhich is tracking people's recovery,external, believes people who developed pneumonia may have more problems because of damage to the lungs. Scans of lungs infected with coronavirus showing areas of pneumonia There are lots of ideas, but no definitive answers. The virus may have been cleared from most of the body, but continues to linger in some small pockets. ""If there's long-term diarrhoea then you find the virus in the gut, if there's loss of smell it is in the nerves - so that could be what's causing the problem,"" says Prof Tim Spector, from King's College London. The coronavirus can directly infect a wide variety of cells in the body and trigger an overactive immune response which also causes damage throughout the body. One thought is the immune systemdoes not return to normal,externalafter Covid and this causes ill-health. The infection may also alter how people's organs function. This is most obvious with the lungs if they become scarred - long-term problems have been seenafter infection with Sars or Mers,external, which are both types of coronavirus. But Covid may also alter people's metabolism. There have been cases of people struggling to control their blood sugar levels afterdeveloping diabetes as a result of Covid,external, and Sars led to changes in the way the body processed fatsfor at least 12 years,external. There are early signs ofchanges to brain structure,external, but these are still being investigated. And Covid-19 also does strange things to the blood, including abnormal clotting, and damaging the network of tubes that carry blood around the body. Inside Health: Sticky Blood and Covid 19 Prof Strain told the BBC: ""The theory I'm working on is a premature ageing of the small blood vessels that deliver oxygen and nutrients to the tissues."" But he warned that until we figure out what is causing long Covid ""it is difficult to figure out treatments."" Post-viral fatigue or a post-viral cough are well documented and common - we've probably all had an infection that has taken ages to fully recover from. Around one in 10 people withglandular fever,externalhas fatigue which lasts for months. And there have even been suggestions that flu, particularly after the 1918 pandemic, may be linked toParkinson's-like symptoms,external. ""With Covid there seem to be more far-reaching symptoms and the number of people seems to be much greater,"" says Prof Brightling. The emphasis though is on the word ""seems"" as until we have a true picture of how many people have been infected we won't know exactly how common these symptoms are, he says. He told the BBC: ""The uniqueness of the way the virus attacks the host and the different ways it then alters the way cells behave seem to be both giving people more severe infection than other viruses and persistent symptoms."" SYMPTOMS:85% of patients have one of these three symptoms IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? QUARANTINE:Who must self-isolate after arriving in the UK LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The number of people with long-Covid appears to be falling with time. However, the virus emerged only at the end of 2019 before going global earlier this year so there is a lack of long-term data. ""We've asked, deliberately, to follow people for 25 years, I certainly hope only a very small number will have problems going beyond a year, but I could be wrong,"" said Prof Brightling. However, there are concerns that even if people appear to recover now, they could face lifelong risks. People who have had chronic fatigue syndrome are more likely to have it again and the concern is that future infections may cause more flare-ups. ""If long Covid follows the same pattern I'd expect some recovery, but if it takes just another coronavirus infection to react then this could be every winter,"" said Prof Strain. It is still possible more problems could emerge in the future. The World Health Organization has warned that widespread inflammation caused by coronavirus could lead to people having heart problems at a much younger age. The NHS has a""Your Covid Recovery Plan"",externalwhich has advice, particularly for those who needed hospital treatment. It recommends the ""three Ps"" in order to conserve energy: Pace yourself so you don't push yourself too hard, and make sure you have plenty of rest Plan your days so your most tiring activities are spread out across the week Prioritise - think about what you need to do and what can be put off It advises speaking to either your hospital team or your GP if you are not recovering as quickly as you might expect. Some have raised concerns thatthere is not enough supportfor people with long-Covid.

"Recent visualisation of a black hole by Nasa Three scientists have been awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics for work to understand black holes. Sir Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez were announced as this year's winners at a news conference in Stockholm. The winners will share the prize money of 10 million krona (Â£864,200). David Haviland, chair of the physics prize committee, said this year's award ""celebrates one of the most exotic objects in the Universe"". Black holes are regions of space where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape from them. UK-born mathematical physicist Sir Roger, from the University of Oxford, demonstrated that black holes were an inevitable consequence of Albert's Einstein's general theory of relativity. Reacting to the win, he told the BBC: ""It was an extreme honour and great pleasure to hear the news this morning, in a slightly unusual way - I had to get out of my shower to hear it."" Among scientific awards, he said, this is ""the prime one"". Sir Roger Penrose: The man who proved black holes weren't 'impossible' Listen to the BBC's Life Scientific: Sir Roger Penrose Hepatitis C discovery wins the Nobel Prize History-making black hole seen to do a shimmy L-R: Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel, Andrea Ghez Penrose receives half of this year's prize, with the other half being shared by Genzel and Ghez. Prof Ghez is only the fourth woman to win the physics prize, out of more than 200 laureates since 1901. The other female recipients are Marie Curie (1903), Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963) and Donna Strickland (2018). ""The history of black holes goes way back in time to the end of the 18th Century. Then, through Einstein's general relativity, we had the tools to describe these objects for real,"" said Ulf Danielsson, a member of the Nobel Committee. But the mathematics of black holes was incredibly complex. Many researchers believed they were nothing more than mathematical artefacts, existing only on paper. It took researchers decades to realise they could persist in the real world. ""That's what Roger Penrose did,"" said Danielsson. ""He understood the mathematics, he introduced new tools and then could actually prove this is a process you can naturally expect to happen - that a star collapses and turns into a black hole."" Sir Roger explained: ""People were very sceptical at the time, it took a long time before black holes were accepted... their importance is, I think, only partially appreciated."" Sir Roger showed that black holes always hide a singularity - a boundary where space and time ends Penrose was born in 1931 in Colchester and comes from a distinguished scientific family. He is the son of the psychiatrist and geneticist Lionel Penrose and Margaret Leathes, who was the daughter of a well-known English physiologist. His brother Jonathan is a chess grandmaster. Sir Roger shied away from competition as a child and struggled in exams. He toldBBC Radio 4's The Life Scientific programmein 2016: ""I was good at maths, but I didn't necessarily do very well in my tests."" However, he added: ""The teacher realised if he gave me enough time, I would do well. ""I think I had to do all my arithmetic working it out from first principles,"" he chuckled, adding: ""I just was slow, and I'm slow at writing."" In the 1950s, he came up with the Penrose triangle, an impossible object which could be depicted in a perspective drawing but could not exist in reality. The triangle, along with other observations by Sir Roger and his father Lionel, influenced the Dutch artist MC Escher, who incorporated them into his artworks Waterfall, and Ascending and Descending. Inspired by the British scientist Dennis Sciama, Penrose next applied his mathematical ability to physics. In 1965, he published a landmark paper in which he was able to show that a black hole always hides a singularity, a boundary where space and time ends. A black hole,externalis a region of space where matter has collapsed in on itself The gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape Black holes will emerge from the explosive demise of certain large stars But some are truly gargantuan, billions of times the mass of our Sun How these monsters - found at galaxy centres - formed is unknown Black holes are detected from the way they influence their surroundings The mathematical concept of ""trapped surfaces,"" was crucial to this giant leap in understanding. A trapped surface forces all rays to point towards a centre, regardless of whether the surface curves outwards or inwards. Once matter begins to collapse, as in the formation of a black hole, and a trapped surface forms, nothing can stop the process from continuing. Similarly, all matter crosses a black hole's event horizon in one direction, with everything carried towards an inescapable end at the singularity. Sir Roger held a lectureship at Birkbeck College (now Birkbeck, University of London) at the time of the breakthrough, and it was on the way to his workplace that he had a moment of inspiration. It occurred as he was in conversation with the physicist Ivor Robinson. The pair crossed a road and an image popped into Sir Roger's head of the trapped surfaces. He told the BBC: ""Maybe it was having myself be a bit distracted from [the black hole problem] which led to me thinking about it in a different way."" Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez provided the most convincing evidence yet of a supermassive black hole at the centre of our galaxy - the Milky Way. At the announcement of this year's recipients, Ulf Danielsson demonstrates the concept of a black hole using a ball They found that this huge object, known as Sagittarius A*, was tugging on the jumble of stars orbiting it. American Prof Ghez, from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), said: ""I'm thrilled to receive the prize and I take very seriously the responsibility of being the fourth woman to win the Nobel prize [in physics]."" For more than 50 years, physicists had suspected that there may be a black hole at the centre of the Milky Way. But the technology had to catch up before this idea could be demonstrated. In the 1990s, Prof Genzel, from the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany, and Ghez started using the world's largest telescopes to see through huge clouds of interstellar gas and dust to the centre of the Milky Way. They stretched the limits of technology, having to develop new techniques to compensate for distortions to their observations caused by the Earth's atmosphere. In 1988, Sir Roger was awarded the prestigious Wolf Prize in physics along with Stephen Hawking for the Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems, an attempt to answer the question of when singularities are produced. Swedish industrialist and chemist Alfred Nobel founded the prizes in his will, written in 1895 - a year before his death.

"Mike Hampshire says without a bounce back loan he may have to search for other work Quitting his IT job two years ago to start a beer tour business was a dream for Mike Hampshire. But his hopes of breaking even in his second year of operation were crushed when the coronavirus crisis hit in spring. Now the future of his Leeds-based business is in serious doubt as he's been unable to get a bounce back loan. ""Without a loan to tide me over I'm going to have to look for other work,"" he said. In September, the chancellor extended the deadline for the government's coronavirus loan schemes to the end of November. Bounce back loans,externalallow small firms to borrow up to Â£50,000 over nine years at preferential rates, with the loans 100% guaranteed by the government. Mr Hampshire is not the only small business owner fighting to survive without being able to get a loan through the government scheme. Mr Bounceback, an anonymous businessman behind a website which helps struggling small firms, said he has heard from lots of people with problems. ""Several banks are not accepting new customers, and the majority of them have chosen to only allow their existing customers to apply, or even worse some lenders appear to be handpicking customers and inviting them to apply,"" he said. Small businesses which bank with smaller lenders could be missing out Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said: ""With many firms facing continued cash flow pressures, it is concerning that businesses who bank with non-accredited lenders remain largely unable to access these vital financial lifelines."" ""Government, regulators and banks must work together to ensure that a greater number of firms can access this support during this challenging period."" Banking trade body UK Finance said that ""the vast majority of applicants have been able to rapidly access the finance they need"" through the scheme which has lent Â£38bn to 1.26 million smaller businesses. ""It isn't the only type of lending, I must say,"" said Stephen Pegge, UK Finance's managing director for commercial finance. ""There is a possibility, even if you can't get a bounce back loan, of borrowing elsewhere."" He told the BBC's Today programme there are ""28 accredited lenders account for the vast majority of existing business relationships so most people will bank with one of those"". But he said that of those 28 lenders, only ""one or two"" will give a bounce back loan to new customers. Mike Hampshire's guided beer tours came to a sudden halt in March when pubs shut their doors. ""I've pretty much had no income since March, but had a bit of cash put by, so thought I'd try and ride it out,"" he told the BBC. ""When pubs re-opened, the social-distancing rules made it impossible to run the tours and I've also had to cancel the annual beer festival I run in November."" With his money running out he turned to government support and decided to apply for a bounce back loan. ""I need about Â£5,000 to see me through to the spring when, hopefully, things will be better,"" he said. Mike Hampshire's guided beer tours came to a sudden halt in March But he banks with Monzo which isn't one of the 28 lenders which signed up for the government scheme. He tried to apply through HSBC, but the bank closed its doors to new customers last week, the day before he made his application.

Samuel L Jackson and Afua Hirsch both discovered their roots on the show Hirsch, who writes a column for the Guardian and penned the book Brit(ish): On Race, Identity and Belonging, told The Radio Times: ""I'm not about destroying history at all. I want people to see it and engage with it. ""But I do feel quite critical that until now these things have been held in a way that neither educates nor enlightens us about our colonial history."" The National Trust homes where colonial links are 'umbilical' How UK museums are responding to Black Lives Matter She was responding to a question about the National Trust, which hasidentified 93 properties with connections to colonialism and historic slavery. Hirsch said she applauded the organisation, but that their collections should be used to tell a more complete version of history. She added on Twitter,externalthat the interview ""left out the part where I said the amount owed in reparations MONUMENTALLY exceeds the amount that could be raised by selling off National Trust collections"". Hirsch, who was born in Norway but grew up in the UK, added that the debate about the legacy of slavery was ""not about beating ourselves up, it's about understanding how we got here"". Enslaved used new diving technology to locate and examine sunken slave ships in the UK, the Caribbean and Florida, retrieving artefacts such as a large ivory tusk 45 miles off the coast of Devon. The four-part CBC/Epix series has already been broadcast in the US. The transatlantic slave trade saw European countries including the UK traffic around 12 million people from West Africa to the Americas between the 16th and 19th Centuries. Hirsch also filmed with Jackson in Elmina, Ghana, one of the major slave trading posts in what was then known as the African Gold Coast. She added that history taught in British schools should acknowledge the country's role in the slave trade rather than just celebrate its abolition. It is not compulsory for schools to teach about the slave trade, but teachers can choose to include it when covering British history from 1745-1901 at Key Stage 3, for pupils aged 11-14.

"US President Donald Trump is coming under fire for downplaying the severity of coronavirus on his return to the White House Election rival Joe Biden, former First Lady Michelle Obama and medics criticise his upbeat statements PM Boris Johnson says the UK cannot return to normal post-pandemic, but needs better housing and healthcare New coronavirus restrictions for Scotland will be announced on Wednesday - but it will not be another full lockdown More than 35.4 million cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed globally, with more than one million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Claire Heald Many thanks for joining us on our live page coverage today. The latest updates on coronavirus were brought to you by: David Walker, Lauren Turner, Joshua Nevett, Max Matza, Emma Harrison, Victoria Bisset, Paul Kirby and Claire Heald. President Trump removed his mask as he returned to the White House on Monday night Weâre pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic soon. In case you missed them, here are some of todayâs major developments from around the world: It's been another busy day of news in the UK. Here's what's been happening so far:  Donald Trump has returned to the White House after being treated by medics for coronavirus. Before leaving Walter Reed medical centre for home, he first drove by his supporters, who had gathered outside. So what do people make of his actions? Scott Pio says Trump is showing love to his supporters by visiting them Scott Pio, a 36-year-old software engineer who lives in Loudoun County, Virginia, was one of those who gathered outside of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, to show their support for the president. Pio applauded the presidentâs decision to go for a drive and does not think it was a risky move. The president, he says, ventured outside of the gates of the military hospital because he wanted âto show his supporters love for being out there"". Pio adds: âHe wouldnât have done it if he didnât really care about the people who are supporting him.â Neil Melton says Trump shows a 'winning spirit' even when ill Neil Melton, a construction-project manager who lives in Prairie Village, Kansas, says he appreciates the way Trump has been candid about his experience with coronavirus. âHeâs trying to be one-on-one with the American people, and heâs trying to show: âHey, Iâm just like you.âââ At the same time, says Melton, he likes to see the president project strength â such as when he walked to the top of a White House staircase and stood at a balcony and took off his mask. âPeople want to see that winning spirit,â says Melton. âThey donât want to live with this Covid lifestyle forever.â Melton adds: âHe wants to show some symbolism: âHey, we can come out of this.ââ Stevie Storck says Trump is not taking the virus seriously âAfter three days, he was saying: âYou donât need to be afraid of it,ââ says Stevie Storck of Windsor, Pennsylvania. She lives on a block with Trump signs (âMake Liberals Cry Againâ), and she says people in her community do not always follow public-health guidelines. People are sometimes cavalier about wearing masks in the post office and in shops, she says, and she is concerned they will be emboldened by the presidentâs actions. âThe misinformation he spread about the virus is a big danger to our community,â she says. âHeâs just furthering that attitude of not taking it seriously.â The World at OneBBC Radio 4 Issues with the England's contact tracing system have been reported since it started. And now, one volunteer has told the BBC what it's been like on the ground. Colin, a volunteer at the local authority centre in Calderdale, West Yorkshire, told The World at One: âCases are still coming through to us too slowly, it is often five or six days after they have been tested, which is too long.â He also said they are only speaking to those people the national system has failed to contact - meaning ""we are not able to build up a complete picture, but we can bring a knowledge of the local geography, the businesses that work here, and the way that the community works"". And Colin added: ""The problem is that the national system works on the basis of test results, so each positive test is treated as an isolated case, not collated into households. âIf you have got a household of maybe five people, three of whom have tested positive, each of those is going to get a phone call as a case in their own right.â This, he said, led to one family receiving 75 separate calls - and disconnecting their phones. Angelica CasasVideo journalist, BBC News Monica MuÃ±oz's father died three months ago from Covid-19 I first met Monica MuÃ±oz, who lost her father and grandfather to Covid-19, while reporting on how Latino-Americans have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Today she says she is not offended by Trump's Twitter advice this morning, advising people to ""learn to live"" with Covid-19 as they have with seasonal flu. ""Today marks three months since my dad passed away. People say that with time things get easier, but Iâm not there yet,"" she says from her home in Texas. ""I agree with President Trump that we cannot be afraid of Covid-19. Life does not stop because of risks. ""We know more about the virus now than we did in the past several months. We have a personal responsibility to take necessary precautions to care for ourselves and protect others. ""We have to continuously inform ourselves about the virus. My dad would always say:Ni modo, la vida sigue(Oh well, life goes on)."" Watch our original piece on Monica's family here: 'Weâre still waiting at home for them to come back' Doctors from three intensive-care units in the Czech Republic have issued an emotional appeal to protect life from Covid-19 to âwin this warâ. A Czech hospital shared the message of doctors Hynek BartoÅ¡, JiÅÃ­ Sagan and AleÅ¡ Chrdle in a social media post on Tuesday. In it, the doctors expressed dismay at the recent resurgence of the virus, which âhas returned with even greater potency than beforeâ. âWe don't want to cause panic and horror, but you must listen to us,â the doctors wrote in the viral post. âOn our wards, we are fighting for the lives of people who - if they had not contracted the coronavirus - would have looked forward to another 10-20 years of quality life ahead of them.â The doctors added that experts, the government and citizens need to do more âif we want to win this warâ. To citizens, they asked for respect for âthe fact that Covid-19 is an insidious opponentâ, adding that âfrequent hand washing, masks and social distancing are the minimum you can do for yourself and others without major sacrificesâ. Coronavirus infections have been rising rapidly since the start of September in the Czech Republic. So far,the country has recorded 85,566 cases and 758 deaths,external. With the pandemic disrupting education for young people around the world, students at the University of Vienna have been given an unusual option to revise. From this week, they are able to study in one of the city's biggest churches, the Votivkirche. The Austrian Catholic Press Agency reported last week that the university had agreed to rent the church when it's not being used for religious services, offering students ""a quiet place to study and stay between courses"". While the location might not be what students are used to, the church has wifi, heaters and toilets. We've heard today how daily hospital admissions are rising in the UK. Here are graphics showing the latest picture. Mark Milley oversees the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Top US General Mark Milley, who oversees the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is in quarantineafter a military aide to President Trump tested positive for the coronavirus. Several other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which runs the US military branches, are also self-isolating and working from home. One of the five military aides that travels with the president - (itâs their job to carry the suitcase containing the nuclear launch codes known as âthe footballâ) - tested positive earlier today. The newly infected military aide is reportedly a member of the Coast Guard. The Vice Commandant of the US Coast Guard, Admiral Charles Ray tested positive, according to a statement released today. Over the weekend, one of Trumpâs military valets also tested positive, US media reported on Tuesday. Also on Tuesday, the Washington Post confirmed New York Times reports that said White House housekeeping staff who tested positive for the virus weeks ago were told to use ""discretion"" when publicly discussing their diagnosis. Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News A group of 400 freelance musicians has played outside Parliament to highlight the plight of the music industry during the pandemic. Violinists Nicola Benedetti and Tasmin Little were among the performers who played a short segment of Mars, from Holst's The Planets, in central London. They then held a two-minute silence, to put pressure on the government to give more support to self-employed artists. There was also a protest outside Birmingham's Symphony Hall. The events were organised by the Musicians Union, which represents more than 32,000 performers in the UK. It says 70% of its members have lost more than three-quarters of their regular work during the lockdown, leaving many in financial hardship. Freelance musicians, who make up 72% of the sector, are particularly affected. Almost half of them are not eligible for grants under the government's current self-employed income support scheme, the union says. Read more here. President Trump has been criticised for saying Americans should not fear Covid-19 President Trump was discharged from hospital on Monday night, allowing him to return to the White House in typically theatrical style. The president will continue his recovery there. Here are some of the key moments in Trumpâs illness so far: Friday: Saturday: Sunday: Monday: Monday evening: Tuesday: President Trump met with his team of doctors at the White House earlier today, according to a statement. ""He had a restful first night at home, and today he reports no symptoms,"" wrote Dr Sean Conley. His vital signs are stable, the doctor continued, adding that ""overall he continues to do extremely well"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has refused to back his deputy's call for Matt Hancock to ""consider his position"". Instead, he says the health secretary needs to ""get on with the job"". Deputy party leader Angela Rayner had been expressing ""frustration"" when she called on Mr Hancock to quit, said Sir Keir. ""I think Angela was probably expressing a frustration that is deeply felt across the country,"" he told reporters. ""What I want is for the government to concentrate on the job in hand and for Matt Hancock and others to get on and deliver what they are promising."" Sir Keir also spoke about the test and trace scheme - see his comments in this video. This video can not be played Keir Starmer on coronavirus testing and tracing plans He said the prime minister should give a ""frank acknowledgement there are real problems"" with the governmentâs approach to dealing with coronavirus, claiming the testing regime âjust isnât workingâ. Facebook said the post breached its rules on misinformation Facebook has removed one of President Trumpâs postsfor breaching its rules on coronavirus misinformation. In the post, President Trump falsely claimed that Covid-19 is less deadly than the seasonal flu. âWe remove incorrect information about the severity of Covid-19, and have now removed this post,âa Facebook spokesperson told CNBC,external. Trump has routinely played down the threat of the virus, telling Americans on Monday they had nothing to fear, after he spent time in hospital with Covid-19. The president shared a similar post about the flu to his Twitter account on Tuesday. The tweet remains accessible, but Twitter has flagged it for violating its rules about âspreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to Covid-19â. Experts say the mortality rate of Covid-19 it is thought to be far higher than that of most strains of the flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates,externalthat 22,000 people in the US died from the flu during the last flu season from late 2019 into 2020. By comparison, the coronavirus outbreak in the US has killed more than 210,000 people so far this year alone,data from Johns Hopkins University shows,external. The White House shot down a proposed rule from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that would have required vaccines be tested on patients for at least two months before they can be approved for public use. The rule would have effectively made it impossible for a vaccine to hit the market before the 3 November presidential election. Trump has said a vaccine could be released any day now, and that it could be available before election day. Polls show that growing numbers of Americans fear that a vaccine may be released too early under less-stringent ""emergency use authorisation"" and will not be deemed safe by medical experts. According to a CNN poll released on Tuesday, 51% of Americans say they would receive a vaccine once one becomes available. Seven former FDA commissioners last week penned a Washington Post article in which they attacked the Trump administration for âundermining the credibilityâ of the regulatory agency. Meanwhile, Democratic candidate Joe Biden has warned of a vaccine being released too early and before it can be properly studied. The position has led Republicans to attack him as ""anti-vax,"" - a term for people opposed to vaccinations. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The number of new Covid cases admitted to hospital hasjumped by a quarter in England in a day. There were 478 hospitalisations on Sunday, up from 386 the day before. It is the largest daily figure since early June. There were no admissions in Northern Ireland, while the data for Scotland is not yet available for Sunday - and Wales counts cases differently. There are now nearly 2,800 patients in hospital in England with Covid. At the peak, it topped 17,000. Orthodox Jews in New York City have been violating social distancing protocols New York is forcing hundreds of schools in Queens and Brooklyn to shut for in-person teaching amid persistently high positive rates in nine neighbourhoods with large populations of Orthodox Jews. The city's mayor had asked the governor for permission to close non-essential businesses as well, but he declined. According to the local media, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo have a longstanding political feud. On Monday, Cuomo threatened: ""I have to say to the Orthodox community tomorrow, if you're not willing to live with these rules, then I'm going to close the synagogues."" The order affects about 200 private schools and 100 public schools for two weeks. It represents the first major reversal to the city's rollback of virus mitigation measures. The UK coronavirus death figure is a sharp increase from Monday - when there were 19 deaths recorded, and 12,594 new cases. And they come after a technical glitch which led to there being a high number of cases recorded over the weekend. It emerged that nearly 16,000 cases of coronavirus had gone unreported, delaying efforts to trace contacts of people who tested positive. Public Health England said 15,841 cases between 25 September and 2 October were left out of the UK daily case figures. They were then added to reach Saturday's figure of 12,872 new cases and Sunday's figure of 22,961. PHE said all those who tested positive had been informed. But it means others in close contact with them were not. Read more about the missing cases here. Workers sanitise the White House press briefing room Reporters have described the White House as a ""ghost town"" as many staff members have been told to work from home and journalists who were exposed to the infected press secretary isolate at home. Trump is back after a highly-choreographed helicopter arrival on Monday evening. He has vowed to return to the campaign trail soon, but has no official events on his public schedule today. He is considering making a nationally-televised address to the nation, according to reports, even as he continues to fight off illness caused by the coronavirus. Trump's doctors and outside experts say there is still a risk that his condition can reverse and worsen, as he is only about five days out from his positive diagnosis. He has downplayed his illness and the danger of the virus, comparing it on Tuesday to seasonal influenza, which experts say is far less lethal than Covid-19. That move has drawn criticism. Meanwhile, the Trump administration rejected an offer from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to contact trace the Supreme Court event at the White House Rose Garden which caused several Republicans to become infected.

"This video can not be played Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets of the capital Bishkek Protesters in Kyrgyzstan calling for the country's parliamentary election to be annulled have broken into parliament in the capital, Bishkek. Footage showed people in the office of President Sooronbai Jeenbekov, and throwing paper from windows. Parts of the building appeared to be on fire. The break-in follows a day of clashes with police, who initially dispersed crowds with water cannon and tear gas. The clashes come amid allegations of vote-rigging in last Sunday's election. One person died and nearly 600 were injured in the unrest, according to the Health Ministry. President Jeenbekov has appealed for a return to order, accusing ""certain political forces"" of attempting to illegally seize power. He has met opposition party leaders and said he would annul the results of the election if necessary. Following the vote, only four parties out of 16 passed the 7% threshold for entry into parliament, three of which have close ties to President Jeenbekov. Opposition protesters against the parliamentary election results storm a government building On Monday, police used stun grenades to disperse thousands of protesters in Ala-Too square, before following them into nearby streets. But demonstrators later flooded back into the central square before storming the parliament building, known as the White House. Video footage shared on social media showed opposition protesters gaining access to the complex, some by climbing fences and others by pushing open the main gates. Later, smoke could be seen billowing out of the building. Thousands of protesters gathered in Ala-Too square in Bishkek amid allegations of vote-rigging Protesters also released Kyrgyzstan's former President Almazbek Atambayev, who was being held in a remand centre at the State National Security Service awaiting a trial for corruption offences, the local AKIpress news agency reported. The strangers reaching out to lonely teens Kyrgyz debate renaming capital Learn more about Kyrgyzstan Groups close to the president have been accused of vote-buying and voter intimidation - claims international monitors say are ""credible"" and a cause for ""serious concern"". On Monday, 12 opposition parties jointly declared that they would not recognise the results of the vote. Later, President Jeenbekov's office said that he would on Tuesday meet leaders from all 16 parties that competed in the election, in a bid to defuse tensions. Two parties with close ties to President Sooronbai Jeenbekov each took 25% of the vote Opposition candidates also called on the Central Electoral Commission to cancel the results of the election. One candidate, Ryskeldi Mombekov, told a crowd of more than 5,000 protesters on Monday: ""The president promised to oversee honest elections. He didn't keep his word."" Mr Mombekov's party, Ata Meken, had been confident of entering parliament, but in the end it was one of the eight parties that missed the threshold. Ata Meken leader Janar Akaev suffered a leg injury in the protests on Monday. Protesters were also calling on President Jeenbekov to resign. Thomas Boserup, head of the election observation mission of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), said in a briefing that although the vote had been ""generally well organised"", allegations of vote buying were a ""serious concern"". Almaz Tchoroev, BBC News, Bishkek The police used water cannon, stun grenades and tear gas on demonstrators. They first used force to disperse protesters in the main square, but as the crowds moved into other streets in Bishkek, police continued to go after them. Reports of injuries then began to emerge - both among the protesters and the police. There were about 5,000 people protesting in Ala-Too square, and the demonstration was largely peaceful for most of the day. But at about 20:10 local time (14:10 GMT), a smaller group of protesters splintered off and went to the parliament building. When they got there, they reportedly tried to break through the gates. This is what triggered the police response. The police had said that they wouldn't interfere in the protests as long as they stayed peaceful - but this was seen as a provocative act. The demonstrators were initially dispersed, but they later returned and successfully gained entry to the parliament building. The two leading parties, which got a quarter of the vote each, were Birimdik and Mekenim Kyrgyzstan. President Jeenbekov's younger brother, Asylbek Jeenbekov, is a member of Birimdik. Mekenim Kyrgyzstan, meanwhile, is seen as being closely connected to the powerful Matraimov family. The family's figurehead, Rayimbek Matraimov, was the target of anti-corruption protests last year and is believed to have helped finance Mr Jeenbekov's successful presidential campaign in 2017. Late on Monday, Birimdik announced that it would be open to a re-run of Sunday's election, and called on other parties that had crossed the 7% threshold to do the same.

"This video can not be played ""That was a very worrying moment, thinking 'have I now got Covid?'"" Covid-19 is being ""weaponised"" by offenders, according to one police force which has seen spitting and coughing assaults on officers double. North Wales Police saw twice as many such assaults between March and June compared with the same period in 2019. Almost one-third of assault charges on South Wales Police officers were related to spitting or coughing between March and May, BBC research shows. Maximum sentences for assaults on emergency workers are being doubled. ""It's just absolutely appalling to weaponise a virus or disease against police officers and emergency service workers"" said North Wales Police Federation general secretary Mark Jones. ""It's unlike anything we've ever seen before, to be threatened with what is an unseen and silent killer is really terrible."" PC David Roberts-Ablett: ""It was a very worrying moment, thinking - have I now got Covid?"" PC David Roberts-Ablett was coughed at by a man who claimed he had coronavirus symptoms after he was arrested for being violent towards staff at a Tesco supermarket in Cardiff. Darrell Glen Humphries had been taken to the city's University Hospital of Wales so an injury could be treated when the 53-year-old coughed in PC Roberts-Ablett's face. Sentences to double for attacks on emergency staff Assaults on officers increase in lockdown ""In these times of Covid, there's a concern. It was a very worrying moment,"" said the constable of nearly 20 years. ""He had been quite aggressive so I asked him to calm down. It was a very deliberate motion by him, he turned his head, his eyes, fixated on me. ""It was almost like he was targeting me, and he picked my face, and then deliberately looked straight at me and coughed at me. Fortunately I was wearing my glasses and a mask at the time so I was protected."" Darrell Glen Humphries admitted assaulting an emergency worker in May Humphries, of Canton in Cardiff, wassentenced to 26 weeks in prisonby the city's magistrates in May for the attack. ""It was a very worrying moment, thinking 'have I now got Covid?',"" the officer said. ""I thought what do I do? Where do I go? ""There is being a police officer and dealing with the criminal aspect of things, but there's a more humane side to it as well, where there's a lot of implications on me and my family, my colleagues and the people I am serving in Cardiff. ""It does play on your mind because for a while you just don't know."" Police forces across the UKsaw a 21% increase in assaults on their officersin the first three months of lockdown. In the North Wales force area, 30 of the 157 crimes recorded against police officers were coughing and spitting, up from 14 the previous year. Of those, 23 people were charged, up from 10 in 2019, according to a freedom of information request by the BBC. One chief constable says an officer told him he would rather in some ways be shoved or pushed than coughed at ""The amount of deliberate coughing and spitting at police officers has risen quite sharply,"" Mr Jones said. ""To see that form of assault and attack on a police officer is quite worrying."" In the South Wales force area, the largest in Wales, of the 167 charges of police officer assaults, 55 were ""weaponising"" Covid-19 as threat and related to PCs being spat or coughed on. ""What we have seen is a number of people effectively making a weapon out of spitting and then presenting that they've got or believe they might have Covid-19,"" said Chief Constable Matt Jukes. ""A colleague who'd been involved in an incident said 'in some ways I'd rather be shoved, or punched, than get bitten or spat out, because of that long-term worry about the impact on health'. ""What the spitting and biting does is leaves officers with real uncertainty, until they can get test results. ""It's not always Covid-19, sometimes it's other infectious diseases. Sometimes they have to wait for reassurance or knowledge that there may be another issue they need to deal with.""

"The report found improvements were needed in the care of prisoners at risk of self-harm Prisoners in Swansea have made up to 300 protective clothing items a week for front-line healthcare staff. A recent visit by HM Inspectorate of Prisons found workshops had been adapted during the Covid-19 pandemic. This helped cut the number of inmates kept in their cells for long periods. Inspectors said the number of men training as cleaners increased in response to enhanced levels of hygiene, with 33 bio-hazard cleans carried out in the prison by newly trained inmates. Overall the coronavirus-shortened scrutiny visit found HMP Swansea to be a ""well-led establishment that, despite some weakness, had overall made good progress"" since the start of the pandemic. Prison early release errors blamed on cuts Librarians helping prisoners to read It follows some damning reports in recent years, including one which said the prison was""not fit for purpose"" after failing to prevent eight suicides over six years, all by prisoners who had been in Swansea for less than a week. The latest inspection reported two further suicides since the previous inspection in 2017 ""soon after the prisoners arrived"" and an action plan had been drawn up in response to recommendations by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman. Swansea was onceone of the UK's most overcrowded jailsand according to a report compiled in July,it remained the ninth most overcrowded,external. Chief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke said while Swansea had ""progressed"", managers needed to establish ""appropriate oversight in the areas of self-harm prevention"". But Mr Clarke said improvements were needed in the care of those at risk of self-harm. He found the scale of mental health problems in Swansea was extremely high, affecting almost eight in 10 inmates, which has prompted the introduction of a new crisis team. The report said outcomes were better for many prisoners at Swansea than at other local prisons The Victorian jail, which opened in 1861, has seen 12 prisoners and 10 staff test positive for coronavirus since March, but there has not been a positive case in a prisoner since April. The inspector said a ""good partnership"" with the local health board, Public Health Wales and the Welsh Government meant every symptomatic prisoner was tested for Covid-19. Prisoners were able to get out of their cells for about 90 minutes a day during the pandemic, with inspectors finding a far greater proportion were involved in ""purposeful activity"" than other prisons. Even in areas where social distancing was possible, most prisoners were not staying 2m apart. But some measures introduced in response to the pandemic had cut bullying, such as canteen orders being delivered to cells. ""We found that managers had made significant progress during the Covid-19 pandemic,"" said Mr Clarke. ""Appropriate priority was given to keeping prisoners in work, maintaining some limited face-to-face education and continuing sentence and risk management. ""Outcomes for many prisoners at Swansea were better than at other local prisons."" The Prison Service said HMP Swansea had ""played its part in the national effort"" to tackle coronavirus and added as ""restrictions are gradually easing, family visits have resumed"".
