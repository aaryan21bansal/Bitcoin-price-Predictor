"Presenter: ""Do you know what a mugwump is?"" Theresa May: ""What I recognise is that what we need in this country is strong and stable leadership."" It's probably fair to say that this is not the stuff of epic election moments - those times that have shaped all our destinies; moments when the country asks itself, truly, who governs?; days when suddenly, a leader, a party's fate is decided. Theresa May, it's also probably fair to assume, did not dream of that question being put to her, nor of having to provide an answer, and, slightly robotically, grimly stick to her prepared script come hell or high water, rather than echo the colourful copy of her foreign secretary. Nor perhaps, was Boris Johnson's first big day out on the campaign trail designed to land the prime minister with questions tonight about her intentions for Syria. Would she just do Donald Trump's bidding if asked to help in another attack? Hypothetical questionsshe resolutely refused to answerat a rally of the party faithful in Yorkshire. Yet few in Tory HQ will be weeping at the product of Boris Johnson's arrival in this campaign, whether it is his Victorian insult hurled at Jeremy Corbyn, which will have upset some voters, (we heard that sentiment that the Tories were ""bullying"" Mr Corbyn on the trail in Essex), nor his admission that it would be ""very difficult"" for the UK to refuse Donald Trump. Whether it was the accidental or deliberate howls of not one, but two dead cats today, the foreign secretary's productive morning attracted yet more attention to one of the issues the Conservatives believe is most dangerous for Jeremy Corbyn. His attitudes towards security and defence, long held, and central to his core supporters, are, the Tories believe, one of his greatest vulnerabilities in this campaign. For floating voters, or many traditional Labour voters, the Tories will have been only too glad to create as much noise as they can.

"The claim:Pensioners would be Â£872 worse off if the triple-lock was taken away. The triple-lock is a commitment to raise the basic state pension by average earnings, inflation or 2.5%, whichever is higher. Reality Check verdict:In the long-term, pensioners would be worse off without the triple-lock. How much worse off would depend on what replaces it. Ian Blackford's figure is a forecast of what would happen if the state pension was only increased in line with inflation predictions for the next five years. He appears to have misspoken, because the research actually said that pensioners would lose Â£817 over five years. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May refused to say whether the Conservatives will keep the same protections for the state pension if they win the general election. Responding to a question from Angus Robertson, the SNP's leader in Westminster, she pledged that pensioners' incomes would continue to rise, but would not specify by how much. The government is currently committed to maintaining the pension triple-lock until 2020, which means it will raise the basic state pension by average earnings, inflation or 2.5%, whichever is higher. Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP are all committed to maintaining the triple-lock. But the Work and Pensions Committee hassaid it should be scrappedon the grounds that it is ""unsustainable"" and ""unfair"" on younger families. It suggested that pensions should rise in line with earnings and be protected against inflation being higher than earnings, but with no minimum annual increase. John Cridland, who published areport on the future of state pensions,externallast month, suggested that the triple-lock would also eventually need to be abandoned in favour of an earnings link. In the long-term, the triple-lock is a big issue, with the number of people of pension age per person of working age forecast by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to rise considerably over the next 50 years. Speaking onBBC Newsnight,Mr Blackford cited research from the House of Commons Library, which found that ""over a five-year period, pensioners would be Â£872 worse off if the triple lock was taken away"". Giving a bit more detail, the library was asked to take Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts for the next five years of inflation and average earnings figures. It then compared what would happen to pensions under different scenarios. It turned out that protecting it in line with with earnings would make almost no difference, because average earnings are expected to be more than 2.5% throughout the period. Protecting only in line with inflation would cost a total of Â£642 over five years for a pensioner on the basic state pension and Â£817 over five years for someone on the new state pension. Mr Blackford presumably remembered that figure wrongly when he said it would cost Â£872. Clearly these figures are based on forecasts for what will happen in the future, which are uncertain. An alternative is to look at how much the triple-lock has cost in the pastas the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has done.,external The triple-lock makes a particularly big difference in periods of relatively low earnings growth and low inflation as the UK has experienced recently. It found that the triple-lock had cost about an extra Â£6bn a year compared with only protecting with earnings and Â£4bn a year compared with adjusting in line with inflation. The IFS made this chart showing the difference in the percentage of national income spent on the state pension with or without the triple-lock, also based on OBR forecasts. The IFS suggested that the government should decide what proportion of earnings it wants the state pension to be and then stick to that, rather than arbitrarily increasing it gradually through the triple-lock. What happens to the triple-lock is highly significant because it has made such a difference in incomes for pensioners compared with workers. In-work benefits are protected less generously than state pensions. The Resolution Foundation brought out research recently suggesting that pensioner households on average arebetter off than working householdsafter housing costs have been taken into account. Taking income after housing costs makes a huge difference because pensioner households are more likely to own their own homes and to have relatively small or paid-off mortgages. This chart from the Resolution Foundation gives income after housing costs for the median pensioner and working household as well as a richer one and a poorer one. Former pensions minister Baroness Altmann told Newsnight that the triple-lock was particularly unfair on younger families because it was putting pressure on the government to keep raising the pension age to keep pension costs down, so the time when they could claim their own pensions was being delayed. Among the options for replacing the triple-lock are: A double-lock, raising state pensions by the higher of earnings or inflation A single-lock based on either earnings or inflation A lock based on earnings, which rises by inflation if inflation is higher than earnings, but then does not enjoy the full increases in earnings in future years to return the state pension to the same proportion of earnings it had previously.

"This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson tells Today the UK could help the US respond to a chemical attack in Syria Britain has long been as much a military ally of the United States as a diplomatic one. Margaret Thatcher allowed Ronald Reagan to use UK airbases to strike Libyan targets in 1986. John Major sent British forces to join the US-led coalition expelling Saddam Hussein's forces from Kuwait in 1991. And more than a decade later, Tony Blair embarked on George Bush's military adventure in Iraq. So it might not seem surprising for Boris Johnson to tell the BBC's Today programme that if President Trump asked for British military support against the Syrian government, it would be hard to say, ""No."" He was being asked how the UK might respond if the United States launched another attack on Syrian government targets. UK 'could join US attack on Syria' Syria war: US warns of 'more' after missile strikes Jeremy Corbyn says US air strikes in Syria 'wrong' Syria chemical 'attack': What we know Earlier this month, the US launched 59 cruise missiles in an attack on an airbase that both the US and the UK claimed had been used to mount a sarin-gas attack on civilians in rebel-held areas in Syria. This video can not be played The Pentagon has released video of missiles being launched from US Navy ships, targeted at a Syrian airfield. This is what the foreign secretary told Today: ""It would be very difficult if the US has a proposal to have some sort of action in response to a chemical weapon attack, and if they come to us and ask us for our support - whether it's with submarine-based cruise missiles in the Mediterranean or whatever it happens to be, as was the case back in 2013 -  in my view and I know this is also the view of the PM, it would be very difficult for us to say, 'No.'"" And to emphasise the point, he added: ""If the Americans were once again to be forced by the actions of the Assad regime - and don't forget it was Assad who unleashed murder upon his own citizens with weapons that were banned almost 100 years ago - if the Americans choose to act again, and they ask us to help, as I said, I think it would be very difficult to say, 'No.'"" Donald Trump had previously rejected calls for further US military intervention in Syria In fact, Mr Johnson has said this before. Last Tuesday he told the House of Commons: ""It is my belief - I stress that no such decision has yet been taken - that were such a request to be made in future and were it to be a reasonable request in pursuit of similar objectives, it would be very difficult for the United Kingdom to say, 'No.'"" Yet no-one noticed Mr Johnson saying this, because a few hours earlier Theresa May had announced her intention to hold a general election, and attention was elsewhere. However, Mr Johnson's remarks are significant for several reasons. He has made explicit what previously was implicit. Sometimes in diplomacy it matters if politicians say things publicly into a microphone. And we now have it on the record that the UK is willing in principle to attack Syrian government targets at the behest of the United States. And this is not just his view: he said it was the prime minister's view too. This is a departure because until now overt UK military action in Syria has been focused on attacking the so-called Islamic State group. MPs voted to allow this, after a debate in December 2015. Syria: The story of the conflict Syria war: A brief guide to who's fighting whom Syria profile - Timeline Since then, the Ministry of Defence says, UK warplanes operating out of Cyprus have carried out 90 air strikes against IS targets. There have been many other sorties over Syria in which UK aircraft and drones have gathered intelligence. In 2013, then Prime Minister David Cameron said he accepted there could be no military action without parliamentary support Mr Johnson also made clear that the government may not necessarily consult Parliament before joining in any US military action. Asked if the decision would have to go before the Commons, Mr Johnson replied: ""I think that needs to be tested."" Pressed on whether going to the House of Commons would be a necessary precondition, Mr Johnson replied: ""I think it would be very difficult for us to say, 'No.' ""How exactly we were able to implement that would be for the government, for the prime minister, to decide."" This is controversial for several reasons. First,in 2013 MPs rejected military action against Syrian forces after similar allegations that they had used chemical weapons. This reinforced a convention - not a legal requirement - that the government must seek parliamentary approval before ordering military action, except in emergencies. And secondly, as of next week, there will be no MPs for the government to consult, after Parliament is dissolved ahead of the UK general election. So, Mr Johnson has clearly allowed for the possibility of military action during the campaign, without parliamentary consultation. Sources close to the foreign secretary insisted that he was not ruling out a parliamentary vote and that the government's position had not changed. But note Mr Johnson's qualifications. He was very careful about spelling out the conditions in which the UK might help. He is talking about UK military action only after a similar chemical weapons attack and only if it were a ""reasonable request"" in pursuit of similar objectives. In other interviews on Thursday morning, Mr Johnson talked about military action that was ""commensurate and appropriate and timely"". So this is no blank cheque. The foreign secretary has given himself plenty of wriggle room.

"The UK will have a general election on 8 June. Here's what you need to know. Ask a questionâ¼ Sorry, your browser cannot display this content. Enter a postcode or seat name  A general election is how the British public decide who they want to represent them in Parliament and, ultimately, run the country. Everyone who is eligible - and registered (see below) - gets to vote for one candidate to represent their local area, which is known in Parliament as a constituency. The candidates standing for election aare usually drawn from political parties, but can also stand as independents. The person with the most votes in a constituency is elected as its MP, to represent that area in the House of Commons. The leader of the political party with the most MPs after the election is expected to be asked by the Queen to become prime minister and form a government to run the country. The leader of the political party with the second highest number of MPs normally becomes leader of the opposition. Once elected, MPs work both in your area - or their constituency - dealing with local matters, and in Parliament, where they vote and help shape law, alongside 649 other MPs. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has called a general election on 8 June - three years earlier than scheduled. Mrs May's official reason for holding an election was to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations. She claimed Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems would try to destabilise and frustrate the process in Parliament. But Mrs May's Conservative Party has a big opinion poll lead over Labour so she will be hoping the election will see her getting a bigger majority in the House of Commons, tightening her grip on power. As things stand, it does not take many Conservative MPs to decide they don't like something the government is doing to get it derailed. Mrs May is also tied to the promises made by the Conservatives at the 2015 election, when David Cameron was prime minister. She has made a few changes - such as backing grammar schools and easing plans to reduce the deficit - but an election gives her the chance to set out her own vision for Britain. Find out the latest picture with theBBC's poll tracker. The latest polls have shown the Conservatives ahead, but that their longstanding lead over Labour has narrowed. The early signs that 2017 will be a tactical election The seats that could decide the election Election 2017 poll tracker: How the parties compare The Conservatives publishedtheir manifesto,externalon 18 May with Theresa May promising a ""mainstream government that will deliver for mainstream Britain"". Labour's manifesto,externalwas launched on 16 May - Jeremy Corbyn pledged to raise the income tax rate for earnings over Â£80,000 and Â£123,000. The Liberal Democrats launchedtheir manifesto,externalon 17 May with leader Tim Farron promising a second EU referendum. The SNP unveiledtheir manifestoon 30 May with a call for a Scottish referendum at the end of the Brexit process. Plaid Cymru promised to give Wales a ""strong voice"" in Brexit when it launchedits manifesto,externalon 16 May. UKIP launchedits manifestoon 25 May with a pledge to tackle radical Islam. In Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein publishedits manifesto on 22 Maysaying a ""new era"" was opening up in Irish politics and theSDLP published its pledgeson 30 May. TheDUP followed on 31 May, saying the union with the UK was ""by far"" the most important issue of the campaign.

British citizens living abroad can vote if they have been registered to vote in the UK in the past 15 years, although the deadline to apply to register now passed, as has the postal vote application deadline. People who will be temporarily abroad can vote by post (although it's too late to apply for a postal vote) or byproxy,external, which means getting someone else to vote for you. It's too late to register to vote in the general election on 8 June. You can register to vote in future electionsonline,external. It's now too late to apply for a postal vote. If you have already applied, post your completed ballot paper and voting statement back as soon as possible so they arrive in time. Alternatively, forms can be handed into your local polling station by 22:00 BST on polling day. Students may be registered at both their home address, and at a university or college address. It all depends whether you spend an equal amount of time at each and, ultimately, the electoral registration officer will decide whether or not someone can register at both. At the general election, it is an offence to vote more than once. Anyone who has moved since they last voted, must register at their new address - paying council tax does not mean you are registered to vote. If you did not re-register in time, you may be able to still vote at the address you originally registered at. If this is too far away, you can always arrange a proxy vote. You can vote either by post or by proxy - which is where you appoint someone else to register your vote on your behalf. To do that you candownload the form here,external.

Details of where to find your local registration officeare on this site,external. Theresa May had said she wanted to wait until 2020 for the next scheduled election but changed her mind, in a move that took everyone by surprise. Prime ministers used to be free to hold an election whenever they felt like it - but under the 2011 Fixed Term Parliaments Act, a general election is supposed to take place every five years on the first Thursday in May, which is why the next one was scheduled for May 2020. But an election can be called ahead of schedule for two reasons - if there is a vote of ""no confidence"" in the current government, or if MPs vote for an early election by a two-thirds majority. Mrs May chose the second option, which was overwhelmingly backed by MPs, by 522 votes to 13. You have to go back to 1966 and Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson for the last example of a government holding an election after a short time in power to increase its number of MPs. In 1974, there were two elections eight months apart - but that was under different circumstances because no party won a majority in the Commons in the first one. UK snap election: Five things you need to know A 2017 general election means that the subsequent election is now due in 2022. That's because the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, which decrees that elections take place every five years, is still in force. But an election could be held at any time if two-thirds of MPs vote for it, as they did this time. A future government could also decide to scrap the Fixed Term Parliaments Act - the Conservative manifesto includes plans to do so. Parliament broke up on 3 May to allow just over a month of full-pelt campaigning ahead of 8 June. The general election didn't stop voting taking place in 34 local council areas in England, all 32 councils in Scotland and all 22 councils in Wales on 4 May. The Conservatives gained control of 11 councils and Labour lost seven, with UKIP losing the 145 council seats it had been defending, and gaining just one. In addition, six areas in England voted for newly-created ""combined local authority mayors"". The Conservatives won four mayoral races and Labour two. The Manchester Gorton by-election, caused by the death of Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, had been due to take place on 4 May but will now be held at the same time as the general election on 8 June. Britain is still on course to officially leave the European Union on Friday 29 March 2019. Negotiations with other EU nations are not due to start until June, meaning the election will probably be over and a new government in place before any serious talking gets under way in Brussels. The Conservative Party says this is a ""one-off chance to hold an election while the European Union agrees its negotiating position"". If Mrs May wins by a big margin in the UK, she will see it as a vote of confidence in her strategy for leaving the EU. But if her slender House of Commons majority is cut further or she loses the election - with anti-Brexit parties such as the Liberal Democrats getting many more MPs - then the UK's current Brexit strategy will be up for grabs. There's a summary ofwhere Britain's parties stand on Brexit, if you'd like to read it. There are lots of opinion polls carried out in the run-up to a general election. Their methods vary but they usually survey the views of at least 1,000 people to find which political party is likely to get most votes. They give each party a percentage rating based on how many people said they would vote for them. A poll tracker amalgamates the results of several opinion polls to try to get as clear a picture as possible. TheBBC tracker, for example, takes the results of the latest seven opinion polls, on a rolling basis, and works out the median (middle) rating for each party. When you hear someone talking about one party having a poll lead over another - they are talking about the gap between the percentage ratings of the parties in the latest poll or set of polls. The opinion polls were wrong about the 2015 general election and the industry has yet to fully fix the problems that caused those inaccuracies. So they should be taken with a pinch of salt. But the gap between Labour and the Conservatives in the polls leading up to the 2015 election was between 0% and 6%, and in the end the Conservatives did better than polls suggested. The Conservatives have a bigger lead than that now, although it has narrowed recently. It's not a straightforward process to work it out. Many Labour MPs have ""safe"" seats - they got thousands more votes than their nearest rivals in 2015, meaning they could lose votes and still retain their place in the Commons. The Conservatives have fewer ""safe"" seats than Labour. They pulled off their surprise 2015 general election victory by winning seats just where they needed them, such as in previously Liberal Democrat-held constituencies in the south-west of England. The danger for Labour is that it piles up votes in seats it already holds - something that happened in 2015 - rather than in areas represented by rival parties. This makes it harder for it to suffer large-scale losses, but it also makes it relatively harder for it to make big gains. No. They were not due to be introduced until 2020.A public consultation is under waywith final proposals set to be made in 2018. The main parties faced a race against time to get candidates in place and some streamlined their normal selection procedures, with more candidates chosen centrally. Some 68 parties and 191 independent candidates contribute to a total of 3,304 people standing for Parliament this year - a decrease of 664 from 2015. Find your constituency and candidates A-Z constituency guide Oh yes - it's proved a good chance for people to get out, or try to return to, frontline politics. Some of the big names stepping down include former Conservative chancellor George Osborne - who is now editing the London Evening Standard newspaper - and ex-party chairman Sir Eric Pickles. Labour's Alan Johnson is retiring, and former health secretary Andy Burnham will not stand after becoming Mayor of Greater Manchester. Some former MPs are aiming to get back, though - including former Lib Dem ministers Sir Vince Cable and Ed Davey. And others are throwing their hat into the ring for the first time, including blogger Jack Monroe - who is campaigning over the NHS - while UKIP's Paul Nuttall is among his party's best known hopefuls. The Conservatives have 330 seats, Labour 229, the SNP 54, the Lib Dems nine and Plaid Cymru three. The Green Party has one MP. UKIP have no MPs after their sole representative left the party and became an independent. For Northern Ireland, the Democratic Unionist Party have eight MPs; Sinn Fein, who don't take up their seats, four; the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) three; and the Ulster Unionist Party two.

"UKIP leader Paul Nuttall has confirmed he will stand as a candidate at the general election. He told LBC Radio he would announce which constituency he was contesting within the next 48 hours. Mr Nuttall, who sits in the European Parliament, had previously suggested he might not stand in 8 June's contest, saying UKIP leaders had done well outside the Commons. He failed to beat Labour at a by-election in Stoke-on-Trent last month. Which MPs are quitting - and who might stand? At a UKIP campaign event on Monday, he repeatedly refused to say whether he would stand in the general election. But on Thursday he told LBC: ""As the leader of the party, I will be, obviously, leading the party into battle as I have done many times in the past"". He said he would stand in a seat where ""we think we can give it a good go"". He defined success for UKIP as improving on the single seat the party had won in 2015 - Douglas Carswell's victory in Clacton. Stressing the need to ""get people over the line this time"", he said: ""The one thing that we learned from 2015 is that vote share, although it is nice to get four million votes and 13% was wonderful, there is no prize for second place in the first-past-the-post system. ""I would like us to get more MPs elected than we got in 2015. I think it's doable. I think what we have got to do is target our resources sensibly, that means both in resources and in terms of manpower."" Mr Nuttall had previously said he did not want to be tied to one constituency during the general election campaign, as happened to his predecessor, Nigel Farage, in 2015 in Thanet, where he failed to unseat the Conservatives.

"Boris Johnson's sister Rachel has joined the Liberal Democrats to fight against a ""hard Brexit"",according to Channel 4 News.,external Ms Johnson reportedly had talks with the party about standing at the general election for them in a target seat. But she was unable to do so because of a rule requiring candidates to have been members for at least a year. Her brother, the foreign secretary, played a leading role in the campaign to get the UK to leave the EU. But their father, Stanley, a former MEP, and Tory MP brother Jo all backed Remain.

"This video can not be played The prime minister sticks relentlessly to her ""strong and stable"" slogan As the general election approaches, MPs start to repeat themselves. Over and over again. In every interview. Why do they do it? The final Prime Minister's Questions before the general election had just finished when an exasperated Paul Flynn asked the Speaker whether a microchip had been planted into Tory MPs that makes them say the words ""strong and stable"" every 18 seconds. The veteran Labour MP had a point - the Conservatives' slogan had just been used 16 times, including a hat-trick of mentions inside a single question by backbencher Michael Fabricant. In the 10 days since the general election was announced (with a speech outside 10 Downing Street containing three ""strong and stables""), it's cropped up 25 times in the House of Commons. It's also been crowbarred into interviews by Tory MPs and ministers, repeated in speeches and tweeted endlessly. Mrs May used it seconds into her first stump speech of the campaign, in Bolton - and then, in case anyone missed it, another 11 times. Laura Kuenssberg: PM sticks to script as Boris Johnson enters election fray Rival parties have attempted to turn the tactic on its head and use it in their attacks on the government. So why are we subjected to such a barrage? Some MPs have found creative ways to plug their slogan Things can get a bit surreal on the campaign trail A clue lies in the calculation by Barack Obama's campaign manager Jim Messina, who has reportedly been hired by Theresa May's election team. He has said voters only spent four minutes a week thinking about politics. So politicians keep saying their key messages in the hope that they will squeeze into that four-minute window. As a result, anyone tasked with following campaigns in detail ends up repeating phrases like ""long-term economic plan"" and ""cost of living crisis"" in their sleep. ""You have to do it over and over again,"" says Tony Blair's former director of communications Lance Price. ""It doesn't matter that journalists are sick and tired of hearing it - the point is that voters have to hear it a lot before it sinks into their subconscious and starts to have some resonance."" A phrase doesn't need to mean much, he thinks. Tony Blair's team championed the ""on message"" campaign style ""Blair would say 'the future, not the past' - which was almost completely meaningless, but he said it over and over again and it portrayed the Tories as harking back to the past, while Labour was shiny and new."" It's safe to say that Jeremy Corbyn, who promised a ""new kind of politics"" on becoming leader, has not followed the New Labour playbook. He tested out some punchy phrases in that final PMQs (saying the Tories were ""strong against the weak and weak against the strong"") but Labour has so far not adopted the relentless repetition approach. PR expert Mark Borkowski is not impressed by what he calls ""simplified electioneering"", saying that while people might be ""hypnotised by the repetitive, simple nature of it"", it could increase cynicism about politicians among voters who have had enough of elections. ""It's fashionable to think they can control the message with a single word, but I think people want more,"" he said. ""If anything it's going to do more to perpetuate election ennui."" He's not alone in wishing for more substantial speeches. ""The party machine is too risk-averse to countenance real speech,"" complained classics professor Mary Beard before the last general election. ""In ancient Greece and Rome, on the other hand, the art of rhetoric was at the heart of political life. ""Recapturing some of that lost art might be a good idea, and might get us beyond pretty much indistinguishable soundbites."" But for Mr Borkowski, the US election, and Donald Trump's promise to ""make America great again"", is helping shape this campaign. ""Everybody seems to be completely obsessed with the success of Trump,"" he says. ""Although people won't admit it, they are very close to actually mimicking what they think was successful for him."" We won't know for another six weeks what has worked for the UK's political leaders - which leaves plenty of time for more ""strong and stables"" to be hurled our way.

"Back in 1993, a rapidly rising Tony Blair caught the public's attention by pledging to be ""tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime"". Liverpool toddler Jamie Bulger had been murdered and violence would soon peak at around four million incidents a year. Records show the public werereally worried about crime,external. Another big story that year was the creation of the European Single Market - and nowhere near the same number of people were bothered about that. How times change. Today, more than half of those polled say the EU is one of the most important issue facing Britain today. Only 8% are concerned by crime. But the latest release of data from the Office for National Statistics includes somepotentially worrying signsahead of an election where crime is almost certainly not going to figure highly in the minds of voters, let alone the parties after their vote. For years, the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW), the main and most comprehensive measure of what crime people say they experience, has been charting a long-term fall in offences which is consistent with what's been happening in every other comparable nation. The CSEW says that traditional crime is broadly static at just over six million offences in the year to December 2016. When you add to that experimental data on cyber and fraud, it comes to 11.5m crimes. There are holes in the CSEW that are difficult to fill - it doesn't cover all types of victims and all types of offences and only recently began asking people about fraud and computer-related crime. But, broadly speaking, it's considered to be a good measure of the long-term trends. At the same time, police recorded crime has gone up to 4.8m offences - a rise of 9% - and it has seen rises in both serious violence and ""traditional"" offences such as burglary and robbery. Those figures - the data collected from what coppers actually know - have been having a torrid time. There have been a series of revamps and changes in methodology amid concerns that not all forces are recording accurately what's going on - particularly in relation to violence. The resulting data still isn't considered to be 100% trust-worthy as a ""national statistic"". And just to further confuse the picture, there's an entirely independent and highly regarded measure of violence from hospitals that saysit has been falling substantially. So that's as clear as mud. What's going on? Some of the 9% increase in police recorded crime is almost certainly down to changes in how things are being recorded, but the ONS also stresses that those tweaks can't account for all of the change On violence, the CSEW estimates there were 29 incidents per 1,000 people - a 4% rise on last year which may not be statistically significant (there are always blips up and down in data). Police on the other hand recorded a 19% rise in all violent offences - up to 1.1m incidents over the same year. While the overwhelming number of violent incidents result in either no or minor physical injury, there are some concerning rises with guns and knives. Firearms offences went up 13%, although all incidents involving guns are still down almost 50% on a decade ago. Knife crime has gone up 14% during the last year, returning to levels last seen six years ago when it became a political and policing priority. Both of these rises have already been concerning chief constables, with the new Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick saying tackling these offences may define her tenure. As for fraud and cyber crimes, there are some more concerning figures here. The crime survey hasn't yet collected two complete years of data on these offences - but statisticians already think that it's a rising trend based on other sources. There were about 5.4m fraud offences in the year to December, with almost 2m of those being computer related, such as online scams or malware used to trick people into providing access to their online accounts. The National Fraud Intelligence Bureau recorded a 4% increase in offences, but it's not quite clear what's going on nationwide because not all victims come forward. And, just as seriously, not all police forces are geared up to understand what's going on in their patch. This raises real strategic resources questions for the police: while your average detective knows a thing or two about gathering fingerprints and tracking burglars - spreadsheets and malware are a totally different world. Marian Fitzgerald, a leading criminologist at the University of Kent, says crime stats have become ""a dog's breakfast"". She argues that not only has the crime survey failed to properly inform the public about the emergence of new types of crimes, the police have been caught massaging figures under pressure from successive governments. ""I think the police figures stabilised after the outcry in 2014 when the police were shown to have been fiddling their figures, particularly in relation to violence and sexual offences,"" says Professor Fitzgerald. ""Any rises that we are seeing now are genuine. Improvements [to police recording practices] stabilised a long time ago."" So is society becoming more criminal, more dangerous? The ONS is working onways to assess the impact of crime,external, including a measure of the severity that different crimes cause:  an attempted break-in to a shed to nick a lawn mower is wholly different to an act of violent domestic abuse. Tom Gash, an author and former Whitehall adviser on crime, says: ""If you take a centuries-long perspective, [the figures ] are great news. There have been radical changes in the reduction of violence in modern society. ""You could discount [the most recent figures] and say it is a very short-term thing, but the thing that worries me is that this is a rise in violent crime that emulates the US. ""The crime drop in America preceded the crime drop we saw here. ""The truth is we don't really know what's going on. We're not sure if this has been caused by cuts in policing or mental health or youth services, or some broader societal factor that we haven't yet worked out.""

"Presidential elections are always something of a national Rorschach test. The reaction to candidates, like the perception of inkblots, helps to divulge the nation's character, underlying disorders and emotional condition. Donald Trump's unexpected victory showed that America had a split personality. It also revealed that, among his 62 million supporters, rage and fear were over-riding emotions. Make America Great Again not only became a mission statement but a nostalgic catch-all. For many of his white working-class supporters, it implied a return to an era when the homeland was more homogenised and the world was less globalised. The first 100 days of an administration, though in many ways a bogus measure, can also be diagnostic. They can reveal the character of a presidency and set the tone. Also they are indicative of the health of US democracy: the functioning of its institutions, executive, legislative and judicial; the workability of the US constitution and the dispersion of political, economic and cultural power. Inauguration day was a celebration for some, a convulsion for others. What is the state of the nation now? What has become clear since Donald Trump delivered his inaugural address is that he has changed the presidency more than the presidency has changed him. The vocabulary of President Trump, if not all his policies, is much the same as that of candidate Trump. To the White House he has brought the same aggression and plain speaking that characterised his insurgent campaign. Social media remains his favoured conduit with the American people. Twitter is to Trump what television was to JFK and radio was to FDR. But it is his means of expression, more than the utilisation of a new medium, that marks such a break from the past. At his inaugural ball he vowed to keep tweeting. By choosing Frank Sinatra's My Way for his first dance, he also gave us a musical clue as to how he would govern. Trump would be Trump. The anti-politician had morphed into the anti-president. His so-far unsubstantiated allegation that Barack Obama ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower - ""Bad (or sick) guy!"" he tweeted - emphasised how he does not feel bound by presidential protocols or conventions. Here he disdained the longstanding tradition that incumbent presidents avoid savage attacks on their predecessors. From his ongoing refusal to release his tax returns to his stonewalling of requests to disclose visitor logs at the White House, he has indicated normal rules do not apply to him. All this continues to horrify his critics but not most of his supporters. They voted for unorthodoxy, and seem to have granted him dispensation to flout norms so long as he delivers results. And yet, he has received highest marks when he is at his most conventionally presidential. His speech to the joint session of Congress, which was similar in language and tone to normal State of the Union addresses, was probably the highpoint of his first 100 days. It got far better reviews than his inaugural, both from Republicans and some Democrats. His decision to strike Syria also trod the path of orthodoxy. Cool-headed and cogent, his late-night statement explaining his decision to strike was also standard presidential fare. Even some of his detractors remarked how in these two moments he truly assumed the mantles of president and commander-in-chief. Lauded by many Democrats who wished Obama had enforced his red line on chemical weapons, the strike on Syria angered some hardline loyalists. Ann Coulter, Laura Ingraham and Michael Cernovich, a self-styled ""American nationalist"", were dismayed that pictures of dying children moved him so easily and that he acted like a neo-conservative rather than a neo-isolationist. Unsurprisingly perhaps, conformism infuriates the alt-right. This video can not be played The divided newlyweds split over Trump's performance Flip-flops on Syria, Chinese currency manipulation and Nato have made Trump's foreign policy appear erratic and incoherent. The confusion over whether or not his administration continues to support a two-state solution in the Middle East displayed a lack of clarity that perplexed foreign diplomats. His congratulations to the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following a referendum granting him more authoritarian powers was markedly different from the cautious reaction of European leaders. Ahead of the French presidential election, Trump said of Marine Le Pen ""she's the strongest on borders and she's the strongest on what's been going on in France"". His words, which came close to an endorsement, prompted this shocked response from former Bush speechwriter David Frum: ""Collect jaw from floor, reinsert in head."" Had one of his predecessors implied support for a far-right candidate, the political storm would have lasted days, and possibly overshadowed their entire presidency. But the response to Trump's remarks was more like a passing shower. It spoke of how quickly the abnormal has become quotidian under this presidency. There's an argument to be made that Trump is at his most successful in foreign affairs when he's at his most unpredictable for the simple reason that is when he's most feared. The Assad regime will surely hesitate before ordering another chemical strike. Nato's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he's already seeing the effect of Trump's focus on financial burden-sharing within the military alliance. The American aid worker Aya Hijazi was released after three years in detention only when Trump raised her case with President Sisi. At the United Nations, there's a new focus on reform, especially of peacekeeping operations. This is partly because there is a new reformist Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, but mainly because of the fear that the US, by far the organisation's biggest donor, could pull funding. Trump has brought a fear factor to the American presidency often absent during the Obama years. Richard Nixon labelled this kind of strategic unpredictability the Madman Theory, and saw it as an essential diplomatic tool. Communist bloc leaders, the theory went, would not provoke America because of the unpredictability of the president's response. It might be crazed. Nuclear even. But the fact that Nixon used this approach in Vietnam shows its shortcomings. In the present context, it's a risky approach to apply to North Korea, but the Trump administration clearly believes ""the era of strategic patience"" towards Kim Jong-un is over, and that sabre rattling will jolt Beijing into pressuring Pyongyang. The next 100 days, presumably, will tell. Overall, there's a ""good cop, bad cop"" dynamic to the Trump administration's diplomacy. Mainstream foreign policy types such as Defence Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson adopt the more conventional approach. Trump lends menace, often through his tweets. Sometimes the very administration seems to have a split personality. Yet the first 100 days have probably yielded more results in the foreign realm than the domestic. Noticeable in these first 100 days has been the corporatisation of the presidency. There's a chairman-of-the-board feel to his daily routine, with its meetings and photo opportunities that often place him in a leather-backed chair in the presidential boardroom - the West Wing basically has two, the Roosevelt Room and the Cabinet Room - surrounded by corporate chiefs. His cabinet is also packed with fellow billionaires and multi-millionaires. This raises the question of whether a super-rich president at the head of a super-rich cabinet can remain a working-class hero in the all-important Rust Belt. After spending time last week in the Ohio River Valley, which is dotted with derelict steelworks, what struck me was how few of his supporters cared. ""No-one works for a poor man,"" said one Trump devotee. Some of the Trump Cabinet and his senior advisers recieve a briefing on the US air strike on Syria There's a nagging sense one business that's undoubtedly seen an uptick is Trump Inc. Potential conflicts of interests abound, and it is hard sometimes to differentiate where the presidency ends and the family business begins. There's been criticism that Trump spends so much time at resorts owned by the Trump Organization. The mixing of business with the presidency could yet be his undoing . An aim of staffing the administration with so many executives was to vest government with corporate know-how and efficiency. But this presidential start-up has been surprisingly accident-prone, critics would say incompetent. What has Trump achieved so far? Has Trump kept his campaign promises? Seven ways the world has changed since Trump became president Whether with big-ticket items such as the original travel ban or fairly trivial matters, like misspelling Theresa May's name in a White House memo handed to reporters, it has often shown itself to be slapdash. Turf battles between hardline figures like Steve Bannon and moderates like Jared Kushner also belie Trump's boast that it is a ""fine-tuned machine"". David Brooks, a conservative columnist for the New York Times, has labelled it ""a golden age of malfunction"". When a new administration fumbles what should have been a pro-forma presidential statement marking Holocaust Remembrance Day you sense there is a problem. When the White House spokesman claims that Hitler did not use chemical weapons against his own people, it suggests it has lost the historical plot. These last examples showed not only a disregard for detail but also an apparent disdain for truth. The first 100 days has produced a litany of falsehoods. A scorecard compiled by thewebsite Politifact,externalfound that of Trump's statements 69% were either mostly false, false or ""pants on fire"". Alternative facts: Kellyanne Conway was lampooned when she first used this Orwellian-sounding phrase, but it perfectly captured the twilight zone of truth often found at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Under Donald Trump, the White House is no longer a reliable source. Victories are often lost in the swirl of controversy. Illegal crossings over the southern border have fallen sharply, by 40% during the first month of Trump's presidency, according to the Department of Homeland Security. That's the steepest decline since 2009. With immigration arrests up by almost a third in the first month, there's a feeling among his supporters that he is delivering on his pledge to protect America's border, even if construction has not yet started on his famed wall. Trump would argue he has already made the homeland safer. A by-product of Trump's troubled presidential launch has been to burnish the reputations of his predecessors. For Democrats, the idolatry of Barack Obama gathers pace. George Herbert Walker Bush, recently ailing in hospital, has become even more of a revered national elder. His son, George W, the one-time Toxic Texan, has been subject to some speedy historical revisionism. Not only has his newly published collection of portraits of wounded warriors won acclaim, as a work of the hand and the heart, his reported remarks at Trump's inauguration - ""That was some weird sh**"" - have come close to making him a folk hero of the left. Might Trump one day be subject to this kind of reassessment? The hostile commentary on him is similar to the scorn heaped on Ronald Reagan. Yet the movie star president is now widely seen as the leader who, by winning the Cold War, ended America's long national nightmare after Vietnam and Watergate. Lyndon Baines Johnson was pilloried as a racist vulgarian, but nonetheless enacted transformative legislation such as the 1964 Civil Rights Act, dismantling segregation, and launching Medicare. Remember this guy? History remembers John F Kennedy's early presidency for the elegance of his inaugural address and the photogenic beauty of his New Frontier, but his first months in office were full of missteps. They included the Bay of Pigs, a string of congressional setbacks and a disastrous summit with Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna, which emboldened the Soviet leader to build the Berlin Wall. While Trump cannot yet boast much of a record of accomplishment in these first 100 days, there are still 1361 to go. A ""civics lesson from hell"" was how the Harvard academic Louis Menand described the contested aftermath of the 2000 presidential election, with its hanging chads, thwarted recounts and litigation. Not since the Supreme Court handed down its ruling in Bush versus Gore has the US constitution faced such a stress test. Now, as then, we have learned where power in America truly lies, and how the checks and balances hard-wired into the US system operate in practice. Donald Trump's executive power has continually been constrained. After signing that early executive order banning entrants from seven mainly Muslim countries, the courts intervened to block him. It was an early constitutional test. But although Trump railed against the ""so-called judges"" who thwarted him, using unusually vehement language, his administration abided by the court's decision and kept within the law. With the checks and balances working as the founding fathers intended, a constitutional crisis was averted. With Trumpcare, it wasn't the courts that blocked Trump but Congress. As he sought to repeal and replace Obamacare, Trump could not even secure a simple majority in a House of Representatives under Republican control. Trump's promise to repeal Obamacare was stymied - by fellow Republicans Had his healthcare proposals cleared that hurdle in the lower house, parts of the reform package would have run into trouble in the Senate. There the Republicans also enjoy a majority but not one big enough to enact bills into law without bipartisan support. With the legislative branch restraining the executive branch, again the constitution worked as intended. The Republican leadership, frustrated by these checks, successfully removed one of them: the use of the filibuster in blocking nominees to America's highest court - in this instance, Trump's nominee Neil Gorsuch. This did not involve an amendment to the constitution, rather a revision of Senate rules, but it was nonetheless momentous. This nuclear option, as it is called, delivered a clear win for the president: the elevation of Judge Gorsuch to the bench. However, the filibuster remains intact to block his legislative agenda, and Democrats will use it to thwart Trump. In recent years, as Washington has become more ungovernable, there's been a growing literature about the inoperability of the constitution, and how its checks and balances have acted more like spanners in the works. Just as Republicans, the great practitioners of the politics of No, used the constitution to stymie Barack Obama, Democrats are relying upon it to impede Donald Trump. For them, the constitution must now seem timeless and timely. A number of Democrats have told me that the genius of the Founding Fathers was to anticipate this kind of presidency. In these first 100 days, we have been reminded of the power of states and municipalities. We have seen an inversion of the doctrine of states' rights. For decades, states' rights was the battle-cry of white supremacists determined to uphold segregation in defiance of federal court orders demanding integration. Now progressive states are using this principle. Some of the biggest cities in the country, including Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Washington DC, are wilfully obstructing Trump's immigration crackdown. Thus, sanctuary cities have become to the progressive left what segregationist citadels were to the racist right, emblematic battlefields in a tug of war between local government and the federal government. Similar battle-lines have been marked out over climate change. Protest power has also emerged as a significant force, as something akin to a national passion play has unfolded on the streets. The sea of pink pussy hats at the massive women's marches on the first weekend of the presidency vividly highlighted a new sense of personal political empowerment: people ready to take matters into their own hands. The speed at which demonstrators congregated at US airports in the immediate aftermath of the ban surely had an emboldening effect on the state attorneys general who successfully challenged it in the courts. The death certificate of Trumpcare may have been signed in the House of Representatives, but mortal wounds were inflicted in those angry town meetings, which alarmed Republican lawmakers. Maybe one of the reasons President Donald Trump has not yet returned to Trump Tower in Manhattan is the fear of massive demonstrations in the city of his birth. For the past eight years, popular anger was on the right of US politics. Now it is on the left. The pertinent political question over the coming years will be to what extent the Democratic Party can harness this street agitation. Will there be a Tea-Party-style mobilisation of progressives that translates into real political power? Or are opponents of Donald Trump pinning more faith in pressure groups than the Democratic Party? 100 Voters for 100 Days Five ways Trump has changed the US What executive actions has Trump taken? The American Civil Liberties Union, for example, has witnessed a fundraising bonanza. The ACLU raked in $24m (Â£18.7m) in online donations the weekend after the first travel ban, six times the amount it normally raises in a year. Constrained by Congress, the courts and his own party, so far this has not been an imperial presidency, the phrase coined by the historian Arthur M Schlesinger Jr to describe the Nixon White House, which was accused, even before the Watergate break-in, of pushing constitutional bounds. Rather it has been an inhibited presidency, in which Donald Trump has been made all too aware of the limits of his executive power. Donald Trump's promise to Make America Great Again was primarily an economic pledge, and there were early signs of a Trump Bump on Wall Street and Main Street. Just three trading days after the new president took the oath of office, the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke through the 20,000 mark for the first time in its history. Investors expected him to slash corporate taxes and set fire to business regulations. Not since 2000, a report suggested last month, has consumer confidence been so buoyant. This rosy soft data has not been matched by hard economic data. The US economy added just 98,000 jobs in March, almost half of what some economists expected. Industrial production and housing starts were lower than expected. Retail sales, which should have risen with consumer confidence, actually fell by 0.2% in March, their first decline in over a year. The markets, having watched the healthcare debacle, are no longer so confident Trump can deliver lower corporate tax rates and a $1tn infrastructure spend. Barron's, the weekly financial newspaper, recently opined: ""Trump bump, we hardly knew ye."" As for the impact of Trump's ""Buy American, Hire American"" doctrine, it is too early to judge. Industry groups have voiced concerns it will raise costs, making it prohibitively expensive to build the new bridges and roads. The tech sector is worried Hire American policies will block or discourage high-skilled immigrants. The tourism industry is reporting a ""Trump Slump,"" because of the off-putting effect of the travel ban and its author. After signalling his willingness to name and shame corporations accused of exporting US jobs abroad or stiffing the federal government, there's evidence it has had a chastening effect. Presumably, no senior executive of a publicly traded company wants to reach for their smartphone in the morning to find their name on his Twitter feed, if only because of the effect it can have on the share price. Boeing, a company that Trump shamed publicly during the transition, says it's made progress with the administration over bringing down the costs of the replacement for Air Force One. The Trump administration also claims to have created jobs by pressuring major corporations to invest in new American plants. Most of these expansion plans were in place, however, before Barack Obama left office. That's true of Ford's Michigan investment, ExxonMobil's Gulf Coast expansion, and Intel's Arizona plant, all of which were touted by the administration as totems of Trumpism. Arguably, the main effect of his self-congratulatory tweets about saving US jobs has been political rather than economic. It has persuaded blue-collar voters that this billionaire populist is battling on their behalf. As for his tweets lambasting business? They've created a love/fear relationship with the corporate sector, which welcomes his deregulation and proposed tax cuts but not necessarily his efforts to roll back globalisation. One sector that has undoubtedly benefited from a Trump bump is the media. The New York Times and Washington Post have seen subscriptions soar. CNN, a network of which obituaries were being written only a few years ago, is enjoying a ratings windfall. Twitter, whose once stagnant user numbers have risen, is finally winning again. Despite high-profile exits, Fox News remains the most influential news channel in America, if only because its breakfast show Fox and Friends is what Trump watches in the morning. Overall, the response of the US journalistic community to Trump's presidency has been to become more adversarial. Reporters like Jim Acosta, anchors like Jake Tapper, and even mild-mannered Wolf Blitzer have adopted a more hard-edged approach. The New York Times has replaced bland headlines with more judgemental wording. A headline three days into his presidency signalled its new approach: Trump Repeats Lie About Popular Vote in Meeting With Lawmakers. Elsewhere, cultural lines are being blurred, an inevitable response perhaps to a president who turned politics in a new reality show genre. Comedians, faced with the dilemma of satirising a self-satirising White House, have adopted a more journalistic persona. John Oliver and Samantha Bee mix gags with serious reportage, much of it directed against Trump. How is Donald Trump doing Ohio? The grassroots movement looking to unseat Republicans Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake Stephen Colbert, who struggled at first as David Letterman's successor after shedding his mock right-wing persona, may overtake apolitical Jimmy Fallon in the late-night ratings. The mimicry of Alec Baldwin and the casting of Melissa McCarthy as Sean ""Spicey"" Spicer have once again made SNL appointment viewing. In the arts, the expectation is that Trump will produce a burst of creativity, in line with the ""Take your broken heart, make it into art"" plea from Meryl Streep at this year's Golden Globes. But much of that art, whether paintings, screenplays or novels, may still be unfinished. This video can not be played President Trump joked about the special relationship with the UK after the BBC political editor's question Just as we await the great Trump-era movie - a Doctor Strangelove, The Deer Hunter or Wall Street - there's not yet been a great Trump-inspired novel. For now, literary classics are filling the void. George Orwell's 1984, with an assist from Kellyanne Conway's ""alternative facts"", rose to the top of best-seller lists. Philip Roth's The Plot Against America, which imagines as president Charles Lindbergh, the aviator who became the spokesman of the America First Committee in the early years of World War Two, has also enjoyed a revival. Hulu is streaming a dramatisation of Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, which imagines a totalitarian America. On Broadway, a stage adaptation of 1984 is in the works.  Then there has been the unexpected success of Come From Away, a feel good 9/11 musical of all things, which tells the story of the nearly 7,000 airline passengers stranded in Gander, Newfoundland, in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Foot-tapping and tear-jerking, the show is all about making outsiders feel at home. Rather pointedly, the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took Ivanka Trump to see it. Next month unveils the fifth season of House of Cards, but in the wake of accusations of Russian meddling, its plotlines, once considered so outlandish, now seem more run-of-the-mill, a case perhaps of life overtaking art. To journey from the major coastal cities into the American heartland feels right now like travelling between different countries. There has long been two Americas, one that favours pick-up trucks over Prius hybrids, Walmart over Whole Foods, Duck Dynasty over This American Life. This age of Trump, as well as accentuating those divisions, has brought with it new identifying markers. Do you wear a scarlet Make America Great Again baseball cap or a pink woollen hat? Would you buy an Ivanka Trump dress? Do you agree with Alex Jones, the host of the far-right Infowars, or Van Jones, CNN's leading pundit? Or, more simply, do you have faith in the president? Increasingly, how you respond to Trump determines which America you inhabit. Barack Obama entered office vowing to bring together red and blue state America, though he was a deeply polarising figure who singularly failed in that endeavour. Donald Trump has not tried particularly hard to be a unifying figure. His travel largely has been to states that voted for him. Many of his appearances outside the White House and Mar-a-Lago have essentially been campaign rallies. His Attorney General Jeff Sessions, angry that a judge had challenged the latest travel ban, even referred to Hawaii, which achieved statehood in 1959, as ""an island in the Pacific"". My own travels around the country, mainly into the Bible and Rust Belt, suggest he remains strong in the regions that sent him to the White House. Last week on the Ohio River Valley, businessmen told me how the Trump Bump is for real. They see it on their balance sheets, with the relaxation of Environmental Protection Agency rules over coal often cited as the reason for the turnaround. This video can not be played Trump's presidency a big hit in Rust Belt Many Rust Belt voters continue to adore Trump because liberals hate him so. They voted for the billionaire partly to punch sneering bicoastal liberals in the nose. They are enjoying the sight of elite blood being shed in such quantities. Because of the shadow cast by the Russian allegations, these first 100 days have sometimes felt like the final days of an ailing administration. Trump is routinely cast as a modern-day Richard Nixon. Yet while it is difficult sometimes to see how this administration can remain viable in its present form, it is harder to imagine how it would be brought to a premature end. Barring some catastrophic revelation emerging from the FBI's investigation into Team Trump's alleged links with the Kremlin or some massive financial scandal, the Republican leadership is unlikely to move against him. In the unlikely event that it launched impeachment proceedings, here the constitution is his friend. It is hard to dislodge an incumbent president. The Founding Fathers, who came up with a governing model that has constrained Trump, also came up with an electoral model, the Electoral College, which has already helped him and may do so again. That will be true if the Rust Belt remains a stronghold. My overwhelming sense, based on the popular vote in November and opinion polls since, is that more Americans are anti-Trump than pro. But my sense also is that many blue-collar battlers remain fiercely loyal. So to write him off would be to repeat the same analytical mistake commentators have made since he first announced for the presidency, that of underestimation. For while Democrats regard their new president as a national embarrassment, many of his supporters continue to view him as a potential national saviour. One hundred days into a presidency the like of which this country has never seen before, the state of the union is disunion. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Auliya Atrafi found fighting continues close to where the MOAB hit On 13 April the US dropped one of its largest non-nuclear bombs on a tunnel complex used by so-called Islamic State militants in eastern Afghanistan. It was the first time such a weapon had been used in battle. The BBC's Auliya Atrafi has been to the area to see if it really had any impact in the battle against IS. The view from the hills overlooking the Mamand Valley is beautiful. Green fields and trees fill the valley floor. Ahead, the valley narrows and hills become mountains. In the distance rises the magnificent Spin-Ghar, the White Mountain, which marks the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. But there was no chance of quiet contemplation when I visited this area of Nangarhar province. Above, three types of American fighter planes were circling and dropping bombs. One bomb hit the narrow part of the valley. It was there, a young soldier told me, that the weapon known as the Mother of All Bombs (MOAB) had been used. I was confused. Reports of the bomb had made me think that it had wiped out the IS stronghold here in Achin district. I assumed that US and Afghan troops would have sealed off the area and that IS (or Daesh, as it is known here) would be in disarray. An Afghan officer corrected me. ""For a start this bomb wasn't as powerful as you think,"" he said. ""There are still green trees standing 100m away from the site of the impact."" The 21,600lb (9,800kg) MOAB flattened houses and trees, but didn't destroy everything A large number of IS militants were killed by the MOAB, but it is hard to know how many. The Achin district governor, Ismail Shinwary, says at least 90. Either way, the battle against IS continues. ""Daesh hasn't gone anywhere; there are hundreds of caves like the one the Americans bombed,"" the officer says, adding that strikes have continued since the bomb was dropped. ""They can't get rid of them like this."" The fighting appeared to be taking place along a huge area in the mountains. The bombardment was relentless, filling the valley with smoke and noise. But IS were taking casualties. Over a breakfast of eggs and green tea, the district police chief, Major Khair Mohammad Sapai, showed us pictures of dead IS fighters. They had beards and long hair. In death they looked pitiable, quite unlike the image they try to portray in their propaganda videos - riding horses, carrying their black flags or making the local Shinwari people sit on bombs and then blowing them up. This video can not be played The BBC's Auliya Atrafi assesses the impact of the Mother of All Bombs Major Khair said some of them were foreigners, but from their disintegrating, dust-covered faces it was hard to tell. He showed us hand-written lists of Afghan telephone numbers seized during operations, and some of the names on the list were indeed Arabic or Pakistani. The major's claims were backed up by Hakim Khan Momand and his friends. They are members of the so-called ""people's uprising"" - new militias made up of local people that help with security in the area. They cooperate with state security forces but their existence is seen as a sign of weak central government and instability. The bearded men lay on portable cots, drinking strong green tea and relishing the sight of IS fighters being bombed by American planes. ""They are all sorts - Uzbeks, Tajiks, Arabs and Wahhabis from Kunar Province. They have nowhere to go; best to bury them in the caves where they happen to be hiding,"" Hakim Khan said. His house lies in the Mamand Valley, in an area still under the control of IS. He adds: ""God willing, the Americans have given us their word that they would clear the entire valley of Daesh fighters."" Unlike the Taliban, who tend to have many supporters in their core areas, IS seem to have angered a lot of people. Few seemed unhappy about the US bombardment. A couple of kilometres from the frontline, ordinary life was continuing. Women carried water, boys played cricket and people went about their daily tasks. However, there was anxiety. One man, Khaled, said local people were pawns in a US game. ""[Dropping the bomb] was a trick to show the world that their mission was going well. But this wasn't the type of bomb they showed in the media. The bomb did nothing."" ""Will IS come back?"" I asked. ""Yes, as soon as the government leaves, the locals won't be able to fight them. If the government makes permanent bases in the area and helps us, then we will be happy,"" he answered. Children play cricket a few kilometres away from where IS positions are being bombed Local children wander in a bazaar destroyed by IS in the area Another local resident suggested IS could do with something a little stronger. ""Let Americans bring down a bigger one, this one was small,"" he said. Back in the hills, Hakim Khan and his friends were listening in to IS fighters communicating via walkie-talkies with the help of their radio. The fighters were reassuring each other and communicating with their comrades in a neighbouring district. A border police officer wondered aloud if the commitment of the Trump administration would match that of IS. ""The more we kill, the more they come from the other side of the Durand line, in Pakistan,"" he said. How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? The new 'Great Game' in Afghanistan After a night back in the safety of Jalalabad, we returned the next morning. There was no fighting so we drove into the valley until we were stopped near the bomb impact site by Afghan special forces, who agreed to show us around. They said that IS fighters saw the district as their own. After most locals fled, IS banned poppy cultivation and began farming wheat, turning the valley green. Now the lush allotments were their battlefields. Bodies lay next to hollow trees that fighters had been sleeping inside. Afghan special forces face a determined enemy in IS Shear, a tough-looking special forces soldier, said that IS fighters were ""crazy"" and very committed. ""They make the most of their basic Russian guns; they are technical fighters,"" he said. ""You can't hear them coming in the mountains: they will wear six pairs of socks and get within striking distance without you hearing them. ""In the mountains they fight individually or in groups of two or three. They don't leave their positions, so you have to kill them.  And their friends don't come to collect their bodies; they lie where they die."" We waited for permission to visit the impact site, surrounded by crates of military supplies dropped from the air. Our escort was Haji Beag, a unit commander, who first showed us a smaller ""IS command base and prison"". One door opening into a spacious courtyard led to a room which led to a small cave that could house around 10 people. It was dug into the rock and felt very solid. It was clear why finding and killing IS militants in these mountains took so much time and energy. A special forces soldier shows the BBC around a cave inside the tunnel complex At the entrance to the cave stood an improvised cage, made of mesh frames. It held two tight spaces which Haji Beag said were used as prison cells. He said he believed the US made a good decision to use the MOAB to target caves used over decades by different militant groups - from the Mujahedeen, to the Taliban, and most recently IS. ""We found about 20 bodies around the site after the explosion. The cave system has been destroyed,"" he said. ""It's possible that most of dead are buried inside those caves."" How powerful is 'mother of all bombs'? What will Trump do about Afghanistan? The drive to the impact site with Haji Beag and his unit was a short one. American planes were still flying above us, targeting the next valley a kilometre away. The mountainous terrain was hard on our four-wheel drive and as we approached the site a rocket landed 200m in front of us. No one was hurt, but it made Haji Beag cautious, and we weren't allowed to set foot on the impact site. But we could see it, and it was unremarkable. There was no big crater. Trees had been burnt and a few rooms had been flattened. Not far from it, houses still stood and there were green trees around. As we left the valley, the bombardment continued. It seemed clear that the bomb that was dropped on 13 April had not come close to delivering a knock-out blow to  IS militants entrenched in the area, and the locals certainly expect more conflict ahead. To me, at least, the Mother Of All Bombs failed to live up to her reputation. At the site where the MOAB was dropped.

"Athaya Slaetalid with husband Jan and their son Jacob There's a shortage of women in the Faroe Islands. So local men are increasingly seeking wives from further afield - Thailand and the Philippines in particular. But what's it like for the brides who swap the tropics for this windswept archipelago? When Athaya Slaetalid first moved from Thailand to the Faroe Islands, where winter lasts six months, she would sit next to the heater all day: ""People told me to go outside because the sun was shining but I just said: 'No! Leave me alone, I'm very cold.'"" Moving here six years ago was tough for Athaya at first, she admits. She'd met her husband Jan when he was working with a Faroese friend who had started a business in Thailand. Jan knew in advance that bringing his wife to this very different culture, weather and landscape would be challenging. Listen to Wives Wanted in the Faroes on BBC Radio 4's Crossing Continents at 11:00 on Thursday 27 April -or catch up on BBC iPlayer Radio The programme can also be heard onAssignment on BBC World Service ""I had my concerns, because everything she was leaving and everything she was coming to were opposites,"" he admits. ""But knowing Athaya, I knew she would cope."" There are now more than 300 women from Thailand and Philippines living in the Faroes. It doesn't sound like a lot, but in a population of just 50,000 people they now make up the largest ethnic minority in these 18 islands, located between Norway and Iceland. In recent years the Faroes have experienced population decline, with young people leaving, often in search of education, and not returning. Women have proved more likely to settle abroad. As a result, according to Prime Minister Axel Johannesen, the Faroes have a ""gender deficit"" with approximately 2,000 fewer women than men. This, in turn, has lead Faroese men to look beyond the islands for romance. Many, though not all, of the Asian women met their husbands online, some through commercial dating websites. Others have made connections through social media networks or existing Asian-Faroese couples. For the new arrivals, the culture shock can be dramatic. Officially part of the Kingdom of Denmark, the Faroes have their own language (derived from Old Norse) and a very distinctive culture - especially when it comes to food. Fermented mutton, dried cod and occasional whale meat and blubber are typical of the strong flavours here, with none of the traditional herbs and spices of Asian cooking. And, although it never gets as cold as neighbouring Iceland, the wet, cool climate is a challenge for many people. A good summer's day would see the temperature reach 16Â°C. Athaya is a confident woman with a ready smile who now works in the restaurant business in Torshavn, the Faroese capital. She and Jan share a cosy cottage on the banks of a fjord surrounded by dramatic mountains. But she's honest about how difficult swapping countries was at first. ""When our son Jacob was a baby, I was at home all day with no-one to talk to,"" she says. ""The other villagers are older people and mostly don't speak English. People our age were out at work and there were no children for Jacob to play with. I was really alone. When you stay at home here, you really stay at home. I can say I was depressed. But I knew it would be like that for two or three years."" Then, when Jacob started kindergarten, she began working in catering and met other Thai women. ""That was important because it gave me a network. And it gave me a taste of home again."" Krongrak Jokladal felt isolated at first, too, when she arrived from Thailand. Her husband Trondur is a sailor and works away from home for several months at a time. Krongrak Jokladal She started her own Thai massage salon in the centre of Torshavn. ""You can't work regular hours with a baby, and although my parents-in-law help out with childcare, running the business myself means I can choose my hours,"" she says. It's a far cry from Krongrak's previous job as head of an accountancy division in Thai local government. But she is unusual in that she runs her own business. Even for many highly educated Asian women in the Faroes, the language barrier means they have to take lower-level work. Axel Johannesen, the prime minister, says helping the newcomers overcome this is something the government takes seriously. ""The Asian women who have come in are very active in the labour market, which is good,"" he says. ""One of our priorities is to help them learn Faroese, and there are government programmes offering free language classes."" Kristjan and Bunlom Arnason Kristjan Arnason recalls the effort his Thai wife Bunlom, who arrived in the Faroes in 2002, put into learning the language. ""After a long day at work she would sit reading the English-Faeroese dictionary,"" he says. ""She was extraordinarily dedicated."" ""I was lucky,"" Bunlom adds. ""I told Kristjan that if I was moving here he had to find me a job. And he did, and I was working with Faeroese people in a hotel so I had to learn how to talk to them."" In an age when immigration has become such a sensitive topic in many parts of Europe, Faeroes society seems remarkably accepting of foreign incomers. This video can not be played Chuen and Karsten have been married for just over a year. They met on a dating website called Thai Cupid. ""I think it helps that the immigrants we have seen so far are mostly women,"" says local politician Magni Arge, who also sits in the Danish parliament, ""They come and they work and they don't cause any social problems. ""But we've seen problems when you have people coming from other cultures into places like the UK, in Sweden and in other parts of Europe - even Denmark. That's why we need to work hard at government level to make sure we don't isolate people and have some kind of sub-culture developing."" But Antonette Egholm, originally from the Philippines, hasn't encountered any anti-immigrant sentiment. I met her and her husband as they moved into a new flat in Torshavn. ""People here are friendly, she explains, ""and I've never experienced any negative reactions to my being a foreigner. I lived in metro Manila and there we worried about traffic and pollution and crime. Here we don't need to worry about locking the house, and things like healthcare and education are free. At home we have to pay. And here you can just call spontaneously at someone's house, it's not formal. For me, it feels like the Philippines in that way."" Likewise, her husband Regin believes increasing diversity is something that should be welcomed not feared. ""We actually need fresh blood here,"" he adds, ""I like seeing so many children now who have mixed parentage. Our gene pool is very restricted, and it's got to be a good thing that we welcome outsiders who can have families."" He acknowledges that he's had occasional ribbing from some male friends who jokingly ask if he pressed ""enter"" on his computer to order a wife. But he denies he and Antonette have encountered any serious prejudice as a result of their relationship. Athaya Slaetalid tells me that some of her Thai friends have asked why she doesn't leave her small hamlet, and move to the capital, where almost 40% of Faroe Islanders now live. They say Jacob would have more friends there. ""No, I don't need to do that,"" she says. ""I'm happy here now, not just surviving but making a life for our family. ""Look,"" she says, as we step into the garden overlooking the fjord. ""Jacob plays next to the beach. He is surrounded by hills covered in sheep and exposed to nature. And his grandparents live just up the road. There is no pollution and no crime. Not many kids have that these days. This could be the last paradise on earth.""

"The opinion polls say no, and conventional wisdom says she hasn't a hope. Centrist Emmanuel Macron is a long way ahead in the polls - so is there any way far-right leader Marine Le Pen could still pull off a shock victory in France's presidential election on 7 May? How the first round was won Since Mr Macron's impressive first-round victory, the polls suggest he is around 19 points ahead of his rival. The margin has narrowed but it is still wide. The omens look good for him too. He won 8,657,326 votes in the first round on 23 April, almost a million more than his National Front runner-up. And many voters who backed other candidates first time around say they plan to back him rather than Ms Le Pen. He has strong backing from key political figures: outgoing Socialist President FranÃ§ois Hollande and candidate BenoÃ®t Hamon on the left and defeated Republican candidate FranÃ§ois Fillon and ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy on the right. Marine Le Pen's big coup has come from attracting ex-candidate Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, who won 1.7 million votes and has been promised the role of prime minister. % EmmanuelMacron % MarineLe Pen Please enable Javascript to view our poll of polls chart. Thepolling average linelooks at the five most recent national polls and takes the median value, ie, the value between the two figures that are higher and two figures that are lower. So what could go wrong for Emmanuel Macron? Abstention is the biggest threat, says political scientist AurÃ©lien Preud'homme. ""If there is a very weak turnout for Macron and very strong support for Le Pen, she could go above 50% of the vote,"" he told the BBC. Marine Le Pen does not even need to go above 50% in the polls to become president, according to one expert, as long as Macron voters stay away in big enough numbers. All she needs is to advance a little more in the polls, and this is how she could do it. ""If she gets 42% of the vote, which isn't impossible, and Macron gets 58%, normally she loses the election,"" physicist and Sciences Po political expert Serge Galam told RMC radio. ""But if 90% of people who said they would vote for Le Pen do it, and at the same time only 65% of people who declared they would vote for Macron actually do it, then it's Marine Le Pen who wins the election with a score of 50.07%."" It is not that the polls are wrong, it is just that they cannot gauge the level of voter apathy in advance. UnderSerge Galam's mathematical formula,external, he gives three examples of how Marine Le Pen can win, where she is candidate ""A turnout x"" and Emmanuel Macron is ""B turnout y"" with a Turnout (T). He calls this model ""differentiated abstention"". Whether or not the polls might fail, it is worth pointing out that almost all the polling organisations were uncannily accurate in predicting where the top six candidates would finish. Marine Le Pen's campaign has hit the ground running US pollster Nate Silver gives Marine Le Pen no chance at all, arguing she isin a far worse hole than Donald Trump ever was,external. The issues dividing Le Pen and Macron The final candidates Five things the election has told us Why the election matters so much But Ian Bremmer of risk consultancy Eurasia Group puts the chance of a Le Pen victory at 30%. ""I feel he's going to win but it's not a safe bet. It's significantly about turnout and there are externalities that are very plausible."" One of those external factors, he believes, might be a terrorist attack on a greater scale than the murder of policeman Xavier JugelÃ© in central Paris three days before the first round. Or perhaps an outbreak of fake news. It could happen, as the 7 May run-off comes in the middle of a holiday weekend. Why make a special effort to stay home and vote on Sunday when Monday is a public holiday? It could work both ways but the Macron vote is more city-based and more likely to venture away from home. ""Neither Le Pen, nor Macron"" is the message from several groups of French voters Then there are the significant groups who cannot bring themselves to back an economic and social liberal in Emmanuel Macron. Many are attracted tothe hashtag #SansMoile7mai (Without me on 7 May)or describe themselves as ""Ni Le Pen Ni Macron"" - neither one nor the other. Another group is Sens Commun (Common Sense), a socially conservative group opposed to same-sex marriage and adoption. Their leader sees the ""political decay"" of Mr Macron as no different to the ""chaos"" offered by Le Pen. More than four out of 10 voters do not appear convinced by either candidate, and that could translate into a high rate of abstention. Historically, however, turnout in the second round is as high as 80%, so there would need to be a dramatic decline. Latest polls suggest three-quarters of voters intend to cast a ballot. Her main hope rests in rallying undecided voters, both those planning to cast a ballot and those who are not. The far-right leader's second-round focus has been to stage an energetic campaign that targets her rival as the ""candidate of finance"" and paints her as the patriotic choice. Macron heckled by pro-Le Pen workers She has distanced herself from her own party, suspending her leadership of the FN until after the election. Most dramatically, she upstaged Mr Macron by making a surprise appearance with striking factory workers at Amiens while he was talking behind closed doors to their union leaders. Voters were unimpressed by Mr Macron's decision to celebrate in posh La Rotonde bistro By contrast Mr Macron initially appeared flat-footed, beginning with a celebration party on Sunday night at a pricey Paris bistro and what sounded like a rebuke from President FranÃ§ois Hollande. ""We need to be extremely serious and mobilised and not think it's a done deal, because a vote is earned, it's fought for."" For Marine Le Pen a lot will hang on the big TV duel on 3 May. In earlier TV debates Mr Macron performed noticeably better. Marine Le Pen has already achieved a record number of votes for her party and is even trying to distance herself from the brand by restyling herself as the people's candidate with ex-banker Emmanuel Macron as a ""candidate of the oligarchy"". In depth: Meteoric rise of Emmanuel Macron In depth: Is Marine Le Pen far right? The key lies with two blocs: the right wing of FranÃ§ois Fillon's Republican support base and the radical left who opted for the surprise package of the first round, Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon. Together the two candidates polled almost 40% of the vote. Mr MÃ©lenchon initially refused to back either run-off candidate, raising the possibility that a section of anti-globalisation voters could find common cause with Marine Le Pen. However, stung by criticism, the far-left leader insisted he had not adopted a ""neither-nor"" stance and warned that a vote for the National Front would be a ""terrible mistake"". Ms Le Pen is heading for Nice, where more than 80 people were killed in a lorry attack last July Political scientist AurÃ©lien Preud'homme says many on the right are leaning towards Marine Le Pen and it just depends on whether she can shift the focus during the final days of campaigning to her strongest suit, security and terrorism. ""What stops the right backing Le Pen is Europe and the euro,"" says Mr Preud'homme. Most Fillon voters are of a certain age and they're the ones who worry about leaving the euro - it would be very worrying for them."" Marine Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen has already said she should have adopted a more aggressive campaign style in the manner of Donald Trump. He overturned a double-digit lead over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to win the US election last November. But she has little time left and may not find enough voters to win over. It is worth remembering that when she won the first round of elections in six of France's 13 regions in 2015, she looked on course to change the course of French politics.

"Unmarried girls who got pregnant used to be seen as bringing shame to their families in parts of Uganda, so they were taken to a tiny island and left to die. The lucky ones were rescued, and one of them is still alive. The BBC's Patience Atuhaire tracked her down. ""When my family discovered that I was pregnant, they put me in a canoe and took me to Akampene [Punishment Island]. I stayed there without food or water for four nights,"" says Mauda Kyitaragabirwe, who was aged just 12 at the time. ""I remember being very hungry and cold. I was almost dying."" On the fifth day a fisherman came along and said he would take her home with him. ""I was a bit sceptical. I asked him whether he was tricking me and wanted to throw me into the water. ""But he said: 'No. I am taking you to be my wife.' So he brought me here,"" she reflects fondly, seated on a simple chair on the veranda of the house she shared with her husband. She lives in the village of Kashungyera, just a 10-minute boat trip across Lake Bunyonyi from Punishment Island, which is actually just a patch of waterlogged grass. This is where Mauda Kyitaragabirwe was left to die At first, Ms Kyitaragabirwe was unsure how to greet me until Tyson Ndamwesiga, her grandson and a tour guide, told her that I spoke the local Rukiga language. Her face cracked into a nearly toothless smile. She held my arm from the elbow, in the tight grip that the Bakiga people usually reserve for long-lost relatives. The slender-built Ms Kyitaragabirwe walks with steady steps and estimates that she is in her eighties, but her family believes she is much older. She was born before birth certificates were common in this part of Uganda so it is impossible to be sure. This video can not be played The island where pregnant girls were sent to die ""She used to have a voter's registration card from just before Uganda's independence [in 1962]. That is what we used to count backwards. We think she's around 106,"" says Mr Ndamwesiga. In traditional Bakiga society, a young woman could only get pregnant after marriage. Marrying off a virgin daughter meant receiving a bride price, mostly paid with livestock. An unmarried pregnant girl was seen as not only bringing shame to the family, but robbing it of much-needed wealth. Families used to rid themselves of the ""shame"" by dumping pregnant girls on Punishment Island, leaving them to die. Because of the remoteness of the area, the practice continued even after missionaries and colonialists arrived in Uganda in the 19th Century and outlawed it. Most people at the time - especially girls - did not know how to swim. So if a young woman was dumped on the island, she had two options - jump into the water and drown, or wait to die from the cold and hunger. I asked Ms Kyitaragabirwe if she was scared. She tilts her head to one side, frowning, and fires back: ""I must have been about 12 years old. If you're taken from your home to an island where no-one else lives, in the middle of the lake, wouldn't you be scared?"" There are 29 islands on Lake Bunyoyi, including one that used to be a leper colony In another part of the region, present-day Rukungiri District, pregnant girls would be thrown off a cliff at Kisiizi Falls. Legend has it that it was not until one of them dragged her brother down with her that families stopped pushing their daughters to their deaths. No-one ever survived Kisiizi Falls. But a number of girls are said to have survived Punishment Island, thanks to young men who could not afford to pay a bride price. Marrying girls from the island meant a dowry-free wife. After her husband took her to his home in the village of Kashungyera, Ms Kyitaragabirwe became a subject of curiosity and gossip. Over the decades, she has become a tourist attraction - her home a regular stop for tourists on the trail of the history of the area. While discussing her life story, she often stopped talking and stared at her hands contemplatively. At other times, like when I asked how she lost her eye, she was quite evasive, instinctively raising her hand to touch it. The touchiest subject seemed to be the fate of the baby she was pregnant with when she was left to die. ""The pregnancy was still quite young. I never had the baby. Back then you could not fight back to defend yourself. If you did, they would beat you up,"" she says, lifting her head-wrap from her lap to wipe her face. Even though she did not say it outright, I understood what she meant - she was beaten up and had a miscarriage. I have three daughters. If any of them had got pregnant before they were married, I wouldn't blame them or punish them. Punishing girls - known in the local language as Okuhena, from which the island draws its local name Akampene - was an age-old practice. And Ms Kyitaragabirwe would have known about the consequences of a pregnancy. ""I had heard about other girls that had been taken to Punishment Island, although not anyone close to me. So, it seems I was also tempted by Satan,"" she chuckles. She never saw or heard from the man who led her down ""Satan's path"". However, she had heard, many years ago, that he had died. Of her husband, James Kigandeire, who died in 2001, she said: ""Oh, he loved me! He really looked after me. ""He said: 'I picked you up from the wilderness, and I am not going to make you suffer'. ""We had six children together. We stayed in this home together until he died."" Ms Kyitaragabirwe's grandson, Tyson, works as a tour guide in the area And while it took decades, she was finally reconciled with her family. She smiled and said: ""After I became a Christian I forgave everyone, even my brother who had rowed me in the canoe. I would go home to visit my family, and if I met any of them I would greet them."" Ms Kyitaragabirwe is believed to be the last woman who was dumped on the island, with the practice having died out after Christianity and government became stronger in the region. Still, unmarried pregnant women were frowned upon for many years. Condemning this attitude, Ms Kyitaragabirwe said: ""I have three daughters. If any of them had got pregnant before they were married, I wouldn't blame them or punish them. ""I know it can happen to any woman. If a young woman got pregnant today, she would come to her father's house and be taken care of.  The people who carried out such practices were blind.""

"Concerns are growing over suspected links between teenage suicides and online pressure groups Reports are circulating in the media of vulnerable people being encouraged to take their own lives by following a series of online challenges. In Russia, the deaths of some teenagers have been linked to the 'Blue Whale' challenge - though these reports have not been confirmed. The idea is that individuals are invited to complete a number of tasks within a 50-day period. The tasks become increasingly harmful and end with the individual being challenged to take their own life. There is concern that the idea is spreading around the world on social media networks. With questions over whether or not the Blue Whale challenge actually exists, and with no confirmed link between the deaths in Russia and Blue Whale, how concerned should you be? Can suicide rates be cut to zero? The children who try to kill themselves There is some confusion about the origin of Blue Whale, but the title is believed to be a reference to an act carried out by some blue whales, who appear to beach themselves on purpose, causing them to die. The name is apparently being used by an alleged online pressure group, which is said to assign a curator to individual participants who then encourages them to complete tests over the course of 50 days. These assigned tasks reportedly escalate from straightforward demands such as watching a macabre video or horror film to something more sinister - even leading to suicide. Unfortunately it is not unusual for teenagers to be drawn to social media groups that ultimately have a detrimental effect on their mental health. French police posted information about the phenomenon on Facebook The online group associated with the Blue Whale reports is said to have thousands of members and subscribers on Facebook and YouTube. The name has cropped up in countries including Russia, Ukraine, Spain, Portugal, France and the UK. Although authorities in Russia are reportedly investigating links between the suicides of a number of teenagers and online pressure groups, there have been no confirmed reports of links to Blue Whale. What police are looking for in these criminal investigations are previous conversations between the deceased and social media users that may have had an influence on any actions taken. There are also reports of suicide cases being investigated in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Russia and Kyrgyzstan, with a focus on links to internet groups. Children's advice groups such asthe NSPCC,externalcan offer guidance on how to detect signs of online grooming - the building of an emotional connection to gain trust - and how to protect your child and prevent the situation from escalating. There are a number of possible signs, but they are not always obvious because offenders exercise discretion in order to avoid being detected or identified. Among the most common signs to watch out for include children who: become very secretive, especially about what they are doing online are spending a lot of time on the internet and social media are switching screens on their device when approached are withdrawn or angry after using the internet or sending text messages have lots of new phone numbers or email addresses on their device The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop), a UK government agency, points out that sometimes change in a child's behaviour is completely normal and it is important not to overreact. Having a calm and open conversation, Ceop says, is an effective way of determining the cause of any behavioural change, tackling any concerns head-on and offering support and reassurance. An education programme set up by the organisation,ThinkUKnow,external, also says that it should be made clear to the individual when approached that any discussion is not going to result in punishment. Children, it says, often avoid reporting their own concerns if they believe that their internet access will be revoked, for example. Parents are advised to contact police if a child is thought to be in danger Another UK-based advice group,Get Safe Online,external, told the BBC that it was aware of the ""horrific"" Blue Whale reports and said that it was unfortunate that groups were ""willing to abuse these platforms"". The chief executive, Tony Neate, said dialogue was essential for addressing issues of peer pressure if a child is ""acting strangely"". ""It will allow them to take a step back, away from the pressures,"" he said, adding that this will help them to realise that it is ""not something they have to, or should, be taking part in"". Mr Neate also advised against ""blanket bans"" on internet use and said that the importance of privacy settings should be explained to all users. He said that speaking openly to other parents and teachers can help raise awareness of potential online threats and ""open the path for other instances to be reported"". ""Never shy away from reporting something that has occurred online to the police if you think your child, or someone else's child is in danger,"" Mr Neate said. ""This is how we can warn others and make sure teenagers don't get caught up in horrific games like this."" Police warn parents over blue whale 'game' Is Pokemon preventing Japan cliff suicides?

"This video can not be played The prime minister sticks relentlessly to her ""strong and stable"" slogan As the general election approaches, MPs start to repeat themselves. Over and over again. In every interview. Why do they do it? The final Prime Minister's Questions before the general election had just finished when an exasperated Paul Flynn asked the Speaker whether a microchip had been planted into Tory MPs that makes them say the words ""strong and stable"" every 18 seconds. The veteran Labour MP had a point - the Conservatives' slogan had just been used 16 times, including a hat-trick of mentions inside a single question by backbencher Michael Fabricant. In the 10 days since the general election was announced (with a speech outside 10 Downing Street containing three ""strong and stables""), it's cropped up 25 times in the House of Commons. It's also been crowbarred into interviews by Tory MPs and ministers, repeated in speeches and tweeted endlessly. Mrs May used it seconds into her first stump speech of the campaign, in Bolton - and then, in case anyone missed it, another 11 times. Laura Kuenssberg: PM sticks to script as Boris Johnson enters election fray Rival parties have attempted to turn the tactic on its head and use it in their attacks on the government. So why are we subjected to such a barrage? Some MPs have found creative ways to plug their slogan Things can get a bit surreal on the campaign trail A clue lies in the calculation by Barack Obama's campaign manager Jim Messina, who has reportedly been hired by Theresa May's election team. He has said voters only spent four minutes a week thinking about politics. So politicians keep saying their key messages in the hope that they will squeeze into that four-minute window. As a result, anyone tasked with following campaigns in detail ends up repeating phrases like ""long-term economic plan"" and ""cost of living crisis"" in their sleep. ""You have to do it over and over again,"" says Tony Blair's former director of communications Lance Price. ""It doesn't matter that journalists are sick and tired of hearing it - the point is that voters have to hear it a lot before it sinks into their subconscious and starts to have some resonance."" A phrase doesn't need to mean much, he thinks. Tony Blair's team championed the ""on message"" campaign style ""Blair would say 'the future, not the past' - which was almost completely meaningless, but he said it over and over again and it portrayed the Tories as harking back to the past, while Labour was shiny and new."" It's safe to say that Jeremy Corbyn, who promised a ""new kind of politics"" on becoming leader, has not followed the New Labour playbook. He tested out some punchy phrases in that final PMQs (saying the Tories were ""strong against the weak and weak against the strong"") but Labour has so far not adopted the relentless repetition approach. PR expert Mark Borkowski is not impressed by what he calls ""simplified electioneering"", saying that while people might be ""hypnotised by the repetitive, simple nature of it"", it could increase cynicism about politicians among voters who have had enough of elections. ""It's fashionable to think they can control the message with a single word, but I think people want more,"" he said. ""If anything it's going to do more to perpetuate election ennui."" He's not alone in wishing for more substantial speeches. ""The party machine is too risk-averse to countenance real speech,"" complained classics professor Mary Beard before the last general election. ""In ancient Greece and Rome, on the other hand, the art of rhetoric was at the heart of political life. ""Recapturing some of that lost art might be a good idea, and might get us beyond pretty much indistinguishable soundbites."" But for Mr Borkowski, the US election, and Donald Trump's promise to ""make America great again"", is helping shape this campaign. ""Everybody seems to be completely obsessed with the success of Trump,"" he says. ""Although people won't admit it, they are very close to actually mimicking what they think was successful for him."" We won't know for another six weeks what has worked for the UK's political leaders - which leaves plenty of time for more ""strong and stables"" to be hurled our way.

"You say chorizo, I say....? Exactly how to pronounce the spicy pork sausage has got viewers of Masterchef in a pickle. But is there a right way and a wrong way? In Wednesday's episode, the velvety tones of the voiceover on the popular BBC One cooking show introduced a dish: ""Iberico pork with grilled calamari, served with chuh-REE-thoh jam, a chuh-REE-thoh and tomato puree, Asian pear and a dressed fennel salad."" It sounded delicious, but when its creator - the Michelin-starred chef Shaun Rankin - talked about the dish chu-REE-thoh had become shuh-REE-zoh, and Twitter was vexed. So who's right? Martha Figueroa-Clark, a linguist in the BBC pronunciation unit for more than 10 years, says the question of how to say ""chorizo"" comes up a lot. The usual pronunciation in English is chuh-REE-zoh, although chuh-REE-soh, chorr-EE-zoh and chorr-EE-soh (-orr as in sorry) are also certified as pronunciations in British dictionaries. But in mimicking a European Spanish pronunciation, the ""z"" can also be pronounced as ""th"" as in 'think'. In Central and South American varieties of Spanish, the ""z"" is pronounced as ""s"" as in 'sit'. One common mispronunciation is chuh-RITS-oh. Martha suggests this might come from people thinking it is an Italian word. So how did Rankin get it wrong? Certainly, the chef, who grew up in Yorkshire and trained in kitchens around the world, will not be a stranger to the word. Indeed, his food style at his restaurants in Jersey and Mayfair, central London, are influenced by European and Asian cooking. Martha suggests he might have been influenced by the pronunciation of ""ch"" in French or Portuguese (""chouriÃ§o"", pronounced shoh-REE-soo). The problem often comes when two people on TV say the same word in different ways in a short space of time, drawing attention to the pronunciation. She advises broadcasters to choose one pronunciation and stick to it. Her team consults a range of dictionaries to establish the accepted pronunciations of words in English and advises broadcasters accordingly. If the pronunciation of a foreign word is not yet established in English, they research the pronunciation and devise an anglicised form for BBC broadcasts. Given the fuss about a sausage, the next time you're at your local Italian, you might want to keep the waiters happy by asking for a large glass of PEE-noh GREE-joh (-j as in Jack) with your bruusk-ET-uh (-uu as in book). The BBC pronunciation guide says chuh-REE-zoh is the most established way to say chorizo Hummus crisis? What hummus crisis? Why is there a vegetable shortage?

"HMRC officers raided Newcastle and West Ham's stadiums on Wednesday as part of the investigation Former Newcastle winger Sylvain Marveaux is one of four people arrested in a tax fraud investigation by Revenue & Customs (HMRC). French authorities said secret payments made to players and agents during deals between French and Premier League clubs are the focus of the probe. Newcastle and West Ham's grounds wereraided on Wednesday,as HMRC deployed 180 officers across the UK and France. Marveaux, 31, joined Newcastle from Rennes in 2011 and made 39 appearances. He returned to France to join Lorient last year. 'Business as usual' at Newcastle Newcastle's managing director Lee Charnley was also arrested. He was released without charge at about 17:00 BST on Wednesday. The French Prosecutor's office says 10 searches were carried out in France and four people were placed in police custody. ""The British authorities suspect secret payments may have been made to benefit certain players, their agents or third parties, allowing them to avoid paying tax on the income, or making social security payments,"" said a statement from the French Prosecutor's office. French officials were asked by HMRC to provide assistance to their investigation in July 2016. It took a further nine months before officers launched their raids on both sides of the Channel. HMRC said it searched premises in the north east and south east of England, and seized business records, financial records, computers and mobile phones. West Ham's London Olympic Stadium and Newcastle's St James' Park were among the locations raided. HMRC officers also visited offices belonging to Chelsea FC ""in connection with its wider investigation"", a club spokesman confirmed. But it is understood the club's premises were not raided and no arrests were made. BBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Richard Conway The wheels of tax investigations turn slowly - so any sporting implications resulting from these arrests and raids may not be known for some time. It would appear, on face value, that Premier League points and status for both West Ham United and newly promoted Newcastle United are safe for now. However this ""on-going"" investigation risks creating instability and uncertainty for both clubs at a time when they both, for different reasons, need it the most. HMRC investigations of this scale are costly and only undertaken in the most serious of circumstances. This isn't going away anytime soon. Rafael Benitez, celebrating promotion on Monday, told reporters it was good to work at a club where there's no backroom politics, a not so subtle reference to his tumultuous time at Real Madrid. With Newcastle having documents seized, and further questions looming for its senior officials, he may have spoken too soon.

"This video can not be played 'Amazing' Selby foul hands advantage to Ding World Championship 2017 Venue:The Crucible Theatre, SheffieldDates:15 April - 1 May Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC Red Button, Connected TVs, online and app. Ding Junhui scored five half-centuries and a ton and showed his growing matchplay maturity to lead reigning champion Mark Selby 5-3 after an intriguing start to their World Championship semi-final. Both players demonstrated their potting prowess before the mini-break, scoring alternating fifties to share the opening four frames. But China's Ding got the better of two of three scrappy frames to edge 4-3 ahead before taking frame eight with a brilliant 110. The contest resumes on Friday morning, with the winner of the first-to-17 match playing either John Higgins or Barry Hawkins in the final. READ MORE: Higgins two clear of Hawkins in semi-final Latest scores, schedule, results & highest break Vote for your most memorable Crucible Theatre moment Unlike last year's Crucible final, when a disastrous start saw Ding lose the opener and slump 6-0 behind against the Englishman on his way to an 18-14 defeat, the world number four settled immediately. A beautifully measured 76, after Selby broke down in the 40s, put him ahead. Selby's superb 68 levelled and the pair then exchanged frames, Ding regaining the lead with an 84 and the world number one rounding off a high quality mini-session with a stylish 99. Ding had a pot success rate of 91% with the world number one marginally ahead at 92% but the first frame on the resumption was the definition of scrappy. Two-time champion Selby, 33, won it to lead for the first time, but Ding's new found mental strength saw him outsmart Selby in a tactical 39-minute frame. He then took control of his third last-four appearance at snooker's showpiece event with breaks of 50 and 56 to edge ahead at 4-3. And he compiled a brilliant 110 - his 10th ton of the tournament - to take his third frame in a row and establish a two-frame lead. Stephen Hendry, seven-time world champion ""I didn't think Ding could beat Ronnie, but he proved me wrong. Ding's weakness has been his mental strength and I said before I couldn't think of a reason why Mark Selby wouldn't win the World Championship but I can now - Ding Junhui. ""Selby played some of the best snooker I have ever seen on Wednesday. The 143 he made was the best break I have seen since working on snooker. It was unbelievable. ""Ding has to go up a level to win this match. He was great against Ronnie O'Sullivan. ""But he has to virtually not miss at all, and he started like that and needs to keep that up. It is lining up to be a classic. ""Who wins the scrappy frames could decide the match. He outplayed Mark in the safety exchange in frame six; he always had the upper hand. It is important for Ding to win those types of frames. ""We were spoilt in the first four frames but if it remains close it will get more cagey.""

"Teenage years can be fraught with dilemmas. But what if you are deaf and fast losing your sight too? Molly Watt was born severely deaf and learned to lip read. But, at the age of 12, she was diagnosed with Usher syndrome, a degenerative disease which causes sight and hearing loss. Now aged 22 she has just 5% of sight left in one eye. ""My vision is like looking through a straw,"" she says. ""There's lots of flashing lights in my 'good' bit and I just have to learn to avoid them. On a bad day, I don't see a lot at all. ""The worst case scenario for any deaf person is to lose their sight. Usher syndrome is not a death sentence but it is incredibly challenging. Without awareness and appropriate support, it is easy to fall into depression and despair - I've been there."" The loss of Molly's sight was rapid, and within two years of being diagnosed she was registered blind. ""My parents knew about my Usher syndrome diagnosis on the day, however, I was unaware of the seriousness of the condition.  It wasn't until I was experiencing the deterioration in my vision that I started asking more questions. ""By the age of 15 I did my own research and that's when I first saw the word 'blind'. It's difficult to accept losing any sense but so much worse when it is the one you most rely on."" Usher syndrome is the most common cause of deafblindness and impacts mobility and balance and can lead to depression. The term 'deafblind' refers to a spectrum of hearing and sight loss. Emma Boswell, the national coordinator from the charity Sense, says there is not an average age for people being diagnosed with Usher, although assessments for cochlear implants now include an eye test which has increased the speed of diagnosis. ""When a person finds out about their diagnosis, it can be very frightening, upsetting and presents an unknown future,"" she says. ""Some parents won't tell their child as they want to keep their diagnosis quiet until they are older."" Molly grew up in Maidenhead with three siblings - two brothers and a sister - and says her relationship with them has been affected by Usher. ""I had already established a long time ago I was not like my siblings. Sadly I was always seen as the 'favourite' child because I was always being taken out to appointments.  As my brothers matured and realised my reality could have been theirs, they were quick to realise they are in fact lucky. BBC See Hear created images of what some people with Usher syndrome experience Usher syndrome is a degenerative condition which combines deafness with a visual impairment called Retinitis Pigmentosa, an eye disease of the retina that affects peripheral vision and causes night-blindness. It is believed to have a prevalence rate from 3.2 to 6.2 per 100,000 people. Information: Sense Speech therapy helped Molly to talk and lip-read and she went to mainstream school until the age of 14, when she moved to a deaf boarding school. She says she was ""excited to be like everyone else"" but was bullied which exacerbated her depression and anxiety. After taking a year out she returned to mainstream education. Her experiences are often dictated by the support she receives. While she says college restored her faith in humanity, she left university early due to a lack of assistance. ""Lecturers didn't have the time to understand my condition. Training and awareness sessions were set up for staff and nobody turned up. ""I just needed materials to be made accessible - large text, for lecturers to wear a radio aid that connected to my hearing aids - it's as simple as that."" Usher syndrome as a teenager comes with additional challenges such as negotiating a social life. The majority of Molly's friends are hearing and sighted and she communicates with them through speech. ""I have to strategise everything I do. I am night-blind and so when I go out I would often ask to hang onto a friend. I will only go out with the close friends who do not make me feel a burden."" Boswell says some young people manage to ""fit"" within their circle of friends as they grow up, while others struggle. ""Some may feel left out of conversations if they are struggling to keep up with who is talking,"" she says. ""Some teenagers may find it difficult to socialise with their friends in dark areas."" At 22 Molly is independent but relies on those around her to help as well using assistive technology. She calls her Apple watch ""invaluable"" as it taps her wrist to alert her to a text or call, enables her to pay for items in shops and is more discrete than holding a phone. She also wears hearing aids, which enable her to lower or increase the sound of the bass or cancel out background noise via an app. The first time she used it she discovered people could hear sound behind them. The mental health of those with Usher syndrome can also be affected. Molly has bipolar disorder and severe anxiety triggered by the quick progression of Usher. ""It's been a rocky road of denial as it is hard to come to terms with an ever-changing progressive condition. Battling with depression and anxiety was a constant struggle as I never wanted to leave the house."" Boswell says the impact upon mental health can depend on the support offered and how open people are about the challenges they face. Those who keep quiet are more likely to become ""isolated and distressed,"" she says. Molly has set up her own charity - The Molly Watt Trust - to support others with Usher and has spoken at prestigious institutions including Harvard University and the House of Commons outlining how capable people with Usher are. ""The hardest thing about Usher syndrome is not knowing what the long term prognosis is,"" she says. ""I am deafblind, but there is nothing wrong with my brain hence my determination to always find a way.""

"Back in 1993, a rapidly rising Tony Blair caught the public's attention by pledging to be ""tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime"". Liverpool toddler Jamie Bulger had been murdered and violence would soon peak at around four million incidents a year. Records show the public werereally worried about crime,external. Another big story that year was the creation of the European Single Market - and nowhere near the same number of people were bothered about that. How times change. Today, more than half of those polled say the EU is one of the most important issue facing Britain today. Only 8% are concerned by crime. But the latest release of data from the Office for National Statistics includes somepotentially worrying signsahead of an election where crime is almost certainly not going to figure highly in the minds of voters, let alone the parties after their vote. For years, the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW), the main and most comprehensive measure of what crime people say they experience, has been charting a long-term fall in offences which is consistent with what's been happening in every other comparable nation. The CSEW says that traditional crime is broadly static at just over six million offences in the year to December 2016. When you add to that experimental data on cyber and fraud, it comes to 11.5m crimes. There are holes in the CSEW that are difficult to fill - it doesn't cover all types of victims and all types of offences and only recently began asking people about fraud and computer-related crime. But, broadly speaking, it's considered to be a good measure of the long-term trends. At the same time, police recorded crime has gone up to 4.8m offences - a rise of 9% - and it has seen rises in both serious violence and ""traditional"" offences such as burglary and robbery. Those figures - the data collected from what coppers actually know - have been having a torrid time. There have been a series of revamps and changes in methodology amid concerns that not all forces are recording accurately what's going on - particularly in relation to violence. The resulting data still isn't considered to be 100% trust-worthy as a ""national statistic"". And just to further confuse the picture, there's an entirely independent and highly regarded measure of violence from hospitals that saysit has been falling substantially. So that's as clear as mud. What's going on? Some of the 9% increase in police recorded crime is almost certainly down to changes in how things are being recorded, but the ONS also stresses that those tweaks can't account for all of the change On violence, the CSEW estimates there were 29 incidents per 1,000 people - a 4% rise on last year which may not be statistically significant (there are always blips up and down in data). Police on the other hand recorded a 19% rise in all violent offences - up to 1.1m incidents over the same year. While the overwhelming number of violent incidents result in either no or minor physical injury, there are some concerning rises with guns and knives. Firearms offences went up 13%, although all incidents involving guns are still down almost 50% on a decade ago. Knife crime has gone up 14% during the last year, returning to levels last seen six years ago when it became a political and policing priority. Both of these rises have already been concerning chief constables, with the new Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick saying tackling these offences may define her tenure. As for fraud and cyber crimes, there are some more concerning figures here. The crime survey hasn't yet collected two complete years of data on these offences - but statisticians already think that it's a rising trend based on other sources. There were about 5.4m fraud offences in the year to December, with almost 2m of those being computer related, such as online scams or malware used to trick people into providing access to their online accounts. The National Fraud Intelligence Bureau recorded a 4% increase in offences, but it's not quite clear what's going on nationwide because not all victims come forward. And, just as seriously, not all police forces are geared up to understand what's going on in their patch. This raises real strategic resources questions for the police: while your average detective knows a thing or two about gathering fingerprints and tracking burglars - spreadsheets and malware are a totally different world. Marian Fitzgerald, a leading criminologist at the University of Kent, says crime stats have become ""a dog's breakfast"". She argues that not only has the crime survey failed to properly inform the public about the emergence of new types of crimes, the police have been caught massaging figures under pressure from successive governments. ""I think the police figures stabilised after the outcry in 2014 when the police were shown to have been fiddling their figures, particularly in relation to violence and sexual offences,"" says Professor Fitzgerald. ""Any rises that we are seeing now are genuine. Improvements [to police recording practices] stabilised a long time ago."" So is society becoming more criminal, more dangerous? The ONS is working onways to assess the impact of crime,external, including a measure of the severity that different crimes cause:  an attempted break-in to a shed to nick a lawn mower is wholly different to an act of violent domestic abuse. Tom Gash, an author and former Whitehall adviser on crime, says: ""If you take a centuries-long perspective, [the figures ] are great news. There have been radical changes in the reduction of violence in modern society. ""You could discount [the most recent figures] and say it is a very short-term thing, but the thing that worries me is that this is a rise in violent crime that emulates the US. ""The crime drop in America preceded the crime drop we saw here. ""The truth is we don't really know what's going on. We're not sure if this has been caused by cuts in policing or mental health or youth services, or some broader societal factor that we haven't yet worked out.""

"Gia is going to take a week's paid leave to house train her puppy Rye As anyone who has had a new puppy will understand, 24-year-old Gia Nigro has got her hands full. Gia, who lives in Columbus, Ohio, is the proud owner of a nine-week-old goldendoodle puppy (a cross between a golden retriever and a poodle) called Rye. Like any young dog it is going to require a fair amount of training to ensure it becomes housetrained and obedient. But what can you do if, like Gia, you work full-time, and you don't have any holiday time left to dedicate to your new four-legged friend? Thankfully for Gia, her employer - Scottish brewer Brewdog - announced a rather unusual new employee perk earlier this year - one week's paid leave for all workers who adopt a puppy or rescue dog. Unsurprisingly the announcement - which was released to the media in a press release rather than just told to staff - madeheadlines around the world,external. Newspaper reports were quick to praise the scheme that Brewdog has dubbed ""pawternity"" leave. The pawternity scheme coincided with the opening of Brewdog's new US brewery and bar However, the more cynical may have wondered whether there was more than a whiff of gimmick to Brewdog's unusual new employee benefit. They may further question whether it was unveiled as ""clickbait"" to draw attention to a press release that also announced that the company had just opened a new 100,000 sq ft (9,000sq m) North American brewery in Columbus. Not that Gia, who works at the new facility, has any complaints. ""The policy gives me the flexibility to choose when to take a fully paid week off with Rye, which I'll be doing next month to get her fully house trained,"" she says. And in defence of Brewdog, it has also always been dog-friendly, and allows employees to take their pets to work with them. While employee perks are nothing new, they have become both more unusual and headline grabbing in recent years. But why exactly are firms offering them? Last year New York-based online retailer Boxed waspraised,externalwhen its co-founder and boss Chieh Huang announced that the company would contribute to the cost of employees' weddings. Mr Huang says he was inspired to start the unusual scheme when he saw one of his employees crying at work because he was struggling to cover the cost of his mother's medical bills and save for his forthcoming wedding. Boxed worker Marcel Graham (centre, in a hat) cried after being told his wedding would be paid for ""He basically realised that he was just never going to make it work,"" says Mr Huang, who was immediately inspired to pay for the worker's wedding, and then introduce the company-wide policy. ""The response was overwhelming,"" says Mr Huang. ""There was lots of yelling, high-fiving, and tears of joy. ""I think that day our employees realised that we understand just how much of a commitment they make to us every day, putting in long hours to make this company grow, and that we're willing to make a commitment to them in return. I really think that resonated with them."" While Boxed is a bit cagey about the details, under the scheme it will pay up to $20,000 (Â£16,000) for weddings, depending on seniority and time with the company. Boxed will pay up to $20,000 towards an employee's wedding So far half a dozen Boxed workers have redeemed the perk, and Mr Huang says there are ""lots more on the horizon"". He firmly rejects the suggestion that the scheme was introduced simply to garner publicity. ""There are definitely less expensive ways to get media attention,"" says Mr Huang. ""We definitely do not sit around in a room trying to come up with ideas on how to create buzzworthy corporate benefits."" Occupational psychologist Cheryl Isaacs says that having generous employee perks can be a good way for a company to help ensure that it has a contented workforce, and that numerous studies have shown (perhaps unsurprisingly) that happy staff are more productive. One such recentreport,externalinto the issue by the University of Warwick found that employee happiness boosted productivity by 12%, while unhappy workers were 10% less productive. However, London-based Ms Isaacs cautions that the benefits should apply to most employees, and not just a few. ""A deeper question that each individual organisation needs to answer is: does the benefit bring ROI [return on investment']? Will it have any long-lasting benefits for the company?"" she says. Other employee perk schemes that have made the headlines in recent years include Apple and Facebook offering to pay for egg freezing for their female employees, while Netflix allows staff to take up to a year's parental leave. US firm Zillow pays for female staff to post their breast milk Meanwhile, US online real estate firm Zillow pays for female employees to post their breast milk if they are working away from home. They introduced the scheme in 2010 after a worker had difficulty getting her container of milk through airport security. While all these firms say they are trying to help their staff rather than garner positive publicity, Florida-based PR expert Glenn Selig guesses that businesses can often be seeking both. ""Companies can both really mean it - want to improve the lives of their employees, and get their names out there,"" he says. ""I wouldn't be surprised if in the C suites [at boardroom level] there was some kind of conversation about what kind of benefit can be offered to employees that would also make the company look good, and could generate positive attention."" While Brewdog has a range of staff benefits that don't make the headlines, such as paying staff a guaranteed living wage and generous parental leave, Mr Selig says the ""pawternity"" scheme is a ""really neat idea"" from a PR point of view. ""Will it make people buy the beer? I don't know,"" he says. ""But you might remember it next time you're sitting in a bar and someone mentions Brewdog.""

"England batsman Jonny Bairstow in a warm-up one day cricket match between India A and England XI in January Cricket's bosses have reversed a decision which effectively handed control of the sport to India, England and Australia. The International Cricket Council (ICC)decided in 2014that the 'Big Three' should have more powers over how the game is run and its financial split. But at a meeting in Dubai, the ICC board voted to pass a new financial model and governance structure. The changes will have to be ratified by the ICC full council in June. The 2014 changes had angered other large cricketing nationssuch as South Africa and Pakistan. However, the reversal is likely to upset India which has been demanding a $570m (Â£442m) cut from ICC revenues but will now receive $293m (Â£227m). The board voted 13 to one in favour of the financial changes and local media have reported that India was the only dissenting voice. Based on forecasted revenues and costs, the England and Wales Cricket Board will receive $143m (Â£111m) across the same period (2016-2023), Zimbabwe will get $94m (Â£73m) and the remaining seven Full Member nations $132m (Â£102m) each. Constitutional changes made by the board - including paving the way for more Test cricket nations and the introduction of an independent female director - were agreed by a vote of 12 to two.

"Unmarried girls who got pregnant used to be seen as bringing shame to their families in parts of Uganda, so they were taken to a tiny island and left to die. The lucky ones were rescued, and one of them is still alive. The BBC's Patience Atuhaire tracked her down. ""When my family discovered that I was pregnant, they put me in a canoe and took me to Akampene [Punishment Island]. I stayed there without food or water for four nights,"" says Mauda Kyitaragabirwe, who was aged just 12 at the time. ""I remember being very hungry and cold. I was almost dying."" On the fifth day a fisherman came along and said he would take her home with him. ""I was a bit sceptical. I asked him whether he was tricking me and wanted to throw me into the water. ""But he said: 'No. I am taking you to be my wife.' So he brought me here,"" she reflects fondly, seated on a simple chair on the veranda of the house she shared with her husband. She lives in the village of Kashungyera, just a 10-minute boat trip across Lake Bunyonyi from Punishment Island, which is actually just a patch of waterlogged grass. This is where Mauda Kyitaragabirwe was left to die At first, Ms Kyitaragabirwe was unsure how to greet me until Tyson Ndamwesiga, her grandson and a tour guide, told her that I spoke the local Rukiga language. Her face cracked into a nearly toothless smile. She held my arm from the elbow, in the tight grip that the Bakiga people usually reserve for long-lost relatives. The slender-built Ms Kyitaragabirwe walks with steady steps and estimates that she is in her eighties, but her family believes she is much older. She was born before birth certificates were common in this part of Uganda so it is impossible to be sure. This video can not be played The island where pregnant girls were sent to die ""She used to have a voter's registration card from just before Uganda's independence [in 1962]. That is what we used to count backwards. We think she's around 106,"" says Mr Ndamwesiga. In traditional Bakiga society, a young woman could only get pregnant after marriage. Marrying off a virgin daughter meant receiving a bride price, mostly paid with livestock. An unmarried pregnant girl was seen as not only bringing shame to the family, but robbing it of much-needed wealth. Families used to rid themselves of the ""shame"" by dumping pregnant girls on Punishment Island, leaving them to die. Because of the remoteness of the area, the practice continued even after missionaries and colonialists arrived in Uganda in the 19th Century and outlawed it. Most people at the time - especially girls - did not know how to swim. So if a young woman was dumped on the island, she had two options - jump into the water and drown, or wait to die from the cold and hunger. I asked Ms Kyitaragabirwe if she was scared. She tilts her head to one side, frowning, and fires back: ""I must have been about 12 years old. If you're taken from your home to an island where no-one else lives, in the middle of the lake, wouldn't you be scared?"" There are 29 islands on Lake Bunyoyi, including one that used to be a leper colony In another part of the region, present-day Rukungiri District, pregnant girls would be thrown off a cliff at Kisiizi Falls. Legend has it that it was not until one of them dragged her brother down with her that families stopped pushing their daughters to their deaths. No-one ever survived Kisiizi Falls. But a number of girls are said to have survived Punishment Island, thanks to young men who could not afford to pay a bride price. Marrying girls from the island meant a dowry-free wife. After her husband took her to his home in the village of Kashungyera, Ms Kyitaragabirwe became a subject of curiosity and gossip. Over the decades, she has become a tourist attraction - her home a regular stop for tourists on the trail of the history of the area. While discussing her life story, she often stopped talking and stared at her hands contemplatively. At other times, like when I asked how she lost her eye, she was quite evasive, instinctively raising her hand to touch it. The touchiest subject seemed to be the fate of the baby she was pregnant with when she was left to die. ""The pregnancy was still quite young. I never had the baby. Back then you could not fight back to defend yourself. If you did, they would beat you up,"" she says, lifting her head-wrap from her lap to wipe her face. Even though she did not say it outright, I understood what she meant - she was beaten up and had a miscarriage. I have three daughters. If any of them had got pregnant before they were married, I wouldn't blame them or punish them. Punishing girls - known in the local language as Okuhena, from which the island draws its local name Akampene - was an age-old practice. And Ms Kyitaragabirwe would have known about the consequences of a pregnancy. ""I had heard about other girls that had been taken to Punishment Island, although not anyone close to me. So, it seems I was also tempted by Satan,"" she chuckles. She never saw or heard from the man who led her down ""Satan's path"". However, she had heard, many years ago, that he had died. Of her husband, James Kigandeire, who died in 2001, she said: ""Oh, he loved me! He really looked after me. ""He said: 'I picked you up from the wilderness, and I am not going to make you suffer'. ""We had six children together. We stayed in this home together until he died."" Ms Kyitaragabirwe's grandson, Tyson, works as a tour guide in the area And while it took decades, she was finally reconciled with her family. She smiled and said: ""After I became a Christian I forgave everyone, even my brother who had rowed me in the canoe. I would go home to visit my family, and if I met any of them I would greet them."" Ms Kyitaragabirwe is believed to be the last woman who was dumped on the island, with the practice having died out after Christianity and government became stronger in the region. Still, unmarried pregnant women were frowned upon for many years. Condemning this attitude, Ms Kyitaragabirwe said: ""I have three daughters. If any of them had got pregnant before they were married, I wouldn't blame them or punish them. ""I know it can happen to any woman. If a young woman got pregnant today, she would come to her father's house and be taken care of.  The people who carried out such practices were blind.""

"HMRC officers raided Newcastle and West Ham's stadiums on Wednesday as part of the investigation Former Newcastle winger Sylvain Marveaux is one of four people arrested in a tax fraud investigation by Revenue & Customs (HMRC). French authorities said secret payments made to players and agents during deals between French and Premier League clubs are the focus of the probe. Newcastle and West Ham's grounds wereraided on Wednesday,as HMRC deployed 180 officers across the UK and France. Marveaux, 31, joined Newcastle from Rennes in 2011 and made 39 appearances. He returned to France to join Lorient last year. 'Business as usual' at Newcastle Newcastle's managing director Lee Charnley was also arrested. He was released without charge at about 17:00 BST on Wednesday. The French Prosecutor's office says 10 searches were carried out in France and four people were placed in police custody. ""The British authorities suspect secret payments may have been made to benefit certain players, their agents or third parties, allowing them to avoid paying tax on the income, or making social security payments,"" said a statement from the French Prosecutor's office. French officials were asked by HMRC to provide assistance to their investigation in July 2016. It took a further nine months before officers launched their raids on both sides of the Channel. HMRC said it searched premises in the north east and south east of England, and seized business records, financial records, computers and mobile phones. West Ham's London Olympic Stadium and Newcastle's St James' Park were among the locations raided. HMRC officers also visited offices belonging to Chelsea FC ""in connection with its wider investigation"", a club spokesman confirmed. But it is understood the club's premises were not raided and no arrests were made. BBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Richard Conway The wheels of tax investigations turn slowly - so any sporting implications resulting from these arrests and raids may not be known for some time. It would appear, on face value, that Premier League points and status for both West Ham United and newly promoted Newcastle United are safe for now. However this ""on-going"" investigation risks creating instability and uncertainty for both clubs at a time when they both, for different reasons, need it the most. HMRC investigations of this scale are costly and only undertaken in the most serious of circumstances. This isn't going away anytime soon. Rafael Benitez, celebrating promotion on Monday, told reporters it was good to work at a club where there's no backroom politics, a not so subtle reference to his tumultuous time at Real Madrid. With Newcastle having documents seized, and further questions looming for its senior officials, he may have spoken too soon.

"Recent aerial photographs of extensive pollution at industrial sites in northern China have caused a public outcry, and calls for action from the authorities. The images, taken by a drone, show a cluster of dark red and rust-coloured pits occupying a big patch of land in a village called Nanzhaofu in Hebei province. The NGO which broke the story, Chongqing Liangjiang Voluntary Service Centre, said preliminary tests it conducted showed the waste water in the pits was strongly acidic. The pollutants have been been there for years, it said, meaning the underground water might have been contaminated. The centre said three pits in total had been found, covering a total of 350,000 sq m. The two largest were 500m apart in Nanzhaofu while a third smaller one was found in Xizhaizhuang county in Tianjin. Together, the two provinces circle Beijing. Volunteers told Chinese media that similar polluted land could be found in other provinces. After the images were published on the NGO's social media accounts last week there was an outburst of public anger. ""Those photos are shocking, the authority has been doing nothing, I am so angry!"" one social media user said. ""My aunt is from that county in Hebei, she died from cancer two years ago. Her grandson is suffering from cancer and her mother in law has cancer too,"" said another. ""I thought it was just coincidence but now I don't. The government has to provide us a safe environment."" The city where you can't escape smog China district is overnight property hotspot It's still not clear where the contaminants came from, but the local authorities were quick to respond to the anger and launch an investigation. The Tianjin authorities sent workers to clean up the pit there, along with three other contaminated sites. They promised to eradicate the problem before the end of July, but this did little to ease the anger. In Hebei, authorities blamed local people for the contamination, saying they had been illegally dumping acid waste for years. The main suspect had been arrested in 2013, they said. But on social media, people are asking why, if the suspect has been arrested, nothing had changed and the land is still contaminated. Reporters who visited Nanzhaofu were told by locals that their lives had been severely affected by the pollution - cancer rates were increasing, they claimed, and a pungent smell had filled the air in the summer in recent years. They don't drink well water, instead they either buy barrel water, or get to a well 5km away in a neighbouring county. In its annual report this week, the environment ministry said water standards in some areas of northern China had declined since 2015. Environment Minister Chen Jining said water samples found 36.3% of heavy polluting industries' land and the surrounding soil did not meet government standards, according to a report by South China Morning Post. Xiong'an is about to be the site of a massive urban development project However, Mr Chen said China's overall condition of air, water, and soil pollution had improved in 2016. One particular area of concern among the public comments has been that all the three sites are less than 100km from Xiong'an, the area of Hebei recently identified asthe location of a new Special Economic Zone. The decision will bring huge investment to the region, putting it on a par with areas like Pudong in Shanghai. It will serve as an extension of Beijing, and the Hebei party chief has said the project would prioritise ecological development and ""build a new area of green, forest, wisdom and clean water"". But Hebei has been notorious for its pollution levels for years. Many have been asking whether it's right for China to begin developing a new area if it can't keep the existing one clean, and whether the necessary environmental protections really will be put in place.
