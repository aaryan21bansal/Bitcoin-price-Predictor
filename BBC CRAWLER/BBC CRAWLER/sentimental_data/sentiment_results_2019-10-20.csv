"This video can not be played Watch protesters flee as a police water cannon truck fires blue liquid outside a mosque A group of hardcore protesters threw petrol bombs at a police station as violence flared in Hong Kong during a banned march that drew tens of thousands. Authorities had refused permission for a march through an upmarket shopping area, citing public order concerns. But large numbers defied that - and a small group of black-clad protesters later attacked a police station. Hong Kong has been convulsed by pro-democracy protests for four months. The unrest in the territory, which is part of China but enjoys unique freedoms, is its most serious crisis since the Britain handed it over in 1997. Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words Why Starbucks? The brands attacked in Hong Kong At Tsim Sha Tsui police station, officers fired tear gas as the building's gate was set on fire. A water cannon was then deployed to clear the area, which would normally be thronged with Sunday shoppers. Some protesters tossed petrol bombs at a police station In one controversial incident, a water cannon truck fired powerful jets of blue liquid at protesters outside a mosque. Police said the water cannon had ""accidentally affected the entrance and front gate"" of the mosque. The Muslim Council of Hong Kong said the mosque was not targeted by police, whose officers later apologised and helped with the clean-up effort. Allow Twitter content?

Elsewhere, shops and Chinese banks were vandalised. A large blaze, started by protesters, engulfed the store of  Chinese smartphone maker, Xiaomi, in the Mong Kok area. Not all of Sunday's demonstrators engaged in violence. Although the rally was unauthorised, it began peacefully. The anger of the crowd was partly fuelled byan attack on pro-democracy leader Jimmy Sham earlier this week which left him in hospital. He was set upon by five men with hammers in the Mong Kok district of Kowloon. On Saturday, another man who was reportedly handing out pro-democracy flyers was stabbed. Water cannons have been laced with blue dye to identify those hit at a later stage In recent weeks, numbers attending protests have dropped from their peak. The movement has seen hundreds of thousands taking part in demonstrations on several occasions. This Sunday's rally rivalled those numbers, according to organisers, who said around 350,000 people attended. Attendance figures from Hong Kong police are not yet available. One protester, Daniel Yeung, said Sunday's turnout far exceeded his expectations, adding that ""Hong Kongers won't easily give up their right to demonstrate"". ""The government are now refusing to authorise any peaceful protest,"" another demonstrator named Avery said on Sunday. ""That means anyone who comes out will inherently be breaking the law. So that's the tactic the Hong Kong government is using."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Originally, the protests were prompted by outrage at a new law that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China. People in Hong Kong are fiercely protective of their legal system and enhanced personal rights, which are governed under an arrangement known as ""one country, two systems"". But they have grown increasingly concerned that China seeks greater control. Hong Kong's leader eventually vowed to scrap the extradition bill, but the protest movement has broadened to include four other demands: For the protests not to be characterised as a ""riot"" Amnesty for arrested protesters An independent inquiry into alleged police brutality Implementation of complete universal suffrage Hong Kong's embattled leader Carrie Lam is seen by many pro-democracy campaigners as a mouthpiece for Beijing â something she denies. This video can not be played Watch the moment chaos erupts in Hong Kong parliament on Wednesday Ms Lam was forced to abandon her major annual speech in parliament this week after opposition lawmakers heckled her, brandishing banners and shouting slogans.

"One of the world's leading fund managers has been forced to resign after the BBC discovered he had broken investment rules. Mark Denning helped to manage more than $300bn (Â£229bn; â¬265bn)   of investors' money at Capital Group. BBC One's Panorama uncovered evidence that suggests he was secretly acquiring shares for his own benefit in some of the same companies as his funds. Mr Denning, who had worked at the firm for 36 years, denies any wrongdoing. The 62-year-old fund manager left his job five days after Panorama wrote to Capital Group about the findings of its investigation. Capital Group - which manages almost $2 trillion of assets - said Mr Denning was no longer with the firm. ""We have a Code of Ethics and personal investing disclosure requirements that hold our associates to the highest standards of conduct. When we learned of this matter, we took immediate action,"" it said. Fund managers are not supposed to invest in the same companies as their funds, because they could potentially profit at the expense of investors. This is because their size means the funds can drive up a company's share price when they invest. The fund manager could use this power to push up the share price in the companies where they have personal investments, rather than picking the companies that offer the best returns for investors. The Panorama investigation discovered that shares were bought on Mr Denning's instructions through a secretive fund based in Liechtenstein. It was called Morebath Fund Global Opportunities. Leaked documents show the Morebath fund had invested in a medical research company called Mesoblast, an Indian film company called Eros International and a gold mining company called Hummingbird Resources. Capital Group funds also invested in all three companies, and the investments in Mesoblast and Eros were made by funds that Mr Denning himself helped to manage. In the case of Hummingbird Resources, Mr Denning appeared to have another potential conflict of interest as the company was set up and run by his son-in-law. This video can not be played ""If there was an intention by the fund manager to financially benefit themselves, that does raise serious concerns."" An expert on the financial rules told Panorama that the private purchases by Mr Denning could represent a serious conflict of interest. Michael Ruck, investigations partner at the law firm TLT, said: ""The whole point behind the regime, in relation to declaring conflicts of interest, is to protect investors. ""If there was an intention by the fund manager to financially benefit themselves, then that does raise serious concerns in relation to their actions."" The stakes in the three companies were ultimately held through an offshore entity called the Kinrara Trust. It was set up and controlled by Mr Denning. Mr Denning's lawyers deny that he owns the shares in the three companies because they say he is not a beneficiary of the Kinrara Trust. ""Our client did not declare his interest in the Kinrara Trust to his former employers because he had been irrevocably excluded as a beneficiary. He believed that he had complied with all of his relevant duties."" Mr Denning's lawyers say he received bad advice. They also say the Morebath fund had an independent asset manager and fund administrator. However, Panorama has seen evidence that Mr Denning was behind the share purchases in the three companies and documents show the Morebath fund was regularly included in a summary of his personal assets. Mr Denning appears to have named the Liechtenstein-based fund after the village of Morebath in North Devon. He owns a nine bedroom house, Morebath Manor, and 21 acres of parkland in the village. The fund manager also owns luxury homes in Chelsea and the Bahamas. Mr Denning used to work for Capital Group in London and was approved by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority until 2018. However, four of the funds he managed were aimed at American investors and he had been working from the company's office in Los Angeles. Panorama also discovered that the Kinrara Trust owned Kinrara International - a company that profited from a controversial energy deal in Senegal. Kinrara International made $22m after the exploration rights to a huge gas field off the Senegalese coast were sold to BP. Experts have told Panorama that they believe Mr Denning should also have declared this - because Capital Group had investments in BP and another company involved in the deal called Kosmos Energy. Mr Denning's lawyers say he has never been a legal or beneficial owner of Kinrara International.

"This video can not be played Unrest sparked by a metro fare hike continues in Santiago Three people have been killed by a fire inside a supermarket in Santiago during a second night of protests in Chile. Two people died at the scene and another died in hospital after the store was looted, Santiago's regional governor, Karla Rubilar, said. President PiÃ±era has suspended the rise in metro fares that sparked the protests, but unrest has continued. Soldiers and tanks were deployed after the government declared a state of emergency and imposed a night curfew. The protests have broadened to reflect general discontent about the high cost of living in one of Latin America's most stable countries. The unrest, the worst in decades, has exposed divisions in the nation, one of the region's wealthiest but also one of its most unequal, and intensified calls for economic reforms. In pictures: Santiago in state of emergency Chile country profile In parts of Santiago, hundreds of troops were deployed on the streets for the first time since 1990, when Chile returned to democracy after the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. In the second day of violent demonstrations, protesters erected barricades and set buses on fire, and police used tear gas and water cannon. Clashes erupted in the city centre with Mayor Felipe Alessandri describing the situation as chaotic. More than 300 people have been arrested, and 156 police injured, as were 11 civilians, police said. Demonstrators clashed with security forces in the capital, Santiago Speaking on television, President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era, whose response to the protests has been criticised, said he had listened ""with humility"" to ""the voice of my compatriots"" and to discontent over the cost of living. Gen Javier Iturriaga del Campo, who is in charge of security in Santiago under the state of emergency, said a curfew would be enforced between 22:00 and 07:00 (01:00-10:00 GMT) in the city and outlying areas. The military is due to help police patrol the streets during a declared 15-day state of emergency that allows authorities to restrict people's freedom of movement and their right to assembly. Later on Saturday, the mayors of the ValparaÃ­so region and ConcepciÃ³n province also announced states of emergency. Earlier, cultural and sporting events were cancelled and shops remained closed. The city's underground system will remain shut down until Monday, with 41 of 136 stations vandalised. Protesters continued on Saturday despite the military deployment Protests were also reported in the cities of ConcepciÃ³n, Rancagua, Punta Arenas, ValparaÃ­so, Iquique, Antofagasta, Quillota and Talca, according to El Mercurio newspaper. Meanwhile, a picture of President PiÃ±era in an upmarket Italian restaurant on Friday evening as police and demonstrators clashed in Santiago was heavily criticised on social media. Critics said the image, reportedly during a birthday celebration for the president's grandson, were emblematic of a leader out of touch with ordinary Chileans. Allow Twitter content?

"The pound slipped against the dollar as currency markets got their first chance to react to MPs backing a move to delay approval of the Brexit deal. Many banks in London had called in extra staff, expecting volatile trading after the first Saturday sitting in the House of Commons for 37 years. But the pound's reaction was muted, slipping 0.6% against the dollar to $1.29, and down 0.4% against the euro. On Friday, the pound had been trading at its highest level for five months. Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda, said the fall in the currency was limited because ""despite more twists and turns than any other soap opera in history, a hard Brexit is now highly unlikely"". Jane Foley, senior foreign exchange strategist at Rabobank, told the BBC's Today programme: ""[Investors] are a little bit more anxious certainly than they were at the end of last week. There was a lot of confidence going in to Saturday's vote that there would be something a little bit more constructive. ""Instead, of course, we've got this delay, so the lower pound this morning reflects the delay. But sterling hasn't sold off very much. If we go back 10 to 12 days, we were trading at $1.22, so we are significantly higher and this is of course related to optimism that Boris Johnson's government may have the numbers to push this deal through. This could still be done in a very short period of time. ""But of course, if we look at the medium term, there is still plenty of scope for volatility, there is still plenty of risk."" Deutsche Bank, like many other banks, had set up additional staff to come in on Sunday expecting a strong reaction to Saturday's vote. But it scaled back numbers after the weekend's events - which saw Prime Minister Boris Johnson send an unsigned request to the EU for a further delay, accompanied by another letter - signed this time - clarifying that was not his own personal position. Events serious enough to require extra staffing out of normal trading hours are relatively rare in currency trading, normally linked to a big infrequent event such as an election with an uncertain outcome, for example. But Russell Lascala, global head of FX at Deutsche Bank, said that, since the Brexit referendum, there had been five or six such events. ""The uncertainty has been going on for years. The market is begging for clarity, to be able to invest or not invest."" Sir Ian Cheshire, chairman of Barclays' UK operations, told the BBC that the deal on offer was ""acceptable"". ""No deal is perfect, but this deal is actually doable and it is, I think, very frustrating to see what appears to be a protracted process when most business leaders would like to see some certainty and get on,"" he said. ""The chances of yet another round of negotiations are extremely unlikely to yield anything significantly different and now the delay is beginning to affect consumer confidence, particularly investment confidence, and I think we have to push ahead and make the best of what we've got coming down the track."" Currency analysts say they expect the next strong movement in the pound to be when the Brexit deal is voted on in Parliament. However, after Saturday's vote, many believe a no-deal Brexit is now less likely. US investment bank Goldman Sachs, which issues regular updates to its clients, now thinks there is a 5% chance of a no-deal Brexit, down from 10% previously.

"""If you were trying to design a way to close businesses like mine, you'd behave exactly as the government has done"". Rob Tanner is on the cusp of winding up his 19-year-old business, SEA Oxford. He takes parties of Europeans - mainly teachers - sightseeing to some of the UK's most popular tourist hotspots such as Stonehenge and Bath. He says the European Union funds the teachers and that trickles down to his business. Rob has seen the number of people taking his tours drop by a fifth in the past few years, he says, which is not only affecting him, but the coach companies and host families he works with. He can't go on any longer. ""At some point the uncertainty will level out - but we just don't know when that will be and if it does recover we don't know if EU visitors will return to the levels that they were at,"" he said. Frustration underpins his every word. Like many small business people, he wanted a decision to be made, and quickly. But it's all come too late for his business. He says the uncertainty is sending customers elsewhere. ""People are going to Malta and Ireland now to learn English because none of the details have been ironed out,"" he said. Brexit: Firms have 'no idea what's going on' Carney: Brexit deal 'positive' for UK economy The Federation of Small Businesses says ""the prolonged period of uncertainty"" caused by the political stalemate has left small businesses like his ""in limbo, with investment plans on hold and confidence low"". In many ways, the debate going on in the business world is the same as in Parliament's. A snap poll carried out by the Institute of Directors (IoD) indicated business leaders were split on the issue of whether politicians should vote Boris Johnson's deal through. In the survey of 655 people conducted between 17 and 19 October, a small majority (55%) thought MPs should approve the deal, as opposed to 41% who thought the Commons should vote against it. The IoD poll suggests that businesses want to avoid a no-deal and move towards either another referendum (30%) or a general election (24%). The Food and Drink Federation - which is concerned about the impact of possible delays on the UK's borders to fresh produce - welcomed the delay. Chief executive Ian Wright said it wanted the extra time to scrutinise the deal,which was only published on Thursday. ""We shouldn't allow the fact that the nation is exhausted to mean we sleepwalk into mistakes that will haunt the UK economy for a generation,"" he said. Most business groups say they want the threat of leaving the European Union at the end of the month with no agreement in place to go away. The British Chambers of Commerce says they'd like to see an ""iron-clad guarantee"" on that front. However, there are also those who say they just want a decision to be made - whatever the terms. A recent survey of clients by the accountancy firm EY found the majority believe Brexit is inevitable and ""are desperate for clarity to the extent they're now willing to accept no deal if that is what it takes"". According to Stephen Welton, chief executive of the Business Growth Fund which funds high growth start-ups, businesses don't have much time left to play with. ""At the moment we are stuck in increasingly circular and damaging debate,"" he said. ""One consequence is that business investment is slowing. We urgently need to redress that and a deal will be the catalyst to that."" Mark Essex, director of public policy for KPMG, agrees the impact of a continued delay will mean damage to the UK's economy - and frustration for companies. He said: ""There's a pent up level of investment to be unleashed on things like infrastructure - decarbonisation - digital connectivity - retail. People aren't sure what regulatory environment is going to be - would you make a big bet on that environment?"" Whatever the specific feelings aboutSaturday's vote- there's no doubt that three years on from the referendum - businesses still feel paralysed by Parliament. A desire to see an end to uncertainty has been a unifying force over the past three years - and many still don't see any clarity on the way forward.

"Ahead of the launch of his most ambitious series yet, broadcaster Sir David Attenborough talks to the BBC about his cult status, a lifetime protecting the planet and finally finding its most elusive animal. This year's Glastonbury Festival was headlined by Stormzy, The Killers, Kylie and The Cure, but the highlight for many was the surprise appearance of a 93-year-old knight of the realm. Sir David Attenborough, who was there to promote his new series Seven Worlds, One Planet,walked out on to the Pyramid Stage to rapturous applause,external, thanked everybody on Worthy Farm for not drinking out of plastic bottles and urged them to keep looking out for all creatures great and small. Several months on, he admits he finds his growing influence on the environmentally woke youth of today a bit bizarre. ""It's very odd,"" he laughs. ""But the fact remains I've been at it 60 years. You can say nobody under the age of 75 can have been without my voice coming from the corner of the room at various times and that must have an effect. Glastonbury: Sir David Attenborough hails plastic ban ""It's a huge advantage for me because you go there with some sort of reputation and people are aware of you, and in a sense you've been part of the family for quite a long time, which is an extraordinary obligation really and a privilege. ""I'm sure there's a hell of a lot of young people saying 'for God's sake why don't they move over, give the others a chance,'"" he modestly adds. In truth, no-one is saying that. Showstopper: Sir David Attenborough addresses tens of thousands of festival-goers on Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage The broadcaster, who recentlyhad a boat named in his honour, was listed as one of the 100 Greatest Britons in a BBC poll in 2002. Since then, his stock has risen exponentially due to natural history shows like Planet Earth, Dynasties and Blue Planet II - whichbrought the issue of plastic wasteto the public's attention andbumped climate change up the government's agenda. Last week, more than 80,000 people applied for just 300 tickets for an early screening of his new documentary, which arrives at what Sir David calls ""the most critical moment on earth since the continents formed"". The series, narrated by the ""rock star"" - as BBC boss Tony Hall introduced him earlier in the day - focuses on the human impact on climate change, animal diversity, poaching and deforestation across all seven continents. The latest scientific research revealed theeffects of climate change are speeding up, as world leaders met to discuss it in New York last month. ""At last nations are coming together and recognising we all live on the same planet,"" Sir David acknowledges. ""All these seven worlds are actually one and we are dependent on it for every mouthful of food we eat and every breath of air we take. ""We have it in our hands and we've made a tragic, desperate mess of it so far."" Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

"Ahead of the launch of his most ambitious series yet, broadcaster Sir David Attenborough talks to the BBC about his cult status, a lifetime protecting the planet and finally finding its most elusive animal. This year's Glastonbury Festival was headlined by Stormzy, The Killers, Kylie and The Cure, but the highlight for many was the surprise appearance of a 93-year-old knight of the realm. Sir David Attenborough, who was there to promote his new series Seven Worlds, One Planet,walked out on to the Pyramid Stage to rapturous applause,external, thanked everybody on Worthy Farm for not drinking out of plastic bottles and urged them to keep looking out for all creatures great and small. Several months on, he admits he finds his growing influence on the environmentally woke youth of today a bit bizarre. ""It's very odd,"" he laughs. ""But the fact remains I've been at it 60 years. You can say nobody under the age of 75 can have been without my voice coming from the corner of the room at various times and that must have an effect. Glastonbury: Sir David Attenborough hails plastic ban ""It's a huge advantage for me because you go there with some sort of reputation and people are aware of you, and in a sense you've been part of the family for quite a long time, which is an extraordinary obligation really and a privilege. ""I'm sure there's a hell of a lot of young people saying 'for God's sake why don't they move over, give the others a chance,'"" he modestly adds. In truth, no-one is saying that. Showstopper: Sir David Attenborough addresses tens of thousands of festival-goers on Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage The broadcaster, who recentlyhad a boat named in his honour, was listed as one of the 100 Greatest Britons in a BBC poll in 2002. Since then, his stock has risen exponentially due to natural history shows like Planet Earth, Dynasties and Blue Planet II - whichbrought the issue of plastic wasteto the public's attention andbumped climate change up the government's agenda. Last week, more than 80,000 people applied for just 300 tickets for an early screening of his new documentary, which arrives at what Sir David calls ""the most critical moment on earth since the continents formed"". The series, narrated by the ""rock star"" - as BBC boss Tony Hall introduced him earlier in the day - focuses on the human impact on climate change, animal diversity, poaching and deforestation across all seven continents. The latest scientific research revealed theeffects of climate change are speeding up, as world leaders met to discuss it in New York last month. ""At last nations are coming together and recognising we all live on the same planet,"" Sir David acknowledges. ""All these seven worlds are actually one and we are dependent on it for every mouthful of food we eat and every breath of air we take. ""We have it in our hands and we've made a tragic, desperate mess of it so far."" Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

"This video can not be played Unrest sparked by a metro fare hike continues in Santiago Three people have been killed by a fire inside a supermarket in Santiago during a second night of protests in Chile. Two people died at the scene and another died in hospital after the store was looted, Santiago's regional governor, Karla Rubilar, said. President PiÃ±era has suspended the rise in metro fares that sparked the protests, but unrest has continued. Soldiers and tanks were deployed after the government declared a state of emergency and imposed a night curfew. The protests have broadened to reflect general discontent about the high cost of living in one of Latin America's most stable countries. The unrest, the worst in decades, has exposed divisions in the nation, one of the region's wealthiest but also one of its most unequal, and intensified calls for economic reforms. In pictures: Santiago in state of emergency Chile country profile In parts of Santiago, hundreds of troops were deployed on the streets for the first time since 1990, when Chile returned to democracy after the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. In the second day of violent demonstrations, protesters erected barricades and set buses on fire, and police used tear gas and water cannon. Clashes erupted in the city centre with Mayor Felipe Alessandri describing the situation as chaotic. More than 300 people have been arrested, and 156 police injured, as were 11 civilians, police said. Demonstrators clashed with security forces in the capital, Santiago Speaking on television, President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era, whose response to the protests has been criticised, said he had listened ""with humility"" to ""the voice of my compatriots"" and to discontent over the cost of living. Gen Javier Iturriaga del Campo, who is in charge of security in Santiago under the state of emergency, said a curfew would be enforced between 22:00 and 07:00 (01:00-10:00 GMT) in the city and outlying areas. The military is due to help police patrol the streets during a declared 15-day state of emergency that allows authorities to restrict people's freedom of movement and their right to assembly. Later on Saturday, the mayors of the ValparaÃ­so region and ConcepciÃ³n province also announced states of emergency. Earlier, cultural and sporting events were cancelled and shops remained closed. The city's underground system will remain shut down until Monday, with 41 of 136 stations vandalised. Protesters continued on Saturday despite the military deployment Protests were also reported in the cities of ConcepciÃ³n, Rancagua, Punta Arenas, ValparaÃ­so, Iquique, Antofagasta, Quillota and Talca, according to El Mercurio newspaper. Meanwhile, a picture of President PiÃ±era in an upmarket Italian restaurant on Friday evening as police and demonstrators clashed in Santiago was heavily criticised on social media. Critics said the image, reportedly during a birthday celebration for the president's grandson, were emblematic of a leader out of touch with ordinary Chileans. Allow Twitter content?

"""If you were trying to design a way to close businesses like mine, you'd behave exactly as the government has done"". Rob Tanner is on the cusp of winding up his 19-year-old business, SEA Oxford. He takes parties of Europeans - mainly teachers - sightseeing to some of the UK's most popular tourist hotspots such as Stonehenge and Bath. He says the European Union funds the teachers and that trickles down to his business. Rob has seen the number of people taking his tours drop by a fifth in the past few years, he says, which is not only affecting him, but the coach companies and host families he works with. He can't go on any longer. ""At some point the uncertainty will level out - but we just don't know when that will be and if it does recover we don't know if EU visitors will return to the levels that they were at,"" he said. Frustration underpins his every word. Like many small business people, he wanted a decision to be made, and quickly. But it's all come too late for his business. He says the uncertainty is sending customers elsewhere. ""People are going to Malta and Ireland now to learn English because none of the details have been ironed out,"" he said. Brexit: Firms have 'no idea what's going on' Carney: Brexit deal 'positive' for UK economy The Federation of Small Businesses says ""the prolonged period of uncertainty"" caused by the political stalemate has left small businesses like his ""in limbo, with investment plans on hold and confidence low"". In many ways, the debate going on in the business world is the same as in Parliament's. A snap poll carried out by the Institute of Directors (IoD) indicated business leaders were split on the issue of whether politicians should vote Boris Johnson's deal through. In the survey of 655 people conducted between 17 and 19 October, a small majority (55%) thought MPs should approve the deal, as opposed to 41% who thought the Commons should vote against it. The IoD poll suggests that businesses want to avoid a no-deal and move towards either another referendum (30%) or a general election (24%). The Food and Drink Federation - which is concerned about the impact of possible delays on the UK's borders to fresh produce - welcomed the delay. Chief executive Ian Wright said it wanted the extra time to scrutinise the deal,which was only published on Thursday. ""We shouldn't allow the fact that the nation is exhausted to mean we sleepwalk into mistakes that will haunt the UK economy for a generation,"" he said. Most business groups say they want the threat of leaving the European Union at the end of the month with no agreement in place to go away. The British Chambers of Commerce says they'd like to see an ""iron-clad guarantee"" on that front. However, there are also those who say they just want a decision to be made - whatever the terms. A recent survey of clients by the accountancy firm EY found the majority believe Brexit is inevitable and ""are desperate for clarity to the extent they're now willing to accept no deal if that is what it takes"". According to Stephen Welton, chief executive of the Business Growth Fund which funds high growth start-ups, businesses don't have much time left to play with. ""At the moment we are stuck in increasingly circular and damaging debate,"" he said. ""One consequence is that business investment is slowing. We urgently need to redress that and a deal will be the catalyst to that."" Mark Essex, director of public policy for KPMG, agrees the impact of a continued delay will mean damage to the UK's economy - and frustration for companies. He said: ""There's a pent up level of investment to be unleashed on things like infrastructure - decarbonisation - digital connectivity - retail. People aren't sure what regulatory environment is going to be - would you make a big bet on that environment?"" Whatever the specific feelings aboutSaturday's vote- there's no doubt that three years on from the referendum - businesses still feel paralysed by Parliament. A desire to see an end to uncertainty has been a unifying force over the past three years - and many still don't see any clarity on the way forward. LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Maps and pictures chart how fires have spread Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"Adam Lallana's equaliser was his first Premier League goal since May 2017 Adam Lallana's late equaliser rescued a point for Liverpool at Old Trafford as Manchester United ended the leaders' flawless start to the Premier League season. Liverpool were in search of their 18th successive league win to equal Manchester City's top-flight record set between August and December 2017 but had to settle for a point after a scrappy encounter. Marcus Rashford's hotly-contested first-half goal, allowed after a video assistant referee check for a foul by Victor Lindelof on Divock Origi, looked to be condemning Liverpool to their first league loss since they went down at Manchester City in January. Rashford finished neatly from Daniel James' cross in the 36th minute but Liverpool, who saw a first-half strike from Sadio Mane ruled out by VAR for handball, struck back when substitute Lallana arrived unmarked at the far post to score from Andy Robertson's cross five minutes from time. The draw means Liverpool's advantage at the top of the table has been cut to six points. Analysis - how Solskjaer found a way to stop Liverpool Klopp: Man Utd always set up to defend against us Was Liverpool's run always destined to end at Man Utd? Discover how you rated the players This video can not be played Man Utd 1-1 Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp takes issue with tackle on Divock Origi Liverpool's relentless start to the season ended here at Old Trafford, an arena where they always struggle to produce their best. They have failed to win on their past six visits to Manchester United, comprising three losses and three draws, meaning manager Jurgen Klopp is still searching for his first win here with Liverpool. Robbed of the injured Mohamed Salah, Liverpool started with Origi on the left and rarely displayed the intensity and attacking verve that has become their trademark in a strangely subdued performance. They had 68% of the ball but barely created any clear-cut opportunities in a match that swiftly became a war of attrition. Liverpool, however, are sustained by a fierce determination even when not in top gear and Lallana was on the mark after a lengthy spell of possession to score his first league goal for over two years. Klopp's side even threatened to snatch victory, but substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's shot flashed inches wide. Klopp was furious about the decision to award Rashford's goal but he must also accept that this was a below-par Liverpool performance and in the end they and their fans, who taunted their United counterparts with inflatable Champions League trophies and the number ""6"", were grateful for a draw that means they still have a healthy advantage at the Premier League summit. This video can not be played Danny Murphy believes Man Utd's performance against Liverpool is something to 'build on' Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will be bitterly disappointed they could not hang on for five more minutes for what would have been a hugely satisfying landmark win. He will, however, be delighted with the fight, spirit and organisation shown by his side, especially as the five-man defensive system United had been working on this week was disrupted minutes before kick-off when Axel Tuanzebe was injured in the warm-up and replaced by Marcos Rojo. They subdued Liverpool until they switched off carelessly late on when Rojo went missing and Ashley Young failed to spot the danger from Lallana in behind him. Overall, however, this was a huge improvement simply in terms of resilience and character. Goalscorer Rashford worked tirelessly while Scott McTominay continues to mature in midfield, and the Stretford End showed their appreciation at the final whistle. This is a mediocre Manchester United side but there was no shortage of effort and they deserved a point that Solskjaer will hope provides a platform for a rise up the table. Some 35% of Marcus Rashford's Premier League goals have come against 'big six' sides (11/31) Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer:""It's important to get results. That's the only way to grow confidence. A win would have been great but a draw is a step in the right direction. ""As a manager you want results now - you can't lose four, five or six games on the bounce. We're looking to win games as soon as possible."" On the lack of a free-kick to Liverpool in the build-up to Rashford's goal:""It's maybe a slight touch but it's not a clear and obvious error. It's still a man's game with tackles allowed, and the second one [Sadio Mane's disallowed goal] was a handball. Today we were on the right end of the VAR decisions."" This video can not be played Man Utd 1-1 Liverpool: Solskjaer praises referee Atkinson Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:""The result is OK. It's not what we wanted but we have to be happy given how the game developed. The first half I didn't like because we gave United the chance to do what they want to do - to put us under pressure and be aggressive. They were not better than we were but they did what they wanted to do. ""They scored a goal which shows all the problems with VAR. Mr Atkinson let the game run I'm sure because there is VAR. For me it was a clear foul. It's a general problem. VAR looks and says 'you decided like this'. But it was a foul. Then we scored a goal that was disallowed. Pretty much everything went against us but we still didn't lose so that is OK. ""We were in charge 100% towards the end. We wanted a different result but to do that you have to play better."" Liverpool failed to win for the first time in 18 Premier League games, since a goalless draw with Everton in March. No side has dropped more points from winning positions in the Premier League this season than Manchester United (8, level with Aston Villa). United registered their second lowest possession figure (32.1%) in a Premier League home match since 2003-04, second only to 32.06% against Liverpool in March 2018. Five of the past seven Premier League meetings between United and Liverpool have ended level (one win each) - just four of the previous 36 between the sides had been drawn. English players scored for both Manchester United and Liverpool in a Premier League meeting for the first time since November 2001 (David Beckham and Michael Owen). Since the start of last season, Liverpool have scored 28 Premier League goals in the final 15 minutes of games, more than any other side. Man Utd boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is the only manager Jurgen Klopp has faced more than once in the Premier League and failed to beat (P2 D2). 35% of Marcus Rashford's 31 Premier League goals for Manchester United have come against 'big six' opponents (11/31). Liverpool's Adam Lallana netted his first goal in 29 Premier League appearances, since scoring against Middlesbrough in May 2017. Since the start of 2017-18, Liverpool's Andrew Robertson has registered 19 assists in the Premier League, more than any other defender. Liverpool visit Genk in the Champions League on Wednesday, with United at Partizan Belgrade in the Europa League on Thursday. Next Sunday in the Premier League, Liverpool host Tottenham with United at Norwich City.

"London saw a huge protest on Saturday, calling for a second referendum on Brexit Boris Johnson made it crystal clear on Saturday: he did not want to write to EU leaders requesting another Brexit extension. And they were crystal clear in telephone calls with him that day that they were far from thrilled to be asked. But UK law demanded the letter be sent. So now what? Don't expect any speedy EU action, for starters. On Saturday, French President Emmanuel Macron repeated his view that a new Brexit extension was not good for anyone. Boris Johnson literally spelling out his opposition to prolonging the Brexit process by writing a separate letter to Brussels to say so, makes it easier for his peers Mr Macron, Angela Merkel and others to drag their feet a little. LIVE: Latest reaction to Johnson's letter > ANALYSIS: Chances of agreement still strong, says Laura Kuenssberg > UPSUM: What happened on Saturday? > IN GRAPHICS:  What happens now? > They prefer first to look to the prime minister to make good on his promise to them that their newly-negotiated Brexit deal will *definitely* be passed by parliament. And time (relatively speaking, of course) is on the prime minister's and EU leaders' side. Under EU law the Brexit deadline is not until 31 October. In theory, Europe's leaders could wait until the morning of the 31st to hold an emergency summit to discuss an extension. Right now they are keen to keep up the pressure on MPs, to help them focus their minds on what they really want, rather than rush forward with another extension, allowing them (in EU eyes) to keep going round in circles, never uniting around one particular concrete Brexit plan. EU leaders like Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel must now decide whether to grant a Brexit extension All 27 EU leaders have to agree for a new Brexit extension to be granted and they will grumble, they will moan and they will stamp their feet (metaphorically, at least). But, if push comes to shove, with the alternative being no deal at all, then, after more than three years of Brexit process and negotiating two Brexit deals with two UK prime ministers, I cannot imagine the EU slamming the door in the face of the UK now. If the House of Commons refuses to approve the new Brexit deal in the next couple of weeks, then granting a new extension would be in EU leaders' interest. They are keen not be blamed by their own citizens for a costly no-deal Brexit. So, through gritted teeth, and only if EU leaders believe that it is needed, they will eventually most likely say yes to an extension. But a short one, if possible. Boris Johnson has struggled to find enough support in parliament, losing a number of key Brexit votes since becoming prime minister They will want to know what it's for. Are there plans in the UK to hold a general election, a second referendum or a referendum on the new Brexit deal? Or is a bit more time needed to pass Brexit-related legislation? EU diplomats rule out the idea of further negotiations or amending the new Brexit deal, whatever comes out of the House of Commons over the next few days. The EU fervently hopes this Brexit deal is the last one. Leaders want to move on to the next stage: negotiating future relations between the EU and UK, including a trade deal. The leaving bit was originally billed as the easy part. 'I will not negotiate delay with EU' Video, 00:02:52'I will not negotiate delay with EU' What actually happened on Saturday?

"All smiles: Qantas crew celebrate after the 19-hour journey from New York to Sydney Australian carrier Qantas has completed a test of the longest non-stop commercial passenger flight as part of research on how the journey could affect pilots, crew and passengers. The Boeing 787-9 with 49 people on board took 19 hours and 16 minutes to fly from New York to Sydney, a 16,200-km (10,066-mile) route. Next month, the company plans to test a non-stop flight from London to Sydney. Qantas expects to decide on whether to start the routes by the end of 2019. If it goes ahead with them, the services would start operating in 2022 or 2023. How UK-Australia travel evolved to one flight Can long-haul air travel also be low cost? No commercial aircraft yet has the range to fly such an ultra-long haul route with a full passenger and cargo load, Reuters news agency reports. To give the plane sufficient fuel range to avoid re-fuelling, the Qantas flight took off with maximum fuel, restricted baggage load and no cargo. The Boeing 787-9 arrives at Sydney international airport Passengers set their watches to Sydney time after boarding and were kept awake until night fell in eastern Australia to reduce their jetlag. Six hours later, they were served a high-carbohydrate meal and the lights were dimmed to encourage them to sleep. On-board tests included monitoring pilot brain waves, melatonin levels and alertness as well as exercise classes for passengers and analysis of the impact of crossing so many time zones on people's bodies. ""This is a really significant first for aviation. Hopefully, it's a preview of a regular service that will speed up how people travel from one side of the globe to the other,"" said Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce. Competition in the ultra-long haul aviation market has intensified in recent years, with various airlines flying extended routes. Singapore Airlines launched a near-19 hour journey from Singapore to New Yorklast year, which is currently the world's longest regular commercial flight. Also last year, Qantas began a 17-hour non-stop service from Perth to London, while Qatar Airways operates a 17.5-hour service between Auckland and Doha.

that Boris Johnson sent multiple letters doesnât really matter in Brussels. The
fact the EU has been asked for a delay means it has been asked for a delay. At the
moment, lots of EU leaders are saying ""we donât think we need a delay"" but that
is a tactic to apply maximum pressure at Westminster to get a deal through. If nothing
changes by next weekend, though, they will have to consider it.

They were crystal clear in telephone calls with him that day that they were far from thrilled to be asked. But UK law demanded the letter be sent.

He adds: ""The only question is 'why aren't we getting on with it?'"" Mr Raab says that Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal is ""very strong"" and includes a democratic ""lock"" that was missing in Theresa May's previous agreement. Sky News Michael Gove tells Sky News' Sophy Ridge that he believes the government has the numbers to get Boris Johnson's deal through. Parliament can get the legislation through by 31 October, he adds. And if Parliament approves the legislation, the letter requesting the delay is withdrawn, Mr Gove said. Sky News Michael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, tells Sky News that the ""most important thing that all of us can do now is focus on getting the legislation through"". ""As a result of yesterday's vote, the risk of leaving without a deal has grown,"" he says. ""Now, as a result of that vote, we can't guarantee that any extension will be granted.""

"This video can not be played Unrest sparked by a metro fare hike continues in Santiago Three people have been killed by a fire inside a supermarket in Santiago during a second night of protests in Chile. Two people died at the scene and another died in hospital after the store was looted, Santiago's regional governor, Karla Rubilar, said. President PiÃ±era has suspended the rise in metro fares that sparked the protests, but unrest has continued. Soldiers and tanks were deployed after the government declared a state of emergency and imposed a night curfew. The protests have broadened to reflect general discontent about the high cost of living in one of Latin America's most stable countries. The unrest, the worst in decades, has exposed divisions in the nation, one of the region's wealthiest but also one of its most unequal, and intensified calls for economic reforms. In pictures: Santiago in state of emergency Chile country profile In parts of Santiago, hundreds of troops were deployed on the streets for the first time since 1990, when Chile returned to democracy after the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. In the second day of violent demonstrations, protesters erected barricades and set buses on fire, and police used tear gas and water cannon. Clashes erupted in the city centre with Mayor Felipe Alessandri describing the situation as chaotic. More than 300 people have been arrested, and 156 police injured, as were 11 civilians, police said. Demonstrators clashed with security forces in the capital, Santiago Speaking on television, President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era, whose response to the protests has been criticised, said he had listened ""with humility"" to ""the voice of my compatriots"" and to discontent over the cost of living. Gen Javier Iturriaga del Campo, who is in charge of security in Santiago under the state of emergency, said a curfew would be enforced between 22:00 and 07:00 (01:00-10:00 GMT) in the city and outlying areas. The military is due to help police patrol the streets during a declared 15-day state of emergency that allows authorities to restrict people's freedom of movement and their right to assembly. Later on Saturday, the mayors of the ValparaÃ­so region and ConcepciÃ³n province also announced states of emergency. Earlier, cultural and sporting events were cancelled and shops remained closed. The city's underground system will remain shut down until Monday, with 41 of 136 stations vandalised. Protesters continued on Saturday despite the military deployment Protests were also reported in the cities of ConcepciÃ³n, Rancagua, Punta Arenas, ValparaÃ­so, Iquique, Antofagasta, Quillota and Talca, according to El Mercurio newspaper. Meanwhile, a picture of President PiÃ±era in an upmarket Italian restaurant on Friday evening as police and demonstrators clashed in Santiago was heavily criticised on social media. Critics said the image, reportedly during a birthday celebration for the president's grandson, were emblematic of a leader out of touch with ordinary Chileans. Allow Twitter content?

"John Grieve headed the Metropolitan Police's anti-terrorist unit, and has spoken about the operation for the first time in a BBC Northern Ireland programme that will be aired on Monday Next week marks the 20th anniversary of the Canary Wharf bomb. Theexplosion in the heart of London's Docklands,externalmarked the end of a 17-month ceasefire in IRA operations. Now, the man charged with catching those responsible has explained how the manhunt happened. John Grieve headed the Metropolitan Police's anti-terrorist unit, and has spoken about the operation for the first time in a BBC Northern Ireland programme that will be aired on Monday. Describing the moment he knew something had happened, Commander Grieve said: ""You saw this whoosh of light, like a long, flat flash across the horizon. ""You could see looking right across London it was a big bomb that had gone off."" That ""whoosh of light"" was a 500kg bomb. It had been loaded on to a lorry in south Armagh, taken across the Irish Sea, driven down the length of England, and parked under the train tracks in Britain's new financial district. Hundreds of people were injured by flying glass in the aftermath of the explosion When Commander Grieve got to the scene, his worst fears were confirmed. ""Hundreds of people injured by flying glass, a scene of utter devastation... like anything you've ever seen in a movie. And that sort of flickering light from the fire brigade and torches... Like a scene from the apocalypse."" Two people were killed in the explosion, and many more were injured, some permanently. It was the responsibility of the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist unit to try and catch the individuals responsible. After appealing on television for information, Commander Grieve soon got his first lead. ""A call comes in from someone who clearly knows what he's talking about who says 'I'm telling you that truck was here at River Road Barking, on this piece of waste ground'. ""Exhibits officers go out there, talk to him, look at what they've got, and instantly recognise that they've got something very useful."" What was discovered was a truckers magazine inside a tyre. ""It was probably taken out of the vehicle to be burnt so it would disappear. I think they were spooked at that point,"" he said. The magazine had a clear fingerprint on which became the first crucial piece of evidence. The second print came after following motorway cameras back up to a Carlisle truck-stop. James McCardle of Crossmaglen was charged in connection with the bombing ""It's lucky that the cleaner hadn't polished the ash-tray because there is his thumbprint on that,"" he said. The third piece of evidence with that same thumbprint on was the Stenaline ticket from the Stranraer ferry. But there was no one matching the print already on the police system. The breakthrough came during a joint Scotland Yard and RUC operation on snipers in south Armagh. Commander Grieve said: ""I got a phone call saying we've arrested the sniper team, and I said congratulations that's wonderful. ""He said we've got the car, we've got the rifle, we've got them all alive which was really good, and he said the fingerprint officers had a look at the first set of fingerprints they've taken from the people we've arrested... and he just took one look at it and he said this is the triple thumbprint man."" James McCardle of Crossmaglen was charged. The RUC's senior investigating officer was Det Insp Alan Mains. Former Congressman Bruce Morris sees the Canary Wharf bomb as a triumph for the IRA He said: ""Not only was he caught for being in the car with the rifle, but also he was the suspect in the Canary Wharf bomb. And that was, in the policing world, just like winning the lottery."" The arrests were seen as the perfect example of a co-ordinated anti-terrorism operation, but others, like former Congressman Bruce Morris see the Canary Wharf bomb as a triumph for the IRA. He said: ""The great irony for me is that Canary Wharf got the republicans to the table. The actions of the British are really 'yes you can bomb your way to the conference table'. That's really what Canary Wharf was."" After the bomb the IRA reinstated it's ceasefire, Sinn FÃ©in was brought round the table and the Good Friday Agreement was signed. Those convicted of the Canary Warf bomb were released months later under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. The Docklands Bomb: Executing Peace will be broadcast on Monday 8 February at 21:00 GMT on BBC One Northern Ireland.

"The device was the biggest bomb to explode in mainland UK since World War Two In 1996 two IRA members planted the UK mainland's biggest bomb since World War Two outside a Manchester shopping centre. The explosion ripped the heart out of the city centre but remarkably no-one was killed. In fact, the blast is now credited by some as kick-starting the city's regeneration. The sun was shining and England were due to take on Scotland in Euro 96 on 15 June. It was the Saturday before Fathers Day and the Arndale Centre was heaving with shoppers. Football fans were also in town for the next day's Russia v Germany fixture at nearby Old Trafford. At about 09:20 BST, a white lorry was parked on double yellow lines near the Marks and Spencer store in the heart of the city. CCTV cameras record two men in hooded jackets getting out and walking away. A short time later, a traffic warden placed a parking ticket on the vehicle's windscreen. The white lorry with the bomb was filmed by a CCTV camera near the Marks and Spencer store Just before 10:00 BST, Gary Hall, a security guard at ITV's Granada studios - on the the other side of town - received a phone call from a man with a ""very calm"" Irish voice. The man said he had planted a bomb that would explode an hour later. Shortly afterwards, police began evacuating about 80,000 people from the city centre, while attempts were made to find the bomb. About 80,000 people were evacuated from the city centre within an hour People ran away in fear as shops and offices emptied. Amid the panic, a police officer spotted the white lorry and noticed wires running from the dashboard. Bomb disposal officers, dispatched from their base in Liverpool, planned to defuse the explosive with a remote-controlled robot. However, the attempt failed and, at 11:17 BST, the 3,300lb device exploded. Smoke mushroomed high above the city while buildings shook and glass shattered, raining debris on people outside the cordoned area. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the IRA bomb explode in Manchester in June 1996 Some 220 people were injured and several were traumatised by the massive blast. As emergency services dealt with the injured, fire crews searched shops and offices for casualties. In the confusion, fallen shop mannequins were briefly mistaken for bodies. However, to the amazement of many, no-one was killed. The bomb caused devastation across the city centre leading to a huge rebuilding project Many were injured by flying glass and debris False rumours of a second bomb led to one couple and their bridesmaid fleeing for safety No-one has ever been charged over the blast although Greater Manchester Police recently launchedanother review of the evidence. It is estimated the IRA bombing caused Â£700 million worth of damage. Plans to regenerate Manchester had already been in place - a tram network had been reintroduced earlier in the 1990s, cultural venues were shaping up and the city had already won the bid to host the 2002 Commonwealth Games. But the bomb's devastation inevitably widened the scale of rebuilding ahead of the millennium. A symbol of the city's effort to get back on its feet was the fact that it still managed to stage the Euro 96 match on the day after the attack. This post box near the lorry famously withstood the blast and is still in use After the bomb, Manchester receivedabout Â£583 million in private and public funding,externaltowards its regeneration, which saw it attract upmarket retailers such as Selfridges and Harvey Nichols. When a former newspaper printworks nearby was transformed into an entertainment venue in 2000, the relaunch was attended by former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and singer Lionel Ritchie. The National Football Museum moved next door in 2012, occupying the eye-catching Urbis building that was completed before the Commonwealth Games. The Urbis building is now the home of the National Football Museum The Arndale Centre has undergone a makeover and expansion since 1996 When the Marks and Spencer store that took the worst brunt of the blast was reopened in 1999 - a key moment in the rebirth of the city centre - it was not a politician or member of the royal family, nor a sports or entertainment figure, that was invited to cut the ribbon. The honour went to three-year-old Sam Hughes, pictured in the most striking image of the day of the explosion, as a security guard tried to help him. Baby Sam Hughes was injured on the day of the attack The Marks and Spencer building was rebuilt and is now surrounded by the construction site for a new tram route Manchester property consultant Ken Bishop says: ""The great irony of the bomb is that the devastation it brought acted as a catalyst for the improvement of what was an unloved part of the city."" He believes the city's business sector would have grown without the attack ""but arguably the uninvited intervention brought about a greater determination and swifter pace for this to happen"".

"Boris Johnson has sent an unsigned request to the EU for a delay to Brexit - followed by a signed one arguing against it. The PMsent three letters in all- an unsigned photocopy of the request as outlined bythe Benn Act; an explanatory note from the UK's ambassador to the EU; and a personal, signed, letter saying why he does not want a delay. Dear Mr President, The UK Parliament has passed the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019. Its provisions now require Her Majesty's Government to seek an extension of the period provided under Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty, currently due to expire at 11 p.m. GMT on 31 October 2019, until 11 p.m. GMT on 31 January 2020. I am writing therefore to inform the European Council that the United Kingdom is seeking a further extension to the period provided under Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty. The United Kingdom proposes that this period should end at 11 p.m. GMT on 31 January 2020. If the parties are able to ratify before this date, the Government proposes that the period should be terminated early. Yours sincerely, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Dear Secretary-General, As the United Kingdom Permanent Representative to the European Union, I invite your attention to the following matter. Attached is a letter sent as required by the terms of the European Union (Withdrawal) (No.2) Act 2019. In terms of the next steps for parliamentary process, Her Majesty's Government will introduce the necessary legislation next week in order to proceed with ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement. I would be grateful for your acknowledgement of receipt of this letter. Sir Tim Barrow Saturday's Brexit vote: What happens now? Analysis: Another 'meaningful vote'? Kuenssberg: Stand by for ever more bruising Brexit battle Dear Donald, It was good to see you again at the European Council this week where we agreed the historic new deal to permit the orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on October 31. I am deeply grateful to you, President Juncker and to all my fellow European leaders for the statesmanship and statecraft which enabled us to achieve this historic milestone. I should also register my appreciation for Michel Barnier and his team for their imagination and diplomacy as we concluded the negotiations. When I spoke in Parliament this morning, I noted the corrosive impact of the long delay in delivering the mandate of the British people from the 2016 referendum. I made clear that, while I believe passionately that both the UK and the EU will benefit from our decision to withdraw and develop a new relationship, that relationship will be founded on our deep respect and affection for our shared culture, civilisation, values and interests. We will remain the EU's closest partner and friend. The deal we approved at last week's European Council is a good deal for the whole of the UK and the whole of the EU. Regrettably, Parliament missed the opportunity to inject momentum into the ratification process for the new Withdrawal Agreement. The UK Parliament Representative will therefore submit the request mandated by the EU (Withdrawal) (No.2) Act 2019 later today. It is, of course, for the European Council to decide when to consider the request and whether to grant it. In view of the unique circumstances, while I regret causing my fellow leaders to devote more of their time and energy to a question I had hoped we had resolved last week, I recognise that you may need to convene a European Council. If it would be helpful to you, I would of course be happy to attend the start of any A50 Council so that I could answer properly any question on the position of HM Government and progress in the ratification process at that time. Meanwhile, although I would have preferred a different result today, the Government will press ahead with ratification and introduce the necessary legislation early next week. I remain confident that we will complete that process by 31 October. Indeed, many of those who voted against the Government today have indicated their support for the new deal and for ratifying it without delay. I know that I can count on your support and that of our fellow leaders to move the deal forward, and I very much hope therefore that on the EU side also, the process can be completed to allow the agreement to enter into force, as the European Council Conclusions mandated. While it is open to the European Council to accede to the request mandated by Parliament or to offer an alternative extension period, I have made clear since becoming Prime Minister, and made clear to Parliament again today, my view, and the Government's position, that a further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners, and the relationship between us. We must bring this process to a conclusion so that we can move to the next phase and build our new relationship on the foundations of our long history as neighbours and friends in this continent our peoples share. I am passionately committed to that endeavour. I am copying this letter to Presidents Juncker and Sassoli, and to members of the European Council.

that Boris Johnson sent multiple letters doesnât really matter in Brussels. The
fact the EU has been asked for a delay means it has been asked for a delay. At the
moment, lots of EU leaders are saying ""we donât think we need a delay"" but that
is a tactic to apply maximum pressure at Westminster to get a deal through. If nothing
changes by next weekend, though, they will have to consider it.

They were crystal clear in telephone calls with him that day that they were far from thrilled to be asked. But UK law demanded the letter be sent.

Ali told the BBC she felt it was the last chance to show how strongly she felt about having another vote.

""I would not feel comfortable sitting at home - I've got pals who have got a gig tonight but I just couldn't be there."" Millie Bishop-Morris, 17, made the journey from Plymouth with her mum and boyfriend. ""I think it's important that young people should be angry about this as well,"" she said. Millie, from Plymouth, has never been on a march before She added: ""I just think Brexit has gone completely the wrong way. I want to be optimistic but I'm preparing myself for the worst."" One group of protesters were seen pulling a float depicting top aide Dominic Cummings using Mr Johnson as a puppet. With ""Demonic Cummings"" splashed across its forehead, the figure on the float appears to be wearing a Nazi uniform, including an armband which reads Get Brexit Done, and has a Union Jack moustache. Who is Dominic Cummings? By Katie Wright, BBC News It was deja vu for many people as they descended on the streets of central London once again to demand a final say on Brexit. Six months on from the last big rally, there was bright sunshine and blue skies to greet the protesters - which included many returning faces, as well as those marching for the first time. In March a carnival vibe accompanied the slow walk from Park Lane to Parliament Square, but university student Ben Stocks said the atmosphere this time was ""more sombre"". Another member of the crowd, Simon Gosden, 63, agreed, saying: ""There's more of an air of tension. We know we're getting down to the nitty gritty - it's all or nothing."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell and Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson were among the politicians to address the rally at Parliament Square, alongside celebrities including Star Trek actor Sir Patrick Stewart and TV presenter Sandi Toksvig. Sir Patrick told the crowd they had proven another referendum was not a ""pipe dream"". He said: ""You haven't just filled a nice bar in north London, you have taken over an entire city. You haven't just impacted the Brexit debate, you have transformed British politics."" Well-known faces also joined in the walk to Parliament Square, including TV chef Rick Stein, who shared a picture from the march. Allow Twitter content?

"Hundreds of people were injured by flying glass in the aftermath of the explosion Twenty years ago an IRA bomb detonated in the heart of London's Docklands not only destroyed one of the country's biggest financial and economic centres, but also destroyed a much smaller business - a newsagent's shop. How did the family company recover? Two people working in the shop in Canary Wharf - Inam Bashir and John Jeffries - had not managed to evacuate the premises in time. They were killed. Over the past two decades Mr Bashir's brother, Ihsan, has been not only trying to come to terms with the loss of his brother but fighting to keep the business going. He said: ""The bomb was parked right next to our shop. The site itself, if you look at the pictures of it, it looks like a nuclear bomb has hit that. The way the damage is, it looks like the whole city has been wrecked."" Imam Bashir and John Jeffries were killed in the IRA attack The Bashir family not only suffered the loss of a son and brother, but shortly afterwards their father had a heart attack and died. Ihsan has said the differing experiences of Troubles victims on either side of the Irish Sea are clear to him. ""Once the funerals were over then you just look at your life, how you're going to cope with your loss. ""People in England don't have much of a voice.  People in Northern Ireland do, which is right, because they have suffered a lot. The UK government has tried their best to help, as much as they can, to appease the victims. ""But most of the time I feel that the appeasement has gone to the IRA, not to the actual families and victims. They have been forgotten. "" The half-tonne bomb was left in a small lorry near the Bashir's newsagent With the business gone, the family struggled to keep their heads above water, but eventually Mr Bashir reopened the newsagent and began trading again. Now, he runs a delicatessen on exactly the same spot where it all happened - a new business selling baguettes. Ihsan Bashir now runs Baguette Express on the site of the family newsagent He said he views it as continuing the legacy of a hard-working brother, as well as that of the family's friend and colleague John Jeffries. ""We will run it in their memory, and in memory against terrorism. You can't stop us from moving on, you cannot stop our lives. We will fight to make it survive, and work it. ""There's a old saying that you give your life for your business. Well we have. We've given our blood to that business. So I'm not going to let that go.""

"This video can not be played Watch as Andy Murray beats Ugo Humbert in Antwerp to reach his first ATP final since 2017. Britain's Andy Murray produced a fine comeback to beat Ugo Humbert at the European Open and reach his first ATP singles final for two years. Murray, who had career-saving hip surgery in January, showed his trademark stubbornness to win 3-6 7-5 6-2 in two hours 23 minutes. He will face fellow three-time Grand Slam winner Stan Wawrinka of Switzerland in Sunday's final. ""It's been a big surprise to me. I'm happy to be into the final,"" he said. Speaking to Amazon Prime, he added: ""It's been a long road to get back to this point ""I certainly didn't expect it to come so soon since I started playing again."" Live scores, schedule and results Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone It is 32-year-old Murray's first final appearance since theDubai Championships in March 2017, when he was then the world number one. No player had ever returned from a hip resurfacing operation to play singles before Murray. And he has managed to reach a final just two months after making his singles return, at Winston-Salem in August. This video can not be played Archive: Murray speaking about his 'life-changing' operation in June The Scot has played four tournaments in just over four weeks and showed signs of fatigue and frustration in the opening set. He struggled on his serve, producing three double faults in the first six games, which allowed 21-year-old Humbert to force the first break of the match. By contrast, Humbert wrapped up the first set with an ace, and kept up his aggressive play with some deep hitting in the second set. The two traded breaks in the second before Humbert, serving to force a tie-break, lost his rhythm, and handed Murray the set on a double fault. Five games in a row went to Murray, allowing him to open up a 3-0 lead in the decider, and his serving grew stronger as the match progressed. He appeared to have some trouble with his right elbow, which may have affected his serve, but he finished the match with six aces and won 77% of points on his first serve. Murray holds an 11-8 head-to-head record over Switzerland's Wawrinka, 34, and both players have struggled with injuries in recent years. The Scot injured his hip in his 2017 French Open semi-final against Wawrinka, while the Swiss had a disrupted two years with a knee injury. ""Stan's a brilliant player. We've played against each other in some big matches in the past in big tournaments,"" Murray added. ""He's had his injury troubles as well the last couple of years and done great to get back to the top of the game."" Antwerp is likely to be Murray's last tournament of the year, with the possible exception of the Davis Cup, for which Great Britain will announce their squad on Monday.

"Hundreds of people have marched through the streets of Glasgow for a ""Love Rally"" to show their support for those who have experienced care. Crowds gathered at Glasgow Green before walking to George Square. Several speakers addressed the crowd in a bid to ""show love"" for people who grow up in care, saying a lack of love has consequences throughout a person's life. Many carried placards and banners adorned with positive messages. Members of the Scottish Parliament were also invited to attend, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeting her apologies at being unable to make the event. She wrote: ""Best wishes to everyone attending the #LoveRally today - sorry I can't be there in person but my (heart emoji) is with you."" Allow Twitter content?

Deputy First Minister John Swinney, however, did join the event and spoke to the marchers as they congregated in the square. The rally was organised by Who Cares? Scotland, an organisation working for and on behalf of care experienced people. The marchers made their way from Glasgow Green to George Square Kevin Browne-MacLeod from the group said: ""According to our records, care experienced people have been asking to be loved since at least the 1970s. ""Procedures, resources and attitudes have all gotten in the way. Love isn't a controversial idea. ""Somewhere along the way, someone decided that love wasn't an essential part of a care experienced person's day. We're marching to change that. ""Almost three years ago today, the first minister promised to build a care system built on love. This march is about holding her to that promise.

"This video can not be played Unrest sparked by a metro fare hike continues in Santiago Three people have been killed by a fire inside a supermarket in Santiago during a second night of protests in Chile. Two people died at the scene and another died in hospital after the store was looted, Santiago's regional governor, Karla Rubilar, said. President PiÃ±era has suspended the rise in metro fares that sparked the protests, but unrest has continued. Soldiers and tanks were deployed after the government declared a state of emergency and imposed a night curfew. The protests have broadened to reflect general discontent about the high cost of living in one of Latin America's most stable countries. The unrest, the worst in decades, has exposed divisions in the nation, one of the region's wealthiest but also one of its most unequal, and intensified calls for economic reforms. In pictures: Santiago in state of emergency Chile country profile In parts of Santiago, hundreds of troops were deployed on the streets for the first time since 1990, when Chile returned to democracy after the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. In the second day of violent demonstrations, protesters erected barricades and set buses on fire, and police used tear gas and water cannon. Clashes erupted in the city centre with Mayor Felipe Alessandri describing the situation as chaotic. More than 300 people have been arrested, and 156 police injured, as were 11 civilians, police said. Demonstrators clashed with security forces in the capital, Santiago Speaking on television, President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era, whose response to the protests has been criticised, said he had listened ""with humility"" to ""the voice of my compatriots"" and to discontent over the cost of living. Gen Javier Iturriaga del Campo, who is in charge of security in Santiago under the state of emergency, said a curfew would be enforced between 22:00 and 07:00 (01:00-10:00 GMT) in the city and outlying areas. The military is due to help police patrol the streets during a declared 15-day state of emergency that allows authorities to restrict people's freedom of movement and their right to assembly. Later on Saturday, the mayors of the ValparaÃ­so region and ConcepciÃ³n province also announced states of emergency. Earlier, cultural and sporting events were cancelled and shops remained closed. The city's underground system will remain shut down until Monday, with 41 of 136 stations vandalised. Protesters continued on Saturday despite the military deployment Protests were also reported in the cities of ConcepciÃ³n, Rancagua, Punta Arenas, ValparaÃ­so, Iquique, Antofagasta, Quillota and Talca, according to El Mercurio newspaper. Meanwhile, a picture of President PiÃ±era in an upmarket Italian restaurant on Friday evening as police and demonstrators clashed in Santiago was heavily criticised on social media. Critics said the image, reportedly during a birthday celebration for the president's grandson, were emblematic of a leader out of touch with ordinary Chileans. Allow Twitter content?

"Ahead of the launch of his most ambitious series yet, broadcaster Sir David Attenborough talks to the BBC about his cult status, a lifetime protecting the planet and finally finding its most elusive animal. This year's Glastonbury Festival was headlined by Stormzy, The Killers, Kylie and The Cure, but the highlight for many was the surprise appearance of a 93-year-old knight of the realm. Sir David Attenborough, who was there to promote his new series Seven Worlds, One Planet,walked out on to the Pyramid Stage to rapturous applause,external, thanked everybody on Worthy Farm for not drinking out of plastic bottles and urged them to keep looking out for all creatures great and small. Several months on, he admits he finds his growing influence on the environmentally woke youth of today a bit bizarre. ""It's very odd,"" he laughs. ""But the fact remains I've been at it 60 years. You can say nobody under the age of 75 can have been without my voice coming from the corner of the room at various times and that must have an effect. Glastonbury: Sir David Attenborough hails plastic ban ""It's a huge advantage for me because you go there with some sort of reputation and people are aware of you, and in a sense you've been part of the family for quite a long time, which is an extraordinary obligation really and a privilege. ""I'm sure there's a hell of a lot of young people saying 'for God's sake why don't they move over, give the others a chance,'"" he modestly adds. In truth, no-one is saying that. Showstopper: Sir David Attenborough addresses tens of thousands of festival-goers on Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage The broadcaster, who recentlyhad a boat named in his honour, was listed as one of the 100 Greatest Britons in a BBC poll in 2002. Since then, his stock has risen exponentially due to natural history shows like Planet Earth, Dynasties and Blue Planet II - whichbrought the issue of plastic wasteto the public's attention andbumped climate change up the government's agenda. Last week, more than 80,000 people applied for just 300 tickets for an early screening of his new documentary, which arrives at what Sir David calls ""the most critical moment on earth since the continents formed"". The series, narrated by the ""rock star"" - as BBC boss Tony Hall introduced him earlier in the day - focuses on the human impact on climate change, animal diversity, poaching and deforestation across all seven continents. The latest scientific research revealed theeffects of climate change are speeding up, as world leaders met to discuss it in New York last month. ""At last nations are coming together and recognising we all live on the same planet,"" Sir David acknowledges. ""All these seven worlds are actually one and we are dependent on it for every mouthful of food we eat and every breath of air we take. ""We have it in our hands and we've made a tragic, desperate mess of it so far."" Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

By sheer coincidence, the press launch for the show occurs on the same day environmental pressure group Extinction Rebellion begin their two-week global protest. And while the presenter won't really be drawn on their methods, or that of political activists like Greta Thunberg (""they are young people and their voices will be heard""), he does admit his shows may have helped viewers the world over to open their eyes to ""the facts"". ""I don't think I've made a series in the last 40 years where I haven't made the end an appeal about caring for the natural world,"" he says. ""Its an extraordinary thing. At the time I daresay people thought we were sort of cranks or something. ""But as it's gone on and on and on and we've repeated it on and on and on - 'not wasting things, not polluting things' and so on - suddenly you hit the right note."" A colony of young penguin chicks wait for their parents to return with food in Andrews Bay, South Georgia Sir David Attenborough (left) and director Jonny Keeling discuss the script while filming in Iceland ""With Blue Planet II,"" he goes on, ""suddenly the world was electrified about the crime of chucking plastic into the ocean that can throttle and poison creatures, including ourselves. ""Quite what it is that makes the messages we all care for ring the bell, is very difficult to say. I dare say if we knew exactly how to do it we'd do it more frequently."" The BBC Natural History unit's biggest project to date, which features music by Sia and Hans Zimmer, involved more than 1,500 people globe-trotting to 41 countries, over several years. Cutting-edge technology - including portable drones capable of shooting in 4K - enabled them to delve inside caves, volcanoes, forests, swamps, jungles and blizzards, to capture images of animals that are new to science and new patterns of behaviour. For director/executive producer Jonny Keeling, it was vitally important to place conservation stories at the heart of the series, so viewers can understand why certain animals are in decline. Such as the tale of the grey-headed albatross and its increasing struggle to recognise its own chicks once they are blown off the nest. There are positive stories in there too though, notably how whales have come back from the brink of extinction sincewhaling was banned in 1986.His team were relieved to capture them on camera on just the final day of a seven-week shoot. ""That's really important as you need to show people the hope and actually when we do something we can make a massive difference,"" says Keeling. ""In a matter of two decades we can turn things around - we can stop the whales disappearing or we can save sharks."" The population of southern right whales was reduced from 35,000 to having only 35 females. Since their protection it has grown back to 2,000 Grey-headed albatross chicks sit above the wet ground, in an attempt to stay warm and not freeze to death in storms ""I think there's some key species,"" he adds, ""If they're looked after you can bring back a whole eco-system and its richness. ""The best solution to climate change is preserving the natural world, preserving forests and oceans and looking after the animals. ""It's a huge clichÃ© but there are seven billion people on earth and if seven billion all start doing the right thingâ¦"" Such is the global interest in any show connected to Sir David that schools in India and South Africa are dialled into the Q&A session following its London world premiere. A boy in Mumbai enthusiastically asks the man himself what he can do to help the planet. ""The best motto to think about is to not waste things,"" replies TV's favourite teacher (sorry Walter White fans). ""Don't waste electricity, paper, food. Live the way you want to live but just don't waste. Look after the natural world and the animals in it and the plants in it too, this is their planet as well as ours."" Sir David Attenborough on windy Stokksnes beach in Iceland Finally, after more than 50 years of searching, Seven Worlds also sees Sir David catch up with his most evasive animal yet - ""a wonderful creature"" called the golden haired blue-faced snub-nosed snow monkey. ""I read about them in a scientific paper in the 60s,"" he recalls. ""I always had it in the back of my mind, and blow me, if this lot found it! ""In the Asia programme I think it's one of the stars."" And another name fit to grace the Pyramid Stage. Please welcome to the stage... the golden haired blue-faced snub-nosed snow monkeys Seven Worlds, One Planet begins on BBC One at 18:15 GMT on Sunday 27 October.

"There was a time when streets across the UK would echo with the clang of bread-bins slamming shut of a weekend. And as children, there was no greater thrill than being walked - stale crust from your nan's house in hand - down to the local pond and feeding the ducks. But that all changed when the public was told that feeding bread to ducks was bad for them. So why, in 2019, is a photo like this being shared on social media, saying carbs are back on the duck menu?

""Just like us, birds need a varied diet to stay healthy,"" a spokesperson for the RSPB tells us in a statement.

The RSPB did not know where the poster shared online was put up, or which organisation was behind the campaign. But like health-conscious humans, it's advised that if you must feed ducks with bread, then you use something other than leftovers from a cheap white loaf. RSPB England's Twitter account describes granary bread with seeds as ""marginally healthier"" than white bread, inadvice it gave to a concerned wildfowl-feeder.,external ""Although bread isn't harmful, our advice is to only feed small amounts to birds.

"Peggy Jehly has been working with wolves and wolf dogs for a number of years In Colorado, there is a  debate going on about whether wolves should be reintroduced into the wild. As that rumbles on, some are trying to de-stigmatise the creatures through unusual means. If you go for a hike in the Garden of Gods in Colorado Springs, you might just stumble across a canine on a leash leading a pack of humans on a well-trodden trail. It's normally the other way around but with an apex predator like this you soon realise who is in control. These magnificent beasts are often stopped by hikers and others, who with jaws open, ask ""Are they real?"". And each time, Peggy Jehly, the mother of each of the pack members out stretching their legs on their daily walk, replies: ""Yes, they are. But let's be clear - they are high-content wolf dogs."" The Californian set up a business eight years ago giving people the opportunity to walk with her animals - all more lupine than canine - in a bid to educate the public about the importance of wolves to the world. Her creatures are also used as wolf ambassadors, going out to schools and events in a bid to help remove the stigma of ""the big bad wolf""; a reputation enhanced by villainous portrayals of the beasts in fairy tales such as Little Red Riding Hood and The Three Little Pigs. Wolves have retained a bad reputation from tales like Little Red Riding Hood Jehly says: ""I want to dispel the myth that these are bad guys"". Jehly doesn't advertise heavily, instead relying often on people stumbling across Colorado Wolf Adventures through word-of-mouth recommendations.  She says this is a deliberate strategy as her priority is the welfare of the wolf dogs. The walks are incredibly intimate with groups ranging from solo travellers to just five people heading out each time with the creatures, Jehly and a small troupe of volunteer handlers. Ghost, who was named after one of the direwolves in Game of Thrones, was a rescue when Peggy first got hold of him As she takes pictures to capture the memory of the unique experience, every so often she stops and warns the walkers to stay back. Anytime a dog is near, the near-lupines we are accompanying are led to an off-trail patch. This is so everybody in the vicinity, including the wolf dogs, stays safe. On the walk we took part in, we were led by three-year-old Spirit, believed to be 96-97% wolf who may have looked very dog-like but was an inquisitive creature with a love of howling and a tactile soul. He's also prone to kissing with full on tongue when he likes the look of someone. A strange experience? Yes. But also an amazing one. Don't forget, it would be pretty much impossible to walk a 100% wolf on a leash, let alone kiss one. Jayden Williams walking Spirit We were also joined by Ghost - a beautiful rescue Jehly had picked up in Colorado Springs after his owner gave him up. The seven-year-old Timber Wolf mix is a regal character who refused to pose for pictures on occasion despite the ideal surroundings. It was clear who was in charge of deciding what images were Instagram friendly. Jayden Williams, 25, from Denver couldn't stop beaming as he walked the two canines. He said: ""I had such an awakening experience with the wolves. ""It was incredible to see these creatures with wolf blood running through them respond to our own feelings of awe. They also didn't hesitate to convey their emotions to us - you knew when they decided to take a break or wanted a moment. ""Walking with them made me realise exactly how social wolves are and it was amazing to see how they bond and form relationships."" Peggy will not reveal where her pack is housed as she says that is their sanctuary for them to rest in And while there are wolf and wolf dog sanctuaries across the US which offer visitors an opportunity to enter and meet the creatures, Jehly's business is different as she keeps the home where the wolf dogs stay a sanctuary, not open to the public. Unless you are a volunteer, the only way to interact with her pack is to go on a walk. Jehly says: ""I love to walk and exercise and I didn't want them to be in their enclosures all day.  I thought these 'wolf walks' would be a good way to educate the public and do something the animal quite likes at the same time."" 'Big, bad wolf' image flawed - scientists But just how can someone get into a job like this? It's not a role anybody can just pick up and do. Jehly is licensed and has many years of experience dealing with wolves and wolf dogs. She spent many years working at a wolf sanctuary in Colorado, moving up the ranks from volunteer to employee to vice president before she eventually decided to break off and start her own business with the motley pack she had collected. Spirit sometimes offers a kiss as part of the interactions with the public ""When I lived in San Francisco, I was misdiagnosed with primary pulmonary hypertension - a disease that was supposed to kill me. I had to deal with that for six months. ""I looked at life a lot differently. I had always liked the mountains and I found a place that I liked. There was a wolf sanctuary and I told my husband we're going to live there and I'm going to work with wolves. I volunteered and it all started from there."" But while these hybrids may look majestic, they are not the sort of creatures that can be kept easily. They require a lot of energy and in some states in the US, special permits are required along with lip tattoos, while in other states they are illegal. Walking and howling with wolves What's it like to kiss a wolf? Study reveals the wolf within your pet dog Jehly says that there had been a rise in people wanting wolf dogs after seeing them in films or in shows such as Game of Thrones but that meant more ended up in sanctuaries as people just couldn't look after them. Jehly also runs her walks in a state where the issue of wolves is a contentious one. She is a supporter of the Rocky Mountain Wolf Project - a coalition seeking for the reintroduction of wolves in the wild. It is seeking support for a ballot to be put forward for Colorado voters to decide on whether wolves should be reintroduced to the wild in the region. However, not everyone loves wolves. The opposing Colorado Stop the Wolf coalition believes it would be too risky to return wolves to the state and is lobbying hard to prevent any moves which could lead to this. They say their fear is based on the risk they pose to households pets and livestock. Denny Behrens, who is the co-chair of the Stop the Wolf Coalition says that the state's parks and wildlifehad already investigated the issue in 2005,external. He said that wolves were already migrating into Colorado and while there was nothing to be done to stop that, reintroducing them was a different matter. ""Nobody hates the wolf but it's not fair to take them from Canada and Alaska where they can roam free and they don't have conflict with people. ""We don't have the landscape for the wolf here - there is just no room."" Peggy has a team of volunteers who help her But for Jehly right now, her main priority is keeping her animals happy and healthy. She warns it's expensive to keep wolf hybrids and people need to be aware of that before they invest. She has teamed up with a food bank in the area which donates any leftovers that aren't fit for human consumption. The family also has to factor in security and ensure they have fencing in place that's high and safe. Jehly says: ""We always say when people start treating these guys like a dog, they'll remind you that they are a wolf. ""They are pack animals so if you get one and think it'll stay in your house, that's a big mistake.""

"This video can not be played Listen to Elton John discuss his childhood and plans for retirement He may have started out singing cover versions on cheap compilation albums, but Elton John went on to become the fifth highest-selling recording artist of all time. He was the first musician to enter the US album charts at number one. He has won a Brit award for outstanding achievement three times. And he owns six gold, 38 platinum and one diamond albums. None of this, however, impressed his father. Stanley Dwight, a flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force, never attended one of Elton's shows, and never expressed pride in his son's success. Their relationship was strained until his death from heart disease in 1991. Writing in his new autobiography, Me, Elton admits he spent his whole career ""trying to show my father what I'm made of"". ""It's crazy, but I just wanted his approval,"" the star tells the BBC, in the only print interview about his book. ""I'm still trying to prove to him that what I do is fine - and he's been dead for almost 30 years."" Strikingly, however, the star harbours no resentment, describing his father as a ""product of his time"" - uptight, emotionally stunted and trapped in an unhappy marriage. ""Although he didn't really come to the shows or write me a letter to say, 'well done', I don't think he knew how to,"" he explains. Elton and his father failed to see eye-to-eye Born Reginald Dwight and raised in Pinner, near Wembley in north-west London, Elton was frequently on the receiving end of his parents' frustration. He spent his formative years in ""a state of high alert"" amid arguments and ""clobberings"" from his mum. ""My parents were oil and water. They should never have gotten married,"" he says. ""As you get older, you can see much clearer what they went through, what they tried to do for me at the expense of their happiness."" His salvation came in rock and roll. Both his parents were musically inclined - Stanley was a trumpet player with the Bob Miller band, while his mother, Sheila, would bring home new records every week on pay day. One day, she arrived home clutching Elvis Presley's Heartbreak Hotel, a disc that turned Reggie's world upside down. ""I grew up in the 1950s, which was a very conservative age - people peeking behind the curtains, being very judgmental,"" he says. ""I knew nothing about sex, it was never even mentioned to me. If a girl got pregnant she was sent away and nobody talked about it. It was a very different place. ""Then Elvis Presley arrived on the scene and revolutionised things musically and socially, and then the 60s happened and all hell broke loose"". Elton John announces final world tour 'Elton let me make him ugly' says Taron Egerton Elton John: On the Yellow Brick Road Initially, the teenager watched these developments as an outsider - in love with the music, but forbidden to participate. ""I was very shy,"" he says. ""I grew up not being able to wear what I wanted to. Winkle picker shoes? No, they were too disgusting. The mods wore chisel toe shoes and anoraks. I couldn't wear those either. ""So when I changed my name and became Elton John, I just went off like an Exocet missile, and I had a great time. I lived my teenage years in my 20s, basically."" The star compensated for being stuck behind a piano by creating ever-more elaborate stage costumes The story has been told a thousand times: The miraculous meeting with lyricist Bernie Taupin, a blue-touch-paper appearance at LA's Troubador club, and an unbeatable run of hit albums. Between 1970 and 1975, there were 11 in all, an astonishingly productive purple patch that generated classic singles like Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting, Tiny Dancer and Rocket Man - the latter of which unexpectedly turned Elton into a sex symbol. ""It was a surprising time,"" he laughs. ""I mean, I wasn't David Bowie, I wasn't Marc Bolan, I was sitting at the piano. But I suddenly became, you know, the object of screaming girls. I don't know why."" Emboldened by success, Elton's outfits became ever more outrageous: Satin capes and winged boots gave way to mohawk wigs, bejewelled top hats and peacock suits adorned with feathers and sequins - the sort of thing Liberace would have worn if he'd had the courage to be really flamboyant. Elton's 1970 shows at the Troubador club made his name. ""He's going to be one of rock's biggest and most important stars,"" said the LA Times. His imperial phase culminated with two sold-out shows at LA's Dodger Stadium in October 1975. With a combined audience of 100,000 fans they were, at the time, the largest concerts ever staged by a single artist. ""He was like Elvis at the height of his career,"" said photographer Terry O'Neill, who shot the gigs. ""It is impossible to try to explain to people today what it was like."" But Elton knew as he played those shows that he would never reach that peak again. ""I was smart enough to know it couldn't last. It's impossible. You just have to accept that there's going to be someone bigger than you."" It's a sense of perspective other artists lack, he says. ""When Michael Jackson said, 'I want to sell more records than Thriller', I thought, 'Oh boy, you're in for a big fall'. Because Thriller was a classic record. It sold 40 million albums, which was huge. You can't have a record coming in at number one all the time."" Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Sure enough, Elton would have to wait until 1990 before he returned to the top of the charts. The wilderness years, while hardly hit-free, saw him split temporarily with Bernie Taupin and record an ill-advised disco album, Victim Of Love. Behind the scenes, his drug and alcohol intake was spiralling out of control. In his memoir, he describes having seizures and witnessing his voice go ""haywire"" as his ""unbelievable appetite"" for cocaine grew stronger. The drug had initially given him a ""jolt of confidence and euphoria,"" but as addiction took hold, he became erratic and violent. In 1983, after filming the video for I'm Still Standing, he woke up with his hands throbbing, unaware that the night before, he'd stripped naked, punched his manager John Reid and methodically demolished his hotel room. Although the recent biopic Rocketman depicts I'm Still Standing as Elton's hymn to sobriety, it actually took him another seven years to kick the habit. Allow YouTube content?

The turning point came when his then-boyfriend Hugh Williams checked into rehab, plunging Elton into a fortnight-long cocaine and whisky binge. Eventually, he dragged himself to the clinic, where Williams confronted him on his behaviour. ""You're a drug addict, you're an alcoholic, you're a food addict and a bulimic,"" he said. ""You're a sex addict. You're co-dependent"". ""Yes,"" said Elton, ""yes, I am,"" and started to cry. So on 29 July, 1990, he entered rehab in Chicago to treat ""three addictions at once"". In his book, Elton reprints a poignant break-up letter he wrote to ""the white lady"" during his treatment. ""I don't want you and I to share the same grave,"" it reads. He kept his word: The singer has now been clean for 29 years, during which time he's revitalised his career, married film producer David Furnish, written the hit soundtrack to the Lion King, launched the stage version of Billy Elliot and become father to two children, Zachary and Elijah. He says the autobiography was written for them: A document they could read after he's gone that would tell the unvarnished truth. ""I want them to know that their dad was being honest, and he made something of his life after a few hiccups along the way"", he says. Elton with his husband David Furnish and their sons Zachary and Elijah It was Elton's sons that prompted him to give up touring, too. ""My kids were only going to grow up once,"" he writes in the memoir. ""Music was the most wonderful thing, but it still didn't sound as good as Zachary chatting about what had happened at football practice."" With typical grandiosity, Elton's farewell tour is scheduled to run for three years, with the final show set for 17 December, 2020, at London's O2 Arena. But that is definitively not the end. Last week, Bernie Taupin posted a photo of himself at the writing desk, composing lyrics. Can Elton confirm they're intended for him? ""Yes, they are,"" he says. ""I said to Bernie, 'I'm going around the world for three years, why don't I write? ""You know, I wrote the whole of the Captain Fantastic album on the SS France, sailing from Southampton to New York, and I didn't have a tape recorder. So I remembered everything I wrote in my head: The chord changes, the sequences, everything. ""And I said, 'I'd like to go back and do that, instead of going into the studio and writing on the spot'. It may not be successful but I just want to try it."" Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

What's more, he's already cooking up plans to play concertsafterthe farewell tour. His ""dream thing"" is to put on a theatrical residency, in the style of Kate Bush's Before the Dawn extravaganza in 2014. Like her, Elton would delve deep into his back catalogue, prioritising lesser-played cuts like Amoreena, Come Down In Time and Original Sin over fan favourites like Your Song or Rocket Man. ""I've sung these songs nearly 5,000 times, some of them, and although they're wonderful songs, and I'm very appreciative of them, I've sung them enough,"" he says. ""If I do perform again, I would like to do songs that I think are just as good as the ones that have been popular for 50 years, but haven't had the chance to emerge.""

"Protesters held signs and wore masks during the pre-season basketball game in New York Dozens of spectators at a US basketball game have held signs and donned T-shirts and masks in support of protests in Hong Kong. Demonstrators gathered during a match in New York between the Brooklyn Nets and the Toronto Raptors. The move was organised by film producer Andrew Duncan, who bought 300 tickets for the activists. It comes amid an ongoing row between China and the NBA over the protests that have rocked Hong Kong since March. Images from the pre-season game on Friday show demonstrators wearing T-shirts emblazoned with ""Stand With Hong Kong"" and ""Free Tibet"". Two other people were also pictured wearing Winnie-the-Pooh costumes. The cartoon bear is used as a symbol to mock Chinese President Xi Jinping and is banned in China. Footage from the protest was shared on social media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Among the group was Hong Kong activist Nathan Law, the former chairman of Demosisto, a pro-democracy party he co-founded with fellow campaigner Joshua Wong. ""We want to use our performance art to show our support for Hong Kong,externaland the NBA,"" another spectator, Chen Pokong, 55, told the New York Post. ""[China wants] to take away freedom of speech and now spread dictatorship to America."" Local media report that some of demonstrators were ejected from the game for chanting. Similar demonstrations have already been held at other games between American and Chinese teams. Earlier this month, during a match between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Guangzhou Loong-Lions, two people were asked to leave for holding signs in support of Hong Kong protests. NBA facing 'substantial' losses over China dispute How one tweet derailed the NBA's China game plan At another game between the Loong-Lions and the Washington Wizards, local media report that spectators had their pro-Hong Kong signs confiscated. But Friday's protest was the first to be held during a match between two NBA teams. The spat between the league and China's government began earlier this month after Houston Rockets manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for protests in Hong Kong. As a result, several Chinese firms suspended sponsorship and telecast deals with the NBA - a huge financial blow to the league, which has millions of followers in China. In Hong Kong this week, some protesters burned jerseys of basketball star LeBron James in response to his comments about the demonstrations The Rockets and the NBA quickly distanced themselves from Mr Morey's tweet, while basketball superstar LeBron Jamessuggested the Rockets' manager ""wasn't educated on the situation"" in Hong Kong. Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai - who is also the vice-chairman of Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba - has also criticised Mr Morey for his ""damaging"" tweet, saying he misjudged how strongly many Chinese people felt about Hong Kong. ""Supporting a separatist movement in a Chinese territory is one of those third-rail issues, not only for the Chinese government, but also for all citizens in China,"" Mr Tsai added. Mr Morey has since backtracked on his tweet. but US lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle have accused the NBA of bowing to Beijing.
