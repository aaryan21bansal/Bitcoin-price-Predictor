"The ban by Waitrose follows concerns over the impact of sugar and caffeine on children Waitrose is to ban the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to children aged under 16. The supermarket said customers buying drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre would be asked to prove their age from 5 March. It follows concerns over the impact of sugar and caffeine on children. The British Soft Drinks Association said energy drinks had been ""deemed safe"" by regulators but that they were not marketed or promoted to under-16s. UK youngsters are among the highest consumers of energy drinks in Europe,according to researchers from Fuse, the Centre for Translational Research in Public Health,external, who in December urged the government to restrict their sale to under-16s. Waitrose said its decision was based on existing industry labelling guidelines, requiring any soft drink with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre to carry a high-caffeine content warning and state it is not recommended for children. Why our school bans energy drinks Energy drink + alcohol = trouble? Does drinking fizz make you fat? Waitrose director of technical and corporate social responsibility Simon Moore said: ""As a responsible retailer we want to sell these products in line with the labelling guidance. ""These drinks carry advice stating that they are not recommended for children, so we're choosing to proactively act on that guidance, particularly given the widespread concerns which have been raised about these drinks when consumed by under 16s."" The move has been welcomed by health and education groups who have previously campaigned about the effects high-caffeine energy drinks can have on children. TV chef Jamie Oliver has been among those campaigning on the issue Last month, campaign group Action on Sugar found that typical serving sizes of energy drinks at 500ml were larger than for other sugary drinks and were ""completely inappropriate"" for children to consume. High sugar intake among children has beenheavily linked to the UK's obesity epidemic, amid contested claims it can alter child behaviour. A sugar tax on the UK soft drinks industryhas already been announced and will come into force next April. Teaching union NASUWT, whichhas previously called for schools to ban energy drinks, said Waitrose had taken a ""positive and responsible step"" but called on the government to issue independent research into the long-term effects of energy-drink use by children. General secretary Chris Keates said: ""These drinks are readily available legal highs and are leading to children and young people consuming high levels of stimulants, with little known about the long-term health impacts."" Irn Bru panic as fans stockpile drink PM joins royal wedding begging row debate 11 explosive claims from new Trump book And TV chef Jamie Oliver, who has filmed a documentary on the issue for Channel 4's Jamie and Jimmy's Friday Night Feast, told BBC Radio 5 live that energy drink consumption and addiction among children was a ""prolific problem"". ""Kids are saying they are addicted to them, experiencing the lows and needing another to get back up again"", he said. ""Even though the industry and the companies will say we do not market to kids, you will hear the opposite from kids."" The British Soft Drinks Association (BSDA) said it had introduced a voluntary code of practice in 2010, which included policies on the appropriate labelling and marketing of energy drinks toward young people. It said the guidelines, which were updated in 2015to cover the marketing and promotion of such drinks,externalaround schools, were supported by Red Bull, Monster, Relentless and Rockstar energy drink brands. Director general Gavin Partington added that alongside manufacturers ""retailers, schools and parents all have a role to play in educating children about caffeine and sugar consumption from all sources"". The British Retail Consortium said all its members took the issue ""seriously"" and followed the BSDA code of practice on energy drinks. Andrea Martinez-Inchausti, deputy director of food policy, also said the BRC would work with the government if it decided to ban the sale of energy drinks to under-16s.

"Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook was making too many mistakes Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has vowed to ""fix"" Facebook, in what he described as his personal challenge for 2018. In a post on his page on the social network, he said it was making too many errors enforcing policies and preventing misuse of its tools.,external Mr Zuckerberg has famously set himself challenges every year since 2009. Facebook launched in 2004. Social media firms have come under fire for allowing so-called fake news ahead of US and other elections to spread. Facebook in particular has been criticised forallowing Russia-linked political ads in the run-up to the 2016 US presidential vote. Mr Zuckerberg said he intended to focus on ""important issues"", which he listed as ""protecting our community from abuse and hate, defending against interference by nation states, or making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent"". ""We won't prevent all mistakes or abuse, but we currently make too many errors enforcing our policies and preventing misuse of our tools,"" he wrote. ""If we're successful this year then we'll end 2018 on a much better trajectory."" Facebook - the secret election weapon Zuckerberg defends Facebook over Trump The Facebook CEO said he would learn more by looking intensely at those issues than by doing something completely separate. In the past his New Year resolutions have included wearing a tie every day and killing his own food. But critics questioned why he needed to make a yearly challenge of these issues. ""Zuckerberg's 2018 personal challenge for himself is...doing the work he should be doing as Facebook CEO anyway,"" tweeted tech writer Maya Kossoff. Allow Twitter content?

He said one of the issues he intended to tackle was the debate about centralisation and decentralisation. Technology had the promise of putting more power into people's hands but many people had now lost faith in that promise and thought technology actually centralised power, he said. Mr Zuckerberg added that encryption and digital currency had the power to counter this trend, and said he would explore how to use them at Facebook. ""This will be a serious year of self-improvement and I'm looking forward to learning from working to fix our issues together,"" he concluded. 2009- Wear a tie every day 2010- Learn Mandarin 2011- Only eat meat he had killed himself 2013- Meet one person a day outside Facebook 2015- Read a book every other week 2016- Build a simple AI to run his home Facebook CEO rejects Trump bias claims Has Facebook profited from fake news?

"This video can not be played ""Everyone's always Snapchatting you"" - five children describe how they use social media Schools should play a bigger role in preparing children for social media's emotional demands as they move from primary to secondary school, England's children's commissioner says. Anne Longfield said she was worried many pupils at that stage became anxious about their identity and craved likes and comments for validation. Herstudy,externalsaid children aged eight to 12 found it hard to manage the impact. The government said it was working with schools on online safety education. The report into the effects of social media on eight to 12-year-olds claimed many children were over-dependent on ""likes"" and comments for social validation. It said children approach a ""cliff-edge"" as they move from primary to secondary school, when social media becomes more important in their lives. How do you talk to children about sex and relationships? Jargon-busting guides to teach children about social media Do you know what social media rules you've signed up to? This video can not be played Children's commissioner for England Anne Longfield: ""More and more younger children are online"" The report spoke to 32 children in eight focus groups, aged eight to 12, and found some saying: ""If I got 150 likes, I'd be like, 'that's pretty cool, it means they like you'"" - Aaron, 11 ""I just edit my photos to make sure I look nice"" - Annie, 11 ""My mum takes pictures of me on Snapchat... I don't like it when your friends and family take a picture of you when you don't want them to"" - Hassan, eight ""I saw a pretty girl and everything she has I want, my aim is to be like her"" - Bridie, 11 Ms Longfield called on schools and parents to prepare children emotionally for the ""significant risks"" of social media as they move schools and meet new classmates - many of whom have their own phones. ""It's really when they hit secondary school that all of these things come together,"" she told BBC News. ""They find themselves chasing likes, chasing validation, being very anxious about their appearance online and offline and feeling that they can't disconnect - because that will be seen as socially damaging."" Although most social media platforms have a minimum age limit of 13, the report said three-quarters of children aged 10 to 12 already had accounts. Ms Longfield said social media provided ""great benefits"" to children but was also exposing them to ""significant risks emotionally"". She suggested compulsory digital literacy and online resilience lessons for year six and seven pupils, so that they learn about the ""emotional side of social media"". Parents should also prepare their children, she said, by helping them ""navigate the emotional rollercoaster"" of the negative aspects of social media. Ella Brookbanks worries her daughter Sophie, nine, will see the negative side to social media Ella Brookbanks, mother to nine-year-old Sophie and 15-year-old Bradley, said her teenage son is ""expected"" to be on social media. ""He seems to want to buy things in order to take pictures of it to send to his friends to show that he has these type of things,"" she told BBC News. ""It's a recognition thing - 'look what I have, look what I can get, like me'."" She says her daughter ""doesn't see that side of it just yet"" but worries Sophie will experience the negative side to social media when she starts secondary school. Parent Trevor said his 12-year-old twin daughters had moved schools as a result of the pressure from social media, but admits they ""can't walk away"" from it. He told BBC Radio 5 live: ""I can't say to them, 'You can't use that,' when I use it."" He said teachers lacked the skills to educate children and said the approach by politicians was ""disappointing"". Children should be made aware of their value outside of 'likes', says charity worker Grace Barrett Matthew Reed, chief executive of the Children's Society, urged parents to have ""open conversations"" with their children about the sites and apps they use. ""This can include looking through their 'friends' lists together and finding out how their child knows different people,"" he said. ""Check their privacy settings and get children to think about what information and photos they are comfortable with others having access to."" Tony Stower, the NSPCC's head of child safety online, said regular conversations would mean children felt able to turn to their parents if they had worries or concerns. ""It's worth reassuring children that people often present rose-tinted versions of their lives on social media, and they shouldn't feel pressured to lead the 'perfect' life, or to look a certain way,"" he said. Grace Barrett, co-founder of children's mental health charity the Self-Esteem Team, said it largely fell to parents to teach their children about social media. ""Teachers can't be equipped to do everything,"" she said. ""We should be helping young people understand that their value lies outside of 'likes' and outside of what they look like.""

"Pike's films include Gone Girl, Die Another Day, Made in Dagenham and Jack Reacher Gone Girl actress Rosamund Pike says there won't be more female leading roles in Hollywood movies until male stars change their attitude. ""Male actors now have to decide that they are willing to play supporting roles to female leads,"" Pike said. ""And often it seems men don't want to,"" she toldRadio 4's Film Programme. ""They're more than happy to play a supporting role to Christian Bale - another man -  (but) less happy to play supporting roles to a lead woman."" Pike is starring in gritty Western Hostiles with Bale, which is released in the UK on Friday. Bale will next play former vice president Dick Cheney in the biopic, Backseat Pike continued: ""Many, many actors are coming out saying we want more female-driven stories, we want fantastic roles for women... so the next consequence is, if you want those to come, then the boys have to play second fiddle. ""That's just the way it is. Until that happens, there will be fewer films with female leads made,"" she added. Films with leading female stars and supporting male actors are not as common as the other way round. But there are some well-known examples, including 2013's Oscar-winning film Gravity, with Sandra Bullock playing the lead alongside George Clooney, and sci-fi flick Arrival (2016), with Jeremy Renner in a supporting role alongside Amy Adams. A 2016 studysuggested that inequality is ""entrenched"" in Hollywood, with women, minorities and LGBT people among those excluded.

"Potential first-time buyers must typically save for eight years to afford a deposit to buy a home, data suggests. A typical 20% deposit in London is now more than Â£80,000, according to the Nationwide Building Society. Elsewhere in the UK, the average deposit could be closer to Â£20,000, the lender said. The squeeze on wages and low interest rates makes it more difficult to raise the money than a decade ago. The Nationwide, which calculated thathouse prices rose by 2.6% in 2017, analysed its mortgage data for the cost of the typical first-time buyer's house purchase in each region, based on four times a buyer's income, and from this derived how much a 20% deposit would be. The Â£80,000-plus cost in London is about Â£30,000 higher than a decade ago. In other regions, such as the Midlands and northern England, deposit requirements are similar to 2007, when prices were at their pre-crisis peak. However, real earnings have generally fallen for young people since then and savings rates are low. The Nationwide then calculated the length of time it would take for buyers in each region to save such a deposit, based on squirreling away 15% of their take-home pay. In most regions, it would take about eight years for the typical buyer to save for a deposit. This rises to nine years in the South East of England and to nearly 10 years in London. Lenders have been told by regulators to set stricter affordability requirements since the financial crisis, to avoid financial stress on the system and on individual borrowers. This created noticeable extra pressure on the need for first-time buyers to save compared with before the financial crisis. Many have turned to parents and other relatives to help with the cost. Iona Bain, founder of the Young Money Blog, said this could be dangerous for young borrowers. ""The Bank of Mum and Dad, or Granny and Grandad, can come with big legal pitfalls, particularly if you're borrowing money with a partner, while trying to grow your money in more exotic ways through crowdfunding or Bitcoin, for instance, could put your whole deposit at risk,"" she said. ""The only other alternative is to simply save harder for longer. That means putting all your spare change into a home where you'll have to live for many years to come, since you'll struggle to move up the housing ladder. ""That doesn't sound very attractive if you're not sure about your future and you're trying to keep all your options open."" Dan Wilson Craw, of the Generation Rent lobby group, said: ""High housing costs are eating into renters' take-home pay which makes saving for a deposit difficult in the country as a whole but near impossible in London and the South East of England. ""Renters deserve a stable home in return for their rent, but private tenancies simply do not offer this."" Meanwhile, demand for mortgages remains relatively static, so lenders are still getting the custom. Bank of England figures show that 65,139 mortgages were approved for house purchases, for new and existing owners, during November. This is very close to the average of the previous six months. The total value of these loans was Â£11.9bn. The figures come the day after the government claimed more than 16,000 first-time buyers havesaved thousands of poundsas a result of changes to stamp duty. The Autumn Budget abolished stamp duty for first-time buyers of homes up to Â£300,000. For properties costing up to Â£500,000, no stamp duty will be paid on the first Â£300,000. According to the government, the changes mean savings of up to Â£5,000 for first-time buyers. Labour said cutting stamp duty just drove up house prices.

"Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage is to meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator in Brussels next Monday. He wrote to Michel Barnier in October to request a meeting, the day after Mr Barnier met three high-profile pro-EU politicians from the UK. Mr Farage said Mr Barnier was listening to people ""who want to stop or delay Brexit"" while he would represent the 17.4 million who voted for it. The two men will meet on Monday at the European Commission headquarters. The MEP confirmed he had ""finally got my meeting with Monsieur Barnier""in a video on Twitter,external, in which he asked his followers to send in their questions for Mr Barnier and said he would pick the best three. Mr Farage, who has campaigned for 20 years to take the UK out of the EU, wrote to Mr Barnier after the Brexit negotiator received a visit from Tory MP Ken Clarke, former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Labour former minister Lord Adonis in October. Mr Clegg had told reporters the three were there to ""get a better understanding"" about what was going on in the negotiations - asked if they were there to stop Brexit he replied: ""If only it were that easy."" The European Commission said at the time that Mr Barnier's ""door was ""always open"" but added: ""There are two negotiators - on the one side the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, David Davis, and on the European side it's the chief negotiator of the EU, Michel Barnier. Nobody else."" James McGrory of the pro-EU Open Britain group suggested that Mr Farage going to Brussels was ""like sending an arsonist to put out a house fire"". ""He has no answers to the costs and complexity of Brexit, other than to blithely say we should walk away with no deal, which would be an unmitigated disaster for our economy and our country,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Unilever is to end Colman's mustard production after 160 years in Norwich Mustard maker Colman's is to leave its base in Norwich where the condiment has been produced for 160 years. Colman's, which employs 113 people at its site in the city, will move its production to Burton-on-Trent and Germany. The GMB union described the closure as ""absolutely devastating news"". The union said 43 jobs would be transferred to the Burton site, with 20 moving to a new facility opening in Norwich for milling mustard seeds. Fears of a closure had been raised whenBritvic, which shares the site in Carrow with Colman's, announced in October it was leavingand transferring its production of Robinsons and Fruit Shoot elsewhere in the UK. Colman's said in December it had reviewed its operations in light of Britvic's closure proposal. The firm, which has been making mustard at the site since 1858, became part of Unilever's Van Den Bergh Foods in 1995. Unilever said in a statement it recognised it would be ""difficult news"" for staff and the people of Norwich but added it was ""committed to supporting"" its employees. The factory is due to close at the end of next year. Unilever said the vast majority of products currently made in Norwich would still be produced in the UK, with only the packing of dry sauce mixes switching to Germany. It said it would also be keeping the ""Colman's of Norwich"" part of its branding. The Colman's factory has been on the site since 1858 Production line workers at the Colman's works in 1908 Colman's advertising in evidence as workers build Norwich City's new Carrow Road ground in 1935 Jeremiah James Colman established the Norwich factory in 1858 after his great-uncle Jeremiah started a mustard and flour business in nearby Stoke Holy Cross in 1814 Jon Strachan, vice president of Unilever in the UK, said moving some operations to Burton was the ""best option"" for the company. He added: ""We wanted to maintain the historic link between Colman's and Norwich and therefore we are also proposing that we invest in a new state-of-the-art-facility in the local area where we will mill and pack our mustard powder and also process our mint. ""That will ensure that we continue to source and grow our mint and mustard here locally, which we've done for generations."" Clive Lewis, Labour MP for Norwich South, described recent weeks as a ""truly awful festive period for hundreds of Norwich food manufacturing workers and their families"". Chloe Smith, the Conservative MP for Norwich North, said Unilever's decision was ""bitterly disappointing"". A consortium of mustard and mint growers from Norfolk, Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire has said it will enter into a new long-term partnership with Unilever. David Martin, chief executive of the Grower's Consortium, said: ""This partnership will allow us to jointly develop a new state-of-the-art facility near Norwich. ""We expect that the facility will create around 25 jobs and will open up new possibilities for the future.""

Debbie Harris said: ""My great-grandfather was the first janitor Colman's ever had, my grandfather was security and then my father worked for them, so it's a great sadness.""

"This video can not be played An Irn Bru fan explains why he is protesting against the drinks new recipe. Fans of Irn Bru have started stockpiling the soft drink ahead of a planned change in recipe. Makers of the fizzy favourite are changing the formula of the product to cut the sugar content by almost half. It is part of a sugar-reduction programme by AG Barr before the government levy on sugary drinks comes into effect in 2018. But fans have launched the ""Hands off our Irn Bru"" petition, attracting more than 6,000 signatures. Irn Bru drinkers are angry after the manufacturer revealed the new flavour would appear in stores in January. They have been taking to social media to vent their dismay, with stories of people buying up to 250 cans mentioned but not substantiated. The petition has attracted more than 6,000 signatures The Cumbernauld-based firm announced last year that it would cut Irn Bru's sugar content from about 10g per 100ml to just below 5g. This will reduce the calorie count per can from just under 140 to about 66. AG Barr said the move was part of a ""long-standing sugar reduction programme"". Heading the ""Hands off our Irn Bru"" petition is joiner Ryan Allan from Ayr. He has already made preparations to preserve his favourite drink and has a stockpile for  ""when he is hungover"". He told the BBC's Kaye Adams programme: ""I've got 24 glass bottles in my loft that will do me for emergencies."" His anger was mostly at what will be replacing the sugar: ""I know its not going to be the same product and I don't want to get used to it. ""I know sugar has its concerns but so do sweeteners and people are not as aware of that as they should be. ""I know the stuff is about to hit the shelves now and I'm going to ask people to try it out of curiosity but if you don't like it don't buy it, vote with your pound."" Chief executive Roger White said the company had ""significantly"" reduced sugar across its portfolio in recent years On his change.org petition, he stated: ""The government's 'sugar tax' that would apply to the sales of sugary drinks is similar to the way cigarettes and alcohol are taxed. ""I would far rather pay more for a bottle than have an altered recipe version."" And he added: ""I believe that a responsible adult should have the choice as to what poisons they want to put in their body."" 'Spiked vegan' chef offers resignation Jet Airways grounds pilots after 'cockpit fight' Major flaw in millions of Intel chips revealed A spokesperson from A.G. Barr said: ""From January 2018 Irn Bru will continue to be made using the same secret Irn Bru flavour essence, but with less sugar. ""The vast majority of our drinkers want less sugar in their Irn Bru so that's what we're now offering. ""We know that our loyal drinkers love Irn Bru for its unique great taste and we've worked hard to deliver this. ""We ran lots of taste tests that showed most people can't tell the difference - 9 out of 10 regular Irn Bru drinkers told us we had a good or excellent taste match.

"Lily Cole said she was ""excited and honoured"" to work on the project A literary expert has resigned from the Bronte Society over a ""rank farce"" decision to appoint a supermodel and actress as its patron for 2018. Lily Colewas chosen by the society as a creative partnerat the Bronte Parsonage Museum for the 200th anniversary of Emily Bronte's birth. Nick Holland, author of books on the Bronte sisters, said such an important role should have gone to a writer. The Bronte Society said it looked forward to working with Cole. More stories from across Yorkshire Mr Holland, 47, from Barnsley, who had been a member of the society for several years, said: ""I think it's a disgrace. ""I understand the society wants to target a younger audience but this is going about it the wrong way and risks diluting the work and legacy of Emily Bronte."" An oil painting of Wuthering Heights author Emily Bronte published in 1847 In hisblog post,externallast month, Mr Holland said: ""The central question should be, what would Emily Bronte think if she found that the role of chief 'artist' and organiser in her celebratory year was a supermodel? ""We all know the answer to that, and anyone who doesn't isn't fit to make the decision or have any role in the governance of the Bronte Society.""

Nick Holland became interested in works by the Brontes after reading Wuthering Heights at the age of 18 Mr Holland added: ""It's best that I leave the society now before they announce James Corden as the creative partner for 2019, a year in which Patrick Bronte is being remembered, and Rita Ora as organiser for Anne Bronte's celebrations in 2020."" The Bronte Society said: ""Lily's innovative projects in the fields of literacy, nature, story-telling and the environment are the perfect fit for Emily, and her originality and creativity will bring a fresh perspective to our 2018 celebrations.""

"John Worboys carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in London between 2002 and 2008 Taxi driver John Worboys, who is believed to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in London between 2002 and 2008, is to be freed from jail. He was an unassuming presence in the front seat, seemingly no different from the thousands of other black cab drivers who ferry workers, tourists and revellers across London. John Worboys claimed to be something of a white knight, rescuing vulnerable women from illegal taxi touts - even if they could not afford the fare. But behind his friendly exterior lay a sinister motive - between October 2006 and February 2008, Worboys sedated 12 women, raping one of them, carrying out other sexual assaults on five more and an attempted sexual assault on another. He was convicted of 19 offences in 2009 at Croydon Crown Court and ordered to serve at least eight years in jail. The following year police said a number of women had come forward and that his alleged victims now numbered more than 100. Worboys, now 60, has spent 10 years in custody including a period on remand. When one woman went to police in July 2007, the cabbie was arrested but police decided they lacked evidence to press charges so they let him go. Between then and February 2008, 29 women were attacked by Worboys. He also drove his black cab in Dorset - where he had a studio which produced adult films - and there have been reports of incidents at the time Worboys was there. The victims - all travelling alone at night - were aged 18 to 33. One 26-year-old, from west London, recalled waking in the cab, dazed from the effects of the drugs. ""The next thing I remember is him being in the back trying to put his hand up my skirt,"" she said. ""I screamed at him to get off me."" 'Black cab rapist' to be freed from jail Worboys, a former stripper and porn actor, craved the attention of women to the extent he would concoct stories to impress them. Boasting of Â£50,000 casino wins and flaunting a carrier bag of cash, he would win passengers' trust before uncorking miniature bottles of champagne. Little did they know the cheap Tesco bubbly was laced with date-rape drug Temazepam, or over-the-counter sleeping medication, from the ""tool-kit"" he kept in the passenger footwell. Alongside the drugs, he stashed Jack Daniels, gin, vodka or whisky, prescription drugs, plastic gloves, condoms and a vibrator. Worboys would win passengers' trust before uncorking miniature bottles of champagne As prosecutors put it, there was ""everything he would need to stupefy and sexually assault a passenger in his cab"". A fully-licensed driver, Worboys had undergone criminal records checks. As one victim said: ""Your guard drops when you are in a black cab, you learn to trust the drivers."" Some remembered nothing after the few sips of laced drink, waking the next morning with the feeling something was seriously amiss. ""I felt just awful, so horrible. Something had been violated,"" one said. Others were wary when Worboys offered them a drink but thought it rude to refuse. They poured away the drink or stalled events by phoning friends, only for Worboys' faÃ§ade to slip as he became frustrated and menacing. Once, when he failed to get his way, he forced a pill down a victim's throat. Another time he complained: ""You've really wasted my time."" Worboys targeted women who had been drinking. Afterwards, many doubted themselves, felt embarrassed or feared wasting police time. He was eventually caught when a woman went for police examination, having ended up slumped by the toilet after accepting a drink from him. The cheap Tesco bubbly was laced with date-rape drug Temazepam, or over-the-counter sleeping medication A media appeal brought forward a flood of earlier victims. Police said that if it was not for these women's courage, Worboys might still have been at large. His DNA was recovered from a semen stain in one woman's underwear. A wristband belonging to another was found in his house, and a third victim's address was found in Worboys' notebook. Forensic evidence linked a vibrator found in his car to another victim. In court, Worboys played the victim. Clutching the side of the witness box, as if for support, he sounded almost timid as he blamed his thirst for attention on missing out on cuddles after his mum died of cancer, when he was 13. He had worked as a milkman, junior dairy manager and security guard, before his craving for attention led him to become a stripper. For 13 years, until he was 42, Worboys revelled in performing as ""Terry the Minder"" for hen parties. Publicity photographs from the 1980s and 1990s show him sporting a blond tinted ""mullet"" haircut, posing in American-style police uniforms, satin underwear or rubber-look outfits. Despite the type of films produced by Worboys in his Dorset studio he claimed he ""never really had casual sex"", although he revealed ""the only time I feel comfortable sleeping... is if I've got someone I'm sleeping with"". These sleeping problems had given him access to prescription Temazepam. Worboys married once - in 1991, to mother-of-three Jean Clayton - but they were unable to have children together and divorced in 1999. Hunched on the stand, with furrowed brow and sunken eyes, he wept as he explained it had been 13 years since he had passed ""the Knowledge"" to become a cabbie. During that time, he claimed, he carried drinks and cigarettes in his cab to hand to ""down-and-outs"". He said he impressed passengers with his ""banter"", allowing them to smoke inside provided they sit on the floor away from view, or let them believe he was doling out ecstasy tablets when in fact they were vitamin pills - his ""vitamin Es"". To officers who investigated his case, this image was as false as the tales of university days he would tell to impress young students. Det Insp Dave Reid said: ""John Worboys took advantage of his position of trust as a black cab driver in London. ""He enticed women into his cab where he took the opportunity to carry out his frightening, humiliating and degrading attacks."" This is an update on an articlewritten in 2009,external.

"At the busiest times, ambulances - like these at the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan - are getting stuck in long queues More than one in eight patients rushed to hospital in an ambulance this winter has faced a delay of more than 30 minutes on arrival, BBC analysis shows. Patients are meant to be handed over to staff within 15 minutes, but more than 75,000 have waited at least twice as long as that in England. Some of the worst waits had lasted up to five hours, ambulance crews said. Doctors warned the delays put patients at risk, as the prime minister apologised for problems in the NHS. Leah Butler-Smith was with her mother, who she thought was having a stroke, when she was caught in a queue outside Broomfield Hospital in Essex this week. ""We weren't moving. We weren't going anywhere,"" she said. Leah Butler-Smith's mother was stuck in a queue outside an A&E unit Ambulances queuing this week outside Broomfield Hospital in Essex Her mother kept falling in and out of consciousness, while she and her sister tried to keep her spirits up. Ambulances continued arriving, making them scared they would be bumped for more urgent cases. ""It's just gobsmacking,"" Leah said. She said it was too soon to know what affect the delay had had on her mother's health. ""The staff are doing all they can. There just aren't the funds for the beds,"" she said. Dr Ellen Makings, medical director at Mid Essex Services NHS Trust, said she was ""extremely sorry"" for the waits experienced on that day. ""Our staff were working extremely hard to ensure that all patients were safe at all times. ""Whilst it was far from ideal for this patient to have an extended stay in the ambulance she was cared for throughout by experienced paramedics and was assessed by a qualified emergency department sister within 30 minutes of arrival, and then again by an emergency department consultant at one hour 50 minutes."" She added once Leah's mother had been assessed and had a scan it emerged she had not had a stroke. Instead she was diagnosed with a stroke mimic, where a patient presents with stroke-like symptoms but has not actually had one. Operation delays: 'Everything is up in the air' People on beds 'as far as you could see' Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the problems being seen were ""not surprising"". ""A&E units are over-crowded, so staff just cannot take care of these patients and ambulance crews have to stay with them. ""It means they face longer delays for all the assessments they should get. It is a risk, but there is nothing we can do about it."" Figures from Public Health England show there was a sharp rise in hospital admissions in England for confirmed flu cases in the last week of December, and PHE bosses said this was contributing to pressure on the NHS. This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I apologise"" for NHS difficulties The analysis of handover delays by the BBC is based on official NHS figures for 20 November to 31 December. They happen when A&E staff are not available to take care of patients brought in. Some have to wait in the back of ambulances, although many end up in waiting areas and side rooms until nurses and doctors become available. The analysis shows: Across England 75,700 ambulances had to wait over 30 minutes - 13% of the total Of those, nearly 17,000 waited over an hour The East Midlands saw the highest proportion of delays, with 20% of crews waiting over 30 minutes, followed by the East of England, with 18% Most ambulances arriving at one hospital trust - Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust - were delayed by over 30 minutes, with one in five delayed by over 60 Only six out of more than 130 hospital trusts have not had any delays of over 30 minutes Ged Blezard, director of operations of the North West Ambulance Service, said the delays were causing a ""number of problems"" and compromising the safety of patients. ""We are nursing patients in hospital corridors - and that is affecting our ability to respond to patients in the community. It is happening on a daily basis,"" he added. He said there were sometimes between 12 and 15 ambulances queuing outside A&E units, with some of the delays lasting four or five hours. Patients caught up in the problems said they feared for their health during the waits. Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust 53% United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust 45% The Queen Elizabeth Hospital NHS Trust (Norfolk) 38% East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust 34% Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust and The Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust (Essex) 29% Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the figures showed the ""shocking scale of the crisis in the NHS"" and ministers should be ashamed that patients had been ""left languishing"" like this. Prime Minister Theresa May has apologised for the problems being seen. This week NHS bosses announced the cancellation of tens of thousands of non-urgent operations in an attempt to ease the pressure on hospitals. Mrs May said: ""I know it's difficult, I know it's frustrating, I know it's disappointing for people, and I apologise."" Saffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital managers, said the problems showed the ""strain"" the system was under. ""Despite planning more meticulously than ever before, the level of demand for services means severe pressures remain,"" she said.

Meanwhile, in Scotlandthere has been a 20% jump in A&E attendances compared with the previous year, prompting an increase in patients waiting more than four hours, and in Northern Ireland the Antrim Area Hospital has had to bring in St John Ambulance volunteers to help with a surge in demand.

"John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women in his taxi John Worboys, thought to be one of the UK's most prolific rapists, is to be freed from jail. The black-cab driver is believed to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in London between 2002 and 2008. Worboys, now aged 60, gave his victims drug-laced champagne before attacking them in the back of his cab. In 2009, he was convicted at Croydon Crown Court of 19 offences andordered to serve at least eight years in jail,external. This video can not be played Solicitor: My client is ""absolutely horrified"" at the news that Worboys will be released The following year police said other women had come forward and that the suspected number of his victims now totalled more than 100. Worboys, a former stripper from Rotherhithe, south-east London, has spent 10 years in custody including a period on remand. After a hearing about his case in November, the Parole Board decided to approve his release with ""stringent"" licence conditions. He will have to report to probation staff every week and is barred from contacting any of his victims. The black cab used by Worboys in his attacks Fay Maxted, the CEO ofThe Survivors Trust,external, said Worboys' release was ""very frightening and worrying for his victims"". She said: ""He's served his sentence and will be on a stringent licence. But for his victims there will be no parole, there is no let-off for what he has done to them. ""When you are raped, or sexually assaulted in this way, there is no way to recover, especially when these attacks were so deliberate and calculated."" Allow Twitter content?

Black cab rapist: ""I screamed at him to get off me"" Sex attack victims sue cabbie John Worboys and his insurers Worboys police were 'overworked',external She said one of the women felt she should not have had to ""receive the news and see his face everywhere while cooking tea for her children"". Mrs Wistrich criticised the original sentence as being too short, saying it was just ""one month per sexual assault"". She said: ""It feels like another smack in the face, after havingspent years battling for justiceto [hold] the police to account for failing to investigate, that they've also not had the courtesy to inform her"". Worboys' black cab being taken away from outside Croydon Crown Court In 2014 Mrs Wistrich's clients won their High Court bid to receive compensation from the Met Police over the way the case was handled. At the time Mr Justice Green  said ""systemic"" failures in the investigation meant Worboys was not stopped earlier. Worboys' period on licence lasts for at least 10 years and he can be sent back to jail if he breaches the conditions. The Parole Board said in a statement: ""We can confirm that a three-member panel of the Parole Board has directed the release of Mr John Worboys, following an oral hearing."" According to the judge who sentenced him in 2009, John Worboys had ""developed and perfected a web of deceit"" to ensnare his victims. The question raised by his imminent release is whether Worboys may have deceived the Parole Board into concluding that he no longer posed a threat to women. Parole panel members have specialist skills and experience but manipulative individuals who are desperate for freedom may be able to convince even the most sceptical criminal justice practitioner that they should be given a chance. A second concern is whether Worboys has been let out to help cut the backlog of prisoners who have served longer than the minimum term imposed as part of their indeterminate sentence for public protection (IPP). The Parole Board, together with the Ministry of Justice, has been working hard to reduce the numbers - in 2016-17, 46% of all IPP offenders considered for parole were successful. At his trial, jurors heard Worboys picked up his victims in the capital's West End and gave them champagne laced with sedatives, claiming he had won the lottery or had won money at casinos. He was convicted of one rape, five sexual assaults, one attempted assault and 12 drugging charges. As well as being ordered to serve at least eight years, Worboys was given an indeterminate sentence, meaning he could be kept in prison as for as long as he was deemed to remain a danger to the public. In 2010 Worboys hadan appeal against his conviction thrown out by the Court of Appeal, where Lord Justice Moses labelled his offences as ""appalling"". Malcolm Fowler, a retired solicitor of 48 years, said Worboys ""would be anything but a free man"" on his release from prison. ""The judge said he was going to serve at least eight years, and he has served a little more than that. ""Worboys is not walking a free man from prison. He is going to be on a very conscious monitoring system, and rightly so."" The Metropolitan Police said it would not be commenting on Worboys' release.

"Tens of thousands of non-urgent NHS operations and procedures in England may be deferred until 31 January, due to winter pressures. The move promptedHealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt to apologise to patients. Non-urgent treatments had already been cancelled until mid-January, but NHS England said on Tuesday that would now be extended to the end of the month. People affected by the delays have told the BBC of the disruption and discomfort caused.

The stoma retracted and severe leaks have been a constant problem. ""I set an alarm for three in the morning every night to empty the bag, but still, on a very regular basis, it leaks. This means a shower, change of clothing whilst my wife changes the sheets. ""The consultant whilst I was still in hospital informed me this would be a problem and I would have the reversal operation once my chemotherapy finished in July. ""I had a long wait until December and since then my operation for the reversal - which is not urgent in the medical sense - has been cancelled twice, along with one provisional date also coming to nothing. ""One side of me does not want to complain, but I am so annoyed with the government who are in total denial with the crisis in the NHS. ""I want my life back, I want reduced power bills, I want freedom from stress and I want an unbroken night's sleep."" Lynne Jefford says a lot of work went into preparing her son Robert for his surgery Lynne Jefford says her son Robert, who needs surgery on his foot, is very upset after his operation was cancelled at short notice. ""My son Robert is 20 years old but has a mental age of a seven or nine-year-old. He has severe special needs, plus epilepsy and a very rare genetic defect. ""He was due to go in to hospital on Thursday for surgery on his foot to help him walk better, as he is in severe and constant pain.  On Wednesday afternoon the hospital called to cancel the operation. ""Robert does not understand why the surgery he has been preparing for has now been cancelled at the last minute. He is in tears knowing he will be in pain when he walks. ""A lot of preparation went in to getting Robert ready for this surgery and he had worked himself up for it. We don't know when this operation will happen. Everything is up in the air."" Phillip Church is a keen wild camper, but his knee injury has halted the hobby Philip Church from Bristol damaged a ligament in his knee which leaves him in pain with restricted movement. ""I waited seven weeks between seeing my doctor and getting a date for my operation. I got the date about two weeks before Christmas. ""But I received a letter between Christmas and New Year telling me my operation was pushed back. I saw what was happening with non-emergency operations and assumed I would fall into that bracket. ""Opening the letter, it was really disappointing. My new date, 24 January, is still subject to change. I am only 50/50 on whether the operation will actually happen on the new date. ""I do understand, if your operation isn't crucial, you go to the back of the line.

"This video can not be played President Trump faces questions about his relationship with former top aide Steve Bannon Lawyers for US President Donald Trump are seeking to stop the release of a book containing damaging allegations about his administration. Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House cites former top aide Steve Bannon as describing a meeting with a group of Russians as ""treasonous"". It also portrays Mr Trump as being surprised at winning the presidency. Despite the legal threat the book's publishers have brought its release forward. It was due to be out on Tuesday but the book's author Michael Wolff said the book would now be available for purchase on Friday. Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. The White House has disputed the book's accuracy. Mr Trump earlier said Mr Bannon - who was sacked in August - had ""lost his mind"" after losing his White House position. This video can not be played Ms Sanders says Mr Trump is a winner Among a number of explosive statements, Mr Bannon reportedly said, referring to a Trump Tower meeting between top campaign officials and Russia:  ""They're going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV."" The meeting, which involved Mr Trump's eldest child Donald Trump Jr, is being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of his inquiry into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia to win the election. Mr Trump strongly denies any collusion took place. Trump-Bannon: A knife fight with consequences 11 explosive claims from new Trump book Who is author of Trump book? On his Breitbart radio show on Wednesday, Mr Bannon responded to the president's criticism by saying he was a ""great man"" and that he supported him ""day in and day out"". After the president met Republican senators in the Oval Office to discuss immigration on Thursday, a reporter asked Mr Trump if his former strategist had betrayed him. He responded: ""I don't know, he called me a great man last night so he obviously changed his tune pretty quick."" The legal notice, which has been published by the Washington Post,external, demands that author Michael Wolff and the book's publisher ""immediately cease and desist from any further publication, release or dissemination of the book"". It accuses Wolff of making ""numerous false and/or baseless statements"" about Mr Trump and says lawyers are considering pursuing libel charges. The lawyers base their notice on excerpts of the book published in publications including New York Magazine and ask for a full copy of the book to be sent to them. The letter says the book ""appears to cite to [sic] no sources for many of its most damaging statements about Mr Trump"" and that many claims are made without citing sources. Neither Wolff nor the publisher, Henry Holt and Co Inc, have yet responded. The attorney who wrote the letter, Charles J Harder, has been called Hollywood's favourite lawyer. He represents Jared Kushner, and represented wrestlerHulk Hogan in his case against now defunct news website Gawker. Mr Harder also briefly represented disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein. He sent a cease-and-desist letter to Mr Bannon on Wednesday, saying he had violated a non-disclosure agreement. This video can not be played Ivanka Trump allegedly struck a deal that she might run for president in the future Wolff's forthcoming book makes many claims, including that: The Trump team was shocked and horrified by his election win His wife, Melania, was in tears of sadness on election night Mr Trump was angry that A-list stars had snubbed his inauguration The new president ""found the White House to be vexing and even a little scary"" His daughter, Ivanka, had a plan with her husband, Jared Kushner, that she would be ""the first woman president"" Ivanka Trump mocked her dad's ""comb-over"" hairstyle and ""often described the mechanics behind it to friends"" The book is reportedly based on more than 200 interviews but some of the book's excerpts have already been criticised and questioned. Still, even if only half of what the book contains is true, it paints a damning portrait of a paranoid president and a chaotic White House, BBC North America editor Jon Sopel says. By the BBC's Anthony Zurcher in Washington Donald Trump might want to familiarise himself with the so-called Streisand Effect. The lesson, most prominently learned by singer Barbra Streisand when she tried to quash photographs of her home that appeared on an obscure website, is that the more you fight against undesirable news, the more you call attention to it. Thanks to his lawyer's ""cease and desist"" letter, Mr Trump is giving Michael Wolff and his explosive book the kind of massive publicity boost money alone can't buy. The highly critical allegations are leading every news programme and newspaper front page (and burying the latest round of glowing US economic news that might otherwise garner attention). Threatening lawsuits is a common tactic for Mr Trump, dating back to his days as a New York real estate mogul. Very seldom does he follow up with actual court action. In this case, such a move would be particularly risky. To meet the ""actual malice"" requirement of US libel law, the president would open himself up to investigation from opposing lawyers seeking to prove that Wolff's allegations had substance - or, at the very least - that he had reason to believe they did. ""Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency,"" Mr Trump said in a statement on Wednesday. Press secretary Sarah Sanders dismissed the book as a ""trashy tabloid fiction"" that she said was ""filled with false and misleading accounts from individuals who have no access or influence with the White House"". 'I'm not that Steve Bannon' Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? A spokesperson for Melania Trump said the First Lady had encouraged her husband's presidential bid. ""She was confident he would win and was very happy when he did,"" she said on Wednesday. On Thursday, the White House said it was banning personal devices, including mobile phones, from the West Wing, citing security concerns. In researching the book, Wolff said he had been able to take up ""something like a semi-permanent seat on a couch in the West Wing"" following the president's inauguration.

"John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women in his taxi John Worboys, thought to be one of the UK's most prolific rapists, is to be freed from jail. The black-cab driver is believed to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in London between 2002 and 2008. Worboys, now aged 60, gave his victims drug-laced champagne before attacking them in the back of his cab.

"Seventy-one people were killed in the west London tower block fire in June The Metropolitan Police has asked the Home Office to pay Â£38m for its Grenfell Tower fire investigation. The London force has submitted an Â£11.1m claim to cover overtime and extra costs in 2017-18. It will also request Â£27m to fund the entire costs of the investigation, which involves 200 officers and staff, for the 12 months from April 2018. Finance director Lynda McMullan said: ""We don't think it's reasonable for us to pick up all the costs."" BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the investigation into the blaze was one of the biggest and most complex inquiries in the force's history. Seventy-one people were killed in the west London tower block fire in June. Why no-one heard the Grenfell blogger's warnings Grenfell Tower: The 21st floor Building safety rules failing, says review Last month,a public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire, headed by Sir Martin Moore-Bick, heard that the Met was investigating offences including manslaughter, corporate manslaughter, misconduct in public office and breaches of fire safety regulations in relation to the fire. The force has gathered 31 million documents and 2,500 physical exhibits. Some 1,144 witnesses have given statements and 383 companies are part of the investigation. The inquiry plans to deliver an interim report into the fire's causes and the emergency response by next autumn. The Met has also requested extra government funding of Â£7.8m to help pay for policing following last year's terror attacks. At a meeting of the London Assembly, Sophie Linden, deputy mayor for policing and crime, said police officer numbers in London were set to fall ""significantly below"" 30,000 despite the funding settlement announced by ministers before Christmas and an increase in the policing precept.

"This video can not be played Brexit will give Corbyn same problems as Tories - Blair Tony Blair has warned Jeremy Corbyn that Brexit will make it harder for Labour to deliver its promises if it wins power. The former prime minister said Mr Corbyn would be in ""exactly the same position"" as the Tories  - distracted by Brexit and short of money. Speaking to the BBC's John Pienaar, he defended his call for a second EU referendum. Labour has backed Brexit and ruled out a second referendum if it wins power. End 'obsessive' Brexit criticism says Fox Blair: Brexit puts NI peace process at risk Brown predicts Brexit 'crisis point' All you need to know about Brexit One member of Labour's shadow cabinet told the BBC Mr Blair's intervention was ""utterly unhelpful"". ""Lots of Labour voters voted for Brexit and this to them sounds like the metropolitan elite ignoring them,"" he said. ""The whole Tony Blair project was about being on the right side of public opinion. And now look at this. Are you telling me the Tony Blair of 1994 would have said this?"" Britain is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, but Mr Blair said it would be too late to change course by then. He has repeatedly argued that people are entitled to change their mind - either through another referendum or a general election - once the terms of its departure are clear. And he urged the current Labour leadership to adopt the same stance. The former prime minister said he was ""committed"" to seeing a Labour government elected, but added a ""qualification"" - which was that ""it's going to be extremely difficult in my view for Labour to deliver on its promises if it puts itself in exactly the same position as the Tory government's going to be on Brexit - because it will find it has less money to deal with the country's problems, that it's distracted by dealing with Brexit rather than the health service, jobs and living standards."" The UK would ""face a very challenging situation"" if it was leaving the EU under a Corbyn government, he added. Mr Blair said that if people voted again for Brexit, he would not push for a third poll - ""that concludes the argument"", he said. But he said that he would not support either of what he saw as the two most likely outcomes of negotiations - a Canada-style free trade deal or the UK being aligned with the EU but having no influence over key decisions. Vote Leave supporters in Sunderland celebrate the referendum result Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer says Labour will push for a deal that would preserve as many of the benefits of the single market and customs union as possible, as well as protecting workers' rights and the environment. But Mr Blair believes this is a ""confusing"" strategy and is not ""credible"". ""Far better to fight for the right for the country to re-think, demand that we know the full details of the new relationship before we quit the old one, go to the high ground on opposing Brexit and go after the Tories for their failures to tackle the country's real challenges. ""Make Brexit the Tory Brexit. Make them own it 100%. Show people why Brexit isn't, and never was, the answer."" Mr Blair - a longstanding critic of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - has ditched his business interests to take a more active role in British politics through his Institute for Global Change think tank. He has previously attacked Mr Corbyn's stance on Brexit - prompting the Labour leader to sayMr Blair should respect the result of the 2016 EU referendum. Richard Tice, co-chairman of the pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave campaign, said Mr Blair ""and his elite gang"" were ""still determined to stop Brexit"" and will lead the UK ""to the very bad deal which we had in the single market and the customs union"". InMr Blair's latest article published on his institute's website,external, he offered this advice to Jeremy Corbyn and his team: ""At every PMQs nail each myth of the Brexit campaign, say why the Tory divisions are weakening our country, something only credible if we are opposed to Brexit, not advocating a different Brexit, and challenge the whole farce head on of a prime minister leading our nation in a direction which even today she can't bring herself to say she would vote for. ""If we do leave Europe, the governing mind will have been that of the Tory right. UKIP uses Tony Blair on its campaign leaflets ""But, if Labour continues to go along with Brexit and insists on leaving the single market, the handmaiden of Brexit will have been the timidity of Labour."" Mr Blair's comments came as his institute issued a document highlighting developments in the UK since the Brexit vote, including a downgrade in economic forecasts.

"The drug they took caused paralysis and glassy-eyed seizures Nine young backpackers were rushed to hospital in the west Australian city of Perth after snorting a drug they mistook for cocaine. Three remain in critical condition after ingesting the mystery white powder which arrived in the post addressed to someone else. The nine suffered seizures, paralysis and hallucinations. Tests suggest the powder contained Hyoscine, a prescription drug which has gained notoriety as a date rape drug. Five of the backpackers are French, two are German, one is Italian and one is Moroccan, and they are aged between 21 and 25, say reports. They were staying at a property in the city's Victoria Park district whena package arrived in the post addressed to a previous occupant, one of the victims told the West Australian newspaper,external. They decided to open the package and found a white powder inside, wrapped in a piece of paper bearing the word ""scoop"", said the man, who said his first name was Simone. ""Scoop"" may have been a reference to ""Scopolamine"", another name for Hyoscine. Believing the powder to be cocaine, they divided it into nine doses and snorted it up their noses - only to quickly become paralysed and unable to summon help. Are backpackers worried about safety in Australia? ""We were powerless, we couldn't do anything,"" Simone said. The alarm was only raised when another housemate, who had been out for the evening, returned home. Neighbours spoke of their terror as they watched the housemates being taken out of the house on stretchers, some unconscious and some suffering glassy-eyed seizures. Three - two French and one German - remain on full life support in intensive care, said Royal Perth Hospital emergency doctor David McCutcheon. ""Several of these people would have died I'm pretty sure without medical intervention,"" he told the West Australian, adding that the nine were brought to hospital ""in a state of agitated delirium"". ""They were hallucinating, their hearts were racing, several of them had to be put in a medically induced coma for their own protection and I really need to emphasise how seriously unwell they were."" Acting deputy police commissioner Gary Budge said the incident flagged up the serious risks to health posed by taking unknown substances, be they illicit or prescription drugs. Cocaine is illegal in Australia, with federal and state laws providing penalties for possessing, using, making or selling the drug. Hyoscine, from the nightshade family of plants, is also known colloquially as ""Devil's Breath"". It's used to treat nausea, motion sickness, and gastro-intestinal pain, among others, with common side-effects including sleepiness and dry mouth. But in higher doses it can also cause hallucinations, agitation, seizures and unconsciousness. In the criminal world, the drug is used for its ability to diminish resistance, creating ""zombies"", and reduce memory of events. As such it is used in robberies, sexual assaults, date rapes and kidnappings. The criminal use of the drug is mainly associated with Colombia, where it is derived from theborracherotree which grows wild in the northern Andean region. Some 50,000 incidents are associated with the drug every year in Colombia. However, some have questioned the horror stories attributed to the drug - for instance, that powder can simply be blown into victims' faces.

"MPs say imports of food produced with lower welfare standards should not be allowed Plans for the way farming subsidies will be dealt with after Brexit have been set out by Michael Gove. Farmers will receive payments for ""public goods"", such as access to the countryside and planting meadows. The environment secretary told farmers the government would guarantee subsidies at the current EU level until the 2022 election. There would then be a ""transitional period"" in England. The National Farmers Union said it was time for ""a new deal"" for the UK. Fergus Ewing, the Scottish rural economy secretary, said Mr Gove had left ""too many questions unanswered"". Meanwhile, a report warns Brexit trade deals could threaten UK food security. MPs and peers in the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Agroecology (APPGA) say ministers must ensure farmers are not undermined by future trade deals which permit imports of food produced with lower welfare or environmental standards. Farm subsidies 'must be earned' - Gove Countryside faces 'damaging uncertainty' Five times food fights have had an impact on trade talks Mr Gove, who has promised that standards will not be compromised after Brexit, addressed two farmers' conferences in Oxford on Thursday. His speeches came ahead of the government's agriculture plans being published this spring. Mr Gove outlined plans to farmers in Oxford The current payment system - Â£3bn a year to UK farmers - is based on the amount of land farmers own. Detailing how the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) will be replaced after Brexit, Mr Gove said the CAP was ""unjust"" and ""doesn't really reward efficiency"". The government has agreed to maintain current subsidies for three years after Brexit, until 2022, and Mr Gove said the payments could continue until 2024 but the length of time would be down to ""consultation"". Mr Gove said during that time he aimed to reduce the largest subsidies, with a maximum cap or a sliding scale of reductions. He said there should be a ""smooth path"" towards a new way of paying farmers when EU subsidies ended and that a new method would ""use public money for public goods"". The plans would see farmers rewarded for planting woodland, boosting wildlife, improving water quality and recreating wildflower meadows. The environment secretary said he was ""confident"" about the future of British farming and that Brexit would allow the UK to ""leverage"" the advantages of Britain producing ""the best food in the world"" and ""some of the most innovative farmers in the world"". New trade deals with other countries outside the EU would provide new markets for the ""superb food"" Britain's farmers produce, Mr Gove said. Lib Dem leader Vince Cable said although farmers might take ""some reassurance"" from the announcement of a transition period, the end of that ""could result in a lot of turbulence and a lot distress"". Minette Batters, deputy president of the National Farmers Union, welcomed incentives to protect the environment but said her key concern was over future trade deals. She said: ""We're very proud of our high standards of environmental protection, of welfare, in the UK and we want those to be respected in any trade negotiation and we do not want to see cheaper food produced to lower standards."" Mr Gove's counterpart in Scotland, Mr Ewing, said Mr Gove's speech ""leaves far too many questions unanswered for any comfort to be taken"". He said it did ""not cover a whole variety of vital support schemes"", such as environmental programmes, ""which are crucial to ensure the continued economic well-being of all of Scotland's rural communities"". By Roger Harrabin, environment analyst For many yearsthe government has argued that EU farm policy is wasteful and bad for the environment. It has driven birds out of the countryside, led to soil erosion, and caused the loss of woodlands and wildflower meadows. Over many years, attempts to reform the policy have been resisted by farm unions, especially in France. But Brexit has given Mr Gove the opportunity to produce a farm policy made in Britain. His changes will alarm those farmers who will need to change their whole business model to get subsidies after Brexit. It will be welcomed by some efficient modern farmers who have already accepted that being paid by the public for owning land can't be justified. The changes will impact on the countryside and food production. It's too soon to tell exactly how. Mr Gove's speech comes as theAPPGA report,externalsays post-Brexit trade deals could pose the biggest peacetime threat to the UK's food security. According to the group, the import of cheaper foods that are produced to lower safety and welfare standards could place UK farmers at a disadvantage. ""To compete with these lower prices, domestic farmers could seek to tighten their margins and therefore cut corners with regards to environmental regulations,"" the AAPG said. ""If the UK is unable to protect its farmers from being undermined by lower welfare imports, farmers are likely to resist improvements and may even press for UK standards to be lowered.""

"This video can not be played ""Medieval"": Find out what Windsor makes of the royal wedding row Theresa May has entered into the debate about ""aggressive begging"" in Windsor ahead of the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. The prime minister said she disagreed with council leader Simon Dudley, whourged police to tackle the issuebefore the St George's Chapel ceremony on 19 May. Mrs May said councils should ""work with police"" and ensure accommodation was provided for homeless people. Mr Dudley has been asked for comment. He had written that beggars could present the town in a ""sadly unfavourable light"" ahead of the royal wedding. This video can not be played Royal wedding: Theresa May joins Windsor begging row debate Asked about his remarks during a visit to a hospital in nearby Camberley, Mrs May said:  ""I don't agree with the comments that the leader of the council has made."" Mrs May, who is MP in the neighbouring constituency of Maidenhead, added: ""Where there are issues of people who are aggressively begging on the streets then it's important that councils work with the police to deal with that aggressive begging."" Lord Bird, founder of the street newspaper, The Big Issue, said criminalising or temporarily moving rough sleepers was ""not the answer"". ""The young royals have a fantastic track record in addressing this issue,"" he said, ""so I've no doubt that Harry and Meghan will be equally concerned that this issue is tackled in a way that creates real, and sustainable change in the lives of homeless people.""

He said he did not believe there were aggressive beggars in the town, and that ultimately deciding to give money or not was up to the individual. ""It is not our choice to be homeless,"" he said. ""Everyone has their own reasons, everyone has their own story."" Murphy James, of the Windsor Homeless Project, said the views expressed by Windsor council leader Simon Dudley were ""misinformed"" Murphy James, of the Windsor Homeless Project, said the views expressed by Mr Dudley were ""misinformed"". ""It was totally unwarranted to bring the royal wedding into this,"" he added. ""This shouldn't be a situation that's hit the headlines because of a royal wedding. This is a situation that should have hit the headlines because there's people sleeping in bus shelters."" Mr Dudley described street begging in the town as creating a ""hostile atmosphere"" for both residents and tourists,externalin a letter to Thames Valley Police and Crime Commissioner Anthony Stansfeld. Mr Stansfeld said many of the people on the streets of Windsor were ""very vulnerable and have mental health issues"". ""It's not as easy as putting them in a police van and dumping them in Southall or somewhere. It's much more complicated than that,"" he said. The Rev Louise Brown, a vicar in nearby Dedworth, said no beggars had ever been aggressive to her in Windsor when she had spoken to them. She said: ""Yes some of them have got drink problems, but without support from the council to find real solutions I think the problem is going to be there.

"The ban by Waitrose follows concerns over the impact of sugar and caffeine on children Waitrose is to ban the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to children aged under 16. The supermarket said customers buying drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre would be asked to prove their age from 5 March. It follows concerns over the impact of sugar and caffeine on children. The British Soft Drinks Association said energy drinks had been ""deemed safe"" by regulators but that they were not marketed or promoted to under-16s. UK youngsters are among the highest consumers of energy drinks in Europe,according to researchers from Fuse, the Centre for Translational Research in Public Health,external, who in December urged the government to restrict their sale to under-16s. Waitrose said its decision was based on existing industry labelling guidelines, requiring any soft drink with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre to carry a high-caffeine content warning and state it is not recommended for children. Why our school bans energy drinks Energy drink + alcohol = trouble? Does drinking fizz make you fat? Waitrose director of technical and corporate social responsibility Simon Moore said: ""As a responsible retailer we want to sell these products in line with the labelling guidance. ""These drinks carry advice stating that they are not recommended for children, so we're choosing to proactively act on that guidance, particularly given the widespread concerns which have been raised about these drinks when consumed by under 16s."" The move has been welcomed by health and education groups who have previously campaigned about the effects high-caffeine energy drinks can have on children. TV chef Jamie Oliver has been among those campaigning on the issue Last month, campaign group Action on Sugar found that typical serving sizes of energy drinks at 500ml were larger than for other sugary drinks and were ""completely inappropriate"" for children to consume. High sugar intake among children has beenheavily linked to the UK's obesity epidemic, amid contested claims it can alter child behaviour. A sugar tax on the UK soft drinks industryhas already been announced and will come into force next April. Teaching union NASUWT, whichhas previously called for schools to ban energy drinks, said Waitrose had taken a ""positive and responsible step"" but called on the government to issue independent research into the long-term effects of energy-drink use by children. General secretary Chris Keates said: ""These drinks are readily available legal highs and are leading to children and young people consuming high levels of stimulants, with little known about the long-term health impacts."" Irn Bru panic as fans stockpile drink PM joins royal wedding begging row debate 11 explosive claims from new Trump book And TV chef Jamie Oliver, who has filmed a documentary on the issue for Channel 4's Jamie and Jimmy's Friday Night Feast, told BBC Radio 5 live that energy drink consumption and addiction among children was a ""prolific problem"". ""Kids are saying they are addicted to them, experiencing the lows and needing another to get back up again"", he said. ""Even though the industry and the companies will say we do not market to kids, you will hear the opposite from kids."" The British Soft Drinks Association (BSDA) said it had introduced a voluntary code of practice in 2010, which included policies on the appropriate labelling and marketing of energy drinks toward young people. It said the guidelines, which were updated in 2015to cover the marketing and promotion of such drinks,externalaround schools, were supported by Red Bull, Monster, Relentless and Rockstar energy drink brands. Director general Gavin Partington added that alongside manufacturers ""retailers, schools and parents all have a role to play in educating children about caffeine and sugar consumption from all sources"". The British Retail Consortium said all its members took the issue ""seriously"" and followed the BSDA code of practice on energy drinks. Andrea Martinez-Inchausti, deputy director of food policy, also said the BRC would work with the government if it decided to ban the sale of energy drinks to under-16s.

"This video can not be played What is a ""bomb cyclone""? A severe winter storm is hitting eastern North America, extending a cold snap that has already claimed 11 lives. Forecasters say a severe pressure drop has led to an explosive winter storm along the eastern US, and has already brought snow to Florida. The US is currently on its 11th day of record-breaking frigid temperatures which began around Christmas. But the predicted new storm has led meteorologists to deploy a new term - bomb cyclone. Ice and snow cover branches near the brink of Niagara Falls The National Weather Service (NWS) has warned that ""Arctic air mass will remain entrenched over the eastern two thirds of the country through the end of the week"". ""Very cold temperatures and dangerously cold wind chills expected,"" the NWS added. A ""bomb cyclone"" or ""weather bomb"" is an unofficial term for what is known as explosive cyclogenesis, according to BBC Weather. This occurs when the central pressure of a low pressure system falls by 24 millibars in 24 hours and can result in violent winds developing around the system. The winds can be strong enough to bring down trees and cause structural damage. Deadly storm batters Europe Stormy sea foam party for dog Canadian winter too much for one moose The storm, the Washington Post adds, will ""in many ways resemble a winter hurricane"" which could be the eastern US's most intense in decades. This video can not be played Cold snap grips North America On Thursday and Friday, the major storm is expected to develop along the eastern seaboard of the US, bringing strong winds, rain, sleet and snow, according to BBC Weather. The storm is forecast to undergo rapid cyclogenesis over the Atlantic Ocean, and current projections show areas north of New York as having the highest risk of significant impacts from strong winds and heavy snow.

"This video can not be played Brexit will give Corbyn same problems as Tories - Blair Tony Blair has warned Jeremy Corbyn that Brexit will make it harder for Labour to deliver its promises if it wins power. The former prime minister said Mr Corbyn would be in ""exactly the same position"" as the Tories  - distracted by Brexit and short of money. Speaking to the BBC's John Pienaar, he defended his call for a second EU referendum. Labour has backed Brexit and ruled out a second referendum if it wins power. End 'obsessive' Brexit criticism says Fox Blair: Brexit puts NI peace process at risk Brown predicts Brexit 'crisis point' All you need to know about Brexit One member of Labour's shadow cabinet told the BBC Mr Blair's intervention was ""utterly unhelpful"". ""Lots of Labour voters voted for Brexit and this to them sounds like the metropolitan elite ignoring them,"" he said. ""The whole Tony Blair project was about being on the right side of public opinion. And now look at this. Are you telling me the Tony Blair of 1994 would have said this?"" Britain is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, but Mr Blair said it would be too late to change course by then. He has repeatedly argued that people are entitled to change their mind - either through another referendum or a general election - once the terms of its departure are clear. And he urged the current Labour leadership to adopt the same stance. The former prime minister said he was ""committed"" to seeing a Labour government elected, but added a ""qualification"" - which was that ""it's going to be extremely difficult in my view for Labour to deliver on its promises if it puts itself in exactly the same position as the Tory government's going to be on Brexit - because it will find it has less money to deal with the country's problems, that it's distracted by dealing with Brexit rather than the health service, jobs and living standards."" The UK would ""face a very challenging situation"" if it was leaving the EU under a Corbyn government, he added. Mr Blair said that if people voted again for Brexit, he would not push for a third poll - ""that concludes the argument"", he said. But he said that he would not support either of what he saw as the two most likely outcomes of negotiations - a Canada-style free trade deal or the UK being aligned with the EU but having no influence over key decisions. Vote Leave supporters in Sunderland celebrate the referendum result Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer says Labour will push for a deal that would preserve as many of the benefits of the single market and customs union as possible, as well as protecting workers' rights and the environment. But Mr Blair believes this is a ""confusing"" strategy and is not ""credible"". ""Far better to fight for the right for the country to re-think, demand that we know the full details of the new relationship before we quit the old one, go to the high ground on opposing Brexit and go after the Tories for their failures to tackle the country's real challenges. ""Make Brexit the Tory Brexit. Make them own it 100%. Show people why Brexit isn't, and never was, the answer."" Mr Blair - a longstanding critic of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - has ditched his business interests to take a more active role in British politics through his Institute for Global Change think tank. He has previously attacked Mr Corbyn's stance on Brexit - prompting the Labour leader to sayMr Blair should respect the result of the 2016 EU referendum. Richard Tice, co-chairman of the pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave campaign, said Mr Blair ""and his elite gang"" were ""still determined to stop Brexit"" and will lead the UK ""to the very bad deal which we had in the single market and the customs union"". InMr Blair's latest article published on his institute's website,external, he offered this advice to Jeremy Corbyn and his team: ""At every PMQs nail each myth of the Brexit campaign, say why the Tory divisions are weakening our country, something only credible if we are opposed to Brexit, not advocating a different Brexit, and challenge the whole farce head on of a prime minister leading our nation in a direction which even today she can't bring herself to say she would vote for. ""If we do leave Europe, the governing mind will have been that of the Tory right. UKIP uses Tony Blair on its campaign leaflets ""But, if Labour continues to go along with Brexit and insists on leaving the single market, the handmaiden of Brexit will have been the timidity of Labour."" Mr Blair's comments came as his institute issued a document highlighting developments in the UK since the Brexit vote, including a downgrade in economic forecasts.

"Department store chain Debenhams' shares have sunk 15% after it warned that annual profits would be lower than expected because of disappointing trading over the key Christmas period. The retailer said underlying pre-tax profits were now likely to be between Â£55m and Â£65m this year. Analysts had been expecting profits to be about Â£83m. Like-for-like sales in the UK fell 2.6% in the 17 weeks to 30 December amid a ""volatile and competitive"" market. Debenhams said,externaltrading had improved over the six-week Christmas period thanks to discounting, with like-for-like sales up 1.2% during that time, but the first week of the post-Christmas sale was worse than expected. ""The market has been challenging and particularly promotional in some of our key seasonal categories and we have responded in order to remain competitive for our customers, which has impacted our profit performance,"" said Debenhams chief executive Sergio Bucher. Shares in the retailer dived 20% in early trade, before recovering slightly by lunchtime to stand 15% lower at about 30p. The retailer said it was ""accelerating some aspects"" of its strategic plan, Debenhams Redesigned, in order to ""deliver a long-term sustainable future"". It said early signs from new store format trials in Stevenage and Wolverhampton were ""promising"". Debenhams added that ""reorganisation and restructuring activity"" and a review of central costs were expected to generate savings of Â£20m. It said there had been ""positive momentum in digital sales growth"", with smartphone demand up 36% year-on-year following improvements to its mobile site. However, Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Strong growth for its digital offering has failed to save Debenhams from a miserable end to the year. ""Customers turned out for Christmas, but refused to put their hands in their pockets in the lead-up to the festive period, or indeed the Boxing Day sales. ""Debenhams has been forced to cut prices to persuade shoppers to part with their cash, and as a result, margins have been squeezed, profits have been significantly downgraded and the share price has taken a massive hit."" Sofie Willmott, senior retail analyst at GlobalData, said: ""Given the barrage of discounted products available in the lead-up to Christmas, including Black Friday, it's no surprise that Debenhams' end-of-season sale produced disappointing results, despite 'further markdown investment'. ""Discerning consumers with squeezed budgets are looking for value for money and by constantly reducing the price of goods, Debenhams is damaging customer perception of value, discouraging shoppers to buy from the retailer."" With hundreds of stores in expensive locations and with a constant squeeze on the average shoppers' spending power, Debenhams is caught in a classic bind. Online and discount retailers are attracting increasing amounts of spending power and Debenhams is in a constant race to adapt quickly enough to a rapidly changing retail market. So it slashes prices to attract sales in the run-up to Christmas, hardly a sign of confidence or strength, while accelerating cost savings and trying to roll out new outlets and improve its online offering. Shareholders seem unimpressed and worried that Debenhams is trying to run faster and faster to catch up and yet appears still to be falling behind  younger and more flexible competitors. Debenhams is the UK's second-biggest department store operator and has 240 stores in 27 countries. Its current fortunes contrast sharply with those of clothing retailer Next, which surprised the markets on Wednesday byraising its profit forecast. Next said annual profits were expected to rise by Â£8m to Â£725m after cold weather boosted trade ahead of Christmas, sending full-price sales up 1.5% - far better than the 0.3% fall it had expected.

"Potential first-time buyers must typically save for eight years to afford a deposit to buy a home, data suggests. A typical 20% deposit in London is now more than Â£80,000, according to the Nationwide Building Society. Elsewhere in the UK, the average deposit could be closer to Â£20,000, the lender said. The squeeze on wages and low interest rates makes it more difficult to raise the money than a decade ago. The Nationwide, which calculated thathouse prices rose by 2.6% in 2017, analysed its mortgage data for the cost of the typical first-time buyer's house purchase in each region, based on four times a buyer's income, and from this derived how much a 20% deposit would be. The Â£80,000-plus cost in London is about Â£30,000 higher than a decade ago. In other regions, such as the Midlands and northern England, deposit requirements are similar to 2007, when prices were at their pre-crisis peak. However, real earnings have generally fallen for young people since then and savings rates are low. The Nationwide then calculated the length of time it would take for buyers in each region to save such a deposit, based on squirreling away 15% of their take-home pay. In most regions, it would take about eight years for the typical buyer to save for a deposit. This rises to nine years in the South East of England and to nearly 10 years in London. Lenders have been told by regulators to set stricter affordability requirements since the financial crisis, to avoid financial stress on the system and on individual borrowers. This created noticeable extra pressure on the need for first-time buyers to save compared with before the financial crisis. Many have turned to parents and other relatives to help with the cost. Iona Bain, founder of the Young Money Blog, said this could be dangerous for young borrowers. ""The Bank of Mum and Dad, or Granny and Grandad, can come with big legal pitfalls, particularly if you're borrowing money with a partner, while trying to grow your money in more exotic ways through crowdfunding or Bitcoin, for instance, could put your whole deposit at risk,"" she said. ""The only other alternative is to simply save harder for longer. That means putting all your spare change into a home where you'll have to live for many years to come, since you'll struggle to move up the housing ladder. ""That doesn't sound very attractive if you're not sure about your future and you're trying to keep all your options open."" Dan Wilson Craw, of the Generation Rent lobby group, said: ""High housing costs are eating into renters' take-home pay which makes saving for a deposit difficult in the country as a whole but near impossible in London and the South East of England. ""Renters deserve a stable home in return for their rent, but private tenancies simply do not offer this."" Meanwhile, demand for mortgages remains relatively static, so lenders are still getting the custom. Bank of England figures show that 65,139 mortgages were approved for house purchases, for new and existing owners, during November. This is very close to the average of the previous six months. The total value of these loans was Â£11.9bn. The figures come the day after the government claimed more than 16,000 first-time buyers havesaved thousands of poundsas a result of changes to stamp duty. The Autumn Budget abolished stamp duty for first-time buyers of homes up to Â£300,000. For properties costing up to Â£500,000, no stamp duty will be paid on the first Â£300,000.

"This video can not be played Brexit will give Corbyn same problems as Tories - Blair Tony Blair has warned Jeremy Corbyn that Brexit will make it harder for Labour to deliver its promises if it wins power. The former prime minister said Mr Corbyn would be in ""exactly the same position"" as the Tories  - distracted by Brexit and short of money. Speaking to the BBC's John Pienaar, he defended his call for a second EU referendum. Labour has backed Brexit and ruled out a second referendum if it wins power. End 'obsessive' Brexit criticism says Fox Blair: Brexit puts NI peace process at risk Brown predicts Brexit 'crisis point' All you need to know about Brexit One member of Labour's shadow cabinet told the BBC Mr Blair's intervention was ""utterly unhelpful"". ""Lots of Labour voters voted for Brexit and this to them sounds like the metropolitan elite ignoring them,"" he said. ""The whole Tony Blair project was about being on the right side of public opinion. And now look at this. Are you telling me the Tony Blair of 1994 would have said this?"" Britain is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, but Mr Blair said it would be too late to change course by then. He has repeatedly argued that people are entitled to change their mind - either through another referendum or a general election - once the terms of its departure are clear. And he urged the current Labour leadership to adopt the same stance. The former prime minister said he was ""committed"" to seeing a Labour government elected, but added a ""qualification"" - which was that ""it's going to be extremely difficult in my view for Labour to deliver on its promises if it puts itself in exactly the same position as the Tory government's going to be on Brexit - because it will find it has less money to deal with the country's problems, that it's distracted by dealing with Brexit rather than the health service, jobs and living standards."" The UK would ""face a very challenging situation"" if it was leaving the EU under a Corbyn government, he added. Mr Blair said that if people voted again for Brexit, he would not push for a third poll - ""that concludes the argument"", he said. But he said that he would not support either of what he saw as the two most likely outcomes of negotiations - a Canada-style free trade deal or the UK being aligned with the EU but having no influence over key decisions. Vote Leave supporters in Sunderland celebrate the referendum result Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer says Labour will push for a deal that would preserve as many of the benefits of the single market and customs union as possible, as well as protecting workers' rights and the environment. But Mr Blair believes this is a ""confusing"" strategy and is not ""credible"". ""Far better to fight for the right for the country to re-think, demand that we know the full details of the new relationship before we quit the old one, go to the high ground on opposing Brexit and go after the Tories for their failures to tackle the country's real challenges. ""Make Brexit the Tory Brexit. Make them own it 100%. Show people why Brexit isn't, and never was, the answer."" Mr Blair - a longstanding critic of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - has ditched his business interests to take a more active role in British politics through his Institute for Global Change think tank. He has previously attacked Mr Corbyn's stance on Brexit - prompting the Labour leader to sayMr Blair should respect the result of the 2016 EU referendum. Richard Tice, co-chairman of the pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave campaign, said Mr Blair ""and his elite gang"" were ""still determined to stop Brexit"" and will lead the UK ""to the very bad deal which we had in the single market and the customs union"". InMr Blair's latest article published on his institute's website,external, he offered this advice to Jeremy Corbyn and his team: ""At every PMQs nail each myth of the Brexit campaign, say why the Tory divisions are weakening our country, something only credible if we are opposed to Brexit, not advocating a different Brexit, and challenge the whole farce head on of a prime minister leading our nation in a direction which even today she can't bring herself to say she would vote for. ""If we do leave Europe, the governing mind will have been that of the Tory right. UKIP uses Tony Blair on its campaign leaflets ""But, if Labour continues to go along with Brexit and insists on leaving the single market, the handmaiden of Brexit will have been the timidity of Labour."" Mr Blair's comments came as his institute issued a document highlighting developments in the UK since the Brexit vote, including a downgrade in economic forecasts.

"This video can not be played Chief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke said recommendations had not been properly addressed A prison is not fit for purpose because of its low standards and failure to do more to prevent eight people taking their own lives over the past six years, a watchdog has said. HM Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) said each of the deaths at Swansea prison were within the first week of arrival. Four of those happened before an inspection in 2014 and the latest visit found lessons had not been learnt. Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) said action was taken. Inspectors also found issues with violence, overcrowding and self-harm. The Prison Governors Association said the ""issues highlighted in the Swansea report are fairly systemic across the prison system"". Chief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke said the inspection in August 2017 was ""very disappointing"". 'No overcrowding link' to prison suicide Governors 'devastated' by prison service ""Between our last inspection in 2014 and when we went back in the middle of last year there have been four further self-inflicted deaths - all in similar circumstances, all in the early days of the individual's imprisonment at Swansea jail,"" Mr Clarke said. ""Quite simply, not enough has been done to understand the sort of problems they may have been facing and to prevent them inflicting harm and death upon themselves."" In the six months before the latest inspection there were 134 cases of self-harm, which Mr Clarke said was ""clearly unacceptable"". Eight people took their own lives over the past six years at the prison. He said only eight of the 63 recommendations made on the 2014 visit had been fully achieved. ""Instead of making progress, the prison had actually gone backwards, and gone backwards in some very serious and worrying ways,"" he added. Mr Clarke also called for HM Prison and Probation Service to help. The report found the prison had a ""complacent and inexcusable"" approach to the safety of vulnerable prisoners. It said the prison's city centre location presented a heightened risk of contraband being thrown over the walls - a problem for jails around England and Wales. It has repeatedly been identified as a factor behind surging levels of violence in prisons, while there are concerns mobiles are used to facilitate more crime from behind bars. Sites revealed for two new prisons Prison suicides rise to record level But the HMIP noted some ""useful initiatives"" in Swansea to tackle this, including placing staff outside perimeter walls and working with the surrounding community. At the time of the inspection, there were 458 men in Swansea prison - nearly 200 more than it should hold. The report also found a rise in violence since the last inspection, while 17% of inmates became addicted to drugs while in prison, and the provision of clean clothing and bedding was ""unacceptably poor"". Mr Clarke added: ""As it stands at the moment, our conclusion is that it's not fit for purpose in that its standards are not acceptable."" Streets around the back of Swansea prison are patrolled to stop people throwing items over the wall Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said men ""find it easier"" to get drugs than clean clothes and bedding. She added: ""But most concerning of all are the terrible findings on self-injury and suicide, which show that this prison is failing to learn lessons from past mistakes and men are dying as a consequence."" The Prison Governors Association blamed ""severe austerity measures"" for the issues at Swansea prison. ""The result is the cuts went too far, too deep and for too long,"" said president Andrea Albutt. She added action plans from previous inspections cannot be implemented because you need ""the money and the staff"". ""If your resources are cut to the bone, you do not have the resources to deliver the action plan and make a difference."" Michael Spurr, chief executive of HMPPS, said it had taken ""immediate action"" since the inspection ""to strengthen safety arrangements in the prison and reduce self-harm"". He said: ""This includes work to improve the level of care and support given to new prisoners in the first night centre. ""A new senior operational manager has also been recruited to focus on safety and enhanced suicide and self-harm prevention training is being given to staff to increase interventions and support available to vulnerable prisoners. ""I'm pleased that the Inspector has recognised the progress that has already made. A robust action plan is in place to address the recommendations in this report.""

"The ban by Waitrose follows concerns over the impact of sugar and caffeine on children Waitrose is to ban the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to children aged under 16. The supermarket said customers buying drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre would be asked to prove their age from 5 March. It follows concerns over the impact of sugar and caffeine on children. The British Soft Drinks Association said energy drinks had been ""deemed safe"" by regulators but that they were not marketed or promoted to under-16s. UK youngsters are among the highest consumers of energy drinks in Europe,according to researchers from Fuse, the Centre for Translational Research in Public Health,external, who in December urged the government to restrict their sale to under-16s. Waitrose said its decision was based on existing industry labelling guidelines, requiring any soft drink with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre to carry a high-caffeine content warning and state it is not recommended for children. Why our school bans energy drinks Energy drink + alcohol = trouble? Does drinking fizz make you fat? Waitrose director of technical and corporate social responsibility Simon Moore said: ""As a responsible retailer we want to sell these products in line with the labelling guidance. ""These drinks carry advice stating that they are not recommended for children, so we're choosing to proactively act on that guidance, particularly given the widespread concerns which have been raised about these drinks when consumed by under 16s."" The move has been welcomed by health and education groups who have previously campaigned about the effects high-caffeine energy drinks can have on children. TV chef Jamie Oliver has been among those campaigning on the issue Last month, campaign group Action on Sugar found that typical serving sizes of energy drinks at 500ml were larger than for other sugary drinks and were ""completely inappropriate"" for children to consume. High sugar intake among children has beenheavily linked to the UK's obesity epidemic, amid contested claims it can alter child behaviour. A sugar tax on the UK soft drinks industryhas already been announced and will come into force next April. Teaching union NASUWT, whichhas previously called for schools to ban energy drinks, said Waitrose had taken a ""positive and responsible step"" but called on the government to issue independent research into the long-term effects of energy-drink use by children. General secretary Chris Keates said: ""These drinks are readily available legal highs and are leading to children and young people consuming high levels of stimulants, with little known about the long-term health impacts."" Irn Bru panic as fans stockpile drink PM joins royal wedding begging row debate 11 explosive claims from new Trump book And TV chef Jamie Oliver, who has filmed a documentary on the issue for Channel 4's Jamie and Jimmy's Friday Night Feast, told BBC Radio 5 live that energy drink consumption and addiction among children was a ""prolific problem"". ""Kids are saying they are addicted to them, experiencing the lows and needing another to get back up again"", he said. ""Even though the industry and the companies will say we do not market to kids, you will hear the opposite from kids."" The British Soft Drinks Association (BSDA) said it had introduced a voluntary code of practice in 2010, which included policies on the appropriate labelling and marketing of energy drinks toward young people. It said the guidelines, which were updated in 2015to cover the marketing and promotion of such drinks,externalaround schools, were supported by Red Bull, Monster, Relentless and Rockstar energy drink brands. Director general Gavin Partington added that alongside manufacturers ""retailers, schools and parents all have a role to play in educating children about caffeine and sugar consumption from all sources"". The British Retail Consortium said all its members took the issue ""seriously"" and followed the BSDA code of practice on energy drinks. Andrea Martinez-Inchausti, deputy director of food policy, also said the BRC would work with the government if it decided to ban the sale of energy drinks to under-16s.

"Large quantities of Afghan heroin reach Turkey via Iran Turkey's Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu has been criticised for saying police should break the legs of drug dealers who are seen outside schools. The Turkish Human Rights Association (IHD) and secular opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet both accused Mr Soylu of incitement to commit a crime. He pledged to take the blame for it. ""If a dealer is near a school the police have a duty to break his leg. Do it and blame me. Even if it costs five, 10, 20 years in jail - we'll pay."" He was speaking at a public meeting on security, at a hall in the Turkish capital, Ankara. He said the security forces' seizure of 20 tonnes of heroin in 2017 had made it a record year for drug hauls.

"This week saw the BBC launch its NHS Tracker project. The online search allows users to find out how their local services perform against the three key targets covering accident and emergency departments, cancer care and planned operations and treatment. The project will run for a year. But already some remarkable issues have been brought to light. There was only one local hospital service in the whole of the UK that achieved all three key targets throughout the year. Take a bow Luton and Dunstable NHS Trust. The medium-sized hospital undoubtedly benefits from the fact that it is not a large regional centre, which means it will avoid some of the most complex cases. But the performance is impressive nonetheless. The next best-placed service had missed a fifth of its targets over the past year.

The trust has been surprisingly reticent to shout about what it does and declined the chance to appear on air as the BBC launched its NHS Tracker. We do know it has been at the forefront of putting GPs into A&E, which is now a national policy as it helps deal with patients who arrive with fairly minor ailments. It also has a state-of-the-art operations centres - fully digitalised (not always a given in the NHS) - that allows managers to monitor which beds are occupied and how long patients have been waiting. This helps keep patients flowing through the system - and when bottlenecks build up they can be identified and dealt with quickly. Six of the top 12 performing hospital services in England over the past year are clustered around the North East. They include South Tyneside, Gateshead and North Tees/Hartlepool, which were ranked second, third and fourth behind Luton. All achieved their key targets for 80% of the year. Newcastle, South Tees and County Durham/Darlington were not far behind. Across the whole region, even when you take into account the weaker performers, the average was just over 70%. The hospitals had a mixed performance on cancer, but achieved a 100% success rate in meeting the 18-week target for planned operations. It's not entirely clear why this has happened. It has a smaller population and fewer hospitals than many of the regions, meaning the performance of a few places is more likely to skew the overall picture. But it is certainly fair to say the region has benefited from having some of the most respected and experienced chief executives running its hospitals in recent years, including Sir Len Fenwick, who ran Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Trust for over 40 years before stepping down earlier this year, and former Jim Mackey, who now runs the regulator, NHS Improvement. That has helped the NHS in the region to forge good links with local councils. This is considered vital as it allows hospitals to discharge patients quickly in the knowledge there is care available in the community to help them recover after their hospital treatment. Targets started to be introduced across the NHS in the early years of the 21st Century. There has been an odd bit of tinkering since, for example both England and Scotland started off expecting 98% of patients to be seen in four hours but have subsequently reduced this target to 95%. But nowhere has chopped and changed as much as Northern Ireland when it comes to planned operations and care. It has a 13-week target from the point at which a decision is made to admit a patient to the start of treatment. It last hit this in 2013, when the threshold was that 60% of patients had to be seen within that time period. At the time performance was improving, and so the target soon moved up to 70% and then 80%. But the health service there could not get close to meeting the mark, and with performance dropping so did the target. In March 2015 it stood at 80%, but since then it has been reduced to 55% - and yet the target has still not been met. It is very hard to compare the performance of each of the four UK nations. As the targets are measured differently, it is hard to say which is doing best and worst. This is why when the BBC launched its NHS Tracker it focused on which nation was best at hitting the targets it had set. It turned out all were pretty poor. Wales, Northern Ireland and England had not achieved any of their key targets at a national level in the past 12 months. Scotland had hit them just 8% of the time. What that does not tell us though is which nation missed them by the most. The best indication of that is performance against the four-hour A&E target as it is the most comparable target and is a good indication of overall ""stress"" in the system. When you look at performance over the past year, there is a clear first, second, third and fourth place. Or at least on a regular basis, that is. Performance has now dropped so far against the targets that a number of hospital bosses voiced concern over whether they could realistically meet them on a consistent basis. There is a growing number of trusts that have not hit targets for over five years. And nationally you have to go back to 2008 for the last time Wales met its cancer target, while its four-hour A&E goal has never been achieved since it was set in 2004. In Northern Ireland neither the A&E nor cancer targets have been met since they were set in 2008 and 2009 respectively. But it is also worth noting there are some targets that have been hit. The BBC chose to focus on the three particular targets it did because these are widely considered to be the most important as they are the ones that best measure the whole patient experience. But there are other targets that have been met. These tend to be measures that look at just one part of the patient pathway, such as access to diagnostic tests when a person needs a hospital operation, or an appointment with a cancer specialist following an urgent referral.

"This video can not be played White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders explains why Mr Trump rounded on his former adviser Steve Bannon US President Donald Trump's lawyers have written to his former strategist Steve Bannon, saying he has violated a non-disclosure agreement. The cease-and-desist notice accuses Mr Bannon of defaming the president in speaking to author Michael Wolff. Wolff's forthcoming tell-all book makes several startling claims, and questions Mr Trump's fitness for office. The president responded by saying Mr Bannon had ""lost his mind"" after losing his White House position. His lawyers said Mr Bannon had broken his employment agreement,externalby speaking to Wolff about Mr Trump, his family and the campaign, ""disclosing confidential information"" and ""making disparaging statements and in some cases outright defamatory statements"". On his radio show on Wednesday, Mr Bannon responded to the president's criticism by saying he was a ""great man"". ""You know, I support him day in and day out,"" he said on the show produced by right-wing Breitbart News, which he heads. The book is reportedly based on more than 200 interviews. Trump-Bannon: A knife fight with consequences On Thursday,the Hollywood Reporter published Wolff's behind-the-scenes account,external. He concluded that everyone he had spoken to was in agreement in their view on Mr Trump: ""They all - 100 percent - came to believe he was incapable of functioning in his job"". Melania and Ivanka Trump feature in various stories Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House makes many explosive claims, including that: Mr Bannon thought a meeting between Donald Trump Jr and a group of Russians was ""treasonous"" The Trump team was shocked and horrified by his election win His wife, Melania, was in tears on election night Mr Trump was angry that A-list stars had snubbed his inauguration The new president ""found the White House to be vexing and even a little scary"" His daughter, Ivanka, had a plan with her husband, Jared Kushner, that she would be ""the first woman president"" Ivanka Trump mocked her dad's ""comb-over"" hairstyle and ""often described the mechanics behind it to friends"" 11 explosive claims from new Trump book It also alleges that former UK Prime MinisterTony Blair told Mr Trump during a meeting last February that the British intelligence services may have been spying on him,externaland his campaign, according to a report in The Times newspaper. This video can not be played Tony Blair says a claim he warned Donald Trump's aides UK spied is a 'complete fabrication' The Times says Mr Blair was hoping to get a job advising Mr Trump on the Middle East. Mr Blair told the BBC Today programme the story was ""complete fabrication, from beginning to end"". He said he had discussed the Middle East peace process with Mr Kushner but denied angling for work. The 64-year-old writer is a former columnist for New York magazine and Vanity Fair. Michael Wolff has written a number of books about the media According to New York magazine, which first published the extracts, Wolff was able to exploit the Trump administration's political inexperience to gain an unusual amount of insight. Wolff said he was able to take up ""something like a semi-permanent seat on a couch in the West Wing"" following the president's inauguration. However, some of the book's excerpts have already been criticised and questioned. The Washington Post said Wolff was a ""provocateur and media polemicist"", and that his reporting had been questioned before. More on the author of the explosive Trump book ""Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency,"" Mr Trump said in a statement on Wednesday. This video can not be played Steve Bannon's three goals for the Trump presidency Press secretary Sarah Sanders dismissed the book as a ""trashy tabloid fiction"" that she said was ""filled with false and misleading accounts from individuals who have no access or influence with the White House"". A spokesperson for Melania Trump said the First Lady had encouraged her husband's presidential bid. ""She was confident he would win and was very happy when he did,"" she said on Wednesday. Aside from the radio comment, Mr Bannon has not spoken publicly about the book, the president's comments or the legal action. How Trump cooled on Bannon However, in an interview with BBC Newsnight, Raheem Kassam - UK editor of Breitbart News - said the Wolff interviews could have been taken out of context. He also said Mr Bannon was well-placed to comment on the Russia controversy, having served in the US Navy. ""He understands what the geopolitical threat is..."" said Mr Kassam. ""So when he remarks that these people shouldn't probably have been in Trump Tower taking meetings with senior campaign staff without lawyers in the room, I would say that is a fair thing to say."" Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Donald Trump swept to the presidency in part on the back of Steve Bannon and his Breitbart conservative media empire. Now we will see how he fares when he is at war with them. The president's blistering reply to Mr Bannon's comments appears to indicate that the bridge between the politician and his ideological spirit guide has been reduced to cinders. But how will Mr Trump's legion of supporters react? It is never wise to underestimate their dedication to the man himself, above all else. No matter the outcome of this coming battle, this has to be viewed as a devastating failure for Mr Bannon personally. After spending years advocating for an anti-establishment conservative populism, he finally had a seat in the halls of power. He said in early 2017 that his goal was nothing short of the ""deconstruction of the administrative state"". Now he is on the outside again, besieged by long-time antagonists and former allies. His president recently signed a tax bill embraced by corporate interests. His first post-2016 foray into elective politics, the Alabama Senate race, ended in humiliating defeat. Perhaps, given all this, the Bannon-Trump feud was as inevitable as it is certain to be vicious. Blair: Trump rumours are false.

"At the busiest times, ambulances - like these at the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan - are getting stuck in long queues More than one in eight patients rushed to hospital in an ambulance this winter has faced a delay of more than 30 minutes on arrival, BBC analysis shows. Patients are meant to be handed over to staff within 15 minutes, but more than 75,000 have waited at least twice as long as that in England. Some of the worst waits had lasted up to five hours, ambulance crews said. Doctors warned the delays put patients at risk, as the prime minister apologised for problems in the NHS. Leah Butler-Smith was with her mother, who she thought was having a stroke, when she was caught in a queue outside Broomfield Hospital in Essex this week. ""We weren't moving. We weren't going anywhere,"" she said. Leah Butler-Smith's mother was stuck in a queue outside an A&E unit Ambulances queuing this week outside Broomfield Hospital in Essex Her mother kept falling in and out of consciousness, while she and her sister tried to keep her spirits up. Ambulances continued arriving, making them scared they would be bumped for more urgent cases. ""It's just gobsmacking,"" Leah said. She said it was too soon to know what affect the delay had had on her mother's health. ""The staff are doing all they can. There just aren't the funds for the beds,"" she said. Dr Ellen Makings, medical director at Mid Essex Services NHS Trust, said she was ""extremely sorry"" for the waits experienced on that day. ""Our staff were working extremely hard to ensure that all patients were safe at all times. ""Whilst it was far from ideal for this patient to have an extended stay in the ambulance she was cared for throughout by experienced paramedics and was assessed by a qualified emergency department sister within 30 minutes of arrival, and then again by an emergency department consultant at one hour 50 minutes."" She added once Leah's mother had been assessed and had a scan it emerged she had not had a stroke. Instead she was diagnosed with a stroke mimic, where a patient presents with stroke-like symptoms but has not actually had one. Operation delays: 'Everything is up in the air' People on beds 'as far as you could see' Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the problems being seen were ""not surprising"". ""A&E units are over-crowded, so staff just cannot take care of these patients and ambulance crews have to stay with them. ""It means they face longer delays for all the assessments they should get. It is a risk, but there is nothing we can do about it."" Figures from Public Health England show there was a sharp rise in hospital admissions in England for confirmed flu cases in the last week of December, and PHE bosses said this was contributing to pressure on the NHS. This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I apologise"" for NHS difficulties The analysis of handover delays by the BBC is based on official NHS figures for 20 November to 31 December. They happen when A&E staff are not available to take care of patients brought in. Some have to wait in the back of ambulances, although many end up in waiting areas and side rooms until nurses and doctors become available. The analysis shows: Across England 75,700 ambulances had to wait over 30 minutes - 13% of the total Of those, nearly 17,000 waited over an hour The East Midlands saw the highest proportion of delays, with 20% of crews waiting over 30 minutes, followed by the East of England, with 18% Most ambulances arriving at one hospital trust - Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust - were delayed by over 30 minutes, with one in five delayed by over 60 Only six out of more than 130 hospital trusts have not had any delays of over 30 minutes Ged Blezard, director of operations of the North West Ambulance Service, said the delays were causing a ""number of problems"" and compromising the safety of patients. ""We are nursing patients in hospital corridors - and that is affecting our ability to respond to patients in the community. It is happening on a daily basis,"" he added. He said there were sometimes between 12 and 15 ambulances queuing outside A&E units, with some of the delays lasting four or five hours. Patients caught up in the problems said they feared for their health during the waits. Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust 53% United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust 45% The Queen Elizabeth Hospital NHS Trust (Norfolk) 38% East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust 34% Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust and The Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust (Essex) 29% Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the figures showed the ""shocking scale of the crisis in the NHS"" and ministers should be ashamed that patients had been ""left languishing"" like this. Prime Minister Theresa May has apologised for the problems being seen. This week NHS bosses announced the cancellation of tens of thousands of non-urgent operations in an attempt to ease the pressure on hospitals. Mrs May said: ""I know it's difficult, I know it's frustrating, I know it's disappointing for people, and I apologise."" Saffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital managers, said the problems showed the ""strain"" the system was under.

"This video can not be played White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders explains why Mr Trump rounded on his former adviser Steve Bannon It's not unusual for former political allies to fall out. It happens all the time. But normally it's done in private, and maybe hinted at in public. Not this time. Not with this President. This is a vicious knife fight between Donald Trump and his former campaign chief and White House Chief strategist being played out across social media. Other Trump family members and supporters are piling in too. Why? Because Steve Bannon has enraged Donald Trump with his description of a meeting that took place between the president's son, Don Jr, and son in law, Jared Kushner, with a Kremlin-linked, Russian lawyer as unpatriotic and treasonous. 11 explosive claims from new Trump book He's talked about how clear it is what the Special Counsel, Robert Mueller, is investigating - whether the Trump organisation was laundering dirty Russian money. Donald Trump has fired back in the way only he knows how. He has met fire with fire, accusing Bannon of having lost his mind, of not being that influential, of being a pretender. Lost his mind. Wow. So much for the spat. Does it matter? Well yes it does. Mr Mueller's team is investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the election To anyone who will listen, Trump and his supporters have insisted vociferously, angrily, indignantly that there is no evidence there was collusion. In onerecent interview with the New York Times,externalconducted over the New Year at Mar-a-Lago, Trump raised the subject again and again and again, denying collusion 16 times. Bannon's comments won't alter the course of the Mueller investigation - his team is quietly getting on with its investigation and following where the evidence takes them - remember there have already been three people charged in connection with this. But it matters in the war of words on social media. The narrative of Trump fidelis is that this is a 'nothingburger', or to change my food metaphor, sour grapes from the Democrats after their shock election defeat. Russia: The 'cloud' over the Trump White House Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Some ideological outriders have been saying that what the president should do is fire the special counsel, and bring his existentially threatening investigation to an end. But how much more difficult is that propaganda battle now to wage, when one of the principal actors from the Trump campaign, and the first six months of the Trump presidency talks openly and on the record about treasonous and unpatriotic behaviour. President Trump boards Air Force One with his then top aide, Steve Bannon The firing of Bannon last August the president did with a heavy heart. But it seems that hell hath no fury like a Bannon scorned. Or as President Johnson noted when dealing with the troublesome J Edgar Hoover in the 1960s - better to have him inside the tent pissing out than outside pissing in. Bannon is outside, and taking careful aim. How Trump cooled on Bannon But if the Bannon accusations are damaging (and they are), there is one aspect of this which will be causing quiet delight in the White House. If you cast your mind back to the summer, the appointment of General John Kelly (and the firing of Bannon) was meant to mark the moment when discipline was imposed on an unruly, freewheeling, chaotic administration. There would be a chain of command. Order. Discipline. Systems. Well Steve Bannon was gone, true; but he was still an important voice in the president's ear. Remember this iron law of governing. It doesn't matter what a person's job title is, it is what proximity they have to the centre of power. Bannon was on the outside, but he was still a source of counsel. Now he is not just on the outside, he is in outer darkness. This video can not be played Steve Bannon's three goals for the Trump presidency So what is Steve Bannon's next move? Well I make one confident prediction: it won't be to roll up his tent, pack his knapsack and skulk away with his head drooping. Bannon is campaigning to tear down the Republican establishment, and in Breitbart News he has a fairly formidable weapon with which to wage his war. Bannon wants candidates in this year's mid term election who will threaten the existing Republican leadership, who will follow the populist, nationalist policies that led Donald Trump to election victory in 2016. You have two men now violently fighting it out for the hearts and minds of the Americans who propelled Donald Trump to victory. When I came to work this morning I thought nothing would or could eclipse Donald Trump's tweet about Kim Jong-un. But now it seems that Mr Bannon and President Trump are locked in a battle over who's got the bigger button and whose is most powerful. Next move, Steve Bannon. And this is so much less life-threatening than real nuclear war.

"Police are ""routinely ignoring"" the needs of women detainees on their periods, the Independent Custody Visiting Association (ICVA) has said. The way menstruating suspects are being treated in police detention could be in breach of human rights and equality laws, according to the IVCA, which monitors the treatment of detainees. It called on the home secretary to introduce new guidelines for police. The Home Office said everyone held in custody should be treated with dignity. But the ICVA - which is funded by the Home Office - says women in England and Wales are often held in police cells without access to hygienic sanitary protection or facilities for washing and changing. Many are not able to speak to a female police officer, it adds. One woman, it says, had her clothes removed and was dressed in a paper suit. Despite her having her period, her underwear had been removed and she was refused any sanitary protection. ""She was left in a state of vulnerability sufficient to cause concern for her wellbeing, bleeding in a paper suit, alone in a cell,"" the ICVA said. Sherry Ralph, the organisation's chief operating officer, said that custody suites ""typically only have one absorbency of tampon and towel available"". ""One senior officer described the packs that they have to buy as 'woeful',"" she added. Surviving period poverty with 'socks and tissue' Tampon tax: How much have you spent? Far fewer women are arrested than men. In 2016/17, 119,937 females were arrested in England and and Wales out of a total 779,660 people arrested. The maximum period of detention in custody is four days, with judicial authorisation. For arrests under terrorism legislation, this rises to 14 days. Evidence gathered by the IVCA suggests the problem of sanitary provision is widespread across forces in England and Wales. The IVCA has now written to Home Secretary Amber Rudd, calling on her to take ""swift action"" to resolve the problems. ""No woman or girl should be left in indignity by police officers for want of a difficult conversation or an inexpensive box of tampons,"" the letter reads. A copy of the letter has also been sent to Women and Equalities Minister Justine Greening and David Isaac, chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission. During the booking-in process, women detainees should be asked about their needs in private They should be provided a female officer point of contact A hygiene pack should be offered automatically to all women, with a fresh pack offered after six hours Hand-washing facilities must be available CCTV monitoring should be pixelated or alternative arrangements made to allow women detainees to change in private Where the removal of clothes is necessary due to risk of self-harm, the removal of sanitary protection should be subject to individual risk assessment Dame Vera Baird, Police and Crime Commissioner for Northumbria, called the failure to offer automatic packages to detainees ""lamentable"". ""This must immediately stop and police must revise their process,"" she said, as she urged the home secretary and prime minister to ""ensure action is taken"". The Home Office said it is working with the ICVA and the National Police Chiefs' Council ""to understand where improvements can be made on this issue"".

"MPs say imports of food produced with lower welfare standards should not be allowed Plans for the way farming subsidies will be dealt with after Brexit have been set out by Michael Gove. Farmers will receive payments for ""public goods"", such as access to the countryside and planting meadows. The environment secretary told farmers the government would guarantee subsidies at the current EU level until the 2022 election. There would then be a ""transitional period"" in England. The National Farmers Union said it was time for ""a new deal"" for the UK. Fergus Ewing, the Scottish rural economy secretary, said Mr Gove had left ""too many questions unanswered"". Meanwhile, a report warns Brexit trade deals could threaten UK food security. MPs and peers in the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Agroecology (APPGA) say ministers must ensure farmers are not undermined by future trade deals which permit imports of food produced with lower welfare or environmental standards. Farm subsidies 'must be earned' - Gove Countryside faces 'damaging uncertainty' Five times food fights have had an impact on trade talks Mr Gove, who has promised that standards will not be compromised after Brexit, addressed two farmers' conferences in Oxford on Thursday. His speeches came ahead of the government's agriculture plans being published this spring. Mr Gove outlined plans to farmers in Oxford The current payment system - Â£3bn a year to UK farmers - is based on the amount of land farmers own. Detailing how the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) will be replaced after Brexit, Mr Gove said the CAP was ""unjust"" and ""doesn't really reward efficiency"". The government has agreed to maintain current subsidies for three years after Brexit, until 2022, and Mr Gove said the payments could continue until 2024 but the length of time would be down to ""consultation"". Mr Gove said during that time he aimed to reduce the largest subsidies, with a maximum cap or a sliding scale of reductions. He said there should be a ""smooth path"" towards a new way of paying farmers when EU subsidies ended and that a new method would ""use public money for public goods"". The plans would see farmers rewarded for planting woodland, boosting wildlife, improving water quality and recreating wildflower meadows. The environment secretary said he was ""confident"" about the future of British farming and that Brexit would allow the UK to ""leverage"" the advantages of Britain producing ""the best food in the world"" and ""some of the most innovative farmers in the world"". New trade deals with other countries outside the EU would provide new markets for the ""superb food"" Britain's farmers produce, Mr Gove said. Lib Dem leader Vince Cable said although farmers might take ""some reassurance"" from the announcement of a transition period, the end of that ""could result in a lot of turbulence and a lot distress"". Minette Batters, deputy president of the National Farmers Union, welcomed incentives to protect the environment but said her key concern was over future trade deals. She said: ""We're very proud of our high standards of environmental protection, of welfare, in the UK and we want those to be respected in any trade negotiation and we do not want to see cheaper food produced to lower standards."" Mr Gove's counterpart in Scotland, Mr Ewing, said Mr Gove's speech ""leaves far too many questions unanswered for any comfort to be taken"". He said it did ""not cover a whole variety of vital support schemes"", such as environmental programmes, ""which are crucial to ensure the continued economic well-being of all of Scotland's rural communities"". By Roger Harrabin, environment analyst For many yearsthe government has argued that EU farm policy is wasteful and bad for the environment. It has driven birds out of the countryside, led to soil erosion, and caused the loss of woodlands and wildflower meadows. Over many years, attempts to reform the policy have been resisted by farm unions, especially in France. But Brexit has given Mr Gove the opportunity to produce a farm policy made in Britain. His changes will alarm those farmers who will need to change their whole business model to get subsidies after Brexit. It will be welcomed by some efficient modern farmers who have already accepted that being paid by the public for owning land can't be justified. The changes will impact on the countryside and food production. It's too soon to tell exactly how. Mr Gove's speech comes as theAPPGA report,externalsays post-Brexit trade deals could pose the biggest peacetime threat to the UK's food security. According to the group, the import of cheaper foods that are produced to lower safety and welfare standards could place UK farmers at a disadvantage. ""To compete with these lower prices, domestic farmers could seek to tighten their margins and therefore cut corners with regards to environmental regulations,"" the AAPG said. ""If the UK is unable to protect its farmers from being undermined by lower welfare imports, farmers are likely to resist improvements and may even press for UK standards to be lowered.""

"This video can not be played Pint-sized Ashes: England thwarted after late drama Fifth Ashes Test, Sydney Cricket Ground (day one of five) England 233-5:Root 83, Malan 55*, Cummins 2-44 Australia:Yet to bat Scorecard England lost two wickets in the final two overs of the first day to let Australia back into the fifth Ashes Test in Sydney. In Mitchell Starc's first over with the second new ball, Joe Root clipped to square leg to depart for 83. The next man in, Jonny Bairstow, chose not to use a nightwatchman, only to edge Josh Hazlewood behind to leave England 233-5 at the close. Captain Root had shared a fourth-wicket stand of 133 with Dawid Malan, who remains on 55 not out. England earlier slipped to 95-3 after winning the toss following a delay of more than two hours because of rain. Mark Stoneman, Alastair Cook and James Vince all wasted good starts, the latter pair falling in the space of seven runs after a stand of 60. Following a drawn fourth Test in Melbourne that was played on a lifeless pitch, Sydney has offered true bounce for the batsmen, a hint of seam for the pace bowlers and turn for off-spinner Nathan Lyon - encouraging for debutant Mason Crane, the youngest spinner to play for England in 90 years. Australia, who have already secured the Ashes, gave little away and it was only towards the end of the day that England, chasing a first Test win down under in 10 attempts, looked to be on top of the game. Starc's intervention first left the contest in the balance, before Hazlewood tipped it Australia's way. Risk or reward: Root's conversion woes Podcast: Analysis from the Test Match Special team Listen: Ashes commentary highlights (on loop) Before Root's dismissal, England's chances were rated at 40% and Australia's 27% with the draw 33% Read more: Malan defends 'gutsy' Bairstow How day one unfolded at the SCG Listen: TMS podcast with Ed Smith Catch-up: TMS In Conversation with Adil Ray (Citizen Khan) The dramatic conclusion was the series in microcosm - Australia wresting back the initiative just as England seemed to be gaining control. Root and Malan had steered England from trouble, Malan returning to his position as England's leading runscorer in the series, and Root primed to improve on a conversion rate in which he has only reached three hundreds from his last 19 Test half-centuries. Root made just 17 from the first 50 deliveries he faced but opened up after tea with his most regular methods of scoring - square on the off side and tucks off the pads. Malan was even more circumspect, scoring 18 from his first 73 balls. His watchfulness outside off stump remained throughout, mixed with cover drives and jabs on the leg side. They both had slices of luck - Malan could have been run out in a mix-up, then edged Lyon past home captain Steve Smith at slip when on 34. Meanwhile, Root top-edged Pat Cummins in between two fielders on the leg-side boundary when on 67. With the close in sight, Root loosely turned Starc's third delivery with the new ball on the leg side, and the diving Mitchell Marsh took a smart catch to leave Root crouched on his haunches in disappointment. Seven deliveries later, Hazlewood found Bairstow's edge, which will expose the out-of-form Moeen Ali and England's elongated tail to the new ball when play resumes at the earlier time of 23:00 GMT on Thursday. England's late slip-up was a repeat of what came from the top three when play finally got under way after lunch. Cook, Stoneman and Vince all missed the chance to cash in after doing the hard work - in the case of the latter two, it was another wasted opportunity to make their place in the side more secure. Stoneman, who played club cricket in Sydney and met his wife here, raced to a run-a-ball 24 but tamely fenced a short ball from Cummins to the keeper. Vince once again looked high class, particularly when driving through the off side, only to find another infuriating way to get out, wafting at Cummins to edge behind for 25. Both men have strong cases to be involved inthe two-Test series in New Zealand in March,yet may feel they need significant contributions in the second innings to be absolutely sure of being in the squad that will be named after this match. Former captain Cook, off the back of an unbeaten 244 in the fourth Test, was loose to begin with, but settled down to accumulate 39 until he played across Hazlewood to be given out lbw on review. This is the 10th staging of the Pink Test at the SCG, in aid of the McGrath Foundation On a slow, unresponsive pitch in Melbourne, Australia had been hampered by the absence of pace spearhead Starc, who missed out with a bruised heel. In Sydney, aided by a much more helpful surface, the hosts were more potent for his presence, even if the left-armer was slightly down on pace and the most expensive of the four frontline bowlers. For long periods, Lyon held an end, while the fast bowlers were rotated at the other. The metronomic Hazlewood was the pick of the attack, examining England's techniques with accuracy and a hint of movement off the seam. Cummins got rewards by banging away back of a length. As England scored more freely in the warmth of the evening, Australia looked to have ran out of energy and options, particularly with Starc seeming to indicate a problem with his left calf. But he still took the new ball and made a telling contribution. Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood have taken a combined 40 wickets in the series England assistant coach Paul Farbrace, speaking to TMS:""Dawid Malan has shown his quality throughout this series and Rooty was playing the best innings he's played throughout the series. You could see the disappointment in him. To lose those two wickets in the last five minutes is a massive disappointment. ""It's a very quiet dressing room tonight, because people know how hard Dawid and Rooty worked to get themselves into that position. To see Rooty get out the way he did, he's incredibly disappointed and frustrated. ""He knows he wants to convert more 50s into 100s. It's not something any coach needs to sit him down and say 'do you realise you need to convert more fifties?'"" Former England batsman Ed Smith:""I think it's Australia's day, just by a bit. For much of the day England made a good fist of it but I think those two late wickets will frustrate them. ""The shadow moving across the pitch came in to a difficult zone for the batsmen and it was exactly that moment when Joe Root was out."" Risk or reward?

Mr Gove's speech comes as theAPPGA report,externalsays post-Brexit trade deals could pose the biggest peacetime threat to the UK's food security.

""To compete with these lower prices, domestic farmers could seek to tighten their margins and therefore cut corners with regards to environmental regulations,"" the AAPG said.

"The flight was carrying 324 guests, including two infants Jet Airways has grounded two pilots following reports of a fight inside the cockpit of a flight from London to Mumbai. The Indian airline confirmed that a ""misunderstanding"" occurred between the cockpit crew on the New Year's Day flight. It added that the crew involved had been taken off their flight duties, pending an investigation. The flight, which was carrying 324 passengers, landed safely in Mumbai. According to Indian media reports, quoting witnesses, the incident occurred after the male pilot allegedly slapped the female pilot. The woman left the cockpit in tears, but colleagues eventually persuaded her to go back, reports said. An official at the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) told PTI news agency that the pilot had also left the cockpit unattended twice during the incident, breaking safety regulations. A spokesperson for Jet Airways confirmed to the BBC that an incident had occurred, but did not detail the exact events that took place. The airline added that the incident has been reported to the DGCA, saying that it had ""zero tolerance for any action of its employees that compromises safety"".

"At the busiest times, ambulances - like these at the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan - are getting stuck in long queues More than one in eight patients rushed to hospital in an ambulance this winter has faced a delay of more than 30 minutes on arrival, BBC analysis shows. Patients are meant to be handed over to staff within 15 minutes, but more than 75,000 have waited at least twice as long as that in England. Some of the worst waits had lasted up to five hours, ambulance crews said. Doctors warned the delays put patients at risk, as the prime minister apologised for problems in the NHS. Leah Butler-Smith was with her mother, who she thought was having a stroke, when she was caught in a queue outside Broomfield Hospital in Essex this week. ""We weren't moving. We weren't going anywhere,"" she said. Leah Butler-Smith's mother was stuck in a queue outside an A&E unit Ambulances queuing this week outside Broomfield Hospital in Essex Her mother kept falling in and out of consciousness, while she and her sister tried to keep her spirits up. Ambulances continued arriving, making them scared they would be bumped for more urgent cases. ""It's just gobsmacking,"" Leah said. She said it was too soon to know what affect the delay had had on her mother's health. ""The staff are doing all they can. There just aren't the funds for the beds,"" she said. Dr Ellen Makings, medical director at Mid Essex Services NHS Trust, said she was ""extremely sorry"" for the waits experienced on that day. ""Our staff were working extremely hard to ensure that all patients were safe at all times. ""Whilst it was far from ideal for this patient to have an extended stay in the ambulance she was cared for throughout by experienced paramedics and was assessed by a qualified emergency department sister within 30 minutes of arrival, and then again by an emergency department consultant at one hour 50 minutes."" She added once Leah's mother had been assessed and had a scan it emerged she had not had a stroke. Instead she was diagnosed with a stroke mimic, where a patient presents with stroke-like symptoms but has not actually had one. Operation delays: 'Everything is up in the air' People on beds 'as far as you could see' Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the problems being seen were ""not surprising"". ""A&E units are over-crowded, so staff just cannot take care of these patients and ambulance crews have to stay with them. ""It means they face longer delays for all the assessments they should get. It is a risk, but there is nothing we can do about it."" Figures from Public Health England show there was a sharp rise in hospital admissions in England for confirmed flu cases in the last week of December, and PHE bosses said this was contributing to pressure on the NHS. This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I apologise"" for NHS difficulties The analysis of handover delays by the BBC is based on official NHS figures for 20 November to 31 December. They happen when A&E staff are not available to take care of patients brought in. Some have to wait in the back of ambulances, although many end up in waiting areas and side rooms until nurses and doctors become available. The analysis shows: Across England 75,700 ambulances had to wait over 30 minutes - 13% of the total Of those, nearly 17,000 waited over an hour The East Midlands saw the highest proportion of delays, with 20% of crews waiting over 30 minutes, followed by the East of England, with 18% Most ambulances arriving at one hospital trust - Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust - were delayed by over 30 minutes, with one in five delayed by over 60 Only six out of more than 130 hospital trusts have not had any delays of over 30 minutes Ged Blezard, director of operations of the North West Ambulance Service, said the delays were causing a ""number of problems"" and compromising the safety of patients. ""We are nursing patients in hospital corridors - and that is affecting our ability to respond to patients in the community. It is happening on a daily basis,"" he added. He said there were sometimes between 12 and 15 ambulances queuing outside A&E units, with some of the delays lasting four or five hours. Patients caught up in the problems said they feared for their health during the waits. Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust 53% United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust 45% The Queen Elizabeth Hospital NHS Trust (Norfolk) 38% East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust 34% Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust and The Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust (Essex) 29% Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the figures showed the ""shocking scale of the crisis in the NHS"" and ministers should be ashamed that patients had been ""left languishing"" like this. Prime Minister Theresa May has apologised for the problems being seen. This week NHS bosses announced the cancellation of tens of thousands of non-urgent operations in an attempt to ease the pressure on hospitals. Mrs May said: ""I know it's difficult, I know it's frustrating, I know it's disappointing for people, and I apologise."" Saffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital managers, said the problems showed the ""strain"" the system was under. ""Despite planning more meticulously than ever before, the level of demand for services means severe pressures remain,"" she said.

Problems have also been reported in other parts of the UK. The Welsh government said the health service was facing ""significant pressure"" andthe chief executive of the NHS in Wales apologised to patients whose operations had been postponed. Meanwhile, in Scotlandthere has been a 20% jump in A&E attendances compared with the previous year, prompting an increase in patients waiting more than four hours, and in Northern Ireland the Antrim Area Hospital has had to bring in St John Ambulance volunteers to help with a surge in demand.

"This video can not be played The crash in December 2017 killed six people Australian authorities have recovered most of a seaplane that crashed near Sydney and killed six people. On Sunday, high-profile UK business leader Richard Cousins, four members of his family and a Canadian pilot died when the plane plunged into a river. After days of planning, police used divers and a crane to lift the wreckage in sections from a depth of 13m (40ft). Officials said a crash involving the same plane in 1996 would form part of their wide-ranging investigation. On Thursday, the majority of the De Havilland DHC-2 Beaver - including its fuselage, floats and a wing - was retrieved from the River Hawkesbury about 50km (30 miles) north of Sydney. The crash killed Compass Group chief executive Mr Cousins, 58, his 48-year-old fiancÃ©e, magazine editor Emma Bowden, her 11-year-old daughter Heather, his sons, Edward, 23, and William, 25, and Sydney-based pilot Gareth Morgan, 44. The family, from Tooting, in south-west London, were flying back to Sydney from an exclusive waterfront restaurant in Jerusalem Bay, not far from the crash site. The businessman's brothers, Simon and Andrew Cousins, said on Thursday: ""We are fortunate and thankful for the outpouring of love and support we've received from across the world."" Victims (clockwise from top left) Richard Cousins, Emma Bowden, Will Cousins, Gareth Morgan, Heather Bowden, Ed Cousins ""We are deeply touched by the tributes to Richard, William, Edward, Emma and Heather in the media and throughout the community."" Tributes paid to seaplane crash family The recovery effort, which began at 06:00 local time (19:00 GMT Wednesday), continued late into the day. Police described it as a complex operation, with divers attaching slings to the wreckage amid ""zero visibility"". According to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald, the same plane was involved in an accident that killed a pilot 22 years ago.,external Its wingtip had struck a hill amid gusty conditions ""conducive to windshear and turbulence"" in rural New South Wales, according to an Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) report.,external Investigators said the aircraft was climbing at almost maximum weight when it clipped the ground, sending it into a cartwheel. The crash involved a single-engine DHC-2 Beaver Seaplane The plane was then repaired and cleared to fly again under official safety requirements, the Civil Aviation and Safety Authority told the BBC. It had since flown thousands of trips as a sightseeing plane until the crash on New Year's Eve. ATSB executive director Nat Nagy said a ""number of factors"" were involved in the 1996 crash but it would be examined as part of a thorough investigation into the plane's history. Seaplanes Pilots Association vice-president Kevin Bowe told the Sydney Morning Herald that crashed planes were rebuilt to a condition that was ""often better than new"". ATSB investigators have said they will release a preliminary report in about 30 days. ""The full sequence of events leading up to the accident is not fully understood at this stage,"" Mr Nagy said on Tuesday. Investigators, he added, would rigorously examine the wreckage, gather witness accounts and examine the pilot's flying history, in an effort to learn what happened.

"Police are ""routinely ignoring"" the needs of women detainees on their periods, the Independent Custody Visiting Association (ICVA) has said. The way menstruating suspects are being treated in police detention could be in breach of human rights and equality laws, according to the IVCA, which monitors the treatment of detainees. It called on the home secretary to introduce new guidelines for police. The Home Office said everyone held in custody should be treated with dignity. But the ICVA - which is funded by the Home Office - says women in England and Wales are often held in police cells without access to hygienic sanitary protection or facilities for washing and changing. Many are not able to speak to a female police officer, it adds. One woman, it says, had her clothes removed and was dressed in a paper suit. Despite her having her period, her underwear had been removed and she was refused any sanitary protection. ""She was left in a state of vulnerability sufficient to cause concern for her wellbeing, bleeding in a paper suit, alone in a cell,"" the ICVA said. Sherry Ralph, the organisation's chief operating officer, said that custody suites ""typically only have one absorbency of tampon and towel available"". ""One senior officer described the packs that they have to buy as 'woeful',"" she added. Surviving period poverty with 'socks and tissue' Tampon tax: How much have you spent? Far fewer women are arrested than men. In 2016/17, 119,937 females were arrested in England and and Wales out of a total 779,660 people arrested. The maximum period of detention in custody is four days, with judicial authorisation. For arrests under terrorism legislation, this rises to 14 days. Evidence gathered by the IVCA suggests the problem of sanitary provision is widespread across forces in England and Wales. The IVCA has now written to Home Secretary Amber Rudd, calling on her to take ""swift action"" to resolve the problems. ""No woman or girl should be left in indignity by police officers for want of a difficult conversation or an inexpensive box of tampons,"" the letter reads. A copy of the letter has also been sent to Women and Equalities Minister Justine Greening and David Isaac, chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission. During the booking-in process, women detainees should be asked about their needs in private They should be provided a female officer point of contact A hygiene pack should be offered automatically to all women, with a fresh pack offered after six hours Hand-washing facilities must be available CCTV monitoring should be pixelated or alternative arrangements made to allow women detainees to change in private Where the removal of clothes is necessary due to risk of self-harm, the removal of sanitary protection should be subject to individual risk assessment Dame Vera Baird, Police and Crime Commissioner for Northumbria, called the failure to offer automatic packages to detainees ""lamentable"". ""This must immediately stop and police must revise their process,"" she said, as she urged the home secretary and prime minister to ""ensure action is taken"". The Home Office said it is working with the ICVA and the National Police Chiefs' Council ""to understand where improvements can be made on this issue"".

"Top bosses only need to work 32 hours to earn the median full-time employee salary If you earn an average UK salary, by the end of today a top boss will have earned more than you do all year. In fact, it takes a top chief executive just three days to earn Â£28,758. The day has been declared ""Fat Cat Thursday"" by think tank the High Pay Centre and HR industry body the CIPD, which calculated the figure. The gap between executive pay and the rest of the workforce remains huge despite top bosses' pay dropping by a fifth last year. The average boss of one of the UK's largest 100 listed firms earned Â£4.5m last year, down from Â£5.4m the year before. Reality Check: How big is the pay gap? May accused of backtracking on pay plans Nonetheless, an average chief executive still earns 120 times more than the average full-time worker, according to the High Pay Centre. Its calculation assumes that the executives work 12 hours a day, most weekends and take just 19 days holiday a year. At this rate, it means bosses only need to work 32 hours - taking them to Thursday, assuming they started work on 2 January - to reach the median full-time employee salary. The think tank has made the calculation for the past four years, and High Pay Centre director Stefan Stern said its figures showed there were still ""unjustifiable [pay] gaps between the top and the rest of the workforce"". However, free-market think tank the Adam Smith Institute said it was a ""mistake"" to worry about executive pay. ""Given how important the decisions a CEO makes are to the success of a firm, it would be shocking if they were not extremely well paid,"" said Sam Dumitriu, head of research at the institute. ""The High Pay Centre are wrong to link high pay at the top with low pay at the bottom,"" he added. ""Poorly performing CEOs are bad for shareholders, but worse for workers. ""Politicians should be careful. Bashing CEO pay may sound good on the stump, but if British businesses lose out on top talent to the US and Europe, British workers and savers will pay the price."" From later this year, as part of government reforms, about 900 listed companies will have to publish and justify the pay ratio between their chief executives and their average worker. The Conservatives had promised in their manifesto that executive pay should be approved by an annual vote of shareholders. However, the new measures instead propose that those public companies who face a shareholder revolt on pay will be named on a register overseen by the Investment Association. A Business Department spokesman said the new rules would ensure ""that the UK remains one of the best places in the world to work, invest and do business.""

According to Indian media reports, quoting witnesses, the incident occurred after the male pilot allegedly slapped the female pilot. The woman left the cockpit in tears, but colleagues eventually persuaded her to go back, reports said. An official at the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) told PTI news agency that the pilot had also left the cockpit unattended twice during the incident, breaking safety regulations. A spokesperson for Jet Airways confirmed to the BBC that an incident had occurred, but did not detail the exact events that took place.

"MPs say imports of food produced with lower welfare standards should not be allowed Plans for the way farming subsidies will be dealt with after Brexit have been set out by Michael Gove. Farmers will receive payments for ""public goods"", such as access to the countryside and planting meadows. The environment secretary told farmers the government would guarantee subsidies at the current EU level until the 2022 election. There would then be a ""transitional period"" in England. The National Farmers Union said it was time for ""a new deal"" for the UK. Fergus Ewing, the Scottish rural economy secretary, said Mr Gove had left ""too many questions unanswered"". Meanwhile, a report warns Brexit trade deals could threaten UK food security. MPs and peers in the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Agroecology (APPGA) say ministers must ensure farmers are not undermined by future trade deals which permit imports of food produced with lower welfare or environmental standards. Farm subsidies 'must be earned' - Gove Countryside faces 'damaging uncertainty' Five times food fights have had an impact on trade talks Mr Gove, who has promised that standards will not be compromised after Brexit, addressed two farmers' conferences in Oxford on Thursday. His speeches came ahead of the government's agriculture plans being published this spring. Mr Gove outlined plans to farmers in Oxford The current payment system - Â£3bn a year to UK farmers - is based on the amount of land farmers own. Detailing how the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) will be replaced after Brexit, Mr Gove said the CAP was ""unjust"" and ""doesn't really reward efficiency"". The government has agreed to maintain current subsidies for three years after Brexit, until 2022, and Mr Gove said the payments could continue until 2024 but the length of time would be down to ""consultation"". Mr Gove said during that time he aimed to reduce the largest subsidies, with a maximum cap or a sliding scale of reductions. He said there should be a ""smooth path"" towards a new way of paying farmers when EU subsidies ended and that a new method would ""use public money for public goods"". The plans would see farmers rewarded for planting woodland, boosting wildlife, improving water quality and recreating wildflower meadows. The environment secretary said he was ""confident"" about the future of British farming and that Brexit would allow the UK to ""leverage"" the advantages of Britain producing ""the best food in the world"" and ""some of the most innovative farmers in the world"". New trade deals with other countries outside the EU would provide new markets for the ""superb food"" Britain's farmers produce, Mr Gove said. Lib Dem leader Vince Cable said although farmers might take ""some reassurance"" from the announcement of a transition period, the end of that ""could result in a lot of turbulence and a lot distress"". Minette Batters, deputy president of the National Farmers Union, welcomed incentives to protect the environment but said her key concern was over future trade deals. She said: ""We're very proud of our high standards of environmental protection, of welfare, in the UK and we want those to be respected in any trade negotiation and we do not want to see cheaper food produced to lower standards."" Mr Gove's counterpart in Scotland, Mr Ewing, said Mr Gove's speech ""leaves far too many questions unanswered for any comfort to be taken"". He said it did ""not cover a whole variety of vital support schemes"", such as environmental programmes, ""which are crucial to ensure the continued economic well-being of all of Scotland's rural communities"". By Roger Harrabin, environment analyst For many yearsthe government has argued that EU farm policy is wasteful and bad for the environment. It has driven birds out of the countryside, led to soil erosion, and caused the loss of woodlands and wildflower meadows. Over many years, attempts to reform the policy have been resisted by farm unions, especially in France. But Brexit has given Mr Gove the opportunity to produce a farm policy made in Britain. His changes will alarm those farmers who will need to change their whole business model to get subsidies after Brexit. It will be welcomed by some efficient modern farmers who have already accepted that being paid by the public for owning land can't be justified. The changes will impact on the countryside and food production. It's too soon to tell exactly how. Mr Gove's speech comes as theAPPGA report,externalsays post-Brexit trade deals could pose the biggest peacetime threat to the UK's food security. According to the group, the import of cheaper foods that are produced to lower safety and welfare standards could place UK farmers at a disadvantage. ""To compete with these lower prices, domestic farmers could seek to tighten their margins and therefore cut corners with regards to environmental regulations,"" the AAPG said. ""If the UK is unable to protect its farmers from being undermined by lower welfare imports, farmers are likely to resist improvements and may even press for UK standards to be lowered.""

"Tech firms are working to fix two major bugs in computer chips that could allow hackers to steal sensitive data. The bugs are an ""absolute disaster"" and need to be fixed promptly, according to one cyber-security researcher. Google researchers said one of the ""serious security flaws"",external, dubbed ""Spectre"", was found in chips made by Intel, AMD and ARM. The other, known as ""Meltdown"" affects Intel-made chips andone recent ARM chip,external. The industry has been aware of the problem for months and hoped to solve it before details were made public. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said there was no evidence that the vulnerability had been exploited. It has issuedguidance about Meltdown and Spectre,external, including advice on what people can do to protect themselves. According to the researchers who found the bugs, chips dating as far back as 1995 have been affected. Some fixes, in the form of software updates known as patches, have been introduced or will be available in the next few days, said Intel, which provides chips to about 80% of desktop computers and 90% of laptops worldwide. ""These bugs are an absolute disaster,"" said Matthew Hickey, a cyber-security expert at Hacker House. While some computers can be patched quickly, others faced a longer wait, he explained, giving virtual hosting systems as one example. ""You may find that patches aren't yet available,"" he told the BBC. Millions of computers contain Intel chips Microchips are the basic electronic systems behind many devices such as computers and mobile phones. In order to do their work, they must move data around, using different types of memory to temporarily store it. In many cases, that information is supposed to be secure from attempts to snoop on it, but these two bugs mean that it could in fact be accessed by a third party. The first reports suggested that a bug affected solely chips made by Intel, but it has since emerged that a separate flaw, Spectre, has been found in Intel, ARM and AMD chips. ""Many types of computing devices - with many different vendors' processors and operating systems - are susceptible to these exploits,"" said Intel. ARM said patches had already been shared with its customers, which include many smartphone manufacturers. AMD said it believed there was ""near zero risk to AMD products at this time"". On a conference call for investors, Intel said researchers had shown that hackers could exploit the Meltdown vulnerability, gaining the ability to read memory and potentially access information such as passwords or encryption keys on devices. Microsoft, which uses Intel chips said it would roll out security updates on Thursday, adding it had no information suggesting any data had been compromised. Apple's latest macOS, version 10.13.2, is safe from the Meltdown bug and the firm is working on updates for earlier versions of the operating system on its laptops and desktops. Computer chip scare: What you need to know As for Spectre, however, experts believe that it will not be possible to patch it directly, but various software tweaks could help stop it being exploited. Googlepublished a blog detailing what some customers may need to do.,externalIt said Android phones with the latest security updates were protected, and that Gmail was safe. It will be releasing security patches for users of older Chromebooks, while there will also be a fix for users of the Chrome web browser. The NCSC said it was aware of the reports of the potential flaw and advised that all organisations and home users ""continue to protect their systems from threats by installing patches as soon as they become available."" When asked whether hackers will make use of the bugs to attack computers, experts advised caution on the issue. ""It is significant but whether it will be exploited widely is another matter,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey.

"Department store chain Debenhams' shares have sunk 15% after it warned that annual profits would be lower than expected because of disappointing trading over the key Christmas period. The retailer said underlying pre-tax profits were now likely to be between Â£55m and Â£65m this year. Analysts had been expecting profits to be about Â£83m. Like-for-like sales in the UK fell 2.6% in the 17 weeks to 30 December amid a ""volatile and competitive"" market. Debenhams said,externaltrading had improved over the six-week Christmas period thanks to discounting, with like-for-like sales up 1.2% during that time, but the first week of the post-Christmas sale was worse than expected. ""The market has been challenging and particularly promotional in some of our key seasonal categories and we have responded in order to remain competitive for our customers, which has impacted our profit performance,"" said Debenhams chief executive Sergio Bucher. Shares in the retailer dived 20% in early trade, before recovering slightly by lunchtime to stand 15% lower at about 30p. The retailer said it was ""accelerating some aspects"" of its strategic plan, Debenhams Redesigned, in order to ""deliver a long-term sustainable future"". It said early signs from new store format trials in Stevenage and Wolverhampton were ""promising"". Debenhams added that ""reorganisation and restructuring activity"" and a review of central costs were expected to generate savings of Â£20m. It said there had been ""positive momentum in digital sales growth"", with smartphone demand up 36% year-on-year following improvements to its mobile site. However, Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Strong growth for its digital offering has failed to save Debenhams from a miserable end to the year. ""Customers turned out for Christmas, but refused to put their hands in their pockets in the lead-up to the festive period, or indeed the Boxing Day sales. ""Debenhams has been forced to cut prices to persuade shoppers to part with their cash, and as a result, margins have been squeezed, profits have been significantly downgraded and the share price has taken a massive hit."" Sofie Willmott, senior retail analyst at GlobalData, said: ""Given the barrage of discounted products available in the lead-up to Christmas, including Black Friday, it's no surprise that Debenhams' end-of-season sale produced disappointing results, despite 'further markdown investment'. ""Discerning consumers with squeezed budgets are looking for value for money and by constantly reducing the price of goods, Debenhams is damaging customer perception of value, discouraging shoppers to buy from the retailer."" With hundreds of stores in expensive locations and with a constant squeeze on the average shoppers' spending power, Debenhams is caught in a classic bind. Online and discount retailers are attracting increasing amounts of spending power and Debenhams is in a constant race to adapt quickly enough to a rapidly changing retail market. So it slashes prices to attract sales in the run-up to Christmas, hardly a sign of confidence or strength, while accelerating cost savings and trying to roll out new outlets and improve its online offering. Shareholders seem unimpressed and worried that Debenhams is trying to run faster and faster to catch up and yet appears still to be falling behind  younger and more flexible competitors. Debenhams is the UK's second-biggest department store operator and has 240 stores in 27 countries. Its current fortunes contrast sharply with those of clothing retailer Next, which surprised the markets on Wednesday byraising its profit forecast. Next said annual profits were expected to rise by Â£8m to Â£725m after cold weather boosted trade ahead of Christmas, sending full-price sales up 1.5% - far better than the 0.3% fall it had expected.

"This video can not be played Tony Blair says a claim he warned Donald Trump's aides UK spied is a 'complete fabrication' A claim that Tony Blair warned Donald Trump's aides UK intelligence may have spied on him is ""a complete fabrication"", the former PM has said. A new book says Mr Blair had shared a ""juicy rumour"" with the son-in-law of the US president, Jared Kushner, that campaign staff, ""possibly even Trump himself"", had been under surveillance. He is said to have been ""angling"" for a post-election Middle East adviser role. Mr Blair's office said the allegations were ""absurd"" and ""simply untrue"". The former UK prime minister told BBC Radio 4's programme: ""I have never had such conversations in the White House or outside of the White House, with Jared Kushner or with anybody else."" He said he had met Mr Kushner and had discussed the Middle East peace process with him but ""I wasn't angling for some job"". ""I have absolutely no desire for an official position was never offered one, don't want one,"" he added. He said the claim was ""a reflection of the crazy state of modern politics"". The account of an alleged meeting between Mr Blair, Mr Kushner and a senior aide at the White House in February 2017, the month after the presidential inauguration, is contained in the book by journalist Michael Wolff andreported in the Times,external. 10 explosive claims from new Trump book Ex-aide Bannon has lost his mind - Trump Who was Donald Trump's chief strategist? According to Mr Wolff's account, in Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, Mr Blair shared the rumour that, during the election, British intelligence ""had had the Trump campaign staff under surveillance, monitoring its telephone calls and other communications"". The former PM is reported to have given the impression that Barack Obama's administration had hinted that such surveillance would be helpful. Last March the US TV channel Fox News carried an unsubstantiated claim that UK intelligence services could have been involved in an alleged spying operation on Trump Tower in New York. The allegation was repeated by the then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer, promptinga rare on-the-record response from Britain's intelligence chiefs. The UK's spy agency GCHQ said the claims ""should be ignored, describing them as ""nonsense"" and ""utterly ridiculous"". The meeting between Jared Kushner and Tony Blair is reported to have taken place in February last year Meanwhile, Mr Trump has disavowed his former aide Steve Bannon, saying he ""lost his mind"" after he lost his job, It follows reported comments from Mr Bannon in the book in which he describes a meeting between the president's son,  Donald Trump Jr, and a group of Russians, as ""treasonous"" and ""unpatriotic"". The Senate, House of Representatives and a US Department of Justice team led by special counsel Robert Mueller are investigating alleged Russian interference in the presidential election and alleged attempts to undermine Hillary Clinton. The claims have been denied both by the Kremlin and Mr Trump. The president has also vehemently denied any collusion with Russia. Mr Trump's lawyers have sent a cease-and-desist letter to Mr Bannon, US media reports said. On Wednesday White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders described Mr Wolff's book as ""filled with false and misleading accounts from individuals who have no access or influence with the White House"".

Steve Bannon left his White House post in August By Jon Sopel, BBC North America editor It's not unusual for former political allies to fall out. It happens all the time. But normally it's done in private, and maybe hinted at in public. Not this time. Not with this President. This is a vicious knife fight between Donald Trump and his former campaign chief and White House Chief strategist being played out across social media.

"Former White House aide Steve Bannon ""lost his mind"" after he lost his job, US President Donald Trump has said. The president disavowed Mr Bannon after he was quoted in a new book describing a meeting between Mr Trump's son and a group of Russians as ""treasonous"". The Russians had offered Donald Trump Jr damaging information on Hillary Clinton at the June 2016 meeting. Mr Trump's lawyers have sent a cease-and-desist letter to Mr Bannon, US media reports said. ""Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind,"" Mr Trump said in a statement on Wednesday. 10 explosive claims from new Trump book Trump Bannon: A knife fight with consequences ""Steve was a staffer who worked for me after I had already won the nomination by defeating seventeen candidates, often described as the most talented field ever assembled in the Republican party,"" he continued. ""Now that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn't as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country."" Mr Trump's lawyers saidMr Bannon had broken his employment agreement,externalby speaking to the book's author Michael Wolff about Mr Trump and his family, ""disclosing confidential information"" and ""making disparaging statements and in some cases outright defamatory statements to Mr Wolff about Mr Trump, his family members, and the Company,"" the letter said, according to the Washington Post newspaper. This video can not be played Steve Bannon's three goals for the Trump presidency Mr Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, was considered a key player in the Trump White House and helped shape Mr Trump's  ""America First"" campaign message before he left his post in August. He returned to his role as the head of the right-wing Breitbart News website, where he said he planned to help Mr Trump's administration as a ""wingman outside"". Mr Trump reportedly spoke to Mr Bannon as recently as 13 December, the day of the special US Senate election in Alabama that saw the defeat of Republican Roy Moore, whom Mr Bannon supported. The president's comments came hours after the explosive new book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, revealed that Mr Bannon called Mr Trump Jr's meeting ""treasonous"" and ""unpatriotic"". How Trump cooled on Bannon Speaking to the author, Mr Bannon said of the investigation into whether there was any collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign: ""They're going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV."" Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Donald Trump swept to the presidency in part on the back of Steve Bannon and his Breitbart conservative media empire. Now we will see how he fares when he's at war with them. The president's blistering reply to Mr Bannon's comments appears to indicate that the bridge between the politician and his ideological spirit guide has been reduced to cinders. But how will Mr Trump's legion of supporters react? It is never wise to underestimate their dedication to the man himself, above all else. No matter the outcome of this coming battle, this has to be viewed as a devastating failure for Mr Bannon personally. After spending years advocating for an anti-establishment conservative populism, he finally had a seat in the halls of power. He said in early 2017 that his goal was nothing short of the ""deconstruction of the administrative state"". Now he is on the outside again, besieged by long-time antagonists and former allies. His president recently signed a tax bill embraced by corporate interests. His first post-2016 foray into elective politics, the Alabama Senate race, ended in humiliating defeat. Perhaps, given all this, the Bannon-Trump feud was as inevitable as it is certain to be vicious. Emails show Mr Trump Jr agreed to meet Russian associates in June 2016 on the premise that they had damaging information against his father's Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. The meeting was also attended by Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and aide, and then campaign chairman Paul Manafort. This video can not be played White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders explains why Mr Trump rounded on his former adviser Steve Bannon Mr Bannon reportedly told Mr Wolff that the three senior campaign officials ""should have called the FBI immediately"" after the meeting, according to US media reports.

Donald Trump has fired back in the way only he knows how. He has met fire with fire, accusing Bannon of having lost his mind, of not being that influential, of being a pretender. Lost his mind. Wow. So much for the spat. Does it matter? Well yes it does. Mr Mueller's team is investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the election To anyone who will listen, Trump and his supporters have insisted vociferously, angrily, indignantly that there is no evidence there was collusion. In onerecent interview with the New York Times,externalconducted over the New Year at Mar-a-Lago, Trump raised the subject again and again and again, denying collusion 16 times. Bannon's comments won't alter the course of the Mueller investigation - his team is quietly getting on with its investigation and following where the evidence takes them - remember there have already been three people charged in connection with this. But it matters in the war of words on social media. The narrative of Trump fidelis is that this is a 'nothingburger', or to change my food metaphor, sour grapes from the Democrats after their shock election defeat. Russia: The 'cloud' over the Trump White House Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Some ideological outriders have been saying that what the president should do is fire the special counsel, and bring his existentially threatening investigation to an end. But how much more difficult is that propaganda battle now to wage, when one of the principal actors from the Trump campaign, and the first six months of the Trump presidency talks openly and on the record about treasonous and unpatriotic behaviour. President Trump boards Air Force One with his then top aide, Steve Bannon The firing of Bannon last August the president did with a heavy heart. But it seems that hell hath no fury like a Bannon scorned. Or as President Johnson noted when dealing with the troublesome J Edgar Hoover in the 1960s - better to have him inside the tent pissing out than outside pissing in. Bannon is outside, and taking careful aim. How Trump cooled on Bannon But if the Bannon accusations are damaging (and they are), there is one aspect of this which will be causing quiet delight in the White House. If you cast your mind back to the summer, the appointment of General John Kelly (and the firing of Bannon) was meant to mark the moment when discipline was imposed on an unruly, freewheeling, chaotic administration. There would be a chain of command. Order. Discipline. Systems. Well Steve Bannon was gone, true; but he was still an important voice in the president's ear. Remember this iron law of governing. It doesn't matter what a person's job title is, it is what proximity they have to the centre of power. Bannon was on the outside, but he was still a source of counsel. Now he is not just on the outside, he is in outer darkness. This video can not be played Steve Bannon's three goals for the Trump presidency So what is Steve Bannon's next move? Well I make one confident prediction: it won't be to roll up his tent, pack his knapsack and skulk away with his head drooping. Bannon is campaigning to tear down the Republican establishment, and in Breitbart News he has a fairly formidable weapon with which to wage his war. Bannon wants candidates in this year's mid term election who will threaten the existing Republican leadership, who will follow the populist, nationalist policies that led Donald Trump to election victory in 2016. You have two men now violently fighting it out for the hearts and minds of the Americans who propelled Donald Trump to victory. When I came to work this morning I thought nothing would or could eclipse Donald Trump's tweet about Kim Jong-un. But now it seems that Mr Bannon and President Trump are locked in a battle over who's got the bigger button and whose is most powerful. Next move, Steve Bannon. And this is so much less life-threatening than real nuclear war.

"Mr Trump sits at the White House Resolute Desk in the Oval Office Donald Trump was ""befuddled"" by his election win, did not enjoy his inauguration and was scared of the White House, according to a new book. Journalist Michael Wolff's Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House also purports to lift the lid on Ivanka Trump's secret presidential ambitions. The book details Mr Trump's regard for media titan Rupert Murdoch, though the admiration was apparently not mutual. The White House said the book was full of ""false and misleading accounts"". Michael Wolff says his work is based on more than 200 interviews and that he took up ""something like a semi-permanent seat on a couch in the West Wing"" following the president's inauguration for a close-up insight into the fledgling administration. Here are 11 of the book's revelations, with commentary from the BBC's Anthony Zurcher. According to the book, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon thought a meeting between Donald Trump Jr and a group of Russians was ""treasonous"". The Russians had offered Donald Trump Jr damaging information on Hillary Clinton at the June 2016 meeting. This video can not be played White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders explains why Mr Trump rounded on his former adviser Steve Bannon Wolff writes that Bannon told him of the meeting: ""The three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor - with no lawyers. They didn't have any lawyers. Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad s***, and I happen to think it's all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately."" Bannon reportedly said the Justice Department investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Moscow would focus on money laundering, adding: ""They're going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV."" Anthony Zurcher:In just a few sentences, Bannon manages to detonate a bomb under the White House's efforts to downplay the significance of that fateful June meeting in Trump Tower and their attempt to dismiss Robert Mueller's inquiry as a partisan witchhunt. It's bad, Bannon is saying, and even more unforgivably it was stupid. Taking aim at Mr Trump's own family in the most personal terms makes it all the more biting. In an article for NYMag,externaladapted from his book, Wolff describes the amazement - and dismay - in the Trump camp at his November 2016 election win. ""Shortly after 8pm on Election Night, when the unexpected trend - Trump might actually win - seemed confirmed, Don Jr told a friend that his father, or DJT, as he calls him, looked as if he had seen a ghost. Melania was in tears - and not of joy. There was, in the space of little more than an hour, in Steve Bannon's not unamused observation, a befuddled Trump morphing into a disbelieving Trump and then into a horrified Trump. But still to come was the final transformation: Suddenly, Donald Trump became a man who believed that he deserved to be, and was wholly capable of being, the president of the United States."" AZ:This is decidedly different from what has been recited by the Trump circle since election night. While campaign hands - at least the less-than-dedicated ones - may have been positioning themselves for a soft landing after a defeat, Mr Trump and his close allies believed in their success. A ""horrified Trump"" was never part of the script. The president and first lady Wolff writes: ""Trump did not enjoy his own inauguration. He was angry that A-level stars had snubbed the event, disgruntled with the accommodations at Blair House, and visibly fighting with his wife, who seemed on the verge of tears. Throughout the day, he wore what some around him had taken to calling his golf face: angry and pissed off, shoulders hunched, arms swinging, brow furled, lips pursed."" But the first lady's office rejected the claims. Communications director Stephanie Grisham said in a statement: ""Mrs Trump supported her husband's decision to run for President and in fact, encouraged him to do so. She was confident he would win and was very happy when he did."" AZ:These words tell the same story as the viral video clip of a stone-faced Melania forcing a smile when the president looks her way. It also explains why Mr Trump was so insistent about the success of his inauguration and the size of his crowds. He felt slighted and aggrieved and was acting accordingly. According to another excerpt from the book, obtained by US media, Mr Trump used to boast that sleeping with his friends' wives made ""life worth living"". ""In pursuing a friend's wife, he would try to persuade the wife that her husband was perhaps not what she thought,""Wolff quotes a Trump friend as saying. He would invite the wife to secretly listen on speakerphone to a conversation that Mr Trump would have in his office with her husband, according to the book. Mr Trump would allegedly engage in sexual banter with the husband in the hope that he might say something indiscreet, asking questions such as:""Do you still like having sex with your wife? How often?"" Wolff writes: ""Trump, in fact, found the White House to be vexing and even a little scary. He retreated to his own bedroom - the first time since the Kennedy White House that a presidential couple had maintained separate rooms. In the first days, he ordered two television screens in addition to the one already there, and a lock on the door, precipitating a brief standoff with the Secret Service, who insisted they have access to the room."" AZ:For much of his adult life, Mr Trump has lived according to his own rules, as a real-estate tycoon whose wealth allowed his every whim or idiosyncrasy to be accommodated. Adjusting to the White House - which Bill Clinton once referred to as the ""crown jewel of the federal penitentiary system"" and Harry Truman called ""the great white jail"" - must have been quite a shock. Mr Trump's daughter and her husband Jared Kushner allegedly struck a deal that she might run for president in future, according to Wolff: Mr Trump pats his pregnant daughter Ivanka during his 2016 campaign ""Balancing risk against reward, both Jared and Ivanka decided to accept roles in the West Wing over the advice of almost everyone they knew. It was a joint decision by the couple, and, in some sense, a joint job. Between themselves, the two had made an earnest deal: If sometime in the future the opportunity arose, she'd be the one to run for president. The first woman president, Ivanka entertained, would not be Hillary Clinton; it would be Ivanka Trump. Bannon, who had coined the term 'Jarvanka' that was now in ever greater use in the White House, was horrified when the couple's deal was reported to him."" AZ:The feud between Bannon and ""Jarvanka"" was no secret, and it certainly wasn't surprising. In a way, the couple represented to Bannon everything he's fighting against - East Coast elitism and entitlement. Yet, thanks to familial ties, they had the president's ear and - this new book claims - harboured dynastic hopes. The US first daughter poked fun at her father's alleged ""scalp-reduction surgery"", according to the book. ""She treated her father with a degree of detachment, even irony, going so far as to make fun of his comb-over to others. She often described the mechanics behind it to friends: an absolutely clean pate - a contained island after scalp-reduction -surgery - surrounded by a furry circle of hair around the sides and front, from which all ends are drawn up to meet in the center and then swept back and secured by a stiffening spray. The color, she would point out to comical effect, was from a product called Just for Men - the longer it was left on, the darker it got. Impatience resulted in Trump's orange-blond hair color."" AZ:It wouldn't be particularly surprising if this is one of the anecdotes that Mr Trump finds most irksome. The president is proud of his hair, and once notably let late-night host Jimmy Fallon ruffle it to establish its authenticity. On windy days, Mr Trump usually wears a hat - the origin of the Make America Great Again ball cap - to ensure there are no coiffing malfunctions. The hair is as much a part of the Trump brand as big hotels and gold-plated escalators. Katie Walsh, the White House deputy chief of staff, asked Mr Kushner, the president's senior adviser, what the administration wanted to achieve. But according to the book, Mr Kushner did not have an answer. ""'Just give me the three things the president wants to focus on,' she [Katie Walsh] demanded. 'What are the three priorities of this White House?' It was the most basic question imaginable - one that any qualified presidential candidate would have answered long before he took up residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Six weeks into Trump's presidency, Kushner was wholly without an answer. 'Yes,' he said to Walsh. 'We should probably have that conversation.'"" AZ:It often takes a new administration a bit of time to find its footing. In Mr Trump's case, the situation was particularly acute. Having campaigned on some clear policy items - strengthened borders, renegotiated trade deals, a sweeping tax cut and Obamacare repeal - prioritising was clearly a challenge. Once in the White House, he allowed Congress to kick off with healthcare reform, and the difficulties achieving that goal haunted the Trump presidency for nearly a year. Wolff, who previously wrote a biography of Rupert Murdoch, describes Mr Trump's high regard for the News Corp media titan. ""Rupert Murdoch, who had promised to pay a call on the president-elect, was running late. When some of the guests made a move to leave, an increasingly agitated Trump assured them that Rupert was on his way. 'He's one of the greats, the last of the greats,' Trump said. 'You have to stay to see him.' Not grasping that he was now the most powerful man in the world, Trump was still trying mightily to curry favor with a media mogul who had long disdained him as a charlatan and fool."" AZ:During the campaign, Mr Trump had at times feuded with Murdoch's Fox News - fighting with presenter Megyn Kelly, boycotting the network and skipping a Fox-broadcast primary debate. The president, however, is one of Fox News' biggest fans - and the network has become his greatest advocate since his inauguration. Mr Trump is said to regularly speak with Mr Murdoch on the phone But the admiration was not mutual, according to Wolff's account of a call between Mr Murdoch and Mr Trump about the president's meeting with Silicon Valley executives. Mr Trump is said to have told Mr Murdoch: ""'These guys really need my help. Obama was not very favorable to them, too much regulation. This is really an opportunity for me to help them.' 'Donald,' said Murdoch, 'for eight years these guys had Obama in their pocket. They practically ran the administration. They don't need your help.' 'Take this H-1B visa issue. They really need these H-1B visas.'Murdoch suggested that taking a liberal approach to H-1B visas, which open America's doors to select immigrants, might be hard to square with his promises to build a wall and close the borders. But Trump seemed unconcerned, assuring Murdoch, 'We'll figure it out.' 'What a f****** idiot,' said Murdoch, shrugging, as he got off the phone."" AZ:There's sometimes been a disconnect between Mr Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric and his action as a businessman, where his companies often relied on immigrant labour. Perhaps the president-elect was reflecting his business sensibilities. Or maybe, in this case, he was simply echoing the opinion of the last group of people who had met with him - a criticism that has been lobbed his way on more than one occasion. Michael Flynn emerges from a plea hearing in a Washington DC courtroom Former US National Security Adviser Mike Flynn knew that accepting money from Moscow for a speech could come back to haunt him, according to the book. Wolff writes that before the election Mr Flynn ""had been told by friends that it had not been a good idea to take $45,000 from the Russians for a speech. 'Well it would only be a problem if we won,' he assured them."" Mr Flynn has been indicted in the Justice Department special counsel's inquiry. AZ:Like Paul Manafort, Flynn was one of the members of the Trump campaign's inner circle whose prior affairs were not ordered in a way that would, shall we say, stand up to close legal scrutiny. If Mr Trump had been defeated, that probably wouldn't have mattered. Like the protagonists in the film The Producers, however, their success was their undoing. Russia-Trump: Who's who?

A skier died in the French Alps and 15 others were injured elsewhere in the country, four of them seriously. Two people were killed when they were swept away by a huge wave on Spain's northern Basque coast. The storm, which hit most of northern Europe after battering the UK, has also cut power to tens of thousands of homes and affected transport. Winds reached up to 100mph (160km/h) in the UK and 147km/h (90mph) in France. Storm Eleanor is the UK's fifth named storm of the season. Storm Eleanor disruption and homes without power in UK In pictures: Storm Eleanor hits the UK In northern France, the storm cut power to more than 200,000 households and Eleanor is set to move to other regions throughout the day, including Corsica. Air travel was also disrupted in the capital, Paris, and in the east of the country. In Paris, the Eiffel Tower was closed because of the strong winds. The city's parks have also been closed until the storm dies down because of worries over falling tree branches. A skier was killed by a falling tree in Morillon, in the Haute-Savoie region of eastern France.

Switzerland has also been badly hit, with some 14,000 homes without power, and several injured after a train was blown off its tracks. The high winds left several people stranded in a ski lift in St Gallen canton, overturned a light airplane in Stans and snapped the 13m (42ft) high Christmas tree in the capital Bern, Reuters news agency reports. Meanwhile, record wind gusts of 195km/h (122mph) were recorded on Pilatus Peak near the Swiss city of Lucerne, broadcaster SRF reported. Waves pound the seafront in Auderville, Normandy Belgium was put on ""orange"" alert, the third of four warning levels, with officials urging people to be cautious when going out because of tree branches and other flying objects. In the Netherlands, gusts of more than 110km/h (68mph) were recorded as hundreds of flights were cancelled at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport. One person was hit by a falling tree, and several main roads and train lines were also closed. Dutch authorities have, for the first time, shut all five major sea barriers to prevent flooding, as large areas of the country are below sea level. A car drives along a flooded road in Merseyside, UK In the UK thousands of homes are without power and travel has been disrupted after Storm Eleanor hit there. The Met Office recorded gusts reaching 100mph (160km/h) overnight on Wednesday with a weather yellow warning still in place for Wales, England, most of Northern Ireland and parts of southern Scotland.

"The rapid increase in the living wage could mean that more jobs are replaced by robots, the Institute of Fiscal Studies has warned. The think tank said with the hourly rate set to top Â£8.50 per hour by 2020, more jobs may be at risk of automation. Firms are more likely to invest in robots and computerised systems if the alternative is more expensive labour. Report author Agnes Norris Keiller said ""beyond some point a higher minimum must start affecting employment"". ""We do not know where that point is. ""The fact there seemed to be a negligible employment impact of a minimum [wage] at Â£6.70 per hour - the 2015 rate - does not mean the same will be true of the rate of over Â£8.50 per hour that is set to apply in 2020,"" the research economist at the IFS added. The IFS makes the point that if the living wage was set at Â£100 an hour, for instance, then clearly a vast number of people would be priced out of the labour market. Of course, the think tank is stretching reality towards the absurd to make a point - but the underlying economic theory still holds. A minimum wage that is ""too high"" could affect the very people it is supposed to help. ""The fact the higher minimum will increasingly affect jobs that appear to be more automatable is an additional reason why extremely careful monitoring is required,"" Ms Norris Keiller said. ""Even higher rates, as proposed for example by the Labour Party, would bring even more employees in more automatable jobs into the minimum wage net."" Hotel cleaning jobs are not easily automated The IFS said that in 2015 the minimum wage was mostly paid to people in lower wage personal service sector jobs such as hotel cleaning or nursery working. Such jobs are not easy to automate. But as the living wage rises faster than average earnings, more people are paid at that level. In 2015, 4% of people aged 25 or over were on the living wage. That is set to reach 12% by 2020. And will increasingly include jobs - such as retail cashiers and bank clerks - which are more susceptible to being replaced by computerised systems. The then chancellor, George Osborne, introduced the ""National Living Wage"" with a political flourish in his 2015 Budget. He announced the new scheme would start at Â£7.20 an hour for the over-25s and rise to Â£9 an hour by 2020. It replaced the Â£6.50 an hour minimum wage. Mr Osborne said that ""Britain deserves a pay rise and Britain is getting a pay rise"". And, the government points out, the present living wage should be seen alongside record employment levels. A spokesman said: ""The National Living Wage is creating a stronger economy and a fairer society, having delivered the fastest pay rise for the lowest earners in 20 years. ""But we also want to create highly-skilled, well-paid jobs for the future backing innovation and supporting the development of new skills through our Industrial Strategy."" Whatever the employment risk level of the living wage, we do not appear to have hit it. And there have been plenty of warnings before about the minimum wage leading to unemployment which have been wrong. Labour, not to be outdone on living wage levels, said in its 2017 election manifesto that it would increase the wage rate to Â£10 an hour. Rebecca Long Bailey,  Labour's shadow secretary of state for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said ""technological change, if harnessed effectively, could bring about immense benefits"". ""All workers should be paid a full and fair wage. Higher wages, good jobs, greater investment in skills and technology to boost productivity and high employment all go together. They are complements, not trade-offs,"" she added. The problem is, according to the IFS, there is not a simple relationship between supporting high paid jobs and increasing the living wage. We might all want a high paid, high skilled economy. But that can take decades to deliver. Increase the living wage too quickly in the meantime and higher levels of unemployment could be the result.

"This video can not be played The crash in December 2017 killed six people Australian authorities have recovered most of a seaplane that crashed near Sydney and killed six people. On Sunday, high-profile UK business leader Richard Cousins, four members of his family and a Canadian pilot died when the plane plunged into a river. After days of planning, police used divers and a crane to lift the wreckage in sections from a depth of 13m (40ft). Officials said a crash involving the same plane in 1996 would form part of their wide-ranging investigation. On Thursday, the majority of the De Havilland DHC-2 Beaver - including its fuselage, floats and a wing - was retrieved from the River Hawkesbury about 50km (30 miles) north of Sydney. The crash killed Compass Group chief executive Mr Cousins, 58, his 48-year-old fiancÃ©e, magazine editor Emma Bowden, her 11-year-old daughter Heather, his sons, Edward, 23, and William, 25, and Sydney-based pilot Gareth Morgan, 44. The family, from Tooting, in south-west London, were flying back to Sydney from an exclusive waterfront restaurant in Jerusalem Bay, not far from the crash site. The businessman's brothers, Simon and Andrew Cousins, said on Thursday: ""We are fortunate and thankful for the outpouring of love and support we've received from across the world."" Victims (clockwise from top left) Richard Cousins, Emma Bowden, Will Cousins, Gareth Morgan, Heather Bowden, Ed Cousins ""We are deeply touched by the tributes to Richard, William, Edward, Emma and Heather in the media and throughout the community."" Tributes paid to seaplane crash family The recovery effort, which began at 06:00 local time (19:00 GMT Wednesday), continued late into the day. Police described it as a complex operation, with divers attaching slings to the wreckage amid ""zero visibility"". According to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald, the same plane was involved in an accident that killed a pilot 22 years ago.,external Its wingtip had struck a hill amid gusty conditions ""conducive to windshear and turbulence"" in rural New South Wales, according to an Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) report.,external Investigators said the aircraft was climbing at almost maximum weight when it clipped the ground, sending it into a cartwheel. The crash involved a single-engine DHC-2 Beaver Seaplane The plane was then repaired and cleared to fly again under official safety requirements, the Civil Aviation and Safety Authority told the BBC. It had since flown thousands of trips as a sightseeing plane until the crash on New Year's Eve. ATSB executive director Nat Nagy said a ""number of factors"" were involved in the 1996 crash but it would be examined as part of a thorough investigation into the plane's history. Seaplanes Pilots Association vice-president Kevin Bowe told the Sydney Morning Herald that crashed planes were rebuilt to a condition that was ""often better than new"". ATSB investigators have said they will release a preliminary report in about 30 days. ""The full sequence of events leading up to the accident is not fully understood at this stage,"" Mr Nagy said on Tuesday. Investigators, he added, would rigorously examine the wreckage, gather witness accounts and examine the pilot's flying history, in an effort to learn what happened.

"This video can not be played ""Everyone's always Snapchatting you"" - five children describe how they use social media Schools should play a bigger role in preparing children for social media's emotional demands as they move from primary to secondary school, England's children's commissioner says. Anne Longfield said she was worried many pupils at that stage became anxious about their identity and craved likes and comments for validation. Herstudy,externalsaid children aged eight to 12 found it hard to manage the impact. The government said it was working with schools on online safety education. The report into the effects of social media on eight to 12-year-olds claimed many children were over-dependent on ""likes"" and comments for social validation. It said children approach a ""cliff-edge"" as they move from primary to secondary school, when social media becomes more important in their lives. How do you talk to children about sex and relationships? Jargon-busting guides to teach children about social media Do you know what social media rules you've signed up to? This video can not be played Children's commissioner for England Anne Longfield: ""More and more younger children are online"" The report spoke to 32 children in eight focus groups, aged eight to 12, and found some saying: ""If I got 150 likes, I'd be like, 'that's pretty cool, it means they like you'"" - Aaron, 11 ""I just edit my photos to make sure I look nice"" - Annie, 11 ""My mum takes pictures of me on Snapchat... I don't like it when your friends and family take a picture of you when you don't want them to"" - Hassan, eight ""I saw a pretty girl and everything she has I want, my aim is to be like her"" - Bridie, 11 Ms Longfield called on schools and parents to prepare children emotionally for the ""significant risks"" of social media as they move schools and meet new classmates - many of whom have their own phones. ""It's really when they hit secondary school that all of these things come together,"" she told BBC News. ""They find themselves chasing likes, chasing validation, being very anxious about their appearance online and offline and feeling that they can't disconnect - because that will be seen as socially damaging."" Although most social media platforms have a minimum age limit of 13, the report said three-quarters of children aged 10 to 12 already had accounts. Ms Longfield said social media provided ""great benefits"" to children but was also exposing them to ""significant risks emotionally"". She suggested compulsory digital literacy and online resilience lessons for year six and seven pupils, so that they learn about the ""emotional side of social media"". Parents should also prepare their children, she said, by helping them ""navigate the emotional rollercoaster"" of the negative aspects of social media. Ella Brookbanks worries her daughter Sophie, nine, will see the negative side to social media Ella Brookbanks, mother to nine-year-old Sophie and 15-year-old Bradley, said her teenage son is ""expected"" to be on social media. ""He seems to want to buy things in order to take pictures of it to send to his friends to show that he has these type of things,"" she told BBC News. ""It's a recognition thing - 'look what I have, look what I can get, like me'."" She says her daughter ""doesn't see that side of it just yet"" but worries Sophie will experience the negative side to social media when she starts secondary school. Parent Trevor said his 12-year-old twin daughters had moved schools as a result of the pressure from social media, but admits they ""can't walk away"" from it. He told BBC Radio 5 live: ""I can't say to them, 'You can't use that,' when I use it."" He said teachers lacked the skills to educate children and said the approach by politicians was ""disappointing"". Children should be made aware of their value outside of 'likes', says charity worker Grace Barrett Matthew Reed, chief executive of the Children's Society, urged parents to have ""open conversations"" with their children about the sites and apps they use. ""This can include looking through their 'friends' lists together and finding out how their child knows different people,"" he said. ""Check their privacy settings and get children to think about what information and photos they are comfortable with others having access to."" Tony Stower, the NSPCC's head of child safety online, said regular conversations would mean children felt able to turn to their parents if they had worries or concerns. ""It's worth reassuring children that people often present rose-tinted versions of their lives on social media, and they shouldn't feel pressured to lead the 'perfect' life, or to look a certain way,"" he said. Grace Barrett, co-founder of children's mental health charity the Self-Esteem Team, said it largely fell to parents to teach their children about social media. ""Teachers can't be equipped to do everything,"" she said. ""We should be helping young people understand that their value lies outside of 'likes' and outside of what they look like.""

"This video can not be played Iran protests: Why people have taken to the streets The head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards has declared the defeat of the ""sedition"" in the country, referring to a wave of anti-government protests. Maj Gen Mohammad Ali Jafari made the announcement as tens of thousands of people attended pro-government rallies called to counter the unrest. It began last Thursday in the city of Mashhad and has seen 21 people killed. The protests were initially against price rises and corruption, but turned to wider anti-government sentiment. They have been the largest since the disputed 2009 presidential election. Gen Jafari said: ""Today, we can say that this is the end of the 96 sedition,"" referring to the current year - 1396 - in the Persian calendar. He said ""security preparedness and people's vigilance"" had led to the defeat of ""enemies"" and that the Guards had only intervened in a ""limited"" way in three provinces. He added: ""There were a maximum of 1,500 people in each place and the number of troublemakers did not exceed 15,000 people nationwide."" Gen Jafari said the total number of protesters had not exceeded 15,000 nationwide The general blamed anti-revolutionary agents, pro-monarchists and forces which he said had been ""announced by [US-ex Secretary of State Hillary] Clinton to create riot, anarchy, insecurity and intrigue in Iran"". The ""enemies"" had tried to pose ""cultural, economic and security threats against Islamic Iran"", he said. Telegram under fire as Iran clamps down on protests The symbol of Iran's protests? Why are there protests in Iran? Iran's Revolutionary Guards take lead on foreign affairs His comments echoed those by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Tuesday, which also blamed unspecified ""enemies"" and which analysts believed referred to the US, Israel and Saudi Arabia. But the general also blamed a ""former official"" for the protests, in a comment analysts believe referred to ex-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has been critical of government officials, in particular Judiciary Chief Sadegh Amoli Larijani, in recent weeks. State television broadcast some of the pro-government rallies live. Among those holding events were the cities of Kermanshah, Ilam and Gorgan. This video can not be played Pro-government rallies have been held in a number of cities Some marchers carried Iranian flags and images of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In the city of Qom, marchers chanted ""death to American mercenaries"". Chants elsewhere included ""the blood in our veins is a gift to our leader"" and ""the seditionist rioters should be executed"". Reuters news agency is reporting fresh protests after nightfall on Wednesday in the city of Malayer in western Hamadan province, with protesters chanting: ""People are begging, the supreme leader is acting like God!"" Video on social media showed protesters in Nowshahr in the north chanting ""death to the dictator"", a phrase that has been used against Ayatollah Khamenei, the agency reported. Another video showed a building burning in Gohardasht. An unpredictable challenge for Iran Iran voices: 'We have the right to protest' Associated Press said other video had emerged on Wednesday of protesters tearing down images of the ayatollah in Noor Abad, 360km (225 miles) south-west of Tehran, although it was unclear when the footage was shot. Meanwhile three members of the security services have been killed in Piranshahr, an area in West Azerbaijan province which borders Iraqi Kurdistan, according to a statement by the Revolutionary Guards. However, the area occasionally sees clashes with Kurdish separatists based in Iraq, and the attack is not thought to be linked to the recent protests.

"Tech firms are working to fix two major bugs in computer chips that could allow hackers to steal sensitive data. The bugs are an ""absolute disaster"" and need to be fixed promptly, according to one cyber-security researcher. Google researchers said one of the ""serious security flaws"",external, dubbed ""Spectre"", was found in chips made by Intel, AMD and ARM. The other, known as ""Meltdown"" affects Intel-made chips andone recent ARM chip,external. The industry has been aware of the problem for months and hoped to solve it before details were made public. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said there was no evidence that the vulnerability had been exploited. It has issuedguidance about Meltdown and Spectre,external, including advice on what people can do to protect themselves. According to the researchers who found the bugs, chips dating as far back as 1995 have been affected. Some fixes, in the form of software updates known as patches, have been introduced or will be available in the next few days, said Intel, which provides chips to about 80% of desktop computers and 90% of laptops worldwide. ""These bugs are an absolute disaster,"" said Matthew Hickey, a cyber-security expert at Hacker House. While some computers can be patched quickly, others faced a longer wait, he explained, giving virtual hosting systems as one example. ""You may find that patches aren't yet available,"" he told the BBC. Millions of computers contain Intel chips Microchips are the basic electronic systems behind many devices such as computers and mobile phones. In order to do their work, they must move data around, using different types of memory to temporarily store it. In many cases, that information is supposed to be secure from attempts to snoop on it, but these two bugs mean that it could in fact be accessed by a third party. The first reports suggested that a bug affected solely chips made by Intel, but it has since emerged that a separate flaw, Spectre, has been found in Intel, ARM and AMD chips. ""Many types of computing devices - with many different vendors' processors and operating systems - are susceptible to these exploits,"" said Intel. ARM said patches had already been shared with its customers, which include many smartphone manufacturers. AMD said it believed there was ""near zero risk to AMD products at this time"". On a conference call for investors, Intel said researchers had shown that hackers could exploit the Meltdown vulnerability, gaining the ability to read memory and potentially access information such as passwords or encryption keys on devices. Microsoft, which uses Intel chips said it would roll out security updates on Thursday, adding it had no information suggesting any data had been compromised. Apple's latest macOS, version 10.13.2, is safe from the Meltdown bug and the firm is working on updates for earlier versions of the operating system on its laptops and desktops. Computer chip scare: What you need to know As for Spectre, however, experts believe that it will not be possible to patch it directly, but various software tweaks could help stop it being exploited. Googlepublished a blog detailing what some customers may need to do.,externalIt said Android phones with the latest security updates were protected, and that Gmail was safe. It will be releasing security patches for users of older Chromebooks, while there will also be a fix for users of the Chrome web browser. The NCSC said it was aware of the reports of the potential flaw and advised that all organisations and home users ""continue to protect their systems from threats by installing patches as soon as they become available."" When asked whether hackers will make use of the bugs to attack computers, experts advised caution on the issue. ""It is significant but whether it will be exploited widely is another matter,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt: I apologise for postponed operations Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has apologised to patients in England who have had their operations postponed. Non-urgent treatments had already been cancelled until mid-January, but NHS England said on Tuesday that would now be extended to the end of the month. It came after hospitals reported they were struggling to cope with the surge in patients being seen since Christmas. At least 17 hospital trusts - one in 10 - have declared a major incident in the last 24 hours, the BBC understands. Bosses said they had been forced into the move as patients were experiencing long waits in A&E and being left on trolleys in corridors because there were no beds available. Some ambulance services have even started asking 999 callers with less serious problems to make their own way to hospital so they can prioritise the most life-threatening calls. Of the decision to cancel operations, Mr Hunt said it was ""absolutely not what I want"". But he said the move was needed given the pressure hospitals were under. ""This is the busiest week of the year for the NHS."" And he also said the whole country was grateful for the work NHS staff were putting in working ""incredibly long hours through the night, beyond the call of duty in every possible way"". This video can not be played Theresa May: The NHS has been better prepared for this winter than ever before His thanks were echoed by Prime Minister Theresa May, who also denied the health service was in crisis.

Problems have also been reported in other parts of the UK. The Welsh government said the health service was facing ""significant pressure"". Meanwhile, in Scotlandthere has been a 20% jump in A&E attendances compared with the previous year, prompting an increase in patients waiting more than four hours, and in Northern Ireland the Antrim Area Hospital has been forced to bring in St John ambulance volunteers to help with a surge in demand. Winter pressure health campaign launched NHS to cancel ops to cope with winter People on beds 'as far as you could see' NHS England's Prof Keith Willett admitted the pressures were severe - the worst he had seen since the 1990s - but said plans were in place. As well as the cancelling of non-urgent treatments, such as knee and hip replacements, hospitals have been given the green light to put patients on mixed sex wards and to bring GPs into A&E to help deal with patients. ""A crisis is when you haven't got in place mitigations and you haven't got a plan to deal with it,"" Prof Willett said. ""We've gone into this winter in a way we've never prepared before."" This video can not be played NHS chief tells Today service is not in crisis but says they may need to cancel more operations in future But Prof Suzanne Mason, of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the measures were ""too little too late"" as hospitals simply had no beds free and these treatments would have had to be cancelled anyway. She added: ""Patient safety is being compromised - there's no doubt about that.  When patients are in crowded emergency departments and staff cannot actually move between patients and provide the basic level of care that's required, then safety is compromised. ""Patients who spend many hours on a trolley - and these are often elderly patients - they are the sickest patients in our department. ""They are much more likely to have a poorer outcome and even die as a result of their experience in the emergency department. And that is a huge tragedy for us in our specialty and that's why we are so desperate to see things improve."" This video can not be played Dr Adrian Harrop: ""I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle"" Reports have emerged of serious problems in a number of places over the past 24 hours: Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre has asked patients to avoid its A&E after being deluged on Tuesday evening Southend Hospital said it was dealing with an ""internal critical incident"" with all its beds full, which has led them to call in extra staff A consultant at University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust apologised for ""third world conditions"" in his hospital department Milton Keynes University Hospital is telling people only to attend for emergency treatment Two ambulance trusts in the east and north-east of England are on the highest alert A concentration of major incidents declared at hospitals across the West Country and south-east Doctors and nurses have also been speaking about the problems. Dr Adrian Harrop, an A&E doctor at Scarborough Hospital, said he felt he was ""fighting a losing battle"" as he was not able to do his job properly and care for his patients in the way he wanted. Mark Nevison, a senior nurse in the north-east, tweeted he had worked in A&E for 10 years and had ""never been so ashamed of the sub-standard care"" now being offered. Esther Herbert said she couldn't leave her mother before 06:30 the following morning Meanwhile, patients have been talking about their experiences. Esther Herbert accompanied her 87-year-old mother to Worcestershire Royal Hospital before Christmas. ""The doors opened and it was just a sea of people,"" she said. ""There were people on beds all the way down the corridor, as far as you could see."" Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has blamed the pressures on ""Tory underfunding"".

"Mr Trump sits at the White House Resolute Desk in the Oval Office Donald Trump was ""befuddled"" by his election win, did not enjoy his inauguration and was scared of the White House, according to a new book. Journalist Michael Wolff's Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House also purports to lift the lid on Ivanka Trump's secret presidential ambitions. The book details Mr Trump's regard for media titan Rupert Murdoch, though the admiration was apparently not mutual. The White House said the book was full of ""false and misleading accounts"". Michael Wolff says his work is based on more than 200 interviews and that he took up ""something like a semi-permanent seat on a couch in the West Wing"" following the president's inauguration for a close-up insight into the fledgling administration. Here are 11 of the book's revelations, with commentary from the BBC's Anthony Zurcher. According to the book, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon thought a meeting between Donald Trump Jr and a group of Russians was ""treasonous"". The Russians had offered Donald Trump Jr damaging information on Hillary Clinton at the June 2016 meeting. This video can not be played White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders explains why Mr Trump rounded on his former adviser Steve Bannon Wolff writes that Bannon told him of the meeting: ""The three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor - with no lawyers. They didn't have any lawyers. Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad s***, and I happen to think it's all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately."" Bannon reportedly said the Justice Department investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Moscow would focus on money laundering, adding: ""They're going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV."" Anthony Zurcher:In just a few sentences, Bannon manages to detonate a bomb under the White House's efforts to downplay the significance of that fateful June meeting in Trump Tower and their attempt to dismiss Robert Mueller's inquiry as a partisan witchhunt. It's bad, Bannon is saying, and even more unforgivably it was stupid. Taking aim at Mr Trump's own family in the most personal terms makes it all the more biting. In an article for NYMag,externaladapted from his book, Wolff describes the amazement - and dismay - in the Trump camp at his November 2016 election win. ""Shortly after 8pm on Election Night, when the unexpected trend - Trump might actually win - seemed confirmed, Don Jr told a friend that his father, or DJT, as he calls him, looked as if he had seen a ghost. Melania was in tears - and not of joy. There was, in the space of little more than an hour, in Steve Bannon's not unamused observation, a befuddled Trump morphing into a disbelieving Trump and then into a horrified Trump. But still to come was the final transformation: Suddenly, Donald Trump became a man who believed that he deserved to be, and was wholly capable of being, the president of the United States."" AZ:This is decidedly different from what has been recited by the Trump circle since election night. While campaign hands - at least the less-than-dedicated ones - may have been positioning themselves for a soft landing after a defeat, Mr Trump and his close allies believed in their success. A ""horrified Trump"" was never part of the script. The president and first lady Wolff writes: ""Trump did not enjoy his own inauguration. He was angry that A-level stars had snubbed the event, disgruntled with the accommodations at Blair House, and visibly fighting with his wife, who seemed on the verge of tears. Throughout the day, he wore what some around him had taken to calling his golf face: angry and pissed off, shoulders hunched, arms swinging, brow furled, lips pursed."" But the first lady's office rejected the claims. Communications director Stephanie Grisham said in a statement: ""Mrs Trump supported her husband's decision to run for President and in fact, encouraged him to do so. She was confident he would win and was very happy when he did."" AZ:These words tell the same story as the viral video clip of a stone-faced Melania forcing a smile when the president looks her way. It also explains why Mr Trump was so insistent about the success of his inauguration and the size of his crowds. He felt slighted and aggrieved and was acting accordingly. According to another excerpt from the book, obtained by US media, Mr Trump used to boast that sleeping with his friends' wives made ""life worth living"". ""In pursuing a friend's wife, he would try to persuade the wife that her husband was perhaps not what she thought,""Wolff quotes a Trump friend as saying. He would invite the wife to secretly listen on speakerphone to a conversation that Mr Trump would have in his office with her husband, according to the book. Mr Trump would allegedly engage in sexual banter with the husband in the hope that he might say something indiscreet, asking questions such as:""Do you still like having sex with your wife? How often?"" Wolff writes: ""Trump, in fact, found the White House to be vexing and even a little scary. He retreated to his own bedroom - the first time since the Kennedy White House that a presidential couple had maintained separate rooms. In the first days, he ordered two television screens in addition to the one already there, and a lock on the door, precipitating a brief standoff with the Secret Service, who insisted they have access to the room."" AZ:For much of his adult life, Mr Trump has lived according to his own rules, as a real-estate tycoon whose wealth allowed his every whim or idiosyncrasy to be accommodated. Adjusting to the White House - which Bill Clinton once referred to as the ""crown jewel of the federal penitentiary system"" and Harry Truman called ""the great white jail"" - must have been quite a shock. Mr Trump's daughter and her husband Jared Kushner allegedly struck a deal that she might run for president in future, according to Wolff: Mr Trump pats his pregnant daughter Ivanka during his 2016 campaign ""Balancing risk against reward, both Jared and Ivanka decided to accept roles in the West Wing over the advice of almost everyone they knew. It was a joint decision by the couple, and, in some sense, a joint job. Between themselves, the two had made an earnest deal: If sometime in the future the opportunity arose, she'd be the one to run for president. The first woman president, Ivanka entertained, would not be Hillary Clinton; it would be Ivanka Trump. Bannon, who had coined the term 'Jarvanka' that was now in ever greater use in the White House, was horrified when the couple's deal was reported to him."" AZ:The feud between Bannon and ""Jarvanka"" was no secret, and it certainly wasn't surprising. In a way, the couple represented to Bannon everything he's fighting against - East Coast elitism and entitlement. Yet, thanks to familial ties, they had the president's ear and - this new book claims - harboured dynastic hopes. The US first daughter poked fun at her father's alleged ""scalp-reduction surgery"", according to the book. ""She treated her father with a degree of detachment, even irony, going so far as to make fun of his comb-over to others. She often described the mechanics behind it to friends: an absolutely clean pate - a contained island after scalp-reduction -surgery - surrounded by a furry circle of hair around the sides and front, from which all ends are drawn up to meet in the center and then swept back and secured by a stiffening spray. The color, she would point out to comical effect, was from a product called Just for Men - the longer it was left on, the darker it got. Impatience resulted in Trump's orange-blond hair color."" AZ:It wouldn't be particularly surprising if this is one of the anecdotes that Mr Trump finds most irksome. The president is proud of his hair, and once notably let late-night host Jimmy Fallon ruffle it to establish its authenticity. On windy days, Mr Trump usually wears a hat - the origin of the Make America Great Again ball cap - to ensure there are no coiffing malfunctions. The hair is as much a part of the Trump brand as big hotels and gold-plated escalators. Katie Walsh, the White House deputy chief of staff, asked Mr Kushner, the president's senior adviser, what the administration wanted to achieve. But according to the book, Mr Kushner did not have an answer. ""'Just give me the three things the president wants to focus on,' she [Katie Walsh] demanded. 'What are the three priorities of this White House?' It was the most basic question imaginable - one that any qualified presidential candidate would have answered long before he took up residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Six weeks into Trump's presidency, Kushner was wholly without an answer. 'Yes,' he said to Walsh. 'We should probably have that conversation.'"" AZ:It often takes a new administration a bit of time to find its footing. In Mr Trump's case, the situation was particularly acute. Having campaigned on some clear policy items - strengthened borders, renegotiated trade deals, a sweeping tax cut and Obamacare repeal - prioritising was clearly a challenge. Once in the White House, he allowed Congress to kick off with healthcare reform, and the difficulties achieving that goal haunted the Trump presidency for nearly a year. Wolff, who previously wrote a biography of Rupert Murdoch, describes Mr Trump's high regard for the News Corp media titan. ""Rupert Murdoch, who had promised to pay a call on the president-elect, was running late. When some of the guests made a move to leave, an increasingly agitated Trump assured them that Rupert was on his way. 'He's one of the greats, the last of the greats,' Trump said. 'You have to stay to see him.' Not grasping that he was now the most powerful man in the world, Trump was still trying mightily to curry favor with a media mogul who had long disdained him as a charlatan and fool."" AZ:During the campaign, Mr Trump had at times feuded with Murdoch's Fox News - fighting with presenter Megyn Kelly, boycotting the network and skipping a Fox-broadcast primary debate. The president, however, is one of Fox News' biggest fans - and the network has become his greatest advocate since his inauguration. Mr Trump is said to regularly speak with Mr Murdoch on the phone But the admiration was not mutual, according to Wolff's account of a call between Mr Murdoch and Mr Trump about the president's meeting with Silicon Valley executives. Mr Trump is said to have told Mr Murdoch: ""'These guys really need my help. Obama was not very favorable to them, too much regulation. This is really an opportunity for me to help them.' 'Donald,' said Murdoch, 'for eight years these guys had Obama in their pocket. They practically ran the administration. They don't need your help.' 'Take this H-1B visa issue. They really need these H-1B visas.'Murdoch suggested that taking a liberal approach to H-1B visas, which open America's doors to select immigrants, might be hard to square with his promises to build a wall and close the borders. But Trump seemed unconcerned, assuring Murdoch, 'We'll figure it out.' 'What a f****** idiot,' said Murdoch, shrugging, as he got off the phone."" AZ:There's sometimes been a disconnect between Mr Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric and his action as a businessman, where his companies often relied on immigrant labour. Perhaps the president-elect was reflecting his business sensibilities. Or maybe, in this case, he was simply echoing the opinion of the last group of people who had met with him - a criticism that has been lobbed his way on more than one occasion. Michael Flynn emerges from a plea hearing in a Washington DC courtroom Former US National Security Adviser Mike Flynn knew that accepting money from Moscow for a speech could come back to haunt him, according to the book. Wolff writes that before the election Mr Flynn ""had been told by friends that it had not been a good idea to take $45,000 from the Russians for a speech. 'Well it would only be a problem if we won,' he assured them."" Mr Flynn has been indicted in the Justice Department special counsel's inquiry. AZ:Like Paul Manafort, Flynn was one of the members of the Trump campaign's inner circle whose prior affairs were not ordered in a way that would, shall we say, stand up to close legal scrutiny. If Mr Trump had been defeated, that probably wouldn't have mattered. Like the protagonists in the film The Producers, however, their success was their undoing. Russia-Trump: Who's who?

"This video can not be played Iran protests: Why people have taken to the streets The head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards has declared the defeat of the ""sedition"" in the country, referring to a wave of anti-government protests. Maj Gen Mohammad Ali Jafari made the announcement as tens of thousands of people attended pro-government rallies called to counter the unrest. It began last Thursday in the city of Mashhad and has seen 21 people killed. The protests were initially against price rises and corruption, but turned to wider anti-government sentiment. They have been the largest since the disputed 2009 presidential election. Gen Jafari said: ""Today, we can say that this is the end of the 96 sedition,"" referring to the current year - 1396 - in the Persian calendar. He said ""security preparedness and people's vigilance"" had led to the defeat of ""enemies"" and that the Guards had only intervened in a ""limited"" way in three provinces. He added: ""There were a maximum of 1,500 people in each place and the number of troublemakers did not exceed 15,000 people nationwide."" Gen Jafari said the total number of protesters had not exceeded 15,000 nationwide The general blamed anti-revolutionary agents, pro-monarchists and forces which he said had been ""announced by [US-ex Secretary of State Hillary] Clinton to create riot, anarchy, insecurity and intrigue in Iran"". The ""enemies"" had tried to pose ""cultural, economic and security threats against Islamic Iran"", he said. Telegram under fire as Iran clamps down on protests The symbol of Iran's protests? Why are there protests in Iran? Iran's Revolutionary Guards take lead on foreign affairs His comments echoed those by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Tuesday, which also blamed unspecified ""enemies"" and which analysts believed referred to the US, Israel and Saudi Arabia. But the general also blamed a ""former official"" for the protests, in a comment analysts believe referred to ex-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has been critical of government officials, in particular Judiciary Chief Sadegh Amoli Larijani, in recent weeks. State television broadcast some of the pro-government rallies live. Among those holding events were the cities of Kermanshah, Ilam and Gorgan. This video can not be played Pro-government rallies have been held in a number of cities Some marchers carried Iranian flags and images of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In the city of Qom, marchers chanted ""death to American mercenaries"". Chants elsewhere included ""the blood in our veins is a gift to our leader"" and ""the seditionist rioters should be executed"". Reuters news agency is reporting fresh protests after nightfall on Wednesday in the city of Malayer in western Hamadan province, with protesters chanting: ""People are begging, the supreme leader is acting like God!"" Video on social media showed protesters in Nowshahr in the north chanting ""death to the dictator"", a phrase that has been used against Ayatollah Khamenei, the agency reported. Another video showed a building burning in Gohardasht. An unpredictable challenge for Iran Iran voices: 'We have the right to protest' Associated Press said other video had emerged on Wednesday of protesters tearing down images of the ayatollah in Noor Abad, 360km (225 miles) south-west of Tehran, although it was unclear when the footage was shot. Meanwhile three members of the security services have been killed in Piranshahr, an area in West Azerbaijan province which borders Iraqi Kurdistan, according to a statement by the Revolutionary Guards. However, the area occasionally sees clashes with Kurdish separatists based in Iraq, and the attack is not thought to be linked to the recent protests.

"Police are ""routinely ignoring"" the needs of women detainees on their periods, the Independent Custody Visiting Association (ICVA) has said. The way menstruating suspects are being treated in police detention could be in breach of human rights and equality laws, according to the IVCA, which monitors the treatment of detainees. It called on the home secretary to introduce new guidelines for police. The Home Office said everyone held in custody should be treated with dignity. But the ICVA - which is funded by the Home Office - says women in England and Wales are often held in police cells without access to hygienic sanitary protection or facilities for washing and changing. Many are not able to speak to a female police officer, it adds. One woman, it says, had her clothes removed and was dressed in a paper suit. Despite her having her period, her underwear had been removed and she was refused any sanitary protection. ""She was left in a state of vulnerability sufficient to cause concern for her wellbeing, bleeding in a paper suit, alone in a cell,"" the ICVA said. Sherry Ralph, the organisation's chief operating officer, said that custody suites ""typically only have one absorbency of tampon and towel available"". ""One senior officer described the packs that they have to buy as 'woeful',"" she added. Surviving period poverty with 'socks and tissue' Tampon tax: How much have you spent? Far fewer women are arrested than men. In 2016/17, 119,937 females were arrested in England and and Wales out of a total 779,660 people arrested. The maximum period of detention in custody is four days, with judicial authorisation. For arrests under terrorism legislation, this rises to 14 days. Evidence gathered by the IVCA suggests the problem of sanitary provision is widespread across forces in England and Wales. The IVCA has now written to Home Secretary Amber Rudd, calling on her to take ""swift action"" to resolve the problems. ""No woman or girl should be left in indignity by police officers for want of a difficult conversation or an inexpensive box of tampons,"" the letter reads. A copy of the letter has also been sent to Women and Equalities Minister Justine Greening and David Isaac, chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission. During the booking-in process, women detainees should be asked about their needs in private They should be provided a female officer point of contact A hygiene pack should be offered automatically to all women, with a fresh pack offered after six hours Hand-washing facilities must be available CCTV monitoring should be pixelated or alternative arrangements made to allow women detainees to change in private Where the removal of clothes is necessary due to risk of self-harm, the removal of sanitary protection should be subject to individual risk assessment Dame Vera Baird, Police and Crime Commissioner for Northumbria, called the failure to offer automatic packages to detainees ""lamentable"". ""This must immediately stop and police must revise their process,"" she said, as she urged the home secretary and prime minister to ""ensure action is taken"". The Home Office said it is working with the ICVA and the National Police Chiefs' Council ""to understand where improvements can be made on this issue"".

"This video can not be played ""Medieval"": Find out what Windsor makes of the royal wedding row A council leader has called for action to tackle ""aggressive begging"" in Windsor, ahead of the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. Simon Dudley, of the Royal Borough of Windsor & Maidenhead, has called on the Berkshire police and crime commissioner (PCC) to address the issue ""urgently"". Mr Dudley said street begging created a ""hostile atmosphere"" for both residents and tourists,external. Windsor Homeless Project described the comments as ""abhorrent"". In December Mr Dudley tweeted about an ""epidemic of rough sleeping and vagrancy,external"" in the town. He said he would be asking Thames Valley Police and the PCC to ""focus on dealing with this before the royal wedding"". He went on to describe how ""vagrancy and begging"" meant people were ""marching tourists to cash points to withdraw cash"" - although Thames Valley Policesaid it had received no such reports,external. Mr Dudley also said some people were earning hundreds of pounds a week targeting tourists and residents in Windsor. In his letter on Tuesday to PCC Anthony Stansfeld, the Conservative councillor said: ""The whole situation... presents a beautiful town in a sadly unfavourable light. He wrote: ""The level of tourist interest is set to multiply with the royal wedding in May 2018, and there are increased concerns from our residents about their safety."" The couple will marry at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in May He said many beggars were not homeless and called for ""immediate action, as this is a significant security concern, especially given the national importance of Windsor"". Windsor Homeless Project manager Murphy James said it was ""sickening"" that Mr Dudley had cited the royal wedding as a reason for his concerns. He said: ""If somebody is sleeping out on the street they are not there by choice; they are there because something has gone wrong. ""I went out on Christmas Day and there were 12 people laid out on Windsor High Street - they were not there by choice."" Mr Stansfeld said the council had not raised the issue with him on his last visit there but said supporting the homeless was a ""priority"". He also said protecting the public was ""of the utmost importance... and the force work day in and day out to keep people safe from harm and make the Thames Valley a safe place to live, work and visit"". Windsor has been described as a ""very special place"" for Prince Harry and Miss Markle, who have spent time there together since meeting in July 2016.

"Former White House aide Steve Bannon ""lost his mind"" after he lost his job, US President Donald Trump has said. The president disavowed Mr Bannon after he was quoted in a new book describing a meeting between Mr Trump's son and a group of Russians as ""treasonous"". The Russians had offered Donald Trump Jr damaging information on Hillary Clinton at the June 2016 meeting. Mr Trump's lawyers have sent a cease-and-desist letter to Mr Bannon, US media reports said. ""Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind,"" Mr Trump said in a statement on Wednesday. 10 explosive claims from new Trump book Trump Bannon: A knife fight with consequences ""Steve was a staffer who worked for me after I had already won the nomination by defeating seventeen candidates, often described as the most talented field ever assembled in the Republican party,"" he continued. ""Now that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn't as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country."" Mr Trump's lawyers saidMr Bannon had broken his employment agreement,externalby speaking to the book's author Michael Wolff about Mr Trump and his family, ""disclosing confidential information"" and ""making disparaging statements and in some cases outright defamatory statements to Mr Wolff about Mr Trump, his family members, and the Company,"" the letter said, according to the Washington Post newspaper. This video can not be played Steve Bannon's three goals for the Trump presidency Mr Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, was considered a key player in the Trump White House and helped shape Mr Trump's  ""America First"" campaign message before he left his post in August. He returned to his role as the head of the right-wing Breitbart News website, where he said he planned to help Mr Trump's administration as a ""wingman outside"". Mr Trump reportedly spoke to Mr Bannon as recently as 13 December, the day of the special US Senate election in Alabama that saw the defeat of Republican Roy Moore, whom Mr Bannon supported. The president's comments came hours after the explosive new book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, revealed that Mr Bannon called Mr Trump Jr's meeting ""treasonous"" and ""unpatriotic"". How Trump cooled on Bannon Speaking to the author, Mr Bannon said of the investigation into whether there was any collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign: ""They're going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV."" Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Donald Trump swept to the presidency in part on the back of Steve Bannon and his Breitbart conservative media empire. Now we will see how he fares when he's at war with them. The president's blistering reply to Mr Bannon's comments appears to indicate that the bridge between the politician and his ideological spirit guide has been reduced to cinders. But how will Mr Trump's legion of supporters react? It is never wise to underestimate their dedication to the man himself, above all else. No matter the outcome of this coming battle, this has to be viewed as a devastating failure for Mr Bannon personally. After spending years advocating for an anti-establishment conservative populism, he finally had a seat in the halls of power. He said in early 2017 that his goal was nothing short of the ""deconstruction of the administrative state"". Now he is on the outside again, besieged by long-time antagonists and former allies. His president recently signed a tax bill embraced by corporate interests. His first post-2016 foray into elective politics, the Alabama Senate race, ended in humiliating defeat. Perhaps, given all this, the Bannon-Trump feud was as inevitable as it is certain to be vicious. Emails show Mr Trump Jr agreed to meet Russian associates in June 2016 on the premise that they had damaging information against his father's Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. The meeting was also attended by Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and aide, and then campaign chairman Paul Manafort. This video can not be played White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders explains why Mr Trump rounded on his former adviser Steve Bannon Mr Bannon reportedly told Mr Wolff that the three senior campaign officials ""should have called the FBI immediately"" after the meeting, according to US media reports.

The Senate, House of Representatives and a special counsel are all investigating alleged Russian interference in the presidential election and alleged attempts to undermine Mrs Clinton - a claim denied by the Kremlin. Mr Trump has also vehemently denied any collusion.

"This video can not be played The crash in December 2017 killed six people Australian authorities have recovered most of a seaplane that crashed near Sydney and killed six people. On Sunday, high-profile UK business leader Richard Cousins, four members of his family and a Canadian pilot died when the plane plunged into a river. After days of planning, police used divers and a crane to lift the wreckage in sections from a depth of 13m (40ft). Officials said a crash involving the same plane in 1996 would form part of their wide-ranging investigation. On Thursday, the majority of the De Havilland DHC-2 Beaver - including its fuselage, floats and a wing - was retrieved from the River Hawkesbury about 50km (30 miles) north of Sydney. The crash killed Compass Group chief executive Mr Cousins, 58, his 48-year-old fiancÃ©e, magazine editor Emma Bowden, her 11-year-old daughter Heather, his sons, Edward, 23, and William, 25, and Sydney-based pilot Gareth Morgan, 44. The family, from Tooting, in south-west London, were flying back to Sydney from an exclusive waterfront restaurant in Jerusalem Bay, not far from the crash site. The businessman's brothers, Simon and Andrew Cousins, said on Thursday: ""We are fortunate and thankful for the outpouring of love and support we've received from across the world."" Victims (clockwise from top left) Richard Cousins, Emma Bowden, Will Cousins, Gareth Morgan, Heather Bowden, Ed Cousins ""We are deeply touched by the tributes to Richard, William, Edward, Emma and Heather in the media and throughout the community."" Tributes paid to seaplane crash family The recovery effort, which began at 06:00 local time (19:00 GMT Wednesday), continued late into the day. Police described it as a complex operation, with divers attaching slings to the wreckage amid ""zero visibility"". According to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald, the same plane was involved in an accident that killed a pilot 22 years ago.,external Its wingtip had struck a hill amid gusty conditions ""conducive to windshear and turbulence"" in rural New South Wales, according to an Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) report.,external Investigators said the aircraft was climbing at almost maximum weight when it clipped the ground, sending it into a cartwheel. The crash involved a single-engine DHC-2 Beaver Seaplane The plane was then repaired and cleared to fly again under official safety requirements, the Civil Aviation and Safety Authority told the BBC. It had since flown thousands of trips as a sightseeing plane until the crash on New Year's Eve. ATSB executive director Nat Nagy said a ""number of factors"" were involved in the 1996 crash but it would be examined as part of a thorough investigation into the plane's history. Seaplanes Pilots Association vice-president Kevin Bowe told the Sydney Morning Herald that crashed planes were rebuilt to a condition that was ""often better than new"". ATSB investigators have said they will release a preliminary report in about 30 days. ""The full sequence of events leading up to the accident is not fully understood at this stage,"" Mr Nagy said on Tuesday. Investigators, he added, would rigorously examine the wreckage, gather witness accounts and examine the pilot's flying history, in an effort to learn what happened.

"Tech firms are working to fix two major bugs in computer chips that could allow hackers to steal sensitive data. The bugs are an ""absolute disaster"" and need to be fixed promptly, according to one cyber-security researcher. Google researchers said one of the ""serious security flaws"",external, dubbed ""Spectre"", was found in chips made by Intel, AMD and ARM. The other, known as ""Meltdown"" affects Intel-made chips andone recent ARM chip,external. The industry has been aware of the problem for months and hoped to solve it before details were made public. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said there was no evidence that the vulnerability had been exploited. It has issuedguidance about Meltdown and Spectre,external, including advice on what people can do to protect themselves. According to the researchers who found the bugs, chips dating as far back as 1995 have been affected. Some fixes, in the form of software updates known as patches, have been introduced or will be available in the next few days, said Intel, which provides chips to about 80% of desktop computers and 90% of laptops worldwide. ""These bugs are an absolute disaster,"" said Matthew Hickey, a cyber-security expert at Hacker House. While some computers can be patched quickly, others faced a longer wait, he explained, giving virtual hosting systems as one example. ""You may find that patches aren't yet available,"" he told the BBC. Millions of computers contain Intel chips Microchips are the basic electronic systems behind many devices such as computers and mobile phones. In order to do their work, they must move data around, using different types of memory to temporarily store it. In many cases, that information is supposed to be secure from attempts to snoop on it, but these two bugs mean that it could in fact be accessed by a third party. The first reports suggested that a bug affected solely chips made by Intel, but it has since emerged that a separate flaw, Spectre, has been found in Intel, ARM and AMD chips. ""Many types of computing devices - with many different vendors' processors and operating systems - are susceptible to these exploits,"" said Intel. ARM said patches had already been shared with its customers, which include many smartphone manufacturers. AMD said it believed there was ""near zero risk to AMD products at this time"". On a conference call for investors, Intel said researchers had shown that hackers could exploit the Meltdown vulnerability, gaining the ability to read memory and potentially access information such as passwords or encryption keys on devices. Microsoft, which uses Intel chips said it would roll out security updates on Thursday, adding it had no information suggesting any data had been compromised. Apple's latest macOS, version 10.13.2, is safe from the Meltdown bug and the firm is working on updates for earlier versions of the operating system on its laptops and desktops. Computer chip scare: What you need to know As for Spectre, however, experts believe that it will not be possible to patch it directly, but various software tweaks could help stop it being exploited. Googlepublished a blog detailing what some customers may need to do.,externalIt said Android phones with the latest security updates were protected, and that Gmail was safe. It will be releasing security patches for users of older Chromebooks, while there will also be a fix for users of the Chrome web browser. The NCSC said it was aware of the reports of the potential flaw and advised that all organisations and home users ""continue to protect their systems from threats by installing patches as soon as they become available.""

"This video can not be played The 23-year-old thanked party members for ""putting their faith"" in him The son of late Labour assembly member Carl Sargeant has been selected by party members to fight the by-election caused by his father's death. Jack Sargeant, 23, was chosen by party members in Alyn and Deeside ahead of the by-election on 6 February. He beat Flintshire councillor Carolyn Thomas and Saltney town councillor Hannah Jones. Carl Sargeant, who had represented Alyn and Deeside in the Assembly since 2003, was found dead in November. Jack Sargeant said he would be ""seeking justice"" for his father and ""getting to the truth about the chain of events that led to his premature death"". Tory and Lib Dem by-election candidates named First minister orders Sargeant inquiry Sacked Labour minister found dead His father was found dead at his home in Connah's Quay days after losing his cabinet position amid allegations around his personal conduct. He had vowed to clear his name, and the first minister has ordered an independent inquiry to consider the circumstances around his sacking. Jack Sargeant said it had been ""extremely difficult"" for his family following the death of his father Jack Sargeant said: ""I am humbled and honoured to have been selected as Labour's candidate. ""I would like to thank local Labour Party members for the faith they have placed in me. ""I will be standing on a platform of being a powerful voice for local people - in the proud tradition of my father."" He said he would listen to local concerns about the economy, health and education and promised to ""champion north Wales interests on all these issues"". ""Whilst friends from the wider Labour family across Britain will be welcome to visit and campaign alongside us to secure victory, I want to emphasise - this will be a locally run campaign,"" he added. ""I take nothing for granted in this by-election."" Plaid Cymru announced that it had selected Carrie Harper on Wednesday. The Conservatives had selected former nurse Sarah Atherton as their candidate for the by-election and community councillor Donna Lalek will stand on behalf of the Liberal Democrats. UKIP previously said they would only stand if Jack Sargeant failed to win the Labour nomination. Conservative Sarah Atherton and Liberal Democrat Donna Lalek were the first two candidates selected Carrie Harper will fight the by-election for Plaid Cymru This comes as no surprise but it does confirm that a by-election already due to take place under extraordinary circumstances is likely to be a highly charged affair with the son of the late Carl Sargeant looking to keep the memory of his father alive. Opposition parties will have to deal with the emotional weight that will inevitably surround his campaign and the undoubted popularity within Labour ranks of his late father, particularly in and around his hometown, and power base of Connah's Quay. Jack Sargeant had made an effort to win the support of Labour members not just through his family connection but also with a focus on local jobs and skills. This will presumably be a central part of his campaign, as will thoughts about his father, no matter how difficult that becomes for the leadership of a Welsh Labour party already facing deep divisions within its own ranks about the sacking of Carl Sargeant.

"Tech firms are working to fix two major bugs in computer chips that could allow hackers to steal sensitive data. The bugs are an ""absolute disaster"" and need to be fixed promptly, according to one cyber-security researcher. Google researchers said one of the ""serious security flaws"",external, dubbed ""Spectre"", was found in chips made by Intel, AMD and ARM. The other, known as ""Meltdown"" affects Intel-made chips andone recent ARM chip,external. The industry has been aware of the problem for months and hoped to solve it before details were made public. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said there was no evidence that the vulnerability had been exploited. It has issuedguidance about Meltdown and Spectre,external, including advice on what people can do to protect themselves. According to the researchers who found the bugs, chips dating as far back as 1995 have been affected. Some fixes, in the form of software updates known as patches, have been introduced or will be available in the next few days, said Intel, which provides chips to about 80% of desktop computers and 90% of laptops worldwide. ""These bugs are an absolute disaster,"" said Matthew Hickey, a cyber-security expert at Hacker House. While some computers can be patched quickly, others faced a longer wait, he explained, giving virtual hosting systems as one example. ""You may find that patches aren't yet available,"" he told the BBC. Millions of computers contain Intel chips Microchips are the basic electronic systems behind many devices such as computers and mobile phones. In order to do their work, they must move data around, using different types of memory to temporarily store it. In many cases, that information is supposed to be secure from attempts to snoop on it, but these two bugs mean that it could in fact be accessed by a third party. The first reports suggested that a bug affected solely chips made by Intel, but it has since emerged that a separate flaw, Spectre, has been found in Intel, ARM and AMD chips. ""Many types of computing devices - with many different vendors' processors and operating systems - are susceptible to these exploits,"" said Intel. ARM said patches had already been shared with its customers, which include many smartphone manufacturers. AMD said it believed there was ""near zero risk to AMD products at this time"". On a conference call for investors, Intel said researchers had shown that hackers could exploit the Meltdown vulnerability, gaining the ability to read memory and potentially access information such as passwords or encryption keys on devices. Microsoft, which uses Intel chips said it would roll out security updates on Thursday, adding it had no information suggesting any data had been compromised. Apple's latest macOS, version 10.13.2, is safe from the Meltdown bug and the firm is working on updates for earlier versions of the operating system on its laptops and desktops. Computer chip scare: What you need to know As for Spectre, however, experts believe that it will not be possible to patch it directly, but various software tweaks could help stop it being exploited. Googlepublished a blog detailing what some customers may need to do.,externalIt said Android phones with the latest security updates were protected, and that Gmail was safe. It will be releasing security patches for users of older Chromebooks, while there will also be a fix for users of the Chrome web browser. The NCSC said it was aware of the reports of the potential flaw and advised that all organisations and home users ""continue to protect their systems from threats by installing patches as soon as they become available."" When asked whether hackers will make use of the bugs to attack computers, experts advised caution on the issue. ""It is significant but whether it will be exploited widely is another matter,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey.

"This video can not be played Brexit will give Corbyn same problems as Tories - Blair Tony Blair has warned Jeremy Corbyn that Brexit will make it harder for Labour to deliver its promises if it wins power. The former prime minister said Mr Corbyn would be in ""exactly the same position"" as the Tories  - distracted by Brexit and short of money. Speaking to the BBC's John Pienaar, he defended his call for a second EU referendum. Labour has backed Brexit and ruled out a second referendum if it wins power. End 'obsessive' Brexit criticism says Fox Blair: Brexit puts NI peace process at risk Brown predicts Brexit 'crisis point' All you need to know about Brexit One member of Labour's shadow cabinet told the BBC Mr Blair's intervention was ""utterly unhelpful"". ""Lots of Labour voters voted for Brexit and this to them sounds like the metropolitan elite ignoring them,"" he said. ""The whole Tony Blair project was about being on the right side of public opinion. And now look at this. Are you telling me the Tony Blair of 1994 would have said this?"" Britain is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, but Mr Blair said it would be too late to change course by then. He has repeatedly argued that people are entitled to change their mind - either through another referendum or a general election - once the terms of its departure are clear. And he urged the current Labour leadership to adopt the same stance. The former prime minister said he was ""committed"" to seeing a Labour government elected, but added a ""qualification"" - which was that ""it's going to be extremely difficult in my view for Labour to deliver on its promises if it puts itself in exactly the same position as the Tory government's going to be on Brexit - because it will find it has less money to deal with the country's problems, that it's distracted by dealing with Brexit rather than the health service, jobs and living standards."" The UK would ""face a very challenging situation"" if it was leaving the EU under a Corbyn government, he added. Mr Blair said that if people voted again for Brexit, he would not push for a third poll - ""that concludes the argument"", he said. But he said that he would not support either of what he saw as the two most likely outcomes of negotiations - a Canada-style free trade deal or the UK being aligned with the EU but having no influence over key decisions. Vote Leave supporters in Sunderland celebrate the referendum result Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer says Labour will push for a deal that would preserve as many of the benefits of the single market and customs union as possible, as well as protecting workers' rights and the environment. But Mr Blair believes this is a ""confusing"" strategy and is not ""credible"". ""Far better to fight for the right for the country to re-think, demand that we know the full details of the new relationship before we quit the old one, go to the high ground on opposing Brexit and go after the Tories for their failures to tackle the country's real challenges. ""Make Brexit the Tory Brexit. Make them own it 100%. Show people why Brexit isn't, and never was, the answer."" Mr Blair - a longstanding critic of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - has ditched his business interests to take a more active role in British politics through his Institute for Global Change think tank. He has previously attacked Mr Corbyn's stance on Brexit - prompting the Labour leader to sayMr Blair should respect the result of the 2016 EU referendum. Richard Tice, co-chairman of the pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave campaign, said Mr Blair ""and his elite gang"" were ""still determined to stop Brexit"" and will lead the UK ""to the very bad deal which we had in the single market and the customs union"". InMr Blair's latest article published on his institute's website,external, he offered this advice to Jeremy Corbyn and his team: ""At every PMQs nail each myth of the Brexit campaign, say why the Tory divisions are weakening our country, something only credible if we are opposed to Brexit, not advocating a different Brexit, and challenge the whole farce head on of a prime minister leading our nation in a direction which even today she can't bring herself to say she would vote for. ""If we do leave Europe, the governing mind will have been that of the Tory right. UKIP uses Tony Blair on its campaign leaflets ""But, if Labour continues to go along with Brexit and insists on leaving the single market, the handmaiden of Brexit will have been the timidity of Labour."" Mr Blair's comments came as his institute issued a document highlighting developments in the UK since the Brexit vote, including a downgrade in economic forecasts.

"The prosecution has been outlining its case against Jake Killick, who is accused of multiple sexual offences A ""marauding predator"" repeatedly raped a woman during a crime spree in Norwich in which he sexually assaulted three other victims, a court has heard. Jake Killick, 23, ""sought to sexually assault and rape a number of different women as they were out in this city"", prosecutor Chris Paxton said. Norwich Crown Court heard the attacks, on 30 March 2017, followed a rape at a woman's house in Thetford in January. Mr Killick, who denies 16 charges, had recently been freed from prison. The jury was told that on leaving jail on 5 January, having served time for a previous attack, the defendant travelled to Thetford in Norfolk, where he raped the woman. She gave police a statement identifying Mr Killick on 28 March after finding she was pregnant, Mr Paxton said. Two days later, Mr Killick carried out the other attacks, the court was told. ""It was, we say, a crime spree of a marauding sexual predator,"" Mr Paxton said. The Norwich attacks began at 04:20 BST on Riverside Road, when the accused was said to have tried to drag a woman into a side street, sexually assaulting her in the process. Ten Bell Court in Norwich is where the accused is said to have raped one of his victims He then went into the city centre and, just after 06:00, repeatedly raped an 18-year-old woman after grabbing her near Chapelfield Gardens, the jury was told.

"This video can not be played White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders explains why Mr Trump rounded on his former adviser Steve Bannon It's not unusual for former political allies to fall out. It happens all the time. But normally it's done in private, and maybe hinted at in public. Not this time. Not with this President. This is a vicious knife fight between Donald Trump and his former campaign chief and White House Chief strategist being played out across social media. Other Trump family members and supporters are piling in too. Why? Because Steve Bannon has enraged Donald Trump with his description of a meeting that took place between the president's son, Don Jr, and son in law, Jared Kushner, with a Kremlin-linked, Russian lawyer as unpatriotic and treasonous. 11 explosive claims from new Trump book He's talked about how clear it is what the Special Counsel, Robert Mueller, is investigating - whether the Trump organisation was laundering dirty Russian money. Donald Trump has fired back in the way only he knows how. He has met fire with fire, accusing Bannon of having lost his mind, of not being that influential, of being a pretender. Lost his mind. Wow. So much for the spat. Does it matter? Well yes it does. Mr Mueller's team is investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the election To anyone who will listen, Trump and his supporters have insisted vociferously, angrily, indignantly that there is no evidence there was collusion. In onerecent interview with the New York Times,externalconducted over the New Year at Mar-a-Lago, Trump raised the subject again and again and again, denying collusion 16 times. Bannon's comments won't alter the course of the Mueller investigation - his team is quietly getting on with its investigation and following where the evidence takes them - remember there have already been three people charged in connection with this. But it matters in the war of words on social media. The narrative of Trump fidelis is that this is a 'nothingburger', or to change my food metaphor, sour grapes from the Democrats after their shock election defeat. Russia: The 'cloud' over the Trump White House Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Some ideological outriders have been saying that what the president should do is fire the special counsel, and bring his existentially threatening investigation to an end. But how much more difficult is that propaganda battle now to wage, when one of the principal actors from the Trump campaign, and the first six months of the Trump presidency talks openly and on the record about treasonous and unpatriotic behaviour. President Trump boards Air Force One with his then top aide, Steve Bannon The firing of Bannon last August the president did with a heavy heart. But it seems that hell hath no fury like a Bannon scorned. Or as President Johnson noted when dealing with the troublesome J Edgar Hoover in the 1960s - better to have him inside the tent pissing out than outside pissing in. Bannon is outside, and taking careful aim. How Trump cooled on Bannon But if the Bannon accusations are damaging (and they are), there is one aspect of this which will be causing quiet delight in the White House. If you cast your mind back to the summer, the appointment of General John Kelly (and the firing of Bannon) was meant to mark the moment when discipline was imposed on an unruly, freewheeling, chaotic administration. There would be a chain of command. Order. Discipline. Systems. Well Steve Bannon was gone, true; but he was still an important voice in the president's ear. Remember this iron law of governing. It doesn't matter what a person's job title is, it is what proximity they have to the centre of power. Bannon was on the outside, but he was still a source of counsel. Now he is not just on the outside, he is in outer darkness. This video can not be played Steve Bannon's three goals for the Trump presidency So what is Steve Bannon's next move? Well I make one confident prediction: it won't be to roll up his tent, pack his knapsack and skulk away with his head drooping. Bannon is campaigning to tear down the Republican establishment, and in Breitbart News he has a fairly formidable weapon with which to wage his war. Bannon wants candidates in this year's mid term election who will threaten the existing Republican leadership, who will follow the populist, nationalist policies that led Donald Trump to election victory in 2016. You have two men now violently fighting it out for the hearts and minds of the Americans who propelled Donald Trump to victory. When I came to work this morning I thought nothing would or could eclipse Donald Trump's tweet about Kim Jong-un. But now it seems that Mr Bannon and President Trump are locked in a battle over who's got the bigger button and whose is most powerful. Next move, Steve Bannon. And this is so much less life-threatening than real nuclear war.
