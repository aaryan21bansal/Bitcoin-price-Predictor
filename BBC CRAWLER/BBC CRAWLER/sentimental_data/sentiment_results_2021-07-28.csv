"The number of people on furlough has fallen sharply, with young people moving off the government scheme fastest, new figures show. At the end of June, 1.9 million people were still on furlough, the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and half a million fewer than in May. In the last three months, younger people came off furlough twice as fast as all other age brackets. Almost 600,000 under-25s had left the scheme in that time, the Treasury said. At the same time, more than a million people in hospitality and retail have left the scheme. Chancellor Rishi Sunak hailed the latest figures, saying they showed the government's policies were working. At the peak of the pandemic in May last year, nearly nine million people were on furlough. The wage support scheme has been extended several times, but will end on 30 September. What impact has the furlough scheme had? How many people are on furlough and what has it cost? Lucy Walker-Evans spent nine months on furlough before being made redundant Lucy Walker-Evans from Chepstow was working as an account manager for a global hotel chain when she was put on furlough in March last year. The 45-year-old spent the next nine months on paid leave, a time she found harrowing at first. ""It felt like you were skiving off work, you kept waiting for the phone to ring, constantly felt guilty,"" she told the BBC. ""There was lots of crying, lots of worry, lots of uncertainty."" In January, she was made redundant, but the time off had given her a chance to take stock. She realised she wanted a less stressful job and to work in charity, and by February she had managed to find a role working at a local shelter for young homeless people - a job she loves. ""Had I not been furloughed, I would never have had time to think about my career, so it was a transformational experience really,"" she told the BBC. ""I also had a year to learn to live on a lower salary - you realise you don't always need to chase the next pay rise."" Jo Shippen says her staff were ""understanding"" about being furloughed Jo Shippen, managing director of Hatters Promotions, a promotional merchandise and print company in Stockport, said the furlough scheme had been a ""godsend"" for her business and staff. ""Without the furlough scheme, I would have to have let people go, I just would not have managed,"" she said. ""I know for a fact I would not have been able to run my business. I would not have been able to embrace the change and I would not have been able to adapt in the way we have adapted."" Hatters was able to continue operating during the lockdowns, but it ""pivoted"" away from events and conferences to supplying products for companies looking to improve staff engagement. Ms Shippen said she had been ""really lucky"" that her staff were ""understanding"" about being furloughed. Under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS), known as furlough, staff receive 80% of their current salary, capped at Â£2,500 a month. Furlough will be wound down further from Sunday as the government asks firms to make a bigger contribution. Since 1 July, employers have been asked to contribute 10% towards the wages of furloughed workers for hours their staff do not work. That amount will rise to to 20% in August and September. The scheme, drawn up after lengthy talks with business groups and union leaders, has cost taxpayers almost Â£50bn to date, arousing fearstaxes will have to rise to pay for it. Since the start of the scheme, a cumulative total of 11.6 million jobs have been supported by the CJRS at various times. It is credited with stopping a spike in unemployment and some fear jobs will be lost when it ends. But according to Tony Wilson, director of the Institute of Employment Studies, the number of people on furlough has been ""dropping like a stone"" as industries start to reopen, while fears of a ""rush of redundancies"" have been unfounded. ""Either employees are being brought back to work by their employers or they are being taken off furlough and leaving the labour market,"" Mr Wilson told the BBC. ""That could be young people going into full-time education rather than seeking work."" However, he noted some industries would be more exposed than others when the scheme finally ends, while support jobs such as office cleaning, security and delivery could also be lost if workers do not go back to the office in the same numbers because of the rise in home working. ""The answer is not extending furlough, but re-skilling people to take up the record number of new vacancies being advertised,"" Mr Wilson said. The top five industry groups with the highest rates of jobs being put on furlough at 31 May 2021: Air passenger transport (57%) Hotels and similar accommodation (57%) Travel agency and tour operator activities (51%) Photographic activities (43%) Beverage serving activities (43%) Source: ONS Tom Waters, senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said there was ""no way to know exactly"" how many jobs would have been lost, and for how long, had the furlough scheme not existed. ""But given that unemployment has only risen slightly since the start of the pandemic, despite the biggest fall in GDP ever recorded, I think it's fair to say that furlough has had a very significant impact on job retention,"" he added. The Trades Union Congress said it was ""great"" so many people had been able to return to work from furlough, but added some firms still required it. ""Doubling the employer contribution is too much too soon, putting jobs at risk in some parts of the economy,"" said Frances O'Grady, the union's general secretary. Laura Kearsley, head of employment law at Nelsons Solicitors, believes a lot of employers will review their workforce in the light of the furlough support being removed. She thinks that might result in an uptick in redundancies. ""I think we will see a lot of employers trying to agree measures that keep people in a job, such as reductions in pay or reductions in hours, changes in operating models,"" she said. She had this advice for those fearing redundancy: ""Find out about your rights. Dig out your employment contract, whatever you signed when you joined. ""Also ask for a company handbook or policy information about redundancy, that should set out what you can expect if you do find yourself in that situation."" Are you currently on furlough?

"The Queen spends a week every year at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh and also holidays at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire A draft law in the Scottish Parliament was amended to exempt the Queen's land from measures to encourage green energy after her lawyers raised ""concerns"". The changes meant land owned by the royal household could not be subject to compulsory purchase orders without the monarch's approval. The correspondence between Buckingham Palace and the Scottish government wasfirst reported in The Guardian,external. Buckingham Palace insisted the process did not alter the nature of any laws. But Liberal Democrat MSP Willie Rennie said such lobbying - details of which were revealed in a Freedom of Information request by a party researcher - should have been declared. Queen is shown legislation by convention The Heat Networks Bill encouraged the use of underground pipes to heat homes and buildings rather than boilers powered by fossil fuels. The documents show correspondence took place between the Scottish government and Buckingham Palace around the procedure known as Queen's consent, where the monarch is given sight of legislation which affects her interests. The concerns centred on the potential use of compulsory purchase orders - a legal process by which land or property can be obtained, for instance for major infrastructure projects, without the the consent of the owner if deemed in the greater public interest. Queen's consent for the Heat Networks Bill was sought in January this year, the documents show, though the content of many exchanges was redacted. In February, officials working for Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse said the minister had agreed to amend the bill, which had been introduced at Holyrood the previous year. The officials said: ""Minister agreed to proposed amendment that would addressed [sic] concerns from Queen's solicitors"". The Queen owns 50,000 acres of land around Balmoral Castle, pictured, including grouse moors, forestry and farmland Setting out the need for the exemption in the Scottish Parliament, Mr Wheelhouse said that in the rare cases where the Queen's estate could be used for a heat network, different provisions were needed for the use of compulsory purchase orders on Her Majesty's land. He said licence holders for heat networks were likely to be private enterprises, as opposed to public authorities which are more typically involved with compulsory purchase. Mr Rennie said lobbying from Buckingham Palace should have been declared. He said: ""This research shows that Queen's consent isn't just some arcane legacy from parliament's past. It's a live process. Laws are secretly being changed behind Scotland's back as a result. ""That's not what people would expect in a democracy. I'm sure people will be shocked to see the Scottish government's willingness to pander to the process. ""Their readiness to hide it from public view shows they have no interest in acting transparently."" Mr Rennie added there should be ""no secret doors to changing the law"" and called on the Scottish government to fully share how the process influences law making. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ""The royal household can be consulted on bills in order to ensure the technical accuracy and consistency of the application of the bill to the Crown, a complex legal principle governed by statute and common law. ""This process does not change the nature of any such bill."" The Scottish government said its policy was that the Crown should be subject to regulatory requirements on the same basis as everyone else ""unless there is a legitimate reason for an exemption or variation."" A spokesman added: ""However, Crown consent is required by law if a bill impacts the private property or interests of the sovereign - and that is what happened in this case. ""In this instance, the Scottish government considered it appropriate to limit the exercise of compulsory purchase powers in relation to the Queen's private estates. ""The minister explained in detail to Parliament the reasons why it was appropriate to amend the bill in this way - with specific reference to the Queen's private estates - and Parliament agreed.""

"Teachers have faced lobbying from some parents over this year's grades, suggests research by a leading social mobility charity Parents of pupils in private schools or living in affluent areas of England were the most likely to put pressure on teachers over exam grades, suggests research fromthe Sutton Trust.,external Almost a quarter of private school teachers had been contacted by parents over A-level and GCSE grades, twice as many as in schools in deprived areas. Teachers submitted grades this year after exams were disrupted by Covid. Head teachers warned such lobbying was ""inappropriate"" and added stress. The research, based on a survey of 3,200 teachers, showed teachers in private schools came under the greatest pressure, with the highest number, 23%, reporting parents contacting them over exam grades. But there was also a social gap between state schools, with 17% of teachers in better-off areas facing pressure from parents, compared with 11% in disadvantaged areas. Teachers' grades used for cancelled exams Students offered cash to defer university places Parents urged to trust teachers over grades Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said parents lobbying for their children ""think they are doing the best for their children, but it is yet another issue which has added to the stress of an extremely stressful period"". But he reassured students that grades were based on objective evidence - ""rather than whose parents have the sharpest elbows"". Mr Barton had previously warned the education select committee that some parents were threatening to involve lawyers over grades and that schools were expecting a ""huge number of appeals"". A-level and GCSE results will be published in a couple of weeks Schools submitted their judgements on grades last month - and the final results will appear in a couple of weeks, with forecasts of an increase in top grades, which could put pressure on university places. Researchers found that half of students applying to university were worried that the disruption caused by the pandemic and the replacement grading system would negatively affect their chance of getting into their first choice university. But Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said parents and students should be confident of the fairness and ""rigour of this year's awarding processes and understand that it is inappropriate to put pressure on staff"". Schools have been able to use a range of evidence for grades, including ""mini-exam"" test papers, mock exams, homework and coursework - after the usual set of full exam papers were cancelled. The study from the Sutton Trust charity, which champions social mobility, shows how much variation there has been. Typically three or four ""mini-exams"" taken, but there were some schools taking more than six, while others were taking one, two or none at all. There were also warnings of the difficulties facing some pupils when they were studying from home - such as a lack of space to work and problems with internet connections and equipment. The report calls on universities to give extra consideration to students from disadvantaged backgrounds who narrowly missed their required grades. And there is a warning that this year's new students will need more support to settle in, after so many difficulties from the pandemic and when students might not have been able to visit universities on open days. ""This year's cohort of university applicants have faced almost two years of disrupted education. As we approach results day, it's vital that poorer students are not disadvantaged by the greater impact of the pandemic on them,"" said Sutton Trust founder Sir Peter Lampl. He also backed suggestions to change the timetable for university applications, so that students could apply once they knew their grades. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""Students have only been assessed on what they had been taught, supporting students who may not have had the opportunity to learn as much as they would do in a normal year and meaning that teachers have effectively made their assessments based on every student having their best day. ""No teacher should be put under undue pressure and grades are subject to wider internal checks in schools and external checks by exam boards to make sure they are a fair reflection of students' work.""

"UK car production is still much lower than it needs to be due to shortages of staff and semiconductors, the industry is warning. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said just 69,097 cars were produced in June, the lowest since 1953, with the exception of last year. The trade body is calling for urgent assistance to exempt staff pinged by the NHS Covid app. SMMT said the industry was ""desperately trying to get back to full capacity"". The picture ""didn't look particularly pretty"", the SMMT's chief executive Mike Hawes said, even though production numbers were up on June 2020, just after the first coronavirus lockdown ended. Van sales soar amid home delivery boom Nissan announces major UK electric car expansion Car sector calls for millions more charging points ""We were expecting to make just over 1.05 million cars this year, but due to semiconductor shortages and other issues, we will be about 100,000 cars lower,"" he said. ""It's difficult to give a picture of the whole industry, but anecdotally, some companies have between 5-30% of staff away self-isolating."" Ideally, the UK car industry needed to get back to producing between 1.2 million to 1.3 million vehicles a year, Mr Hawes added. UK car plants turned out 498,923 cars in the first half of 2021, 38.4% lower than the five-year average. This is equivalent to losses of about Â£8.5bn, the SMMT said. Some firms had resorted to reducing shifts, but the true impact of the staff shortages would not be felt until the annual car plant summer shutdowns ended, it added. The SMMT is calling on the government to bring forward the 16 August target date for exempting fully vaccinated adults from self-isolation, as well as introducing a ""test to release"" scheme to support those employees not yet fully vaccinated. ""If it can't be brought forward, what we need to know is, if you took a PCR test two to three days before 16 August, would it count?"" said Mr Hawes. There was plenty of demand for UK car exports, he added, but key issues for the industry included ""friction"" at the borders as a result of Brexit and rising logistics costs due to the pandemic. He said companies also felt consumers would only be persuaded to switch to electric cars if the charging infrastructure was there to support them. Mr Hawes said it was ""still a very difficult time for the industry"", and that the impact of the global semiconductor shortage was likely to last into 2022. Semiconductor makers cut production during lockdowns because ""it was unclear how long the European markets would be closed for [but] the shutdowns were not as long as anticipated"", Mr Hawes explained. ""Some of the countries that produce them now have rising Covid cases so we don't know how that will affect production going forward."" Well, the figures are better than last year's at least - but considering how badly the industry was affected by lockdowns last year, that really isn't saying very much. Demand isn't the problem. The bulk of UK-built cars are sold overseas, and manufacturers say there's plenty of appetite for them. But two issues, both linked to the pandemic, have got in the way of the recovery: the global semiconductor shortage and the shortage of staff resulting from the so-called 'pingdemic'. Ultimately, though, these are relatively short-term problems, and the industry will get over them. The bigger issue for UK car manufacturing is how to attract new investment. With governments in the UK and in Europe making plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars within a few years, the race is on to replace the production lines that will soon become obsolete. The hiatus caused by Brexit meant manufacturers were reluctant to commit to the UK, just as the electric cars revolution was taking shape. Now, with new investments announced at Nissan and Vauxhall, the situation has changed. But with other countries such as Germany having gone further, faster, the UK still has a lot to do to stake its claim to a significant share of the future electric car industry.

"International cruises will be able to start again from England from 2 August after a 16-month break. People arriving at UK ports who have been fully vaccinated in the US and the EU will also not have to quarantine, the UK government said. It is part of a plan torelax isolation rules for US and EU arrivals in the UK. An industry body said travel agencies, hotels, tour guides, port operators and other firms would benefit from cruises restarting. Domestic cruises have been allowed to run from May but international cruises have been prohibited. The government said international cruise travel advice ""will be amended to encourage travellers to understand the risks associated with cruise travel and take personal responsibility for their own safety abroad"". Cruise ships have been moored up around the world, waiting out the pandemic Under the new rules, from 04:00 BST on Monday of next week, 2 August, fully vaccinated US and EU travellers arriving from amber countries will not need to quarantine or take a test on day eight of their arrival. However, they will still need to take a pre-departure test and a PCR test on the second day after they arrive. Arrivals will also still need to complete a passenger locator form. Under-18s will be exempt from isolation, and some will not have to test, depending on their age. Separate rules will continue to apply forthose arriving from France.,externalTravellers who have been in France in the 10 days before arriving in England must quarantine for 10 days after arrival, and take a Covid test on or before day two and on or after day eight, even if fully vaccinated. The UK government said the overall rule changes would help to reunite family and friends whose loved ones live abroad. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the reopening of travel was ""progress we can all enjoy"". However, international cruises are unlikely to be available from Monday. On its website, P&O Cruises said following their UK summer staycations, its Britannia ship will begin planned western Mediterranean itineraries on 25 September, while its Iona vessel will launch on the same date. It said due to the current traffic light system, a ""number of itineraries have had to be cancelled"". Cruises on Ventura have been paused until 3 October 2021, while cruises on its Azura ship have been halted up until 10 December 2021. Some others have been delayed until 2022. Cunard's first UK cruise will sail on 13 August with international cruises beginning in October. Both firms are part of US giant Carnival cruises, which is one of the world's biggest cruise companies. The hugely profitable business was brought to its knees by Covid after regulators around the world stopped ships from sailing to try and limit outbreaks. There were outbreaks on various cruise liners, including some owned by Carnival. Richard Ballantyne, chief executive at the British Ports Association (BPA), said UK domestic cruises had demonstrated how ports and cruise lines could ""ensure the health and safety of passengers, crew and destinations"". He said the organisation is ""hopeful that the devolved administrations will follow suit shortly"" in allowing international cruises. The British Ports Association, which represents more than 400 ports, terminal operators and port facilities, said it was ""disappointed"" that arrivals from France still need to quarantine on arrival into England for ten days. The MSC Virtuosa was the first cruise ship to take passengers in UK waters in more than a year The global cruise line industry has beenone of the hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic. In 2019, it contributed more than $154bn (Â£110bn) to the global economy, according to the trade body Cruise Lines International Association, before the shops were all anchored due to the lockdown. Carnival, which made a profit of $3bn in 2019, reported a loss of $10bn in 2020 after its revenues plunged 73%. There is an increased risk of respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases on shipsdue to passengers and crew mixing from different parts of the world, according to experts. In 2020 there were major outbreaks on cruise ships, including the Carnival-owned Diamond Princess. According to the most recent statistics on data site Worldometer, 22 countries have still had fewer Covid cases than were found on the Diamond Princess, and 27 countries have had fewer than its 13 deaths.

"This video can not be played Grant Shapps explains the new rules People who were fully vaccinated in the EU or US will not need to isolate when coming to England, Scotland and Wales from an amber list country.

The UK government said the rule change would help to reunite family and friends whose loved ones live abroad. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it would apply to people who have been fully vaccinated with a jab approved by the EU or US, with the final dose at least 14 whole days before arrival. Travellers will still need to take either a lateral flow or PCR test pre-departure and a PCR test on the second day after they arrive. Under-18s will be exempt from isolation, and some will not have to test, depending on their age. It come as a further 27,734 cases were reported in the UK, bringing to an end a seven-day run of falling case numbers.

He added that the change would be ""carefully monitored by clinicians and kept under close review"". The Welsh government said the move posed ""clear public health risks"" - but its shared open border with England made it ""ineffective"" to have different arrangements. Welsh health minister Eluned Morgan said vaccines would reduce the risks but only if they were effective against any new variants of concern and cautioned against international travel for non-essential reasons this summer. In Northern Ireland, people vaccinated in the UK and travelling from amber list countries have not needed to self-isolate since 19 July,subject to testing,external.

So I'm very glad that is happening."" But Fiona Clarke in Portugal says the cost of Covid testing is still a barrier for her to visit family in Brighton. ""I think we'll look very carefully, we'll wait and see what happens with the testing,"" she says. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said she had ""real concerns"" over the plan. ""Each individual US state does things differently,"" she said. ""They don't have a National Health Service that has a vaccine programme like we do with the certifications. ""So we're really concerned about making sure that new variants do not come into the UK and that we do have a system that identifies where we have variants of Covid where infection is and we're able to isolate it.""

"An FFP3 mask - not the brand that failed safety tests A million masks supplied to the NHS as high grade did not meet the correct level of protection, tests have found. The masks, assumed to be the FFP3 type, also had invalid CE safety marking, the emblem used to signify compliance with European standards, a report said. The British Medical Association (BMA) said it was ""scandalous"" staff working in the pandemic had been put at risk. The Department of Health and Social Care said a strategy was in place to provide alternatives. FFP3 masks are worn by health professionals working in intensive care or when certain procedures are carried out that can generate aerosols. These are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19. Do doctors and nurses have enough protective gear? Million NHS masks withdrawn over safety concern Tests carried out in February show that masks branded ""Fang Tian"" and marked as FT-045A distributed for use in the NHS in England failed FFP3 requirements. The report issued by the British Standards Institution in June also stated the personal protective equipment (PPE) carried a ""false"" CE mark. It said they bore the discontinued identifying number for BSI Assurance UK Limited but it said the masks had not been certified by that body. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said 1.12 million of the masks were either in use in the NHS or in stores when they were withdrawn earlier this year. They said this represented a ""very small proportion"" of its overall stocks. In February officials said they had commissioned ""independent testing"" of the masks and that they would communicate the outcome ""shortly"". The results were only shared with NHS staff earlier this month. In the letter seen by the BBC, the DHSC said it was important to ""reassure"" users that the masks ""should have afforded protection equivalent to the level that the World Health Organisation recommends"" for performing aerosol-generating procedures. Test results showed the masks would have passed this lower FFP2 standard. But it is the higher FFP3 standard that is recommended in the UK. ""Even though they were eventually recalled, to know that more than one million masks were not providing the lifesaving protection they should have been shows what little regard has been given to the quality of some PPE and the procurement process it goes through,"" said Dr Vishal Sharma, consultants committee chair with the BMA doctors' union. ""There are serious questions that need answering: how did they end up within the supply chain, let alone being distributed to hospitals? Why were problems not identified earlier?

"Activision was sued by the state of California last week following a two-year investigation Staff at US gaming giant Activision Blizzard have staged a walk-out over accusations of sexism and harassment. The company behind Call of Duty and World of Warcraft was sued last week by the state of California over alleged violations of state workplace protection laws. Female employees described a ""frat boy"" culture, the lawsuit said. Activision denied the allegations claiming they were ""distorted and in many cases false"". On Tuesday, Activision's CEO said the initial response had been ""tone-deaf"". Employees protested outside the company's campus in Irvine on Wednesday. Some were pictured holding signs that read ""women's voices matter"" and ""fight bad guys in game, fight bad guys IRL"". On social media, a number of gamers said they would not login to anything Activision Blizzard during the walkout in solidarity with employees. The allegations against Activision were contained in a legal filing from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) following a two-year investigation. It included accusations of drunken harassment of female employees by male colleagues or supervisors, a culture of ignoring complaints and retaliation against women who made them, and widespread discrimination against women in areas such as equal pay and promotion opportunity. The lawsuit found that women make up only 20% of Activision's staff. More than 2,000 employees have signed an open letter calling for an end to mandatory arbitration in harassment cases, improvements in recruiting practices and creation of a diversity and equity task force. Chief Executive Bobby Kotick said on Tuesday that the company will ""continue to investigate each and every claim"" of sexism at Activision ""and will not hesitate to take decisive action"". ""Anyone found to have impeded the integrity of our processes for evaluating claims and imposing appropriate consequences will be terminated,"" he said. Mr Kotick added that Activision's games criticised as being sexist, will also be removed following complaints from staff and gamers. He said that there would be listening sessions for staff to ""speak out and share areas for improvement"".

"International cruises will be able to start again from England from 2 August after a 16-month break. People arriving at UK ports who have been fully vaccinated in the US and the EU will also not have to quarantine, the UK government said. It is part of a plan torelax isolation rules for US and EU arrivals in the UK. An industry body said travel agencies, hotels, tour guides, port operators and other firms would benefit from cruises restarting. Domestic cruises have been allowed to run from May but international cruises have been prohibited. The government said international cruise travel advice ""will be amended to encourage travellers to understand the risks associated with cruise travel and take personal responsibility for their own safety abroad"". Cruise ships have been moored up around the world, waiting out the pandemic Under the new rules, from 04:00 BST on Monday of next week, 2 August, fully vaccinated US and EU travellers arriving from amber countries will not need to quarantine or take a test on day eight of their arrival. However, they will still need to take a pre-departure test and a PCR test on the second day after they arrive. Arrivals will also still need to complete a passenger locator form. Under-18s will be exempt from isolation, and some will not have to test, depending on their age. Separate rules will continue to apply forthose arriving from France.,externalTravellers who have been in France in the 10 days before arriving in England must quarantine for 10 days after arrival, and take a Covid test on or before day two and on or after day eight, even if fully vaccinated. The UK government said the overall rule changes would help to reunite family and friends whose loved ones live abroad. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the reopening of travel was ""progress we can all enjoy"". However, international cruises are unlikely to be available from Monday. On its website, P&O Cruises said following their UK summer staycations, its Britannia ship will begin planned western Mediterranean itineraries on 25 September, while its Iona vessel will launch on the same date. It said due to the current traffic light system, a ""number of itineraries have had to be cancelled"". Cruises on Ventura have been paused until 3 October 2021, while cruises on its Azura ship have been halted up until 10 December 2021. Some others have been delayed until 2022. Cunard's first UK cruise will sail on 13 August with international cruises beginning in October. Both firms are part of US giant Carnival cruises, which is one of the world's biggest cruise companies. The hugely profitable business was brought to its knees by Covid after regulators around the world stopped ships from sailing to try and limit outbreaks. There were outbreaks on various cruise liners, including some owned by Carnival. Richard Ballantyne, chief executive at the British Ports Association (BPA), said UK domestic cruises had demonstrated how ports and cruise lines could ""ensure the health and safety of passengers, crew and destinations"". He said the organisation is ""hopeful that the devolved administrations will follow suit shortly"" in allowing international cruises. The British Ports Association, which represents more than 400 ports, terminal operators and port facilities, said it was ""disappointed"" that arrivals from France still need to quarantine on arrival into England for ten days. The MSC Virtuosa was the first cruise ship to take passengers in UK waters in more than a year The global cruise line industry has beenone of the hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic. In 2019, it contributed more than $154bn (Â£110bn) to the global economy, according to the trade body Cruise Lines International Association, before the shops were all anchored due to the lockdown. Carnival, which made a profit of $3bn in 2019, reported a loss of $10bn in 2020 after its revenues plunged 73%. There is an increased risk of respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases on shipsdue to passengers and crew mixing from different parts of the world, according to experts. In 2020 there were major outbreaks on cruise ships, including the Carnival-owned Diamond Princess. According to the most recent statistics on data site Worldometer, 22 countries have still had fewer Covid cases than were found on the Diamond Princess, and 27 countries have had fewer than its 13 deaths.

"The government has already released an artists's impression of the new vessel A new national flagship yacht, designed to promote the UK around the globe, will cost up to Â£250m, the defence secretary has said. A government document published last week,externalput the budget at Â£150m, while reports said it could reach Â£200m. But Ben Wallace has now given ""a firm price"" for the ""floating embassy"" of between Â£200m and Â£250m. Labour's shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said the party would scrap the government's ""pet project"". Boris Johnson announced the plan for the yacht in May, which will be used for hosting events like trade fairs and diplomatic meetings. New national ship to showcase best of British - PM Ministry of Defence to pay for 'national yacht' Watch: Royal yacht 'silly populist nonsense', says Lord Clarke The vessel, which is yet to have a name, will be the successor to the Royal Yacht Britannia, which was retired in 1997 after 44 years in service. It will be funded from the Ministry of Defence's budget. The prime minister said the ship would reflect ""the UK's burgeoning status as a great, independent maritime trading nation"" post-Brexit. But Mr Thomas-Symonds said the latest costing showed the PM had ""lost control of his vanity yacht"", calling for the money to be invested ""wisely"" on projects such as tackling crime and anti-social behaviour. An ""engagement day"" to discuss the new flagship was held in Greenwich, London, on Wednesday, with Mr Wallace giving a speech. He said there had been ""a lot of reporting around this ship, not all of it accurate"" so wanted to set out the government's ""basic aims"" for the vessel. The defence secretary added: ""Subject to working through bids, competition and technology, I aim to commission the ship for between Â£200m and Â£250m on a firm price. ""The competition will run until the end of October. I hope to announce the winners in December."" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace confirmed the costings during a speech on Wednesday After that, Mr Wallace said he wanted construction to begin ""in a British shipyard as early as next year and have a ship in the water by 2024 or 2025"". He added: ""That's an ambitious timescale but this is an ambitious project, the chance to break the mould and break some records to get things done in the national interest."" Mr Wallace previously defended the cost of the ship to the MoD, telling the Commons Defence Committee it was less than 0.1% of the Â£13bn defence budget for shipbuilding over the next 10 years. But Labour's shadow Treasury minister, Bridget Phillipson, called on the government to show ""a real focus on value for money at every stage"" of the project and ensure it supported jobs in UK shipyards.

"Ministers will allow fully vaccinated travellers from the EU and US to avoid quarantine when they arrive in England from 2 August Currently, people who have been fully vaccinated in the UK do not have to isolate when travelling from the US and EU But that exemption does not apply to people who have been vaccinated outside the UK The new rules will come in from 04:00 BST on Monday 2 August The travel industry has welcomed the relaxation of the rules but has called for the government to go further Health Secretary Sajid Javid says it is too early to see a long-term trend in the falling number of positive UK cases Boris Johnson says 16 August is ""nailed onâ as the end of isolation for fully-vaccinated people who have contact with a positive Covid case Olympic host city Tokyo records its largest number of new Covid infections in a single day since the pandemic began Edited by Katie Wright We're now bringing our live page to a close for today, but will be back tomorrow. Thanks for joining us. The page was written today by Jen Meierhans, Richard Morris, Sinead Wilson and Alex Therrien. The editor was Katie Wright. We'll soon be bringing our live page to a close. But before we do, here is a round-up of the main coronavirus stories from today. Reality Check From Monday, people who have been fully vaccinated in the US will
no longer have to quarantine on arrival in England. So, how many people have been travelling between the two
countries? Numbers have obviously fallen dramatically due to the pandemic. Data from the UK aviation authority shows that in May (the most
recent available figures) there were just over 80,000 arrivals from and
departures to the US. That compares to more than two million in May 2019. Itâs important to point out that while restrictions are being
lifted for double-jabbed US visitors to the UK, it is not a reciprocal
arrangement. Itâs currently not possible for people to travel to the US from
the UK,apart from US citizens and a few other exemptions.,external And the UK was moved to the highest risk level by the US
government just 10 days ago - with Americans warned not to travel to the UK
because of the prevalence of the Delta variant. Read moreabout the UK's travel rules. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The run of
day-on-day falls in detected cases has come to an end with 27,724 infections
confirmed by the government on Wednesday, up from just over 23,500 on Tuesday. But that was
always going to happen. The total still represents a fall of more than a third on last Wednesdayâs figure so it should not be interpreted as a rise in any real
sense. What is even
more encouraging perhaps is that the growth in hospital cases continues to
slow. The seven-day average has yet to start falling, but if current trends continue that will
happen soon, perhaps before the NHS hits 1,000 admissions a day. During the
winter peak it hit 4,000. The big
unknown is what happens next. Most scientists think we are in for a period
where infection rates bobble along going up and down for the rest of the summer
â a sustained period of mini peaks. The impact of
the 19 July mixing has yet to be felt for one thing. But this is
unchartered territory. There is also a hope that the level of immunity built up
in the population, coupled with summer meaning people are outdoors more and
continued vigilance by the public - the amount of daily contacts we are having
is still much less than what it was before the pandemic hit â could keep
driving rates down. North-east England is ""not out of the woods"" despite the region's fall in coronavirus cases, health chiefs have warned. The average infection rate across the region is 566 per 100,000 people - down from 878 on Friday, according to Newcastle City Council. However, its director of public health says the impact of easing restrictions on 19 July was not yet clear.The city previously had the highest infection rate in the country. Prof Eugene Milne told BBC Newcastle the ""upwards pressure"" in positive cases in the city ""began to diminish at the beginning of July"" with several factors likely to be involved. He suggested the numbers might have been affected by people testing themselves less often and by students having left the city for their summer breaks. He says: ""We know the city was very busy last weekend. We're waiting with bated breath to see if there is an impact from increased mixing. ""We're nowhere near down to the levels we saw last summer and everybody knows what happened after that so I think we need to be awfully careful. We're not out of the woods."" Read more here. Paul Ludlow, president of P&O Cruises, says he is ""delighted"" at the government's decision to restart international cruising. He says the company plans to pick up international cruises again from the end of September to give the company a little bit of time âto work through the detailâ. This is the ""green light that so many of our guests have been looking for over the last year or so"", he adds. He says the industry made a lot of headlines at the start of the pandemic when people were stranded on ships but they have been working hard since then to provide safe experiences. Today's announcement is great news for the economy, he adds, and for all the suppliers who service the sector. No decision has been made on Scotland's quarantine rules for people from the EU and US, the country's government has said. It comes after the UK government announced that fully vaccinated visitors will not need to quarantine upon arrival in England. The travel industry had campaigned for a rule change so that people living abroad could more easily visit. A Scottish government spokesperson said holiday travel remained ""risky and subject to sudden change"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said this morning, before the announcement, that discussions were ongoing. Her advice is not to travel abroad on holiday, unless it is absolutely necessary. Cruise ships have been restricted to domestic travel in the UK International cruises have been given the go-ahead to restart from ports in England from next Monday. The announcement comes as the UK government scraps the requirement to quarantine for double-jabbed US and EU citizens arriving in the UK. It means, for the first time since the pandemic started, cruises can start in England, call at foreign ports and then return to England without vaccinated passengers having to self-isolate. Minister for Aviation and Maritime, Robert Courts,tweeted,externalhe was ""delighted"" by the news. New government advice for cruising,externalasks travellers to make a personal assessment, look at their vaccination status and their insurance to make sure they are protected. President Samia Suluhu Hassan has assured Tanzanians that the Covid-19 vaccines are safe People in Tanzania are being actively encouraged to get Covid-19 vaccinations in a dramatic change of policy for one of Africa's most populous countries. A vaccination drive is now under way after the country's new president rejected her predecessor's Covid scepticism. President Samia Suluhu Hassan has been pictured receiving her vaccination. The man she replaced, John Magufuli, played down the virus, calling for prayer instead of vaccines and masks. After he died in March of heart complications, Ms Samia set up a task force on coronavirus. Officially, the country of 58 million people has recorded 29 deaths with coronavirus and 858 cases butthere are fears the true numbers are far greater. We've been hearing reaction to the news that double-jabbed arrivals from the EU and US will no longer have to quarantine on arrival in England from 2 August. Patricia Duncan, 70, has been speaking to us from Spain where she has lived for 19 years. She says: ""Normally I travel three or four times a year to see my family and friends, and itâs been a long time. So Iâm very glad that is happening. As soon as I have a date, I shall be on there to get a flight. âItâs good because my daughter has
finally got a date for her operation, sheâs been waiting for two years or more.
I was hoping to go to England to be there, to help her out. âI have another friend with mental
health issues who is desperate for me to visit. She adds: Although our (case) numbers have risen lately, theyâre small numbers. So Iâm very happy to hear
about the news."" The science backs up the government's decision to change the rules for fully vaccinated travellers from the US and EU, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has said. From 04:00 BST on Monday, people who have been fully vaccinated in the EU or US will not need to isolate when coming to England from an amber list country. Asked about whether the decision was scientifically justified, Prof Adam Finn told the BBC News Channel, ""yes, it does"". He said: ""This has been coming for some time and we now do have fairly solid evidence that these vaccines don't just stop people getting sick - they actually do reduce their risk of getting infected and passing the infections on to others. ""They're not by any means perfect in that regard, but it kind of makes logical sense that people who have been fully immunised pose a much lower risk than those who haven't in terms of carrying the virus around."" He said the change had ""perhaps happened a little bit sooner than some of us would have liked"" because there were still ""quite a lot of people"" who had not been able to get both vaccine doses, such as younger adults. But nonetheless, it was ""good news"" that governments were beginning to talk to each other and reach agreement on this, he added. Savid Javid visiting a vaccination centre in London Health Secretary Sajid Javid says it is too early to see a long-term trend in the falling number of positive Covid cases in the UK. Speaking before today's data was released, he said the figures were ""encouraging"" but ""no-one really knows where cases will eventually end up"" and ministers ""remain cautious"". On a visit to a vaccination centre in Little Venice, London, Javid acknowledged that ""the one area where we need to do more collectively"" is to get 18 to 29-year-olds to take up the offer of a jab. And he says young people should think of Covid-19 vaccines as ""liberating"". He adds that while it will not be compulsory for close contacts of Covid cases to be tested from 16 August, it will still be recommended. Despite the rise in UK cases compared with yesterday, the seven-day average is still 36.1% down compared with the previous week. In contrast, the seven-day average for deaths is up by the same percentage, 36.1%, while hospitalisations are up 23.4%. Elsewhere in the figures, there were 151,851 second doses of the vaccine delivered and 35,446 first doses. A further 27,734 cases and 91 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have been reported in the UK. It brings to an end a seven-day streak of cases falling in the UK, although they remain below 30,000 for a fourth straight day. On Tuesday there were 23,511 cases and 131 deaths. Today's figures compare with 44,104 cases and 73 deaths a week ago. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner, who's on a visit to Hull, says her party has "" real concerns"" about the easing of quarantine rules because ""there doesn't seem to be a system in place yet for an international vaccine passport"". She's raising particular concerns about arrivals from the US saying each state there ""does things differently"" and America does not have an NHS ""that has a vaccine programme like we do with the certifications"". ""So we're really concerned about making sure that new variants do not come into the UK and that we do have a system that identifies where we have variants of Covid where infection is and we're able to isolate it"" she adds. She says unless that happens ""we risk going backwards again and our economy will suffer as a result of that"".  This video can not be played Shapps on opening up England to visitors from US and Europe Here's a little more from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who has rejected criticism that the government has been too slow to allow double-vaccinated visitors from Europe and the US to avoid self-isolation. Passengers fully vaccinated with vaccines authorised by the EMA and FDA in Europe - with the exception of France, and the US will be able to travel to England without having to quarantine on arrival from 04:00 on 2 August Shapps said the government would âalways put the security of our country firstâ. He said the government had needed to wait for other countries âto catch upâ with the UKâs vaccination programmes and had wanted to make sure the approach of allowing double-vaccinated UK nationals to avoid isolation when returning home had been working before opening it up further. He said the government would be assessing whether other countries could join the exemption from self-isolation during August. Asked if the self-isolation rules would be relaxed for the rest of the world, he said the government would be âlooking at what happens with other countries, in particular where we can rely on their data and their vaccines that they are using, so we will be looking at that next month, during August and opening that up as quickly as is practicable and is safe to do"". First Minister Mark Drakeford says it will be hard for Wales not to follow England's lead and end quarantine restrictions for double-jabbed EU and US citizens arriving in the UK. But he is calling for assurances that the UK government can ensure the vaccine status of travellers. He says he would have preferred a more precautionary approach and thinks international travel is still best avoided. There is  âpractical detail that we donât yet have available to us"" he says and the Welsh government will want to be confident that arrangements have been made ""properly and reliably"".  Airlines are welcoming the lifting of quarantine restrictions for fully vaccinated travellers to England from the US and the EU but called for ministers to go further. Airlines UK described it as a ""lifeline"" for businesses reliant on international travel and described the move as  ""a positive step that should pave the way for a return to unrestricted travel"". But the company says more low-risk countries should be moved from the amber to the green list next week. Virgin Atlantic agrees, saying the UK is ""falling behind"" the EU and the US with a ""continued overly cautious approach"" towards international travel. It's warning of the risk to the economy and jobs unless the travel rules are further relaxed. British Airways says the relaxation of restrictions will help reunite families. In a statement, its chairman and chief executive, Sean Doyle, said ""our own trials have proved it's quick and easy to check travellers are fully vaccinated and can safely enter the UK"". Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said he expects the US to become more relaxed about allowing Britons to visit ""in time"". Asked by broadcasters whether he was confident the US and Europe would reciprocate after the government announced fully vaccinated travellers from there could come to England without needing to quarantine, he said: ""It will depend. We can only set the rules at our end, and that has always been the case. ""People should always check the rules on the other side. ""I've just spoken to my US counterpart today and in the US they still have an executive order which prevents travel from the UK, from Europe, from several other countries to the US. ""So we're saying, 'You can come here, you can come visit, you can come see friends, you can come as a tourist if you've been double vaccinated and follow the rules without quarantine'. ""We can't change that on the other side but we do expect that in time they will release that executive order, which was actually signed by the previous president, and bans inward travel."" There must be a system to assess passengers' Covid status before they travel to prevent congestion at airports whenEU and US arrivals are exempt from quarantine, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) says. Tom Thackray, CBI director of Iinfrastructure, says: 
âRestriction-free international travel will be a vital piece of the recovery jigsaw, and ending quarantine requirements for fully-vaccinated arrivals from the US and EU is a huge step towards that goal."" He says the news will come as a ""significant boost to the beleaguered travel industry"" while also restoring important business links with key trading partners. He adds: âThe task now is to implement these changes as rapidly and smoothly as possible, which should include an efficient pre-travel system of assessing passengersâ Covid-status to prevent congestion at airports.â Â© 2025 BBC.

He says he would have preferred a more precautionary approach and thinks international travel is still best avoided. There is  âpractical detail that we donât yet have available to us"" he says and the Welsh government will want to be confident that arrangements have been made ""properly and reliably"".  Airlines are welcoming the lifting of quarantine restrictions for fully vaccinated travellers to England from the US and the EU but called for ministers to go further. Airlines UK described it as a ""lifeline"" for businesses reliant on international travel and described the move as  ""a positive step that should pave the way for a return to unrestricted travel"". But the company says more low-risk countries should be moved from the amber to the green list next week. Virgin Atlantic agrees, saying the UK is ""falling behind"" the EU and the US with a ""continued overly cautious approach"" towards international travel. It's warning of the risk to the economy and jobs unless the travel rules are further relaxed. British Airways says the relaxation of restrictions will help reunite families. In a statement, its chairman and chief executive, Sean Doyle, said ""our own trials have proved it's quick and easy to check travellers are fully vaccinated and can safely enter the UK"". Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said he expects the US to become more relaxed about allowing Britons to visit ""in time"". Asked by broadcasters whether he was confident the US and Europe would reciprocate after the government announced fully vaccinated travellers from there could come to England without needing to quarantine, he said: ""It will depend. We can only set the rules at our end, and that has always been the case. ""People should always check the rules on the other side. ""I've just spoken to my US counterpart today and in the US they still have an executive order which prevents travel from the UK, from Europe, from several other countries to the US. ""So we're saying, 'You can come here, you can come visit, you can come see friends, you can come as a tourist if you've been double vaccinated and follow the rules without quarantine'. ""We can't change that on the other side but we do expect that in time they will release that executive order, which was actually signed by the previous president, and bans inward travel."" There must be a system to assess passengers' Covid status before they travel to prevent congestion at airports whenEU and US arrivals are exempt from quarantine, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) says. Tom Thackray, CBI director of Iinfrastructure, says: 
âRestriction-free international travel will be a vital piece of the recovery jigsaw, and ending quarantine requirements for fully-vaccinated arrivals from the US and EU is a huge step towards that goal."" He says the news will come as a ""significant boost to the beleaguered travel industry"" while also restoring important business links with key trading partners. He adds: âThe task now is to implement these changes as rapidly and smoothly as possible, which should include an efficient pre-travel system of assessing passengersâ Covid-status to prevent congestion at airports.â Â© 2025 BBC.

"Stamp duty holiday withdrawals have ""taken some of the heat out"" of the UK housing market, according to the Nationwide. The building society said house prices dropped slightly in July compared with June, but were still 10.5% higher than a year ago. Any stamp duty savings have been outstripped by rising prices. But the tax break, alongside the search for space, has created a housing boom during the pandemic. The mortgage lender said the typical home cost Â£244,229 in July. How much stamp duty will I have to pay now? Why house prices are rising so fast in a pandemic 'We sold up, moved to the sea and are living the Zoom dream' Annual house price increases were at a 17-year high in June, and slowed slightly in July. Breaks for stamp duty, or the equivalent tax, were withdrawn in Wales at the end of June, and became less generous in England and Northern Ireland at the same time. The tax will return to pre-pandemic status by October. ""The tapering of stamp duty relief in England is also likely to have taken some of the heat out of the market,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. ""This provided a strong incentive to complete house purchases before the end of June, especially for higher-priced properties."" The number of homes being sold every month has hit levels not seen since comparable records began in 2005. Mr Gardner said the market for large properties had surged, while sales of flats had fallen. The number of transactions involving properties bought for Â£500,000 or more increased by 37% over the 12 months to March, compared with a rise of 2% for all properties. The search for space, indoors and outside, had driven demand for larger homes in which to live and work during the pandemic. Flats, without gardens and - in some cases - with issues over cladding and fire safety, have been more difficult to sell. The outlook may improve for first-time buyers The Nationwide said there were signs that there would still be activity in the housing market, even if jobs were lost, the economy struggled and Covid support schemes were wound down. Iain McKenzie, chief executive of The Guild of Property Professionals, said: ""It is going to be interesting to see how the demand for properties changes as we come into the autumn. ""This will give us the opportunity to evaluate just how successful the stamp duty holiday has been at keeping the property market buoyant since the start of the pandemic.""Â Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country, said: ""While the clamour in recent times has been for bigger properties with more outdoor space, we may see luxury apartments start to come back into vogue as the drift back to the office starts to gather pace in the big cities.""

"The government's Covid test scheme to prevent workers having to self-isolate is a ""pointless solution"" because it excludes supermarket workers, according to the boss of the Iceland chain. ""It's only depot and factory workers so it only fixes half the supply chain issue,"" Richard Walker told the BBC. Smaller food delivery firms have also complained they still do not know if they qualify for the new scheme. Daily testing for some critical sectors in England was launched on Monday. The government's move came after several industries warned of staffing shortages caused by 10-day isolations after people were ""pinged"" - identified as having had close contact with someone who has Covid. UK pingdemic response chaotic, say food firms More pinged workers to get daily Covid tests Mr Walker said that there is ""plenty of stock to go around"" but that his staff are having to work ""very hard to keep the show on the road"", with the problems of the driver shortage and staff having to isolate. ""There's a lot of red tape in getting these testing centres set up, it's a nightmare so with three weeks to go, in my view, it's simply not worth the effort."" He said Iceland had still not received any information regarding additional testing centres for its depot workers and that the plans ""feel a bit like spin"". So far, over 200 testing sites have started testing critical workers, who are exempt from self-isolation, according to figures from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). It said 800 sites were currently being set up, and it expected these to be in use by the end of the week if all the organisations take up the offer of testing. In total 2,000 sites are expected to be up and running by the end of August. However, from 16 August, anyone in England who is fully vaccinated - and unvaccinated under-18s - will be able to takePCR tests,externalinstead of self-isolating if they are pinged. Similar rules come into force in Scotland from 9 August - and in Wales from 7 August. Sainsbury's said on Tuesday that the daily contact Covid testing was now up and running at three of its depots. While Morrisons said of its largest depots, three would be included in the initial 15 priority testing sites. Morrisons said it was in the process of contacting staff who have been double vaccinated and pinged to see if they would like to move to a daily testing regime, which is voluntary. Fewer Iceland staff are being pinged now and Mr Walker said with the entry to peak holiday season and all of their sick pay used up, ""it feels to me like potentially they're starting to delete the app en masse, in numbers that they weren't previously doing, and to be honest who can blame them."" Krissy Fremont says her company has been left ""completely in the dark"" Krissy Fremont from wholesalers Birchall Foodservice, which delivers food to schools, hospices, care homes, restaurants, hotels and cafes, also said the Burnley-based company was ""completely in the dark"". ""There's still a total lack of detail,"" she told the BBC. On Monday, the government said organisations were being contacted by NHS Test and Trace so they could mobilise sites this week to test up to 10,000 food service staff. But Birchall Foodservice said it had not received any communication about whether they are included in the scheme. Ms Fremont, who has had to fill in for isolating staff by doing driving shifts herself, said she had ""absolutely no certainty"" that the company was able to use the scheme or its testing facilities. She has emailed the government for clarification, but so far has only received an automated response. Manchester based fish, meat and poultry traders J& B Wilde is also struggling with staff shortages and has not been contacted by the government about the scheme. Four businesses that Mariella Gabbutt's company trades with have closed because of Covid Owner Mariella Gabbutt told the BBC two of her 18 employees had to isolate after being pinged by NHS Test and Trace and had to take holiday pay. ""Both cut chicken so if they had both been pinged at the same time, I'd have had to close the chicken room,"" she explained. Four other businesses she trades with have closed because of Covid and the problems with driver shortages which have also increased her delivery costs by 25%. ""If you're self-employed you just can't afford to have 10 days off, it would close the business,"" Ms Gabbutt added. The chief executive of the Federation of Wholesale Distributors, James Bielby, told the BBC the scheme was ""not really an option"" for some smaller businesses for whom supervised on-site testing was ""not a practical solution."" ""It requires a commitment of staff and space which would be very onerous for them and will be a challenge for Cash and Carry depots for example,"" he said. Smaller wholesalers can apply for specific exemptions for fully-vaccinated individual members of staff in critical roles, but there might be a 24-hour delay in hearing back whether they can do so. ""The delay in giving them access to the scheme means more expense, more food wasted if it cannot be delivered, and more small businesses having to turn customers away,"" Mr Bielby added. Jayne Paterson says her business is finding it very tough Jayne Paterson, owner of Paterson's Fruit and Veg, which supplies care homes and restaurants in Cumbria and South Scotland, also says she is yet to receive any clarification or information from the government. ""We've been able to manage our own isolating staff but we've been losing customers from their staff having to isolate - which costs us Â£800 a week in lost sales to each restaurant we supply."" ""I'd like to think the daily testing will keep going as it's what is allowing us to trade but we're still finding it very tough,"" she added. Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, told the BBC that the scheme was ""very limited."" ""We now know how to get into the exemption scheme but you have to jump through a lot of hoops and be able to set up a sophisticated testing operation at your site."" ""To do that with just three weeks before the isolation rules end feels like a very long way from exemptions that could have made a proper difference earlier on,"" he added.

"People must be protected from excessive pricing for public electric car charging, MPs have said. Charging an electric car at home is much cheaper than using public charge points. This could put pressure on people who are less able to afford it, the Transport Select Committee said. The government also needs to make charging infrastructure accessible and reliable, and make sure people in rural areas have equal access, the MPs added. The UK plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and hybrids by 2035. That should mean that most cars on the road in 2050 are either electric, use hydrogen fuel cells, or some other non-fossil fuel technology. Why electric cars will take over sooner than you think Have you been affected by the issues in this story?Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external However, at present there is a disparity between how much it costs to charge a car at home compared to public charging, which is more expensive. Consumers need to be protected from excessive charges, the Transport Committee said. Property developers should also be required to provide public charging points, and councils should make sure charging infrastructure is built, the MPs added. ""Charging electric vehicles should be convenient, straightforward and inexpensive and drivers must not be disadvantaged by where they live or how they charge their vehicles,"" said committee chair Huw Merriman. In addition, drivers who live in rural or remote areas or who do not have off-street parking ""risk being left behind"", the committee said. The committee said industry must use pricing ""to change consumer charging behaviour to a 'little but often' approach and at times when the National Grid can meet total demand"". Graeme Cooper, head of future markets at National Grid, said that the energy network operator was ""working with government to map out where critical grid capacity is needed to enable the faster roll out of charging points"". ""There will be an uptick in demand for energy so we need to ensure that we are future proofing, putting the right wires in the right place for future demand."" He said National Grid would have to ramp up capacity to help achieve the UK's net zero goals, both by making it smarter, but also putting in more physical infrastructure. Preparing for a revolution is never easy - but with the sale of new petrol and diesel cars due to end in 2030, that's exactly what lies ahead. MPs have set out some clear concerns - notably that people who don't have access to off-street parking or who live in remote areas might struggle to charge electric cars, and would be obliged to pay more for the power they use. They want the government to make sure this doesn't happen. One issue raised is that different public charging networks currently have their own payment and operating systems, making it difficult for drivers to swap from one to another. They want guarantees that as networks grow, they will be made more compatible - and that pricing will be transparent. Then there's what happens when millions of electric cars make demands on the electricity grid. Demand for power will rise, and MPs have voiced concerns that this could lead to blackouts in parts of the country. But as the report itself points out, industry bodies are confident that new technologies which allow cars to be charged when pressure on the grid is light, and even feed power back at peak times, should help the network to manage. Nevertheless, these are all legitimate concerns. What seems clear is that MPs feel the government needs to provide more coordination and guidance, to ensure that within a few years people will be able to buy electric cars, use them, and charge them with a minimum of fuss. An orderly revolution, in fact. Jack Cousens, head of roads policy for the AA, said; ""For most drivers, the opportunity to charge an EV in their garage, on their driveway or in a dedicated parking space offers cheaper running costs. ""However, for the 30% of homeowners with no access to dedicated off-street parking or workplace charging, they have no choice but to pay the rates set on the public charging network."" ""On the road to electrification, we cannot allow one group of drivers to benefit while others struggle - in effect, a two-tier system of have and have-nots."" Benjamin Sovacool, professor of energy policy at the University of Sussex Business School, said the pricing of charging ""is a concern"", and that electric vehicles ""benefit some people more than others"". Lower income areas, especially rural areas, spend about twice as much of their income on mobility already, he said. The UK government was approached for comment.

"This video can not be played Grant Shapps explains the new rules People who were fully vaccinated in the EU or US will not need to isolate when coming to England, Scotland and Wales from an amber list country.

Travellers will still need to take either a lateral flow or PCR test pre-departure and a PCR test on the second day after they arrive.

People fully-jabbed in the EU or USwill not need to isolatewhen coming to England, Scotland and Wales from an amber list country The change is introduced from04:00 BST on Monday Travellers willstill take a pre-departure test, and a PCR teston or before day twoafter arrival They will need to have taken a vaccineapproved by the European Medicines Agency, or US Food and Drug Administration Internationalcruises can depart from England once more, with new guidance Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said the change to the rules would provide ""a boost for the tourism sector and wider economy while ensuring public health is protected"". He added that the change would be ""carefully monitored by clinicians and kept under close review"". The Welsh government said the move posed ""clear public health risks"" - but its shared open border with England made it ""ineffective"" to have different arrangements. Welsh health minister Eluned Morgan said vaccines would reduce the risks but only if they were effective against any new variants of concern and cautioned against international travel for non-essential reasons this summer. In Northern Ireland, people vaccinated in the UK and travelling from amber list countries have not needed to self-isolate since 19 July,subject to testing,external. The Stormont Executive is set to consider the policy of allowing those vaccinated in the US and EU to enter Northern Ireland without quarantine on Thursday. Children under 18 who are ordinarily resident in the US and EUwill be exempt from isolation Thoseunder five years old do not need to testat all Children between the ages of five and 10 will only need to completea PCR test on day two after arrival And 11 to 17-year-olds will needa pre-departure test and a PCR testbefore or on day two Airlines UK, which represents big carriers, said the move would offer ""a lifeline for thousands of businesses reliant on international inbound travel"". Joss Croft, of trade association UKinbound, said it would ""allow the Â£28bn inbound tourism sector, which supports over 500,000 jobs across the UK, to finally restart"". Although US citizens will soon be able to avoid quarantine in England, Scotland and Wales, they are being urged not to travel to the UKby their country's health protection agency,,externalthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And the US border is currently closed to the UK, as well as many other countries, except for US citizens. The UK and US have set up a taskforce to discuss a travel corridor, althoughearlier this week the White House saidit had no plans to lift Covid-19 travel restrictions for non-Americans. But Prime Minister Boris Johnsontold LBC on Wednesday,externalthat ""we're talking to them the whole time"". For 70-year-old Patricia Duncan in Spain, the changes will mean she can travel to England and be on hand to support her daughter ahead of an operation - without needing to isolate. ""I have another friend with mental health issues who is desperate for me to visit,"" she says. ""Normally I travel three or four times a year to see my family and friends, and it's been a long time. So I'm very glad that is happening."" But Fiona Clarke in Portugal says the cost of Covid testing is still a barrier for her to visit family in Brighton. ""I think we'll look very carefully, we'll wait and see what happens with the testing,"" she says. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said she had ""real concerns"" over the plan. ""Each individual US state does things differently,"" she said. ""They don't have a National Health Service that has a vaccine programme like we do with the certifications. ""So we're really concerned about making sure that new variants do not come into the UK and that we do have a system that identifies where we have variants of Covid where infection is and we're able to isolate it.""

"Stamp duty holiday withdrawals have ""taken some of the heat out"" of the UK housing market, according to the Nationwide. The building society said house prices dropped slightly in July compared with June, but were still 10.5% higher than a year ago. Any stamp duty savings have been outstripped by rising prices. But the tax break, alongside the search for space, has created a housing boom during the pandemic. The mortgage lender said the typical home cost Â£244,229 in July. How much stamp duty will I have to pay now? Why house prices are rising so fast in a pandemic 'We sold up, moved to the sea and are living the Zoom dream' Annual house price increases were at a 17-year high in June, and slowed slightly in July. Breaks for stamp duty, or the equivalent tax, were withdrawn in Wales at the end of June, and became less generous in England and Northern Ireland at the same time. The tax will return to pre-pandemic status by October. ""The tapering of stamp duty relief in England is also likely to have taken some of the heat out of the market,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. ""This provided a strong incentive to complete house purchases before the end of June, especially for higher-priced properties."" The number of homes being sold every month has hit levels not seen since comparable records began in 2005. Mr Gardner said the market for large properties had surged, while sales of flats had fallen. The number of transactions involving properties bought for Â£500,000 or more increased by 37% over the 12 months to March, compared with a rise of 2% for all properties. The search for space, indoors and outside, had driven demand for larger homes in which to live and work during the pandemic. Flats, without gardens and - in some cases - with issues over cladding and fire safety, have been more difficult to sell. The outlook may improve for first-time buyers The Nationwide said there were signs that there would still be activity in the housing market, even if jobs were lost, the economy struggled and Covid support schemes were wound down. Iain McKenzie, chief executive of The Guild of Property Professionals, said: ""It is going to be interesting to see how the demand for properties changes as we come into the autumn. ""This will give us the opportunity to evaluate just how successful the stamp duty holiday has been at keeping the property market buoyant since the start of the pandemic.""Â Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country, said: ""While the clamour in recent times has been for bigger properties with more outdoor space, we may see luxury apartments start to come back into vogue as the drift back to the office starts to gather pace in the big cities.""

"The Quest 2 comes with black foam padding, which can irritate the skin Virtual-reality headset-maker Oculus is issuing a recall for the foam padding in its Quest 2 headset, warning it can cause skin irritation. Facebook-owned Oculus said only a ""very small percentage"" of users were experiencing the problem. But it is offering a free cover - made of silicone - to all Quest 2 owners. Facebook also announced it was ""pausing"" Quest 2 sales and from 24 August all Quest 2 headsets would come with the new silicone cover. The revamped headset would also have twice the internal storage, for the same price. The problem with skin irritation was widely known among VR enthusiasts online and Facebook has previously operated a replacement programme for the small number of people affected.

"The UK's largest tobacco firm says it sees cannabis as part of its future as it tries to move away from selling traditional cigarettes. British American Tobacco said it wanted to ""accelerate"" its transformation by reducing the health impact of its products. In March, BAT took a stake in Canadian medical cannabis maker Organigram. It also signed a deal to research a new range of adult cannabis products, initially focused on cannabidiol (CBD). ""As we think about our portfolio for the future, certainly beyond nicotine products are interesting for us as another wave of future growth,"" BAT executive Kingsley Wheaton told Radio 4's Today Programme. Mr Wheaton, BAT's chief marketing officer, said it saw cannabis related products as part of its future growth. The firm is currently trialling a CBD vape product in Manchester. ""I think [CBD vaping] is part of the future, but the present challenge is reduced harm in tobacco and nicotine alternatives, encouraging people to switch."" Marlboro maker could stop selling cigarettes in UK Releasing its half year results to the end of June, the tobacco giant reported an 8.1% rise in revenues to Â£12.18bn. It said more than a third of its UK revenues now come from vaping brands such as Vuse, Velo and glo. The tobacco giant also saw its fastest gain in new customers, with users of non-combustible products - such as vapes - jumping 2.6 million to 16.1 million. Big tobacco companies have tried to ride two horses in their communications to investors over the past decade. They have drawn attention to their efforts to get away from nasty cigarettes, while at the same time pointing to the big dividend payments the sales of those cigarettes support. That balance has now decisively shifted - in the companies' communications anyway - to the former. First Philip Morris International and now BAT have gone all out to stress their move into new types of less harmful products - vaping, heated rather than combusted tobacco, and, in BAT's case, cannabis. Progress is being made. BAT's results for the six months to the end of June show that sales of ""new category"" products grew by half to Â£942m. That is still a fraction of its total Â£12bn in revenue. Cigarette volumes - BAT sold 316 billion cigarettes in the six-month period - actually grew slightly thanks to a recovery in demand in emerging markets. Even though traditional tobacco remains by far its biggest business, the company says it is committed to change, pledging that ""ESG (environmental, social and governance issues) is at the core of our strategy."" It is hardly surprising that BAT wants to drape itself in the ESG flag. A recent piece of research by the accountancy firm PWC noted the rapid influx of shareholder money into ESG funds, ones that will only invest in companies with the right ethical credentials.  It thinks that their combined value will be greater than all other types of funds within three years. BAT's share price has roughly halved in the past four years, from Â£55 to Â£27.  The ability to tempt some of those ESG funds back into owning BAT shares might to do something to restore that flagging price. Despite its commitment to healthier choices, BAT said sales of its cigarettes recovered in some developing nations following the end of coronavirus lockdowns when sales were banned in some countries. Sales of brands like Dunhill, Kent, Lucky Strike and Rothmans rose in the first half of the year in countries such as Brazil, Turkey and Pakistan. It said overall revenue from its combustibles division - cigarettes and heated tobacco products - fell 3% to Â£10.5bn. William Ryder, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that there is still some way to go if the tobacco giant is to meet its target of Â£5bn in revenues from nicotine alternatives by 2025. ""For now... BAT is still dependent on cigarettes... Traditional tobacco products still pay the dividend, and will do for some time,"" he said.

"Ministers will allow fully vaccinated travellers from the EU and US to avoid quarantine when they arrive in England from 2 August Currently, people who have been fully vaccinated in the UK do not have to isolate when travelling from the US and EU But that exemption does not apply to people who have been vaccinated outside the UK The new rules will come in from 04:00 BST on Monday 2 August The travel industry has welcomed the relaxation of the rules but has called for the government to go further Health Secretary Sajid Javid says it is too early to see a long-term trend in the falling number of positive UK cases Boris Johnson says 16 August is ""nailed onâ as the end of isolation for fully-vaccinated people who have contact with a positive Covid case Olympic host city Tokyo records its largest number of new Covid infections in a single day since the pandemic began Edited by Katie Wright We're now bringing our live page to a close for today, but will be back tomorrow. Thanks for joining us. The page was written today by Jen Meierhans, Richard Morris, Sinead Wilson and Alex Therrien. The editor was Katie Wright. We'll soon be bringing our live page to a close. But before we do, here is a round-up of the main coronavirus stories from today. Reality Check From Monday, people who have been fully vaccinated in the US will
no longer have to quarantine on arrival in England. So, how many people have been travelling between the two
countries? Numbers have obviously fallen dramatically due to the pandemic. Data from the UK aviation authority shows that in May (the most
recent available figures) there were just over 80,000 arrivals from and
departures to the US. That compares to more than two million in May 2019. Itâs important to point out that while restrictions are being
lifted for double-jabbed US visitors to the UK, it is not a reciprocal
arrangement. Itâs currently not possible for people to travel to the US from
the UK,apart from US citizens and a few other exemptions.,external And the UK was moved to the highest risk level by the US
government just 10 days ago - with Americans warned not to travel to the UK
because of the prevalence of the Delta variant. Read moreabout the UK's travel rules. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The run of
day-on-day falls in detected cases has come to an end with 27,724 infections
confirmed by the government on Wednesday, up from just over 23,500 on Tuesday. But that was
always going to happen. The total still represents a fall of more than a third on last Wednesdayâs figure so it should not be interpreted as a rise in any real
sense. What is even
more encouraging perhaps is that the growth in hospital cases continues to
slow. The seven-day average has yet to start falling, but if current trends continue that will
happen soon, perhaps before the NHS hits 1,000 admissions a day. During the
winter peak it hit 4,000. The big
unknown is what happens next. Most scientists think we are in for a period
where infection rates bobble along going up and down for the rest of the summer
â a sustained period of mini peaks. The impact of
the 19 July mixing has yet to be felt for one thing. But this is
unchartered territory. There is also a hope that the level of immunity built up
in the population, coupled with summer meaning people are outdoors more and
continued vigilance by the public - the amount of daily contacts we are having
is still much less than what it was before the pandemic hit â could keep
driving rates down. North-east England is ""not out of the woods"" despite the region's fall in coronavirus cases, health chiefs have warned. The average infection rate across the region is 566 per 100,000 people - down from 878 on Friday, according to Newcastle City Council. However, its director of public health says the impact of easing restrictions on 19 July was not yet clear.The city previously had the highest infection rate in the country. Prof Eugene Milne told BBC Newcastle the ""upwards pressure"" in positive cases in the city ""began to diminish at the beginning of July"" with several factors likely to be involved. He suggested the numbers might have been affected by people testing themselves less often and by students having left the city for their summer breaks. He says: ""We know the city was very busy last weekend. We're waiting with bated breath to see if there is an impact from increased mixing. ""We're nowhere near down to the levels we saw last summer and everybody knows what happened after that so I think we need to be awfully careful. We're not out of the woods."" Read more here. Paul Ludlow, president of P&O Cruises, says he is ""delighted"" at the government's decision to restart international cruising. He says the company plans to pick up international cruises again from the end of September to give the company a little bit of time âto work through the detailâ. This is the ""green light that so many of our guests have been looking for over the last year or so"", he adds. He says the industry made a lot of headlines at the start of the pandemic when people were stranded on ships but they have been working hard since then to provide safe experiences. Today's announcement is great news for the economy, he adds, and for all the suppliers who service the sector. No decision has been made on Scotland's quarantine rules for people from the EU and US, the country's government has said. It comes after the UK government announced that fully vaccinated visitors will not need to quarantine upon arrival in England. The travel industry had campaigned for a rule change so that people living abroad could more easily visit. A Scottish government spokesperson said holiday travel remained ""risky and subject to sudden change"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said this morning, before the announcement, that discussions were ongoing. Her advice is not to travel abroad on holiday, unless it is absolutely necessary. Cruise ships have been restricted to domestic travel in the UK International cruises have been given the go-ahead to restart from ports in England from next Monday. The announcement comes as the UK government scraps the requirement to quarantine for double-jabbed US and EU citizens arriving in the UK. It means, for the first time since the pandemic started, cruises can start in England, call at foreign ports and then return to England without vaccinated passengers having to self-isolate. Minister for Aviation and Maritime, Robert Courts,tweeted,externalhe was ""delighted"" by the news. New government advice for cruising,externalasks travellers to make a personal assessment, look at their vaccination status and their insurance to make sure they are protected. President Samia Suluhu Hassan has assured Tanzanians that the Covid-19 vaccines are safe People in Tanzania are being actively encouraged to get Covid-19 vaccinations in a dramatic change of policy for one of Africa's most populous countries. A vaccination drive is now under way after the country's new president rejected her predecessor's Covid scepticism. President Samia Suluhu Hassan has been pictured receiving her vaccination. The man she replaced, John Magufuli, played down the virus, calling for prayer instead of vaccines and masks. After he died in March of heart complications, Ms Samia set up a task force on coronavirus. Officially, the country of 58 million people has recorded 29 deaths with coronavirus and 858 cases butthere are fears the true numbers are far greater. We've been hearing reaction to the news that double-jabbed arrivals from the EU and US will no longer have to quarantine on arrival in England from 2 August. Patricia Duncan, 70, has been speaking to us from Spain where she has lived for 19 years. She says: ""Normally I travel three or four times a year to see my family and friends, and itâs been a long time. So Iâm very glad that is happening. As soon as I have a date, I shall be on there to get a flight. âItâs good because my daughter has
finally got a date for her operation, sheâs been waiting for two years or more.
I was hoping to go to England to be there, to help her out. âI have another friend with mental
health issues who is desperate for me to visit. She adds: Although our (case) numbers have risen lately, theyâre small numbers. So Iâm very happy to hear
about the news."" The science backs up the government's decision to change the rules for fully vaccinated travellers from the US and EU, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has said. From 04:00 BST on Monday, people who have been fully vaccinated in the EU or US will not need to isolate when coming to England from an amber list country. Asked about whether the decision was scientifically justified, Prof Adam Finn told the BBC News Channel, ""yes, it does"". He said: ""This has been coming for some time and we now do have fairly solid evidence that these vaccines don't just stop people getting sick - they actually do reduce their risk of getting infected and passing the infections on to others. ""They're not by any means perfect in that regard, but it kind of makes logical sense that people who have been fully immunised pose a much lower risk than those who haven't in terms of carrying the virus around."" He said the change had ""perhaps happened a little bit sooner than some of us would have liked"" because there were still ""quite a lot of people"" who had not been able to get both vaccine doses, such as younger adults. But nonetheless, it was ""good news"" that governments were beginning to talk to each other and reach agreement on this, he added. Savid Javid visiting a vaccination centre in London Health Secretary Sajid Javid says it is too early to see a long-term trend in the falling number of positive Covid cases in the UK. Speaking before today's data was released, he said the figures were ""encouraging"" but ""no-one really knows where cases will eventually end up"" and ministers ""remain cautious"". On a visit to a vaccination centre in Little Venice, London, Javid acknowledged that ""the one area where we need to do more collectively"" is to get 18 to 29-year-olds to take up the offer of a jab. And he says young people should think of Covid-19 vaccines as ""liberating"". He adds that while it will not be compulsory for close contacts of Covid cases to be tested from 16 August, it will still be recommended. Despite the rise in UK cases compared with yesterday, the seven-day average is still 36.1% down compared with the previous week. In contrast, the seven-day average for deaths is up by the same percentage, 36.1%, while hospitalisations are up 23.4%. Elsewhere in the figures, there were 151,851 second doses of the vaccine delivered and 35,446 first doses. A further 27,734 cases and 91 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have been reported in the UK. It brings to an end a seven-day streak of cases falling in the UK, although they remain below 30,000 for a fourth straight day. On Tuesday there were 23,511 cases and 131 deaths. Today's figures compare with 44,104 cases and 73 deaths a week ago. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner, who's on a visit to Hull, says her party has "" real concerns"" about the easing of quarantine rules because ""there doesn't seem to be a system in place yet for an international vaccine passport"". She's raising particular concerns about arrivals from the US saying each state there ""does things differently"" and America does not have an NHS ""that has a vaccine programme like we do with the certifications"". ""So we're really concerned about making sure that new variants do not come into the UK and that we do have a system that identifies where we have variants of Covid where infection is and we're able to isolate it"" she adds. She says unless that happens ""we risk going backwards again and our economy will suffer as a result of that"".  This video can not be played Shapps on opening up England to visitors from US and Europe Here's a little more from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who has rejected criticism that the government has been too slow to allow double-vaccinated visitors from Europe and the US to avoid self-isolation. Passengers fully vaccinated with vaccines authorised by the EMA and FDA in Europe - with the exception of France, and the US will be able to travel to England without having to quarantine on arrival from 04:00 on 2 August Shapps said the government would âalways put the security of our country firstâ. He said the government had needed to wait for other countries âto catch upâ with the UKâs vaccination programmes and had wanted to make sure the approach of allowing double-vaccinated UK nationals to avoid isolation when returning home had been working before opening it up further. He said the government would be assessing whether other countries could join the exemption from self-isolation during August. Asked if the self-isolation rules would be relaxed for the rest of the world, he said the government would be âlooking at what happens with other countries, in particular where we can rely on their data and their vaccines that they are using, so we will be looking at that next month, during August and opening that up as quickly as is practicable and is safe to do"". First Minister Mark Drakeford says it will be hard for Wales not to follow England's lead and end quarantine restrictions for double-jabbed EU and US citizens arriving in the UK. But he is calling for assurances that the UK government can ensure the vaccine status of travellers. He says he would have preferred a more precautionary approach and thinks international travel is still best avoided. There is  âpractical detail that we donât yet have available to us"" he says and the Welsh government will want to be confident that arrangements have been made ""properly and reliably"".  Airlines are welcoming the lifting of quarantine restrictions for fully vaccinated travellers to England from the US and the EU but called for ministers to go further. Airlines UK described it as a ""lifeline"" for businesses reliant on international travel and described the move as  ""a positive step that should pave the way for a return to unrestricted travel"". But the company says more low-risk countries should be moved from the amber to the green list next week. Virgin Atlantic agrees, saying the UK is ""falling behind"" the EU and the US with a ""continued overly cautious approach"" towards international travel. It's warning of the risk to the economy and jobs unless the travel rules are further relaxed. British Airways says the relaxation of restrictions will help reunite families. In a statement, its chairman and chief executive, Sean Doyle, said ""our own trials have proved it's quick and easy to check travellers are fully vaccinated and can safely enter the UK"". Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said he expects the US to become more relaxed about allowing Britons to visit ""in time"". Asked by broadcasters whether he was confident the US and Europe would reciprocate after the government announced fully vaccinated travellers from there could come to England without needing to quarantine, he said: ""It will depend. We can only set the rules at our end, and that has always been the case. ""People should always check the rules on the other side. ""I've just spoken to my US counterpart today and in the US they still have an executive order which prevents travel from the UK, from Europe, from several other countries to the US. ""So we're saying, 'You can come here, you can come visit, you can come see friends, you can come as a tourist if you've been double vaccinated and follow the rules without quarantine'. ""We can't change that on the other side but we do expect that in time they will release that executive order, which was actually signed by the previous president, and bans inward travel."" There must be a system to assess passengers' Covid status before they travel to prevent congestion at airports whenEU and US arrivals are exempt from quarantine, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) says. Tom Thackray, CBI director of Iinfrastructure, says: 
âRestriction-free international travel will be a vital piece of the recovery jigsaw, and ending quarantine requirements for fully-vaccinated arrivals from the US and EU is a huge step towards that goal."" He says the news will come as a ""significant boost to the beleaguered travel industry"" while also restoring important business links with key trading partners. He adds: âThe task now is to implement these changes as rapidly and smoothly as possible, which should include an efficient pre-travel system of assessing passengersâ Covid-status to prevent congestion at airports.â Â© 2025 BBC.

Thanks for joining us. The page was written today by Jen Meierhans, Richard Morris, Sinead Wilson and Alex Therrien. The editor was Katie Wright. We'll soon be bringing our live page to a close. But before we do, here is a round-up of the main coronavirus stories from today. Reality Check From Monday, people who have been fully vaccinated in the US will
no longer have to quarantine on arrival in England. So, how many people have been travelling between the two
countries? Numbers have obviously fallen dramatically due to the pandemic. Data from the UK aviation authority shows that in May (the most
recent available figures) there were just over 80,000 arrivals from and
departures to the US. That compares to more than two million in May 2019. Itâs important to point out that while restrictions are being
lifted for double-jabbed US visitors to the UK, it is not a reciprocal
arrangement. Itâs currently not possible for people to travel to the US from
the UK,apart from US citizens and a few other exemptions.,external And the UK was moved to the highest risk level by the US
government just 10 days ago - with Americans warned not to travel to the UK
because of the prevalence of the Delta variant. Read moreabout the UK's travel rules. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The run of
day-on-day falls in detected cases has come to an end with 27,724 infections
confirmed by the government on Wednesday, up from just over 23,500 on Tuesday. But that was
always going to happen. The total still represents a fall of more than a third on last Wednesdayâs figure so it should not be interpreted as a rise in any real
sense. What is even
more encouraging perhaps is that the growth in hospital cases continues to
slow. The seven-day average has yet to start falling, but if current trends continue that will
happen soon, perhaps before the NHS hits 1,000 admissions a day. During the
winter peak it hit 4,000. The big
unknown is what happens next. Most scientists think we are in for a period
where infection rates bobble along going up and down for the rest of the summer
â a sustained period of mini peaks. The impact of
the 19 July mixing has yet to be felt for one thing. But this is
unchartered territory. There is also a hope that the level of immunity built up
in the population, coupled with summer meaning people are outdoors more and
continued vigilance by the public - the amount of daily contacts we are having
is still much less than what it was before the pandemic hit â could keep
driving rates down. North-east England is ""not out of the woods"" despite the region's fall in coronavirus cases, health chiefs have warned. The average infection rate across the region is 566 per 100,000 people - down from 878 on Friday, according to Newcastle City Council. However, its director of public health says the impact of easing restrictions on 19 July was not yet clear.The city previously had the highest infection rate in the country. Prof Eugene Milne told BBC Newcastle the ""upwards pressure"" in positive cases in the city ""began to diminish at the beginning of July"" with several factors likely to be involved. He suggested the numbers might have been affected by people testing themselves less often and by students having left the city for their summer breaks. He says: ""We know the city was very busy last weekend. We're waiting with bated breath to see if there is an impact from increased mixing. ""We're nowhere near down to the levels we saw last summer and everybody knows what happened after that so I think we need to be awfully careful. We're not out of the woods."" Read more here. Paul Ludlow, president of P&O Cruises, says he is ""delighted"" at the government's decision to restart international cruising. He says the company plans to pick up international cruises again from the end of September to give the company a little bit of time âto work through the detailâ. This is the ""green light that so many of our guests have been looking for over the last year or so"", he adds. He says the industry made a lot of headlines at the start of the pandemic when people were stranded on ships but they have been working hard since then to provide safe experiences. Today's announcement is great news for the economy, he adds, and for all the suppliers who service the sector. No decision has been made on Scotland's quarantine rules for people from the EU and US, the country's government has said. It comes after the UK government announced that fully vaccinated visitors will not need to quarantine upon arrival in England. The travel industry had campaigned for a rule change so that people living abroad could more easily visit. A Scottish government spokesperson said holiday travel remained ""risky and subject to sudden change"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said this morning, before the announcement, that discussions were ongoing. Her advice is not to travel abroad on holiday, unless it is absolutely necessary. Cruise ships have been restricted to domestic travel in the UK International cruises have been given the go-ahead to restart from ports in England from next Monday. The announcement comes as the UK government scraps the requirement to quarantine for double-jabbed US and EU citizens arriving in the UK. It means, for the first time since the pandemic started, cruises can start in England, call at foreign ports and then return to England without vaccinated passengers having to self-isolate. Minister for Aviation and Maritime, Robert Courts,tweeted,externalhe was ""delighted"" by the news. New government advice for cruising,externalasks travellers to make a personal assessment, look at their vaccination status and their insurance to make sure they are protected.

He said: ""This has been coming for some time and we now do have fairly solid evidence that these vaccines don't just stop people getting sick - they actually do reduce their risk of getting infected and passing the infections on to others. ""They're not by any means perfect in that regard, but it kind of makes logical sense that people who have been fully immunised pose a much lower risk than those who haven't in terms of carrying the virus around."" He said the change had ""perhaps happened a little bit sooner than some of us would have liked"" because there were still ""quite a lot of people"" who had not been able to get both vaccine doses, such as younger adults. But nonetheless, it was ""good news"" that governments were beginning to talk to each other and reach agreement on this, he added. Savid Javid visiting a vaccination centre in London Health Secretary Sajid Javid says it is too early to see a long-term trend in the falling number of positive Covid cases in the UK. Speaking before today's data was released, he said the figures were ""encouraging"" but ""no-one really knows where cases will eventually end up"" and ministers ""remain cautious"". On a visit to a vaccination centre in Little Venice, London, Javid acknowledged that ""the one area where we need to do more collectively"" is to get 18 to 29-year-olds to take up the offer of a jab. And he says young people should think of Covid-19 vaccines as ""liberating"". He adds that while it will not be compulsory for close contacts of Covid cases to be tested from 16 August, it will still be recommended. Despite the rise in UK cases compared with yesterday, the seven-day average is still 36.1% down compared with the previous week. In contrast, the seven-day average for deaths is up by the same percentage, 36.1%, while hospitalisations are up 23.4%. Elsewhere in the figures, there were 151,851 second doses of the vaccine delivered and 35,446 first doses. A further 27,734 cases and 91 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have been reported in the UK. It brings to an end a seven-day streak of cases falling in the UK, although they remain below 30,000 for a fourth straight day. On Tuesday there were 23,511 cases and 131 deaths. Today's figures compare with 44,104 cases and 73 deaths a week ago. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner, who's on a visit to Hull, says her party has "" real concerns"" about the easing of quarantine rules because ""there doesn't seem to be a system in place yet for an international vaccine passport"". She's raising particular concerns about arrivals from the US saying each state there ""does things differently"" and America does not have an NHS ""that has a vaccine programme like we do with the certifications"". ""So we're really concerned about making sure that new variants do not come into the UK and that we do have a system that identifies where we have variants of Covid where infection is and we're able to isolate it"" she adds. She says unless that happens ""we risk going backwards again and our economy will suffer as a result of that"".  This video can not be played Shapps on opening up England to visitors from US and Europe Here's a little more from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who has rejected criticism that the government has been too slow to allow double-vaccinated visitors from Europe and the US to avoid self-isolation. Passengers fully vaccinated with vaccines authorised by the EMA and FDA in Europe - with the exception of France, and the US will be able to travel to England without having to quarantine on arrival from 04:00 on 2 August Shapps said the government would âalways put the security of our country firstâ. He said the government had needed to wait for other countries âto catch upâ with the UKâs vaccination programmes and had wanted to make sure the approach of allowing double-vaccinated UK nationals to avoid isolation when returning home had been working before opening it up further. He said the government would be assessing whether other countries could join the exemption from self-isolation during August. Asked if the self-isolation rules would be relaxed for the rest of the world, he said the government would be âlooking at what happens with other countries, in particular where we can rely on their data and their vaccines that they are using, so we will be looking at that next month, during August and opening that up as quickly as is practicable and is safe to do"". First Minister Mark Drakeford says it will be hard for Wales not to follow England's lead and end quarantine restrictions for double-jabbed EU and US citizens arriving in the UK. But he is calling for assurances that the UK government can ensure the vaccine status of travellers. He says he would have preferred a more precautionary approach and thinks international travel is still best avoided. There is  âpractical detail that we donât yet have available to us"" he says and the Welsh government will want to be confident that arrangements have been made ""properly and reliably"".  Airlines are welcoming the lifting of quarantine restrictions for fully vaccinated travellers to England from the US and the EU but called for ministers to go further. Airlines UK described it as a ""lifeline"" for businesses reliant on international travel and described the move as  ""a positive step that should pave the way for a return to unrestricted travel"". But the company says more low-risk countries should be moved from the amber to the green list next week. Virgin Atlantic agrees, saying the UK is ""falling behind"" the EU and the US with a ""continued overly cautious approach"" towards international travel. It's warning of the risk to the economy and jobs unless the travel rules are further relaxed. British Airways says the relaxation of restrictions will help reunite families. In a statement, its chairman and chief executive, Sean Doyle, said ""our own trials have proved it's quick and easy to check travellers are fully vaccinated and can safely enter the UK"". Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said he expects the US to become more relaxed about allowing Britons to visit ""in time"". Asked by broadcasters whether he was confident the US and Europe would reciprocate after the government announced fully vaccinated travellers from there could come to England without needing to quarantine, he said: ""It will depend. We can only set the rules at our end, and that has always been the case. ""People should always check the rules on the other side. ""I've just spoken to my US counterpart today and in the US they still have an executive order which prevents travel from the UK, from Europe, from several other countries to the US. ""So we're saying, 'You can come here, you can come visit, you can come see friends, you can come as a tourist if you've been double vaccinated and follow the rules without quarantine'. ""We can't change that on the other side but we do expect that in time they will release that executive order, which was actually signed by the previous president, and bans inward travel."" There must be a system to assess passengers' Covid status before they travel to prevent congestion at airports whenEU and US arrivals are exempt from quarantine, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) says. Tom Thackray, CBI director of Iinfrastructure, says: 
âRestriction-free international travel will be a vital piece of the recovery jigsaw, and ending quarantine requirements for fully-vaccinated arrivals from the US and EU is a huge step towards that goal."" He says the news will come as a ""significant boost to the beleaguered travel industry"" while also restoring important business links with key trading partners. He adds: âThe task now is to implement these changes as rapidly and smoothly as possible, which should include an efficient pre-travel system of assessing passengersâ Covid-status to prevent congestion at airports.â Â© 2025 BBC.

Thanks for joining us. The page was written today by Jen Meierhans, Richard Morris, Sinead Wilson and Alex Therrien. The editor was Katie Wright. We'll soon be bringing our live page to a close. But before we do, here is a round-up of the main coronavirus stories from today. Reality Check From Monday, people who have been fully vaccinated in the US will
no longer have to quarantine on arrival in England. So, how many people have been travelling between the two
countries? Numbers have obviously fallen dramatically due to the pandemic. Data from the UK aviation authority shows that in May (the most
recent available figures) there were just over 80,000 arrivals from and
departures to the US. That compares to more than two million in May 2019. Itâs important to point out that while restrictions are being
lifted for double-jabbed US visitors to the UK, it is not a reciprocal
arrangement. Itâs currently not possible for people to travel to the US from
the UK,apart from US citizens and a few other exemptions.,external And the UK was moved to the highest risk level by the US
government just 10 days ago - with Americans warned not to travel to the UK
because of the prevalence of the Delta variant. Read moreabout the UK's travel rules. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The run of
day-on-day falls in detected cases has come to an end with 27,724 infections
confirmed by the government on Wednesday, up from just over 23,500 on Tuesday. But that was
always going to happen. The total still represents a fall of more than a third on last Wednesdayâs figure so it should not be interpreted as a rise in any real
sense. What is even
more encouraging perhaps is that the growth in hospital cases continues to
slow. The seven-day average has yet to start falling, but if current trends continue that will
happen soon, perhaps before the NHS hits 1,000 admissions a day. During the
winter peak it hit 4,000. The big
unknown is what happens next. Most scientists think we are in for a period
where infection rates bobble along going up and down for the rest of the summer
â a sustained period of mini peaks. The impact of
the 19 July mixing has yet to be felt for one thing. But this is
unchartered territory. There is also a hope that the level of immunity built up
in the population, coupled with summer meaning people are outdoors more and
continued vigilance by the public - the amount of daily contacts we are having
is still much less than what it was before the pandemic hit â could keep
driving rates down. North-east England is ""not out of the woods"" despite the region's fall in coronavirus cases, health chiefs have warned. The average infection rate across the region is 566 per 100,000 people - down from 878 on Friday, according to Newcastle City Council. However, its director of public health says the impact of easing restrictions on 19 July was not yet clear.The city previously had the highest infection rate in the country. Prof Eugene Milne told BBC Newcastle the ""upwards pressure"" in positive cases in the city ""began to diminish at the beginning of July"" with several factors likely to be involved. He suggested the numbers might have been affected by people testing themselves less often and by students having left the city for their summer breaks. He says: ""We know the city was very busy last weekend. We're waiting with bated breath to see if there is an impact from increased mixing. ""We're nowhere near down to the levels we saw last summer and everybody knows what happened after that so I think we need to be awfully careful. We're not out of the woods."" Read more here. Paul Ludlow, president of P&O Cruises, says he is ""delighted"" at the government's decision to restart international cruising. He says the company plans to pick up international cruises again from the end of September to give the company a little bit of time âto work through the detailâ. This is the ""green light that so many of our guests have been looking for over the last year or so"", he adds. He says the industry made a lot of headlines at the start of the pandemic when people were stranded on ships but they have been working hard since then to provide safe experiences. Today's announcement is great news for the economy, he adds, and for all the suppliers who service the sector. No decision has been made on Scotland's quarantine rules for people from the EU and US, the country's government has said. It comes after the UK government announced that fully vaccinated visitors will not need to quarantine upon arrival in England. The travel industry had campaigned for a rule change so that people living abroad could more easily visit. A Scottish government spokesperson said holiday travel remained ""risky and subject to sudden change"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said this morning, before the announcement, that discussions were ongoing. Her advice is not to travel abroad on holiday, unless it is absolutely necessary. Cruise ships have been restricted to domestic travel in the UK International cruises have been given the go-ahead to restart from ports in England from next Monday. The announcement comes as the UK government scraps the requirement to quarantine for double-jabbed US and EU citizens arriving in the UK. It means, for the first time since the pandemic started, cruises can start in England, call at foreign ports and then return to England without vaccinated passengers having to self-isolate. Minister for Aviation and Maritime, Robert Courts,tweeted,externalhe was ""delighted"" by the news. New government advice for cruising,externalasks travellers to make a personal assessment, look at their vaccination status and their insurance to make sure they are protected. President Samia Suluhu Hassan has assured Tanzanians that the Covid-19 vaccines are safe People in Tanzania are being actively encouraged to get Covid-19 vaccinations in a dramatic change of policy for one of Africa's most populous countries. A vaccination drive is now under way after the country's new president rejected her predecessor's Covid scepticism. President Samia Suluhu Hassan has been pictured receiving her vaccination. The man she replaced, John Magufuli, played down the virus, calling for prayer instead of vaccines and masks. After he died in March of heart complications, Ms Samia set up a task force on coronavirus. Officially, the country of 58 million people has recorded 29 deaths with coronavirus and 858 cases butthere are fears the true numbers are far greater. We've been hearing reaction to the news that double-jabbed arrivals from the EU and US will no longer have to quarantine on arrival in England from 2 August. Patricia Duncan, 70, has been speaking to us from Spain where she has lived for 19 years. She says: ""Normally I travel three or four times a year to see my family and friends, and itâs been a long time. So Iâm very glad that is happening. As soon as I have a date, I shall be on there to get a flight. âItâs good because my daughter has
finally got a date for her operation, sheâs been waiting for two years or more.
I was hoping to go to England to be there, to help her out. âI have another friend with mental
health issues who is desperate for me to visit. She adds: Although our (case) numbers have risen lately, theyâre small numbers. So Iâm very happy to hear
about the news."" The science backs up the government's decision to change the rules for fully vaccinated travellers from the US and EU, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has said.

In contrast, the seven-day average for deaths is up by the same percentage, 36.1%, while hospitalisations are up 23.4%. Elsewhere in the figures, there were 151,851 second doses of the vaccine delivered and 35,446 first doses. A further 27,734 cases and 91 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have been reported in the UK. It brings to an end a seven-day streak of cases falling in the UK, although they remain below 30,000 for a fourth straight day. On Tuesday there were 23,511 cases and 131 deaths. Today's figures compare with 44,104 cases and 73 deaths a week ago. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner, who's on a visit to Hull, says her party has "" real concerns"" about the easing of quarantine rules because ""there doesn't seem to be a system in place yet for an international vaccine passport"". She's raising particular concerns about arrivals from the US saying each state there ""does things differently"" and America does not have an NHS ""that has a vaccine programme like we do with the certifications"". ""So we're really concerned about making sure that new variants do not come into the UK and that we do have a system that identifies where we have variants of Covid where infection is and we're able to isolate it"" she adds. She says unless that happens ""we risk going backwards again and our economy will suffer as a result of that"".  This video can not be played Shapps on opening up England to visitors from US and Europe Here's a little more from Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who has rejected criticism that the government has been too slow to allow double-vaccinated visitors from Europe and the US to avoid self-isolation. Passengers fully vaccinated with vaccines authorised by the EMA and FDA in Europe - with the exception of France, and the US will be able to travel to England without having to quarantine on arrival from 04:00 on 2 August Shapps said the government would âalways put the security of our country firstâ. He said the government had needed to wait for other countries âto catch upâ with the UKâs vaccination programmes and had wanted to make sure the approach of allowing double-vaccinated UK nationals to avoid isolation when returning home had been working before opening it up further. He said the government would be assessing whether other countries could join the exemption from self-isolation during August. Asked if the self-isolation rules would be relaxed for the rest of the world, he said the government would be âlooking at what happens with other countries, in particular where we can rely on their data and their vaccines that they are using, so we will be looking at that next month, during August and opening that up as quickly as is practicable and is safe to do"". First Minister Mark Drakeford says it will be hard for Wales not to follow England's lead and end quarantine restrictions for double-jabbed EU and US citizens arriving in the UK. But he is calling for assurances that the UK government can ensure the vaccine status of travellers. He says he would have preferred a more precautionary approach and thinks international travel is still best avoided. There is  âpractical detail that we donât yet have available to us"" he says and the Welsh government will want to be confident that arrangements have been made ""properly and reliably"".  Airlines are welcoming the lifting of quarantine restrictions for fully vaccinated travellers to England from the US and the EU but called for ministers to go further. Airlines UK described it as a ""lifeline"" for businesses reliant on international travel and described the move as  ""a positive step that should pave the way for a return to unrestricted travel"". But the company says more low-risk countries should be moved from the amber to the green list next week. Virgin Atlantic agrees, saying the UK is ""falling behind"" the EU and the US with a ""continued overly cautious approach"" towards international travel. It's warning of the risk to the economy and jobs unless the travel rules are further relaxed. British Airways says the relaxation of restrictions will help reunite families. In a statement, its chairman and chief executive, Sean Doyle, said ""our own trials have proved it's quick and easy to check travellers are fully vaccinated and can safely enter the UK"". Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said he expects the US to become more relaxed about allowing Britons to visit ""in time"". Asked by broadcasters whether he was confident the US and Europe would reciprocate after the government announced fully vaccinated travellers from there could come to England without needing to quarantine, he said: ""It will depend. We can only set the rules at our end, and that has always been the case. ""People should always check the rules on the other side. ""I've just spoken to my US counterpart today and in the US they still have an executive order which prevents travel from the UK, from Europe, from several other countries to the US. ""So we're saying, 'You can come here, you can come visit, you can come see friends, you can come as a tourist if you've been double vaccinated and follow the rules without quarantine'. ""We can't change that on the other side but we do expect that in time they will release that executive order, which was actually signed by the previous president, and bans inward travel."" There must be a system to assess passengers' Covid status before they travel to prevent congestion at airports whenEU and US arrivals are exempt from quarantine, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) says. Tom Thackray, CBI director of Iinfrastructure, says: 
âRestriction-free international travel will be a vital piece of the recovery jigsaw, and ending quarantine requirements for fully-vaccinated arrivals from the US and EU is a huge step towards that goal."" He says the news will come as a ""significant boost to the beleaguered travel industry"" while also restoring important business links with key trading partners. He adds: âThe task now is to implement these changes as rapidly and smoothly as possible, which should include an efficient pre-travel system of assessing passengersâ Covid-status to prevent congestion at airports.â Â© 2025 BBC.

"Mattel expects Barbie content on Netflix and an upcoming movie starring Margot Robbie will help maintain the brand's popularity Toy maker Mattel says it has to raise prices in the run-up to Christmas as the industry giant faces higher costs. The comments come after a rise in costs of raw materials and shipping, as the global economy recovers from the pandemic. At the same time, the maker of Barbie dolls announced better than expected sales of more than $1bn (Â£720m). Like rival Hasbro, Mattel is emerging from the impact of Covid that saw shops closed and supply chains disrupted. ""We will be looking at increasing prices in the second half of [the] year,"" Mattel's chief executive Ynon Kreiz told the BBC. ""We haven't broken out [which products will be affected], but this is in response to some of the inflationary pressures,"" he added. Mr Kreiz also said his company was not alone in having to put up its prices: ""We're not the only ones who did it, in our industry everyone did - and no-one is surprised by [price increases]."" He was speaking as the company unveiled second quarter figures that beat Wall Street forecasts. Net sales for the period jumped by 40% compared to the same time last year to $1.03bn. That was boosted by a 46% rise in billings for Barbie, the company's biggest brand. Companies in many industries around the world have had their operations disrupted by delays to shipping and problems getting goods through ports due to the pandemic. Mr Kreiz said Mattel encountered supply chain issues due to problems with shipping but had got around the worst of them due to the scale of the business. ""We were able to leverage our size and partnerships that we have with our vendors and retail partners and mitigate some of these issues, so we did not have any impact on our business in the second quarter,"" he said. On Monday, rival toy maker Hasbro announced better than expected net revenues of $1.32bn, a rise of 54%. Hasbro also said it aimed to avoid pandemic-related supply chain issues by increasing its shipping capabilities and speeding up the process of sourcing its products. In recent years Mattel has made Barbie more diverse, with dolls based on different role models and professions. Earlier this month the firm launched a doll based on tennis superstar Naomi Osaka. Revenues were also boosted by a 67% jump in billings for the Hot Wheels toy car brand. The firm said it expects Barbie content on Netflix and an upcoming movie starring Margot Robbie, as well as a new video game based on Hot Wheels, to help maintain both brands' popularity this year.

"This video can not be played Elizabeth McCourt: 'I can't forgive Lambeth for what they've done to me or my family' Staff and councillors presided over a ""culture of cover-up"" that led to more than 700 children in south London care homes suffering cruelty and sexual abuse, an inquiry has found. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse strongly criticised Lambeth Council for allowing abuse in five homes from the 1960s to the 1990s. It said abusers were able to to infiltrate homes and the foster system. Lambeth Council has made an unreserved apology to the victims. And a former council leader said the authority had ""clearly failed"" and she should have known about the abuse. The Metropolitan Police also apologised ""for when we let children in the care of Lambeth down"". The inquiry into the council, held in the summer of 2020, examined five homes - Angell Road, South Vale Assessment Centre, the Shirley Oaks complex, Ivy House and Monkton Street. The Independent Inquiry Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) report,externalsaid: ""With some exceptions, they [Lambeth Council staff] treated children in care as if they were worthless. ""As a consequence, individuals who posed a risk to children were able to infiltrate children's homes and foster care, with devastating, life-long consequences for their victims."" Of the 705 complaints made by former residents across three such facilities, only one senior member of staff was ever disciplined by the council, the report said. At Shirley Oaks, which closed in 1983, the council received allegations of abuse against 177 members of staff, involving at least 529 former residents. Children's home girl raped '500 times' 'Systematic abuse where I grew up' How the child sexual abuse inquiry works The council was mired in corruption and financial mismanagement during the decades of abuse, with ""politicised behaviour and turmoil"" dominating its culture, according to the report. The report partly blames the Labour council's battle against the Conservative government in the 1980s, saying it sought to ""take on the government"" to the detriment of local services. ""During that time, children in care became pawns in a toxic power game within Lambeth Council and between the council and central government,"" the report added. The IICSA is calling on the Met Police to consider a criminal investigation into why allegations of sexual abuse made by a boy, later found dead at the Shirley Oaks care home, were not passed on to the coroner by Lambeth Council in 1977. The force said it would assess this recommendation. Shirley Oaks and South Vale were found to have been ""brutal places where violence and sexual assault were allowed to flourish"". Another care home, Angell Road, ""systematically exposed children (including those under the age of five years) to sexual abuse,"" the report said. Elizabeth McCourt, who was sexually abused at Angell Road care home, said she could not forgive Lambeth Council. The 56-year-old told the BBC she was forced into prostitution because of the council's ""negligence"". ""I felt dirty, I felt ashamed and I felt like I had nobody to listen to me,"" she said. ""Because of what happened to me in care, and then coming out of care, I can't hold a job down... I've got a criminal record so it's very difficult for me to work."" An archive picture of Shirley Oaks children's home - located in Croydon but run by Lambeth Council Sandra Fearon, who was at Shirley Oaks between 1964 and 1969 with her siblings, said she was violently sexually abused by a doctor from the age of 12. She told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme the abuse continued every week for two years until her school intervened, after she was able to tell a school nurse what had happened to her. ""I got to the point where I was probably seconds away from suicide. That's how bad my health was and the state I was in,"" she said, adding that the abuse ""absolutely destroyed me"". Children spent time with ""social aunts"" or ""social uncles"", volunteers who worked with children without proper vetting. One such volunteer, Geoffrey Clarke, stayed at Shirley Oaks with regular and unimpeded access to children there from the early 1970s. He was convicted of sexually assaulting three children in 1998, but Lambeth Council is now aware of at least 40 people who have made allegations against him. Clarke was charged with numerous abuse offences as part of Operation Middleton, one of five police investigations into child sexual abuse linked to Lambeth Council from 1992 to the present date. Clarke took his own life before his trial. The inquiry criticises the Metropolitan Police for its failures to follow up evidence that may have led to the identification of further offending. Six men have been convicted since the 1990s in connection with abuse in Lambeth. They include: William Hook, jailed for 10 years; Philip Temple, jailed for 18 years; and Leslie Paul, sent to prison for 13 years. Michael Carroll was appointed to work in a Lambeth care home in 1978 despite abusing children previously in Liverpool and failing twice to declare his offences, including when he applied to be a foster carer. He was eventually convicted and sentenced to 10 years in 1999. The former Shirley Oaks site The report made a number of recommendations, including that the council publishes an action plan to deal with the issues raised, as well as improving staff training, recruitment and vetting. Lambeth Council has accepted the recommendations and apologised to the inquiry for creating and overseeing conditions ""where appalling and absolutely shocking and horrendous abuse was perpetrated"". It has also paid Â£71.5 million in compensation to former children's home residents, with individual payments of up to Â£125,000. Linda Bellos, who led Lambeth Council between 1986-88, said she was ""shocked"" and ""disgusted"" by the abuse revealed in the report. Ms Bellos, who was not called to give evidence by the inquiry, told the BBC: ""I should have known, there should have been transparency for the services that we were supposed to be giving to vulnerable children."" ""We clearly failed. I hold myself responsible for that failure,"" she added. Commander Alex Murray, from the Met Police, said: ""It is clear that at different times we missed opportunities to identify offenders and investigate further. Some of the treatment of children was also unacceptable."" He said the force had changed the way it investigated allegations of child sexual abuse, with better training for officers, greater collaboration between social care partners and ""putting the victim at the heart of the investigation"". The long-running IICSA is investigating claims against organisations including the church, local authorities and the armed forces. Its final report of overarching findings will be laid before Parliament next summer.
