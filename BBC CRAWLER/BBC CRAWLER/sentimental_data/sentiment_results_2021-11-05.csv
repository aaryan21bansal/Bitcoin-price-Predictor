"Winston Trew, jailed for a crime he did not commit, later became a university lecturer The British Transport Police (BTP) has apologised to the British African community for ""systemic racism"" and a corrupt officer in the 1970s. A number of young black people were jailed for crimes they did not commit. Derek Ridgewell gave false evidence at trials of groups of men including those who became known as the Waterloo Four, Oval Four and the Stockwell Six. Current BTP Chief Constable Lucy D'Orsi said: ""We cannot undo the past, but we can learn from it."" Winston Trew, pictured in the 1970s, said his life fell apart after he served eight months in prison In the past two years, the wrongful convictions of the Oval Four and Stockwell Six were overturned at the Court of Appeal. In each case, a senior BTP officer offered an apology to the victims of the quashed case. However, Winston Trew, who was one of the Oval Four, suggested to BTWSC, an African history education group, that BTP apologise to the wider British African community. Convictions quashed in corrupt detective case Three of Stockwell Six have convictions overturned Men 'framed by corrupt detective' to go to court Mr Trew, along with Sterling Christie, George Griffiths and Constantine ""Omar"" Boucher were accused of stealing handbags in 1972. They spent eight months in prison for assaulting a police officer and attempted theft. The Chief Constable said: ""I am sincerely sorry for the trauma suffered by the British African community through the criminal actions of former police officer DS Derek Ridgewell who worked in BTP during the 1960s and 70s. ""In particular, it is of regret that we did not act sooner to end his criminalisation of British Africans, which led to the conviction of innocent people. This is simply inexcusable and is something that my colleagues and I are appalled by."" Det Sgt Derek Ridgewell died in jail in 1982 A judge halted a trial of the 'Tottenham Court Road Two' in 1973 when Det Sgt Ridgewell's evidence against two devout Jesuits from Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), who were studying at Oxford University, became too outlandish. He was transferred from the underground to work in a south London mail depot investigating mail theft. He died of a heart attack in prison in 1982, serving a seven-year jail term. Chief Constable D'Orsi said: ""The actions of DS Ridgewell do not define the BTP of today which is enriched by highly professional, kind and committed officers and staff who are passionate about protecting the public. I have also met retired officers who are equally appalled by the criminal actions of DS Derek Ridgewell. I acknowledge that, during those times, systemic racism played a role in the culture of the force, as it did across many parts of society. ""Moving forwards, I would like to engage and work closer with the British African community. We cannot undo the past, but we can learn from it. This is an important and sombre point of reflection in our history. ""BTP is committed to combating racism, which includes Afriphobia, which led to these historic cases that targeted African youths and destroyed lives. ""Finally, I would like to reiterate my sincere apology for the trauma caused to the British African community by a corrupt BTP officer, whose misuse of his powers caused harm not only to the innocent young people criminalised, but also to their families and community.""

"Maros Sefcovic says triggering Article 16 would cause unpredictability in Northern Ireland There will be ""serious consequences"" if the UK triggers Article 16, European Commission (EC) Vice-President Maros Sefcovic has warned. Mr Sefcovic said the move would be ""serious for Northern Ireland as it would lead to instability and unpredictability"". His comments follow a meeting with the UK's Brexit minister in Brussels overthe protocol dispute. Lord Frost said progress at the meeting was ""limited"". He said gaps could still be bridged through intensive negotiations. The protocol is the special Brexit deal agreed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are now subject to checks and control It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU. But it also creates a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The EU hasproposed measuresto ease the checks and controls for goods crossing the Irish Sea. But the UK is demanding fundamental reform and there is growing speculation it will trigger Article 16 - which allows parts of the protocol to beunilaterally suspended if they are causing serious difficulties- in the coming weeks. Mr Sefcovic said triggering Article 16 would be serious for EU-UK relations ""as it would mean a rejection of EU efforts to find a consensual solution to the implementation of the protocol"". He said that despite a ""big move"" by the EU on its proposals, ""until today we have seen no move at all from the UK side"". Lord Frost said the UK and EU would ""carry on trying"" to reach agreement Following Friday's meeting, a UK spokesperson said Lord Frost had indicated ""the EU's proposals did not currently deal effectively with the fundamental difficulties in the way the protocol was operating"". ""He underlined that the UK's preference was still to find a consensual solution that protected the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and the everyday lives of people in Northern Ireland,"" the spokesperson added. Before the meeting, Lord Frost had warned time was running out on the talks. He had said the UK was not going to trigger Article 16 on Friday, although this was ""very much on the table and has been since July"". There is growing speculation that the UK is planning to use Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol in the coming weeks. The Irish government says such a move would be ""reckless and irresponsible"", and Maros Sefcovic has warned it could result in ""serious consequences"". Ultimately, the EU could impose tariffs on UK goods - but that would only be possible after a lengthy arbitration process. The arbitrators would first have to find that the UK is in breach of the protocol. Then the UK would have to refuse to remedy that breach, at which point the EU could retaliate under the terms of the wider Brexit deal, the TCA. It could require another arbitration process to rule whether the use of tariffs is proportionate retaliation. There is a potentially faster legal track - known as infringement proceedings - which could lead to the UK being fined. Read the full analysis here. Lord Frost added that if the gap narrowed, the commission listened to what was said in the UK command paper and looked at the situation in Northern Ireland, that could help move things forward. He would not give a timescale on how long negotiations could last but said they were trying to reach agreement and were going to ""carry on trying"". The European Commission has also ruled out talk about deadlines but it is understood the EU could look to legally challenge any move by the UK to trigger Article 16. Ultimately, the EU could impose tariffs on UK goods, but that would only be possible after a lengthy arbitration process. EC spokesman Daniel Ferrie told reporters in Brussels on Friday that the commission was ""fully concentrated on finding solutions"". He said the EU's proposals were ""far-reaching and ambitious"". Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem What is Article 16 and what exactly does it say? Most NI checks on British goods to be scrapped Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he expected to see decisive action on the protocol before the end of November. Sir Jeffrey, whose party opposes the protocol, said he would meet Lord Frost next week to discuss the issue. ""The protocol is harming Northern Ireland, it is harming our economy, it is harming our political place in the union and that's why I want to see new arrangements put in place that respect Northern Ireland's place within the UK internal market,"" he said. ""I hope agreement can be reached but if it can't then within weeks I want to see the UK government taking decisive action."" The EU accepts the Northern Ireland Protocol is causing difficulties for many businesses but its proposed measures to ease checks and controls for goods crossing the Irish Sea have not been accepted by the UK government. It is seeking more wide-ranging reform of the protocol. Last month, Lord Frost said the UK government would not trigger Article 16""gratuitously or with any particular pleasure"". Article 16 can be triggered if the protocol is leading to serious ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"" that are liable to persist. If the UK was to use Article 16 to suspend most controls on goods going from GB to NI, that could cause significant problems for Ireland. It could reopen questions about goods being controlled as they cross the Irish border or as they leave Ireland for the rest of the EU. Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin has said it would be""irresponsible and reckless""for the UK to trigger Article 16. Meanwhile,a survey has indicated that the protocol is not a top priority for most people across Northern Ireland,external, including unionists. Unionist parties in Northern Ireland oppose the protocol, as they say it undermines their place in the UK. It ranked fourth on the list of priorities behind health, Covid recovery and the economy. The survey also shows the majority of the 1,000 people asked would support remaining in the UK if a border poll was held ""tomorrow"". Reacting to the survey, Sir Jeffrey said he did not agree that people do not care about the protocol, saying it was a ""big issue for many people, particularly those businesses that are being harmed"". ""They do care about the protocol and they also care, as I do, about other issues like health, like Covid recovery, the economy. Unionists say the protocol damages trade and threatens Northern Ireland's place in the UK ""These things are important and they are all inextricably bound up in our membership of the union."" Commissioned by the University of Liverpool, the survey questioned people across all of Northern Ireland's council areas last month. Of those who responded, 39% described themselves as unionist, 26% nationalist and 33% neither unionist or nationalist The survey indicated that just over 9% said the protocol was their biggest concern. When broken down, just 12% of unionists said the protocol was the important issue for them. More than 60% also said they wanted the Stormont Executive to remain in place until the Assembly election in May. When asked how they would vote in a border poll ""tomorrow"", 58% of those surveyed supported remaining in the UK, with 29% voting for a united Ireland.

"Jes Staley suddenly left his job as chief executive of Barclays this week The US Virgin Islands has served Barclays in the UK with a court order to provide any documents linked to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The US territory is seeking information on transactions, correspondence and investments linked to the financier. The bank was subpoenaed in New York on the matter in February this year. A Barclays spokesperson said: ""Barclays has already provided its response to this subpoena and complied with its obligations. ""The US Virgin Islands is now in the process of serving a similar subpoena on Barclays in the UK and Barclays will respond to that subpoena once it is served."" The BBC understands there is no link between the subpoena and Jes Staley's recent shock resignation as Barclays chief executive, or the FCA probe into his links to Mr Epstein. Following the conclusion of the investigation, Mr Staley left his job suddenly this week after more than six years at Barclays. It had focussed on Mr Staley's links with the dead financier and whether they were closer than first thought. Barclays said on Monday it had been made aware of the conclusions of the probe and ""Mr Staley's intention to contest them"". The subpoena served on Barclays in the US asked for a wide range of documents including any communications between Mr Staley and Epstein, details of the bank's investigation into Epstein and Staley, and Barclays' decision to hire Mr Staley. The US Virgin Islands attempted to serve the second subpoena on Barclays at its London offices in September, but this needs High Court approval, which lawyers for the US territory are understood to be seeking. Mr Staley left his job as Barclays boss after a shock resignation this week, apparently over a perceived inconsistency between his account to his own board of his relationship with Epstein and evidence seen by regulators. Mr Staley insists that while Epstein was an important client of JP Morgan, where Mr Staley worked for a number of years and as such they were in contact regularly, their dealings were well within the grounds that could be described as professional. The BBC understands the regulator took the view that the volume and tone of the emails between the two suggested a closer relationship than the purely professional. But Barclays has stated that the report makes no findings that Mr Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Epstein's crimes.

"No 10 insists Boris Johnson followed the rules on declaring his holiday to Spain Opposition parties have called for an inquiry into Boris Johnson's free holiday at a Spanish villa owned by the family of minister Lord Zac Goldsmith. The PM declared the trip on theRegister of Ministers' Interests,external, saying he had ""a longstanding personal friendship"" with the family. But Labour and the Lib Dems say he should publish details on theRegister of Members' Interests,externalcovering all MPs. No 10 said he did not need to and had followed all transparency rules. The Register of Members' Interests is a list of any financial benefits MPs get away from Parliament, such as wages from a second job or gifts, like a company paying for a trip abroad. The idea behind it is to keep a check on any conflicts of interest and to ensure MPs do what they think is the best thing for the public, rather than for any external influencers. The Register of Ministers' Interests is similar but just covers government ministers, including the activities of close family members. It can also cover non-financial interests, like if they are a member of an organisation away from Parliament. But unlike the list for members, only the prime minister can dish out punishments for breaking the rules - for the wider group of MPs, they would face an investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. Johnson given free holiday by minister Goldsmith PM's explanation for Mustique trip criticised What does 'sleaze' mean when politicians use it? The investigations into Boris Johnson and the government A No 10 spokesman claimed the trip to Spain did not need to be on the MPs' register - where declarations often include the price - because it was not connected to his work as an MP. It was ""a family holiday at the home of longstanding family friends and is unconnected with a PM's parliamentary and political activities,"" the spokesman added. ""Given the hospitality was provided by another minister [Lord Goldsmith] it's right that the PM made this declaration in his ministerial capacity to ensure sufficient transparency."" But the two opposition parties said the prime minister had broken the code of conduct for MPs - the same rulesthe government tried to rewrite on Wednesday, before performing a U-turn. Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has written to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Stone, saying the public would draw the conclusion the PM was ""dishing out cushy jobs to his friends who pay for his luxury holidays"". She told reporters Mr Johnson had ""broken the rules more times than I've had hot dinners"", adding: ""If he's getting money and gifts that he's not declaring, that's very serious because we then don't know if these are people who are unduly able to influence the PM."" The Liberal Democrats said the Conservatives ""don't have a shred of integrity left"" after this week's row over standards. ""The Tories have shown they can't be trusted to mark their own homework on this issue,"" she added. ""They are now the party of sleaze,"" added Lib Dem chief whip Wendy Chamberlain. Mr Johnson took the trip to to southern Spain in October, with his wife Carrie and their son, and stayed in a villa owned by Lord Goldsmith's family for free. The peer is a close friend of the prime minister's wife and gave her her first job in politics. Goldsmith lost his seat as an MP for Richmond Park in 2019, but retained his job as an environment minister after Mr Johnson appointed him to the House of Lords. Carrie Johnson (left) and Lord Goldsmith (centre), pictured here campaigning with former Conservative leader Theresa May in 2017 The government is supposed to publish a list of any financial benefits received by ministers twice a year. Themost recent list includes,externalthe declaration that: ""The prime minister has a longstanding personal friendship with the Goldsmith family and, in that capacity, in October 2021, stayed in a holiday home in southern Spain which was provided free of charge by the Goldsmiths. ""Given Lord Goldsmith is a minister of the crown, the arrangement has accordingly been declared."" But Labour says he should also publish the details in the MPs' register that would likely show the cost of the accommodation. It is not the first time the PM has come under scrutiny for free holidays. He was been criticised over how slow he was to explain the funding of his trip to the Caribbean island of Mustique shortly after winning the 2019 election. Aninvestigation by the Committee on Standards,externalfound Mr Johnson had not broken the rules but criticised the arrangements as ""ad hoc and informal"". In her letter to the Commissioner, Labour's Ms Rayner claimed the PM had ""a long history of breaching the rules in relation to parliamentary standards and other integrity and anti-corruption measures"". She also pointed to the ruling over the Mustique trip, which said he was ""required under the House's rules to register the holiday accommodation he received"". Ms Rayner added: ""We cannot have a situation where Boris Johnson behaves like it's one rule for him and another for everyone else. ""I would be grateful for your guidance on whether this is a breach of the rules, and whether you will investigate the Member of Parliament for Uxbridge and South Ruislip.""

"Winston Trew, jailed for a crime he did not commit, later became a university lecturer The British Transport Police (BTP) has apologised to the British African community for ""systemic racism"" and a corrupt officer in the 1970s. A number of young black people were jailed for crimes they did not commit. Derek Ridgewell gave false evidence at trials of groups of men including those who became known as the Waterloo Four, Oval Four and the Stockwell Six. Current BTP Chief Constable Lucy D'Orsi said: ""We cannot undo the past, but we can learn from it."" Winston Trew, pictured in the 1970s, said his life fell apart after he served eight months in prison In the past two years, the wrongful convictions of the Oval Four and Stockwell Six were overturned at the Court of Appeal. In each case, a senior BTP officer offered an apology to the victims of the quashed case. However, Winston Trew, who was one of the Oval Four, suggested to BTWSC, an African history education group, that BTP apologise to the wider British African community. Convictions quashed in corrupt detective case Three of Stockwell Six have convictions overturned Men 'framed by corrupt detective' to go to court Mr Trew, along with Sterling Christie, George Griffiths and Constantine ""Omar"" Boucher were accused of stealing handbags in 1972. They spent eight months in prison for assaulting a police officer and attempted theft. The Chief Constable said: ""I am sincerely sorry for the trauma suffered by the British African community through the criminal actions of former police officer DS Derek Ridgewell who worked in BTP during the 1960s and 70s. ""In particular, it is of regret that we did not act sooner to end his criminalisation of British Africans, which led to the conviction of innocent people. This is simply inexcusable and is something that my colleagues and I are appalled by."" Det Sgt Derek Ridgewell died in jail in 1982 A judge halted a trial of the 'Tottenham Court Road Two' in 1973 when Det Sgt Ridgewell's evidence against two devout Jesuits from Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), who were studying at Oxford University, became too outlandish. He was transferred from the underground to work in a south London mail depot investigating mail theft. He died of a heart attack in prison in 1982, serving a seven-year jail term. Chief Constable D'Orsi said: ""The actions of DS Ridgewell do not define the BTP of today which is enriched by highly professional, kind and committed officers and staff who are passionate about protecting the public. I have also met retired officers who are equally appalled by the criminal actions of DS Derek Ridgewell. I acknowledge that, during those times, systemic racism played a role in the culture of the force, as it did across many parts of society. ""Moving forwards, I would like to engage and work closer with the British African community. We cannot undo the past, but we can learn from it. This is an important and sombre point of reflection in our history. ""BTP is committed to combating racism, which includes Afriphobia, which led to these historic cases that targeted African youths and destroyed lives. ""Finally, I would like to reiterate my sincere apology for the trauma caused to the British African community by a corrupt BTP officer, whose misuse of his powers caused harm not only to the innocent young people criminalised, but also to their families and community.""

"Greta Thunberg is one of the world's best-known climate change campaigners. She has been credited with raising public awareness, especially amongst young people Ms Thunberg was born in the Swedish capital Stockholm in 2003. Her mother Malena Ernman is an opera singer, and her father Svante Thunberg is an actor. She first learned about climate change when she was eight. When she was 11 or 12, she started suffering from depression, according to her father, Svante. ""She stopped talking... she stopped going to school,"" he said. Around the same time she was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism. Greta at a 'school strike' in 2018. She was 15 when she began the protests In summer 2018, aged 15, Ms Thunberg held the first ""School Strike for Climate"" outside the Swedish parliament. The protest was widely covered, and hundreds of thousands of young people across the world joined herFridays For Future strikes. Mr Thunberg says his daughter became ""much happier"" after she started campaigning. She has described her autism diagnosis as a ""superpower"" which helped motivate her protests. ""Being different is a gift,""she told the BBC. ""If I would've been like everyone else, I wouldn't have started this school strike."" Between 2019 and 2020, she took a year out of school to concentrate on activism, and became famous for her impassioned speeches to world leaders. She left school in summer 2023, andended her school climate strikes. Ms Thunberg has been arrested several times for her participation in environmental protests around the world and fined by the Swedish courts. Thunberg's father: 'Greta is happy, but I worry' A really simple guide to climate change In April 2019, aged 16, Ms Thunbergtold members of the European Parliament: ""Our house is falling apart and our leaders need to start acting accordingly, because at the moment they are not."" Five months later,she sailed by yacht across the Atlantic to address a UN climate action summit in New York. ""I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean,"" she told delegates. ""Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.""

What Greta Thunberg did with her year off school Ms Thunberg has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize every year between 2019 and 2023. In 2019, she became the youngest-everTime Person of the Year. Also in 2019, she won the Right Livelihood Award (known as the Alternative Nobel Prize) and Amnesty International's Ambassador of Conscience Award, and was listed by Forbes as one of the world's 100 most powerful women. In 2022, she brought out The Climate Book, which contains essays from 100 scientists, writers and activists about how to combat the climate crisis. At the start of 2023, controversial media personality Andrew Tate baited Ms Thunberg on X, formerly Twitter,by listing his 33 cars and offering to send her details of their ""enormous emissions"",external. She respondedwith a sarcastic tweet,externalwhich was liked by several million people and shared widely. Donald Trump said it was ""ridiculous"" that Time magazine nominated Greta Thunberg as its person of the year She was also mocked on Twitter by former US President Donald Trump when she won the Time magazine award. He said:""Greta must work on her Anger Management problem... Chill Greta, Chill!"",external. Russian President Vladimir Putin described her as a ""kind, but poorly informed, teenager"". Greta defends herself against trolls Hundreds of thousands of young people around the world joined the Fridays for Future strikes Although Ms Thunberg has not devised any specific environmental strategies, she is credited with raising public awareness of climate change across the world, especially amongst young people.

"No 10 insists Boris Johnson followed the rules on declaring his holiday to Spain Opposition parties have called for an inquiry into Boris Johnson's free holiday at a Spanish villa owned by the family of minister Lord Zac Goldsmith. The PM declared the trip on theRegister of Ministers' Interests,external, saying he had ""a longstanding personal friendship"" with the family. But Labour and the Lib Dems say he should publish details on theRegister of Members' Interests,externalcovering all MPs. No 10 said he did not need to and had followed all transparency rules. The Register of Members' Interests is a list of any financial benefits MPs get away from Parliament, such as wages from a second job or gifts, like a company paying for a trip abroad. The idea behind it is to keep a check on any conflicts of interest and to ensure MPs do what they think is the best thing for the public, rather than for any external influencers. The Register of Ministers' Interests is similar but just covers government ministers, including the activities of close family members. It can also cover non-financial interests, like if they are a member of an organisation away from Parliament. But unlike the list for members, only the prime minister can dish out punishments for breaking the rules - for the wider group of MPs, they would face an investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. Johnson given free holiday by minister Goldsmith PM's explanation for Mustique trip criticised What does 'sleaze' mean when politicians use it? The investigations into Boris Johnson and the government A No 10 spokesman claimed the trip to Spain did not need to be on the MPs' register - where declarations often include the price - because it was not connected to his work as an MP. It was ""a family holiday at the home of longstanding family friends and is unconnected with a PM's parliamentary and political activities,"" the spokesman added. ""Given the hospitality was provided by another minister [Lord Goldsmith] it's right that the PM made this declaration in his ministerial capacity to ensure sufficient transparency."" But the two opposition parties said the prime minister had broken the code of conduct for MPs - the same rulesthe government tried to rewrite on Wednesday, before performing a U-turn. Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has written to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Stone, saying the public would draw the conclusion the PM was ""dishing out cushy jobs to his friends who pay for his luxury holidays"". She told reporters Mr Johnson had ""broken the rules more times than I've had hot dinners"", adding: ""If he's getting money and gifts that he's not declaring, that's very serious because we then don't know if these are people who are unduly able to influence the PM."" The Liberal Democrats said the Conservatives ""don't have a shred of integrity left"" after this week's row over standards. ""The Tories have shown they can't be trusted to mark their own homework on this issue,"" she added. ""They are now the party of sleaze,"" added Lib Dem chief whip Wendy Chamberlain. Mr Johnson took the trip to to southern Spain in October, with his wife Carrie and their son, and stayed in a villa owned by Lord Goldsmith's family for free. The peer is a close friend of the prime minister's wife and gave her her first job in politics. Goldsmith lost his seat as an MP for Richmond Park in 2019, but retained his job as an environment minister after Mr Johnson appointed him to the House of Lords. Carrie Johnson (left) and Lord Goldsmith (centre), pictured here campaigning with former Conservative leader Theresa May in 2017 The government is supposed to publish a list of any financial benefits received by ministers twice a year. Themost recent list includes,externalthe declaration that: ""The prime minister has a longstanding personal friendship with the Goldsmith family and, in that capacity, in October 2021, stayed in a holiday home in southern Spain which was provided free of charge by the Goldsmiths. ""Given Lord Goldsmith is a minister of the crown, the arrangement has accordingly been declared."" But Labour says he should also publish the details in the MPs' register that would likely show the cost of the accommodation. It is not the first time the PM has come under scrutiny for free holidays. He was been criticised over how slow he was to explain the funding of his trip to the Caribbean island of Mustique shortly after winning the 2019 election. Aninvestigation by the Committee on Standards,externalfound Mr Johnson had not broken the rules but criticised the arrangements as ""ad hoc and informal"". In her letter to the Commissioner, Labour's Ms Rayner claimed the PM had ""a long history of breaching the rules in relation to parliamentary standards and other integrity and anti-corruption measures"". She also pointed to the ruling over the Mustique trip, which said he was ""required under the House's rules to register the holiday accommodation he received"". Ms Rayner added: ""We cannot have a situation where Boris Johnson behaves like it's one rule for him and another for everyone else. ""I would be grateful for your guidance on whether this is a breach of the rules, and whether you will investigate the Member of Parliament for Uxbridge and South Ruislip."" The PM's spokesman said Mr Johnson did not need to declare the holiday on the list of MPs interests as ""ministerial code declarations fall outside the remit of the House of Commons registrar and Parliamentary Standards Commissioner"". He added: ""The PM has written to the House of Commons registrar to set out that this holiday has been declared under the ministerial code, because the arrangement is with another minister.""

"A former England youth captain, Azeem Rafiq captained Yorkshire in a Twenty20 fixture in 2012 Two further Yorkshire board members have joined chairman Roger Hutton in resigning over the club's response to racism experienced by Azeem Rafiq. Hutton ""apologised unreservedly"" to Rafiq, 30, when he quit his role on Friday. Hanif Malik and Stephen Willis stepped down from the board following an emergency meeting later that day. Lord Kamlesh Patel of Bradford has been appointed as a director and chair of the club. A fourth board member, Neil Hartley, will step down in the near future after ""ensuring smooth transition to new leadership"". Lord Patel is chair of the England and Wales Cricket Board's South Asian advisory group and was previously a board member at the governing body. ""The club needs to learn from its past errors, regain trust and rebuild relationships with our communities,"" Lord Patel said. ""Yorkshire is lucky to have a vast talent pool of cricketers, and passionate supporters, from all of our communities and we must re-engage with everyone to make a better Yorkshire County Cricket Club for everyone."" Vaughan 'categorically' denies making racist comment to Asian players Yorkshire cricket racism scandal - how we got here Ballance 'regrets' using racist language towards Rafiq Hutton released a lengthy statement on Friday, admitting the club ""should have recognised at the time the serious allegations of racism"" raised by Rafiq. He added that at Yorkshire he had ""experienced a culture that refuses to accept change or challenge"". Hutton was also highly critical of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), claiming the governing body ""declined to help"". It comes after an investigation found Rafiq was a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" - but the club said they would take no disciplinary action. On Thursday, Yorkshire weresuspendedfrom hosting England matches by the ECB. The ECB said it was ""clear"" Yorkshire's handling of the issue is ""wholly unacceptable and is causing serious damage to the reputation of the game"". Hutton claimed that when he was made aware of Rafiq's allegations, he ""immediately reached out"" to the ECB ""to ask for their help and intervention to support a robust inquiry"" but there was a ""reluctance to act"". In response, the ECB confirmed Yorkshire had contacted them at the start of the investigation, but said: ""Our role is to operate as a regulator across the entire game. We must act independently of any club investigations, should we ever be required to intervene as regulator - either during or after. ""The reason why our governance is structured in this manner, is perfectly demonstrated in the way that these issues have played out at Yorkshire County Cricket Club."" The ECB and Yorkshire have confirmed they are to investigate a tweet sent by Yorkshire head coach Andrew Gale in 2010. Jewish News reports Gale, then club captain, sent a now-deleted tweet containing an anti-Semitic slur to former Leeds United head of media Paul Dews. Gale told Jewish News he was ""completely unaware"" of the offensive nature of the term and deleted the tweet as soon as he was made aware. ""This kind of behaviour would be completely unacceptable to the club,"" said Yorkshire. ""Now we are aware of it, it goes without saying that we will investigate the allegations thoroughly."" In a statement, Hutton said: ""I would like to take this opportunity to apologise unreservedly to Azeem. ""I am sorry that we could not persuade executive members of the board to recognise the gravity of the situation and show care and contrition. ""There has been a constant unwillingness from the executive members of the board and senior management at the club to apologise and to accept [there was] racism and to look forward. ""During my time as chairman, I take responsibility for failing to persuade them to take appropriate and timely action. ""This frustration has been shared by all of the non-executive members of the board, some of whom have also now resigned."" Speaking about the ECB, Hutton, who will be questioned by MPs alongside senior Yorkshire officials and Rafiq on 16 November, added: ""I was saddened when they declined to help as I felt it was a matter of great importance for the game as a whole. ""It is a matter of record that I have continually expressed my frustration at the ECB's reluctance to act."" Hutton, a lifelong Yorkshire fan and local lawyer, took up the role in April 2020 and said he ""never met Azeem and was not at the club during the period he was employed."" Speaking on Thursday, Julian Knight MP, the chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said he hoped the sanctions handed down by the ECB would ""act as a short, sharp shock to bring the club to its senses"". ""Like the rest of us, I imagine the members of Yorkshire County Cricket Club will be questioning why the board is still in place,"" he added. Many companies have cut their ties with Yorkshire,including kit manufacturer Nike, primary sponsor Emerald Publishing and Yorkshire Tea. On Friday, NIC Services Group, who sponsor the front of Yorkshire's shirt, suspended its partnership with the club with immediate effect. England limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan, who is leading the side at the Men's T20 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates, says the issues raised by the report and Yorkshire's response to it need to be addressed. ""We want to see the sport in a great light but equally if there's an issue as serious as this we want it dealt with,"" Morgan said. ""We firmly believe that there is no place in our sport for any type of discrimination, and I think the actions of the ECB board to Yorkshire have indicated how serious they are about dealing with issues like this."" Meanwhile, former England captain Michael Vaughan says he was named in Yorkshire's report but ""totally denies any allegation of racism"". Vaughan says the report states that in 2009, while he was still a Yorkshire player, he told a group of Asian team-mates, including Rafiq: ""Too many of you lot, we need to do something about it."" Ex-Pakistan bowler Rana Naved-ul-Hasan told ESPN healso heard the alleged comment. BBC pundit Vaughan says he ""completely and categorically denies"" saying that. On Wednesday, ex-England international Gary Ballance said he ""regrets"" using racist language towards Rafiq when they were Yorkshire team-mates.

"Delegates from around the world are attending the climate change summit at the Scottish Event Campus on the banks of the Clyde. World leaders, campaign groups and protesters have descended on Glasgow for the COP26 climate change conference. Here are some of the best images and key moments from the crucial climate summit so far. Ahead of the conference First Minister Nicola Sturgeon met indigenous delegates at a ceremonial gathering at the Tramway in Glasgow. One of the main aims of the conference is to limit a rise in future global warming to a ceiling of 1.5C. As delegates gathered, campaigners arrived. Greenpeace's flagship Rainbow Warrior sailed up the Clyde, here passing under the Erskine Bridge. Climate activist Greta Thunberg arrived by train and joined protesters at Festival Park near the Clyde to send her message of ""no more blah, blah, blah"". While on the streets the message was put across in a more Scottish accent. The slogans were being driven home as Scotland was enjoying a more traditional guising, in the wake of the lockdown restrictions of the Covid pandemic. Back on the conference trail, and US President Joe Biden's journey to Glasgow drew a lot of attention on the M8 as his motorcade travelled from his accommodation in Edinburgh. Meanwhile, much was made about the non-attendance of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The Queen addressed world leaders and other senior royals at a reception at Glagsow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, with a message to ""rise above politics and achieve true statesmanship. At the conference venue and around the city security has been extremely tight, with thousands of officers drafted in from around the UK. Inside, all eyes have been on world leaders, to see what agenda can be agreed as deals are set out on emissions, investment and global climate targets. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen outlined one such pledge along with the United States to slash emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane. Keeping up the pressure are groups like Extinction Rebellion, who have also been targeting green investment and financial insitistutions. As talks continued, there was some disappointment as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi only committed to a net zero target for his country by the year 2070. Activists outside the summit drove home their message that COP26 needed to be a time for action and not ""climate games"". Someone else to get her message across was Earthshot Prize finalist Vinisha Umashankar, a schoolgirl from India who has created a solar-powered ironing cart. She took the opportunity to tell world leaders her generation ""will live to see the consequences"" of their actions at COP26. Delegates representing indigenous peoples around the world and the global south have been working to make their voices heard among the speeches of world leaders. And one campaign group seeking to amplify those voices had their inflatable ""debt monster"" - in the shape of Nessie - seized by police as they sought to launch it on the River Clyde. More voices were raised by the Glasgow Youth Choir at St Lukes Church in the city, bringing their message to the conference. Adding a bit of celebrity glitz was Leonardo DiCaprio, who attended the conference and also met Prince Charles and Stella McCartney at a fashion installation by the designer, at the Kelvingrove. The world leaders summit has finished but the work of the negotiators from countries around the globe will continue as COP26 runs its course. Security around the event remains as tight as ever, with talks continuing through until 12 November. And the work of campaigners and protesters is also continuing on the streets and at venues surrounding the conference. The use of coal around the world is a key issue, and these Pikachus joined activists from the No Coal Japan coalition Youth climate activist Kato Ewekia Taomia, from Tuvalu, addressed delegates in the hall. Tuvalu is one of the nations particularly under threat from rising sea levels. The seas are also the focus for Ocean Rebellion, who have been drawing attention to the climate's impact on the world's marine life. Tongan activist Uili Lousi stands alongside ""Flare Oceania 2021"", created by artist John Gerrard, a real-time moving image showing a simulation of the seas around Tonga with the flag/flare embedded in it. As the weekend approaches, larger mass protests are being held, with the Fridays For Future Scotland Climate Strike on Friday and the Global Day for Climate Justice march on Saturday. Placards were in full effect on the Climate Strike march, which took place through the centre of the city. The young activists march gathered in Kelvingrove Park in the west of the city. Thousands took to the streets to call for world leaders to take more urgent action on the climate. All photos are subject to copyright. Â© 2025 BBC.

"On day six of the climate summit, the focus turned to youth and public engagement Climate activists Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate spoke to protesters, after marching through the streets of Glasgow Thunberg described COP26 as a ""failure"" and a ""PR exercise"", full of more ""blah blah blah"", while Nakate urged young people to ""hold leaders to account"" We were joined for Friday's live coverage by special guests, BBC Young Reporters Maisie, Nel and Donald They helped us hear directly from young people affected by climate change around the world, as well as youth activists and campaigners COP26's overall goal is to keep the world on track for 1.5C of warming, which scientists say will help us avoid the worst impacts Edited by Hamish Mackay and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman It's been another busy day in Glasgow, with the sixth day of COP26 coming to a close. Here's a recap of what happened today:  We're pausing our live coverage now, but we'll be back tomorrow morning. Until then...  Saturday's COP26 theme will be nature - underlying the importance of the natural world and sustainable land use. As the first week of the conference comes to an end, millions of people around the world are expected to take part in a Global Day of Action for Climate Justice. About 200 demonstrations are expected around the world - including another march in Glasgow and another event in London leaving from the Bank of England and onto a rally in Trafalgar Square. In Glasgow, climate actvist Greta Thunberg is also expected to give another speech. Read more:Who is Greta Thunberg and what are her aims? David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News Maybe itâs because the conference crowds have thinned and
the security queues are shorter but the mood does seem a fraction brighter at
the end of this first week. Perhaps the flurry of promises on everything frommethanetocoalandforeststofinanceshows momentum is possible. Or itâs India, a giant of the developing world thatâs long
resisted climate targets, signalling that itâscoming on board. But itâs wise to be cautious. Promises are not the same as
delivery. And US envoy John Kerry is emphatic that weâre still at the stage of
âjob not doneâ. The pledges made so far should lead to a less scary rise in
the projected temperature. But that depends on them being implemented - and given the
low levels of trust, will everyone do what they say they will? Thereâs another week of hard negotiating to go. After concluding her speech following today's march in Glasgow, climate activist Greta Thunberg tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Former US vice president Al Gore has just finished giving a speech at the global legislators summit at the Scottish parliament. He told delegates the world is at a ""long-awaited political tipping point"" in the fight against climate change. Gore, who served two terms as vice president under Bill Clinton, said ""impressive"" pledges for action have been made in Glasgow. But he warned the climate crisis is getting worse ""faster than we are yet implementing solutions"", insisting that more political will is needed to tackle the problem. He added it is crucial more countries and organisations are held to account on net-zero pledges. With increasingly strong voices demanding governments do more, the job of legislators is to ""translate the popular will into effective solutions for the climate crisis"", he said. We must put the period of delay and distraction and expedience in the past, recognise that we have entered a period of consequences and make it a period of solutions.""  Reality Check While politicians at COP26 discuss saving the planet, many cities around the world
have been suffering particularly badly from air pollution in the last few
days. India's capital, Delhi, has
seen peak pollution levels following the festival of Diwali, during which
the use of millions of fireworksfills the air with harmful particles. In addition to the fireworks,
the industrial use of coal and the burning of crop stubble across the region
has contributed to extreme concentrations of small and harmful particles known as PM2.5. Smog envelopes a highway in the Delhi area Delhi, as well as the Chinese capital, Beijing, currently top the rankings for the cities with the worst air quality, according to the IQAir index,which monitors air pollution in real time.,external In Beijing. PM2.5 levels are 17 times higher than WHO guidelines, and the elderly, children and the sick are being advised to stay inside. Beijingâs air pollution is mainly caused by the burning of coal to produce electricity. As the worldâs biggest consumer and producer of coal, the country is heavily reliant on it, although President Xi Jinping has promised to âphase downâ coal use from 2026. Another country facing serious air pollution is Kyrgyzstan, whose capital Bishkek is sometimes enveloped in hazardous smog in winter. Officials have blamed pollution in the capital on the use of coal by nearby power plants. At the COP26 summit, Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov pledged to achieve a âcarbon-free green development platformâ by 2050, moving away from coal to hydropower. Earlier, we heard from Ineza Umuhoza Grace, a Rwandan advocate who has been at COP26 this week. She told BBC Young Reporters Maisie and Nel about how she decided to fight for communities affected by climate change in her country. This is her message to other young people: Donât be afraid to show your colours in terms of achieving climate justice because everyone, everywhere has a voice - and everyone, everywhere has an ability to believe in change.  We should be messengers to our elders, and tell them that we all have one planet... we are all interconnected. We can only survive if we work together.  Young people can make our leaders accountable.  We've also heard Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate address the thousands of climate
protestors gathered in Glasgowâs George Square. The
24-year-old from Kampala, inspired by Greta Thunberg, began her own strike in
January 2019 in front of the Ugandan parliament building. She says her country is witnessing the impacts of the climate crisis first hand. ""People
are dying, children are dropping out of school, peopleâs farms are being
destroyed,"" she says. ""We are in a crisis, we are in a disaster that is
happening every day."" Africa is suffering the worst impacts of climate change, Vanessa says, even though historically the continent is only responsible for 3% of global emissions. She ends on an upbeat note with a vision of what the future could be like - ""the farms can blossom again...the pain and suffering is gone,"" - but urges the crowd to ""continue to hold leaders to account"". ""We don't need any more empty promises,"" the teenage campaigner says to cheers from the crowd. Greta says they do not want ""commitments that are full of loopholes"" and ones that ""ignore historical emissions and climate justice"". ""And that's all we are getting."" Leaders ""cannot ignore the scientific consensus"" the people, or their own children, she says. ""We are tired of their blah, blah, blah. Our leaders are not leading."" Before concluding her speech, Greta thanks everyone for attending the march, and says she hopes to see them at tomorrow's march too. They have had 26 COPs, they have had decades of blah, blah, blah - and where has that got us?  ""The leaders are doing nothing,"" Greta tells the crowd. ""It seems like their main goal is to continue to fight for the status quo."" She goes on to say COP26 has been named ""the most exclusionary COP ever"". She calls it a ""global greenwash festival"", a ""failure"" and a ""PR exercise"". ""A two-week long celebration of business as usual and blah, blah, blah,"" she says, repeating a phrase heard in a previous speech. She says the people in the most affected areas ""still remain unheard"". It's now time for the speaker the crowd have been waiting for - as campaigner Greta Thunberg takes to the stage in Glasgow. The Swedish teenager begins by saying COP26 ""is a failure"". ""We cannot solve a crisis with the same methods that got us into this in the first place,"" she says. ""What will it take for the people in power to wake up?"" The protest in Glasgow has been hearing from activists from around the world The city's George Square is packed with climate activists Activists of all ages are at the protest Penty of handmade placards can be spotted in the crowd Some protesters were dressed in masks of world leaders Thousands of people are in the crowd Paul O'HareBBC Scotland News The moment many in this large crowd in George Square have
been waiting for is not far away now...it's almost time for Greta Thunberg to
address this Fridays for Future rally. Before it got under way it was clear the 18-year-old Swedish climate campaigner was the star attraction. In
a bid to warm up the Glasgow crowd, the MC shouted: âWhat do we want?â They
replied: âGreta!â The MC joked: âYou're supposed to say 'climate justice'.â Greta Thunberg (blue hat) waits in a group near the main stage in George Square Nel RichardsBBC Young Reporter Speaking with activist Ineza Umuhoza Grace was a pleasure. The true facts and impacts of climate change on her family in Rwanda were very clear and she taught me that we need to fight this crisis together. Her courage was inspirational and she is a true advocate for young people. I asked her: If you ever feel disheartened by the challenge ahead, what are your tips for staying positive and motivated? âI like to challenge my personality first, Iâm the type of person that doesnât like to give up, I like to focus on what I can do.  Iâm too positive for negativity but sometimes I need to be realistic and not to be scared to share my voice.  Ineza is an inspirational campaigner but a bad selfie taker... Ineza Umuhoza Grace, 25, is a environmental advocate from Rwanda who has been at COP26 events this week campaigning for greater financial
support for communities already experiencing damage because of climate change. She's been speaking to BBC Young Reporters Maisie Goodwin and Nel Richards in between a packed schedule at the conference centre. They started by asking what affects of climate change she had personally experienced: I was exposed to climate change from a very young age - five or six - because I have the memory of floods in my house and my bedroom was like a lake.  When I finished my secondary school classes, I wanted to study to become a pilot or a mechanical engineer because I was good in science. Then when I watched the news, I had the information that in one particular area in my country, a rural area, women and children were being forced to move because of erosion and flooding. When I saw the news, it reminded me of how hopeless I felt. Then I wanted to study environmental engineering because I wanted to learn how to contribute to my community.  In 2020 our country lost 4,000 hectares of crops, due to flooding and intense rainfall. This especially affects women and children - when they are forced to move their crop fields this is very problematic. We also see a lot of damage to schools and homes.â  Next up, Mail and Nel asked her about how she stays motivated and positive. While COP26 is focsued on how governments can avoid the worst impacts of climate change, there are many ways in which we as individuals can do our bit for the planet. One of the ways we can reduce our carbon footprint is through what we eat. Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, according to a major report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),which says the West's high consumption of meat and dairy is fuelling global warming. If youâre eating beef three to five times a week, over an entire year your consumption is contributing 1,611kg to your annual greenhouse gas emissions. That's the equivalent of driving a regular petrol car 4,112 miles (6,618km), or taking five return flights from London to Malaga. Hello â itâs Nel Richards and Maisie Goodwin here, two of the BBCâs Young Reporters. Weâve been speaking to James Miller, who is attending COP26 today as a delegate with Unicef. âYoung people have contributed least to the climate crisis but they are the ones who will be most impacted by it,â he tells us. âMore than half of the world's children are at extreme risk of climate related impacts - that's over a billion children.â The 19-year-old is calling for young peopleâs voices to be represented more in negotiations. He says he is pleased to see so many young people at COP today but they should be handed more power. âThere are a very few young people that are in those decision making roles, there are a few delegates representing countries who are under the UNâs definition of âyoungâ.â Helen BriggsBBC Environment Correspondent in Glasgow Inside COP's inner Blue Zone, face masks are everywhere. Most wear regular white ones, but brightly-coloured masks
are popping up around the conference centre - in shades of yellow, orange and
green. Why? Theyâre being worn to highlight that gender justice and
human rights are central to climate action. ""We demand nothing less,"" says Mara Dolan, a member of the
Women & Gender Constituency, a network of feminist activists at COP. Another member, Gina Cortes, says there are ""deep inequities
and deep injustices"" at this COP, with some observers, especially from the
global south, missing from the conference due to travel restrictions Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check This video can not be played What is Climate Justice? With many of today's protesters in Glasgow calling for ""climate justice"", what exactly does the term mean? Many of the countries worst affected by climate change have contributed least to the emissions that cause it. So where should the burden lie in taking action to counter it? Check out this video as Reality Check's Chris Morris examines some of the big questions. Activists from across the world are taking to the stage in George Square, Glasgow, to address the thousands of climate protesters that have gathered there.

"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you on Saturday. Anexperimental pill to treat Covid developed by the US company Pfizercuts the risk of hospitalisation or death by 89% in vulnerable adults, clinical trial results suggest. Paxlovid is intended for use soon after symptoms develop in people at high risk of severe disease. Itcomes a day after the UK medicines regulator approved a similar treatmentfrom Merck Sharp and Dohme (MSD) called molnupiravir. The UK has already ordered 250,000 courses of the Pfizer treatment along with another 480,000 courses of MSD's pill. The European continent is once again ""at the epicentre"" of the Covid pandemic, theWorld Health Organization has warned.Insufficient vaccine take-up is responsible for a rise in cases, WHO Europe head Hans Kluge has said.  While 80% of people in Spain are double jabbed, in Germany it is about 66% - and take-up is far lower in some Eastern European countries. Germany on Friday registered a record number of Covid infections for the second day in a row - more than 37,000 new cases. Could wearing face masks be affecting the way we interact? People tend to automatically imitate others' facial expressions of emotion. But astudy led by Cardiff Universityfound people unable to use their mouth to mimic that emotion struggled to empathise with other people. Read about thedifferent rules and guidance for face coveringsand masks across the UK. US employers hired more new workers in October than expected, after a slowdown in the summer partly due to the impact of the Delta variant. Firms added 531,000 posts,official figures showed.There had also been an apparent reluctance from parts of the workforce to return to jobs a few months ago but companies are now raising wages to attract staff. Birmingham's German Christmas market has returnedafter the pandemic saw the event cancelled in 2020. The market is slightly smaller this year due to works being carried out in Victoria Square, where part of the event is held. But Birmingham City Council has warned the market could still be changed or cancelled if Covid restrictions return.

"A former England youth captain, Azeem Rafiq captained Yorkshire in a Twenty20 fixture in 2012 Two further Yorkshire board members have joined chairman Roger Hutton in resigning over the club's response to racism experienced by Azeem Rafiq. Hutton ""apologised unreservedly"" to Rafiq, 30, when he quit his role on Friday. Hanif Malik and Stephen Willis stepped down from the board following an emergency meeting later that day. Lord Kamlesh Patel of Bradford has been appointed as a director and chair of the club. A fourth board member, Neil Hartley, will step down in the near future after ""ensuring smooth transition to new leadership"". Lord Patel is chair of the England and Wales Cricket Board's South Asian advisory group and was previously a board member at the governing body. ""The club needs to learn from its past errors, regain trust and rebuild relationships with our communities,"" Lord Patel said. ""Yorkshire is lucky to have a vast talent pool of cricketers, and passionate supporters, from all of our communities and we must re-engage with everyone to make a better Yorkshire County Cricket Club for everyone."" Vaughan 'categorically' denies making racist comment to Asian players Yorkshire cricket racism scandal - how we got here Ballance 'regrets' using racist language towards Rafiq Hutton released a lengthy statement on Friday, admitting the club ""should have recognised at the time the serious allegations of racism"" raised by Rafiq. He added that at Yorkshire he had ""experienced a culture that refuses to accept change or challenge"". Hutton was also highly critical of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), claiming the governing body ""declined to help"". It comes after an investigation found Rafiq was a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" - but the club said they would take no disciplinary action. On Thursday, Yorkshire weresuspendedfrom hosting England matches by the ECB. The ECB said it was ""clear"" Yorkshire's handling of the issue is ""wholly unacceptable and is causing serious damage to the reputation of the game"". Hutton claimed that when he was made aware of Rafiq's allegations, he ""immediately reached out"" to the ECB ""to ask for their help and intervention to support a robust inquiry"" but there was a ""reluctance to act"". In response, the ECB confirmed Yorkshire had contacted them at the start of the investigation, but said: ""Our role is to operate as a regulator across the entire game. We must act independently of any club investigations, should we ever be required to intervene as regulator - either during or after. ""The reason why our governance is structured in this manner, is perfectly demonstrated in the way that these issues have played out at Yorkshire County Cricket Club."" The ECB and Yorkshire have confirmed they are to investigate a tweet sent by Yorkshire head coach Andrew Gale in 2010. Jewish News reports Gale, then club captain, sent a now-deleted tweet containing an anti-Semitic slur to former Leeds United head of media Paul Dews. Gale told Jewish News he was ""completely unaware"" of the offensive nature of the term and deleted the tweet as soon as he was made aware. ""This kind of behaviour would be completely unacceptable to the club,"" said Yorkshire. ""Now we are aware of it, it goes without saying that we will investigate the allegations thoroughly."" In a statement, Hutton said: ""I would like to take this opportunity to apologise unreservedly to Azeem. ""I am sorry that we could not persuade executive members of the board to recognise the gravity of the situation and show care and contrition. ""There has been a constant unwillingness from the executive members of the board and senior management at the club to apologise and to accept [there was] racism and to look forward. ""During my time as chairman, I take responsibility for failing to persuade them to take appropriate and timely action. ""This frustration has been shared by all of the non-executive members of the board, some of whom have also now resigned."" Speaking about the ECB, Hutton, who will be questioned by MPs alongside senior Yorkshire officials and Rafiq on 16 November, added: ""I was saddened when they declined to help as I felt it was a matter of great importance for the game as a whole. ""It is a matter of record that I have continually expressed my frustration at the ECB's reluctance to act."" Hutton, a lifelong Yorkshire fan and local lawyer, took up the role in April 2020 and said he ""never met Azeem and was not at the club during the period he was employed."" Speaking on Thursday, Julian Knight MP, the chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said he hoped the sanctions handed down by the ECB would ""act as a short, sharp shock to bring the club to its senses"". ""Like the rest of us, I imagine the members of Yorkshire County Cricket Club will be questioning why the board is still in place,"" he added. Many companies have cut their ties with Yorkshire,including kit manufacturer Nike, primary sponsor Emerald Publishing and Yorkshire Tea. On Friday, NIC Services Group, who sponsor the front of Yorkshire's shirt, suspended its partnership with the club with immediate effect. England limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan, who is leading the side at the Men's T20 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates, says the issues raised by the report and Yorkshire's response to it need to be addressed. ""We want to see the sport in a great light but equally if there's an issue as serious as this we want it dealt with,"" Morgan said. ""We firmly believe that there is no place in our sport for any type of discrimination, and I think the actions of the ECB board to Yorkshire have indicated how serious they are about dealing with issues like this."" Meanwhile, former England captain Michael Vaughan says he was named in Yorkshire's report but ""totally denies any allegation of racism"". Vaughan says the report states that in 2009, while he was still a Yorkshire player, he told a group of Asian team-mates, including Rafiq: ""Too many of you lot, we need to do something about it."" Ex-Pakistan bowler Rana Naved-ul-Hasan told ESPN healso heard the alleged comment. BBC pundit Vaughan says he ""completely and categorically denies"" saying that. On Wednesday, ex-England international Gary Ballance said he ""regrets"" using racist language towards Rafiq when they were Yorkshire team-mates. 'Racist language isn't friendly banter,' say British-Pakistanis 2 September 2020:Following aninitial interview with Wisden,external,ESPN Cricinfo publish an article with Rafiq,externalin which he claims ""institutional racism"" at Yorkshire County Cricket Club left him close to taking his own life. 3 September 2020:Yorkshire saythey have launched a ""formal investigation"" into the claims made by Rafiq and chairman Roger Hutton says the club would be carrying out a ""wider review"" of their ""policies and culture"" 5 September 2020:Yorkshire ask an independent law firmto investigate racism allegations against the club by Rafiq. 13 November 2020:Rafiq sayshe hopes to bring about ""meaningful change"" after giving his first statement to the inquiry. 15 December 2020:Rafiq files a legal claimagainst Yorkshire ""claiming direct discrimination and harassment on the grounds of race, as well as victimisation and detriment as a result of trying to address racism at the club"". 2 February 2021:Yorkshire threaten a lifetime banfor anyone found to have made threats against Rafiq or his family and legal team, after ESPN Cricinfo show them messages sent to Rafiq's legal firm. 17 June 2021:An employment tribunal case between Rafiq and his former club Yorkshirefails to find a resolution.The independent investigation into his racism allegations remains ongoing. 16 August 2021:Yorkshire receive the findingsof an independent investigation into the racism allegations and, two days later, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB)asks for a copy. 19 August 2021:Yorkshire, yet to release the findings of the report at this stage,admitRafiq was ""the victim of inappropriate behaviour"" and offer him their ""profound apologies"". Rafiq accuses Yorkshire of downplaying racismby calling him the victim of ""inappropriate behaviour"". 8 September 2021:MPs tell Yorkshireto publish the findingsof the report ""immediately"". 10 September 2021:Yorkshire release the findings of the report,which says Rafiq was the ""victim of racial harassment and bullying"" and seven of the 43 allegations made by the player were upheld by an independent panel. According to Hutton, the report said there was ""insufficient evidence to conclude that Yorkshire County Cricket Club is institutionally racist"". Yorkshire released a summary of the panel's report and recommendations, but said the full report could not be released for legal reasons ""in relation to privacy law and defamation"". 8 October 2021:Yorkshire miss a deadlineto send the full report to Rafiq and his legal team after BBC Sport understands an employment judge ordered the club to release it in full by Friday, 8 October. 13 October 2021:Rafiq then receives a heavily redacted version,while the ECB says it is still awaiting the full report. 28 October 2021:Yorkshire says it carried out its own internal investigation after the findings in the reportand concludedthat ""there is no conduct or action taken by any of its employees, players or executives that warrants disciplinary action"". 2 November 2021:The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee calls on Hutton to appear before it to answer questions about Yorkshire's handling of a report into Rafiq's allegations of racism. MP Knight, chair of the DCMS select committee,calls on the board of Yorkshire County Cricket Club to resignafter a leaked report emerges apparently containing details of the investigation into the treatment of Rafiq. A story published by ESPN says the report had concluded that a racially offensive term used towards Rafiq was regarded as ""banter"". Knight makes his comments after health secretary Javid calls for ""heads to roll"" at Yorkshire and said if the ECB did not take action ""it's not fit for purpose"". He further states in a Twitter post that the term allegedly used to describe Rafiq was ""not banter"". The ECB announces it will conduct a ""full"" investigation into the situation. 3 November 2021:The date of the DCMS hearing is scheduled for 16 November andRafiq is called to give evidence in person,along with senior Yorkshire officials. Several sponsors, including primary sponsor Emerald Publishing and Yorkshire Tea,end their partnershipswith Yorkshire County Cricket Club. Current Yorkshire batter Gary Ballance releases a lengthy statement expressing regret for using a racial slur against former team-mate Rafiq. 4 November 2021:The ECB board suspends Yorkshire from hosting international matches. Kit supplier Nike ends four-year deal, announced in March 2021. Former England captain Michael Vaughansays he was namedin the report but ""totally denies any allegation of racism"". 5 November 2021:Yorkshire chairman Roger Hutton resigns over the club's response and apologises ""unreservedly"" to Rafiq. Two further board members also quit and a fourth will step down in the near future. Lord Kamlesh Patel of Bradford is appointed as a director and chair of the club.

"Rooney's refusal to work with an Israeli publisher triggered a wave of both anger and praise Two of Israel's biggest bookstores say they are stopping selling works by Irish author Sally Rooney, after she refused to allow an Israeli publisher to translate her new book into Hebrew. The acclaimed writer said it was in support of calls to boycott Israel over its policies towards the Palestinians. The move by the bookstores follows a backlash against Rooney's decision. Her stance triggered a wave of both praise and condemnation, escalating into a war of words on social media. On Thursday, bookstores Steimatzky and Tzomet Sefarim said they would remove Rooney's books from their branches and online sites. The companies have more than 200 outlets across Israel. It is the first such action by Israeli booksellers since it emerged last month that Rooney had turned down a bid by Israeli publisher Modan for the rights to translate her book Beautiful World, Where Are You. She said that while she was ""very proud"" that her two previous novels had been translated into Hebrew, ""for the moment, I have chosen not to sell these translation rights to an Israeli-based publishing house"". Rooney said it was out of solidarity with the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which calls for a complete boycott of Israel. She could not, she said, ""accept a new contract with an Israeli company that does not publicly distance itself from apartheid and support the UN-stipulated rights of the Palestinian people"". Apartheid was a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white minority government against the black majority in South Africa from 1948 until 1991. Israel has long claimed BDS opposes the country's very existence and is motivated by anti-Semitism. It vehemently rejects any comparison with apartheid as a smear tactic. Rooney's decision was denounced by Israel's Diaspora Minister Nachman Shai, calling ""the cultural boycott of Israel anti-Semitism in a new guise"". The author said it would still ""be an honour"" to have Beautiful World, Where Are You translated into Hebrew by a company which shared her political position. The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel said Palestinians ""warmly welcomed"" her move, while others said she had been misrepresented. Rooney has received several book prizes in the UK, including The Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year Award in 2017 and a Costa Book Award in 2018.

"On day six of the climate summit, the focus turned to youth and public engagement Climate activists Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate spoke to protesters, after marching through the streets of Glasgow Thunberg described COP26 as a ""failure"" and a ""PR exercise"", full of more ""blah blah blah"", while Nakate urged young people to ""hold leaders to account"" We were joined for Friday's live coverage by special guests, BBC Young Reporters Maisie, Nel and Donald They helped us hear directly from young people affected by climate change around the world, as well as youth activists and campaigners COP26's overall goal is to keep the world on track for 1.5C of warming, which scientists say will help us avoid the worst impacts Edited by Hamish Mackay and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman It's been another busy day in Glasgow, with the sixth day of COP26 coming to a close. Here's a recap of what happened today:  We're pausing our live coverage now, but we'll be back tomorrow morning. Until then...  Saturday's COP26 theme will be nature - underlying the importance of the natural world and sustainable land use. As the first week of the conference comes to an end, millions of people around the world are expected to take part in a Global Day of Action for Climate Justice. About 200 demonstrations are expected around the world - including another march in Glasgow and another event in London leaving from the Bank of England and onto a rally in Trafalgar Square. In Glasgow, climate actvist Greta Thunberg is also expected to give another speech. Read more:Who is Greta Thunberg and what are her aims? David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News Maybe itâs because the conference crowds have thinned and
the security queues are shorter but the mood does seem a fraction brighter at
the end of this first week. Perhaps the flurry of promises on everything frommethanetocoalandforeststofinanceshows momentum is possible. Or itâs India, a giant of the developing world thatâs long
resisted climate targets, signalling that itâscoming on board. But itâs wise to be cautious. Promises are not the same as
delivery. And US envoy John Kerry is emphatic that weâre still at the stage of
âjob not doneâ. The pledges made so far should lead to a less scary rise in
the projected temperature. But that depends on them being implemented - and given the
low levels of trust, will everyone do what they say they will? Thereâs another week of hard negotiating to go.

Former US vice president Al Gore has just finished giving a speech at the global legislators summit at the Scottish parliament. He told delegates the world is at a ""long-awaited political tipping point"" in the fight against climate change. Gore, who served two terms as vice president under Bill Clinton, said ""impressive"" pledges for action have been made in Glasgow. But he warned the climate crisis is getting worse ""faster than we are yet implementing solutions"", insisting that more political will is needed to tackle the problem. He added it is crucial more countries and organisations are held to account on net-zero pledges. With increasingly strong voices demanding governments do more, the job of legislators is to ""translate the popular will into effective solutions for the climate crisis"", he said. We must put the period of delay and distraction and expedience in the past, recognise that we have entered a period of consequences and make it a period of solutions.""  Reality Check While politicians at COP26 discuss saving the planet, many cities around the world
have been suffering particularly badly from air pollution in the last few
days. India's capital, Delhi, has
seen peak pollution levels following the festival of Diwali, during which
the use of millions of fireworksfills the air with harmful particles. In addition to the fireworks,
the industrial use of coal and the burning of crop stubble across the region
has contributed to extreme concentrations of small and harmful particles known as PM2.5. Smog envelopes a highway in the Delhi area Delhi, as well as the Chinese capital, Beijing, currently top the rankings for the cities with the worst air quality, according to the IQAir index,which monitors air pollution in real time.,external In Beijing. PM2.5 levels are 17 times higher than WHO guidelines, and the elderly, children and the sick are being advised to stay inside. Beijingâs air pollution is mainly caused by the burning of coal to produce electricity. As the worldâs biggest consumer and producer of coal, the country is heavily reliant on it, although President Xi Jinping has promised to âphase downâ coal use from 2026. Another country facing serious air pollution is Kyrgyzstan, whose capital Bishkek is sometimes enveloped in hazardous smog in winter. Officials have blamed pollution in the capital on the use of coal by nearby power plants. At the COP26 summit, Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov pledged to achieve a âcarbon-free green development platformâ by 2050, moving away from coal to hydropower. Earlier, we heard from Ineza Umuhoza Grace, a Rwandan advocate who has been at COP26 this week. She told BBC Young Reporters Maisie and Nel about how she decided to fight for communities affected by climate change in her country. This is her message to other young people: Donât be afraid to show your colours in terms of achieving climate justice because everyone, everywhere has a voice - and everyone, everywhere has an ability to believe in change.  We should be messengers to our elders, and tell them that we all have one planet... we are all interconnected. We can only survive if we work together.  Young people can make our leaders accountable.  We've also heard Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate address the thousands of climate
protestors gathered in Glasgowâs George Square. The
24-year-old from Kampala, inspired by Greta Thunberg, began her own strike in
January 2019 in front of the Ugandan parliament building. She says her country is witnessing the impacts of the climate crisis first hand. ""People
are dying, children are dropping out of school, peopleâs farms are being
destroyed,"" she says. ""We are in a crisis, we are in a disaster that is
happening every day."" Africa is suffering the worst impacts of climate change, Vanessa says, even though historically the continent is only responsible for 3% of global emissions. She ends on an upbeat note with a vision of what the future could be like - ""the farms can blossom again...the pain and suffering is gone,"" - but urges the crowd to ""continue to hold leaders to account"". ""We don't need any more empty promises,"" the teenage campaigner says to cheers from the crowd. Greta says they do not want ""commitments that are full of loopholes"" and ones that ""ignore historical emissions and climate justice"". ""And that's all we are getting."" Leaders ""cannot ignore the scientific consensus"" the people, or their own children, she says. ""We are tired of their blah, blah, blah. Our leaders are not leading."" Before concluding her speech, Greta thanks everyone for attending the march, and says she hopes to see them at tomorrow's march too. They have had 26 COPs, they have had decades of blah, blah, blah - and where has that got us?  ""The leaders are doing nothing,"" Greta tells the crowd. ""It seems like their main goal is to continue to fight for the status quo."" She goes on to say COP26 has been named ""the most exclusionary COP ever"". She calls it a ""global greenwash festival"", a ""failure"" and a ""PR exercise"". ""A two-week long celebration of business as usual and blah, blah, blah,"" she says, repeating a phrase heard in a previous speech. She says the people in the most affected areas ""still remain unheard"". It's now time for the speaker the crowd have been waiting for - as campaigner Greta Thunberg takes to the stage in Glasgow. The Swedish teenager begins by saying COP26 ""is a failure"". ""We cannot solve a crisis with the same methods that got us into this in the first place,"" she says. ""What will it take for the people in power to wake up?"" The protest in Glasgow has been hearing from activists from around the world The city's George Square is packed with climate activists Activists of all ages are at the protest Penty of handmade placards can be spotted in the crowd Some protesters were dressed in masks of world leaders Thousands of people are in the crowd Paul O'HareBBC Scotland News The moment many in this large crowd in George Square have
been waiting for is not far away now...it's almost time for Greta Thunberg to
address this Fridays for Future rally. Before it got under way it was clear the 18-year-old Swedish climate campaigner was the star attraction. In
a bid to warm up the Glasgow crowd, the MC shouted: âWhat do we want?â They
replied: âGreta!â The MC joked: âYou're supposed to say 'climate justice'.â Greta Thunberg (blue hat) waits in a group near the main stage in George Square Nel RichardsBBC Young Reporter Speaking with activist Ineza Umuhoza Grace was a pleasure. The true facts and impacts of climate change on her family in Rwanda were very clear and she taught me that we need to fight this crisis together. Her courage was inspirational and she is a true advocate for young people. I asked her: If you ever feel disheartened by the challenge ahead, what are your tips for staying positive and motivated? âI like to challenge my personality first, Iâm the type of person that doesnât like to give up, I like to focus on what I can do.  Iâm too positive for negativity but sometimes I need to be realistic and not to be scared to share my voice.  Ineza is an inspirational campaigner but a bad selfie taker... Ineza Umuhoza Grace, 25, is a environmental advocate from Rwanda who has been at COP26 events this week campaigning for greater financial
support for communities already experiencing damage because of climate change. She's been speaking to BBC Young Reporters Maisie Goodwin and Nel Richards in between a packed schedule at the conference centre. They started by asking what affects of climate change she had personally experienced: I was exposed to climate change from a very young age - five or six - because I have the memory of floods in my house and my bedroom was like a lake.  When I finished my secondary school classes, I wanted to study to become a pilot or a mechanical engineer because I was good in science. Then when I watched the news, I had the information that in one particular area in my country, a rural area, women and children were being forced to move because of erosion and flooding. When I saw the news, it reminded me of how hopeless I felt. Then I wanted to study environmental engineering because I wanted to learn how to contribute to my community.  In 2020 our country lost 4,000 hectares of crops, due to flooding and intense rainfall. This especially affects women and children - when they are forced to move their crop fields this is very problematic. We also see a lot of damage to schools and homes.â  Next up, Mail and Nel asked her about how she stays motivated and positive. While COP26 is focsued on how governments can avoid the worst impacts of climate change, there are many ways in which we as individuals can do our bit for the planet. One of the ways we can reduce our carbon footprint is through what we eat. Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, according to a major report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),which says the West's high consumption of meat and dairy is fuelling global warming. If youâre eating beef three to five times a week, over an entire year your consumption is contributing 1,611kg to your annual greenhouse gas emissions. That's the equivalent of driving a regular petrol car 4,112 miles (6,618km), or taking five return flights from London to Malaga. Hello â itâs Nel Richards and Maisie Goodwin here, two of the BBCâs Young Reporters. Weâve been speaking to James Miller, who is attending COP26 today as a delegate with Unicef. âYoung people have contributed least to the climate crisis but they are the ones who will be most impacted by it,â he tells us. âMore than half of the world's children are at extreme risk of climate related impacts - that's over a billion children.â The 19-year-old is calling for young peopleâs voices to be represented more in negotiations. He says he is pleased to see so many young people at COP today but they should be handed more power. âThere are a very few young people that are in those decision making roles, there are a few delegates representing countries who are under the UNâs definition of âyoungâ.â Helen BriggsBBC Environment Correspondent in Glasgow Inside COP's inner Blue Zone, face masks are everywhere. Most wear regular white ones, but brightly-coloured masks
are popping up around the conference centre - in shades of yellow, orange and
green. Why? Theyâre being worn to highlight that gender justice and
human rights are central to climate action. ""We demand nothing less,"" says Mara Dolan, a member of the
Women & Gender Constituency, a network of feminist activists at COP. Another member, Gina Cortes, says there are ""deep inequities
and deep injustices"" at this COP, with some observers, especially from the
global south, missing from the conference due to travel restrictions Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check This video can not be played What is Climate Justice? With many of today's protesters in Glasgow calling for ""climate justice"", what exactly does the term mean? Many of the countries worst affected by climate change have contributed least to the emissions that cause it. So where should the burden lie in taking action to counter it? Check out this video as Reality Check's Chris Morris examines some of the big questions. Activists from across the world are taking to the stage in George Square, Glasgow, to address the thousands of climate protesters that have gathered there. So far, we've had speakers from Colombia, Papa New Guinea, Uganda, Pakistan and the UK.

"Flooding in Bangladesh: The world's poorest 50% will have the lowest carbon footprint, the study says The carbon footprint of the world's richest 1% is on track to be 30 times higher than what's needed to limit global warming to 1.5C, a study says. But emissions of the poorest 50% will continue to be below climate goals. The research, carried out by two European environmental agencies, comes as world leaders meet at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow. ""A tiny elite appear to have a free pass to pollute,"" says Naftoke Dabi at Oxfam. The charity commissioned the study from the Stockholm Environment Institute and the Institute for European Environmental Policy. ""Their over-sized emissions are fuelling extreme weather around the world and jeopardising the international goal of limiting global heating."" Climate scientists warn that there is a finite amount of greenhouse gases that we can continue to release into the atmosphere before the planet warms to more than 1.5C from pre-industrial levels. By 2030, they say, we need to only emit as much carbon dioxide as the planet can absorb. If this amount were split evenly and every adult on the planet had a share, by 2030 we could each emit 2.3 tonnes of CO2 every year. The super-rich - many of whom have multiple homes, private jets and superyachts - emit a lot more than others. Arecent study,externalthat tracked the air travel of celebrities via their social media accounts found some emitted over a thousand tonnes a year. But the global 1% are not just billionaires, or even millionaires - it includes anyone earning over $172,000. This study also looked at the world's richest 10% - anyone earning over $55,000 - and found emissions were still high. The richest 10% will emit nine times more carbon dioxide than their share. Traci Curth's family has three cars, which she says is normal for most American families One example of people in the top 10% is the Curths, a family of four in the suburbs of Toledo, Ohio. Traci Curth, her husband and her teenage daughter each drive a car. ""The suburb I live in, that's pretty much how everyone gets around,"" says Traci. Toledo has hot summers and cold winters, so the air-conditioning is on when the heating isn't. The family has a freezer loaded with chicken breasts and mince beef - they eat meat about four or five times a week. ""I would say that's pretty normal for most American families,"" says Traci. Togonin, an English teacher and environmental educator, doesn't own a car and goes to work on moped For English teacher Togonin Severin Togo in Kati, Mali, life is quite different. Like 80% of people in the world he doesn't have a car - he travels to work on his moped. ""Cars are considered to be for rich people,"" he says. He gave up meat recently, but before that he ate it just two or three times a week. And - like 90% of people around the world - he's never been on an aeroplane. But he does worry about emissions from people burning waste in his city, where the waste management system is not functional, as well as the inefficient wood and gas burners used for cooking. Oxfam's report found that it's the 40% in the middle doing the most to curb emissions. While their carbon footprint rose significantly between 1990 and 2015, it is set to drop, thanks to changes being made at government level in sectors like transport and energy since the Paris climate agreement in 2015. But governments need to do more, Oxfam's Naftoke Dabi says, calling for bans and taxes on ""carbon-intensive luxury goods, such as mega-mansions, SUVs or space tourism"". ""They need to tackle the emissions of the richest because they're hugely responsible for the climate crisis, and it's the poorest that are paying the highest price,"" she says.

"Maros Sefcovic says triggering Article 16 would cause unpredictability in Northern Ireland There will be ""serious consequences"" if the UK triggers Article 16, European Commission (EC) Vice-President Maros Sefcovic has warned. Mr Sefcovic said the move would be ""serious for Northern Ireland as it would lead to instability and unpredictability"". His comments follow a meeting with the UK's Brexit minister in Brussels overthe protocol dispute. Lord Frost said progress at the meeting was ""limited"". He said gaps could still be bridged through intensive negotiations. The protocol is the special Brexit deal agreed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are now subject to checks and control It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU. But it also creates a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The EU hasproposed measuresto ease the checks and controls for goods crossing the Irish Sea. But the UK is demanding fundamental reform and there is growing speculation it will trigger Article 16 - which allows parts of the protocol to beunilaterally suspended if they are causing serious difficulties- in the coming weeks. Mr Sefcovic said triggering Article 16 would be serious for EU-UK relations ""as it would mean a rejection of EU efforts to find a consensual solution to the implementation of the protocol"". He said that despite a ""big move"" by the EU on its proposals, ""until today we have seen no move at all from the UK side"". Lord Frost said the UK and EU would ""carry on trying"" to reach agreement Following Friday's meeting, a UK spokesperson said Lord Frost had indicated ""the EU's proposals did not currently deal effectively with the fundamental difficulties in the way the protocol was operating"". ""He underlined that the UK's preference was still to find a consensual solution that protected the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and the everyday lives of people in Northern Ireland,"" the spokesperson added. Before the meeting, Lord Frost had warned time was running out on the talks. He had said the UK was not going to trigger Article 16 on Friday, although this was ""very much on the table and has been since July"". There is growing speculation that the UK is planning to use Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol in the coming weeks. The Irish government says such a move would be ""reckless and irresponsible"", and Maros Sefcovic has warned it could result in ""serious consequences"". Ultimately, the EU could impose tariffs on UK goods - but that would only be possible after a lengthy arbitration process. The arbitrators would first have to find that the UK is in breach of the protocol. Then the UK would have to refuse to remedy that breach, at which point the EU could retaliate under the terms of the wider Brexit deal, the TCA. It could require another arbitration process to rule whether the use of tariffs is proportionate retaliation. There is a potentially faster legal track - known as infringement proceedings - which could lead to the UK being fined. Read the full analysis here. Lord Frost added that if the gap narrowed, the commission listened to what was said in the UK command paper and looked at the situation in Northern Ireland, that could help move things forward. He would not give a timescale on how long negotiations could last but said they were trying to reach agreement and were going to ""carry on trying"". The European Commission has also ruled out talk about deadlines but it is understood the EU could look to legally challenge any move by the UK to trigger Article 16. Ultimately, the EU could impose tariffs on UK goods, but that would only be possible after a lengthy arbitration process. EC spokesman Daniel Ferrie told reporters in Brussels on Friday that the commission was ""fully concentrated on finding solutions"". He said the EU's proposals were ""far-reaching and ambitious"". Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem What is Article 16 and what exactly does it say? Most NI checks on British goods to be scrapped Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he expected to see decisive action on the protocol before the end of November. Sir Jeffrey, whose party opposes the protocol, said he would meet Lord Frost next week to discuss the issue. ""The protocol is harming Northern Ireland, it is harming our economy, it is harming our political place in the union and that's why I want to see new arrangements put in place that respect Northern Ireland's place within the UK internal market,"" he said. ""I hope agreement can be reached but if it can't then within weeks I want to see the UK government taking decisive action."" The EU accepts the Northern Ireland Protocol is causing difficulties for many businesses but its proposed measures to ease checks and controls for goods crossing the Irish Sea have not been accepted by the UK government. It is seeking more wide-ranging reform of the protocol. Last month, Lord Frost said the UK government would not trigger Article 16""gratuitously or with any particular pleasure"". Article 16 can be triggered if the protocol is leading to serious ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"" that are liable to persist. If the UK was to use Article 16 to suspend most controls on goods going from GB to NI, that could cause significant problems for Ireland. It could reopen questions about goods being controlled as they cross the Irish border or as they leave Ireland for the rest of the EU. Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin has said it would be""irresponsible and reckless""for the UK to trigger Article 16. Meanwhile,a survey has indicated that the protocol is not a top priority for most people across Northern Ireland,external, including unionists. Unionist parties in Northern Ireland oppose the protocol, as they say it undermines their place in the UK. It ranked fourth on the list of priorities behind health, Covid recovery and the economy. The survey also shows the majority of the 1,000 people asked would support remaining in the UK if a border poll was held ""tomorrow"". Reacting to the survey, Sir Jeffrey said he did not agree that people do not care about the protocol, saying it was a ""big issue for many people, particularly those businesses that are being harmed"". ""They do care about the protocol and they also care, as I do, about other issues like health, like Covid recovery, the economy. Unionists say the protocol damages trade and threatens Northern Ireland's place in the UK ""These things are important and they are all inextricably bound up in our membership of the union."" Commissioned by the University of Liverpool, the survey questioned people across all of Northern Ireland's council areas last month. Of those who responded, 39% described themselves as unionist, 26% nationalist and 33% neither unionist or nationalist The survey indicated that just over 9% said the protocol was their biggest concern. When broken down, just 12% of unionists said the protocol was the important issue for them. More than 60% also said they wanted the Stormont Executive to remain in place until the Assembly election in May. When asked how they would vote in a border poll ""tomorrow"", 58% of those surveyed supported remaining in the UK, with 29% voting for a united Ireland.

"Rooney's refusal to work with an Israeli publisher triggered a wave of both anger and praise Two of Israel's biggest bookstores say they are stopping selling works by Irish author Sally Rooney, after she refused to allow an Israeli publisher to translate her new book into Hebrew. The acclaimed writer said it was in support of calls to boycott Israel over its policies towards the Palestinians. The move by the bookstores follows a backlash against Rooney's decision. Her stance triggered a wave of both praise and condemnation, escalating into a war of words on social media. On Thursday, bookstores Steimatzky and Tzomet Sefarim said they would remove Rooney's books from their branches and online sites. The companies have more than 200 outlets across Israel. It is the first such action by Israeli booksellers since it emerged last month that Rooney had turned down a bid by Israeli publisher Modan for the rights to translate her book Beautiful World, Where Are You. She said that while she was ""very proud"" that her two previous novels had been translated into Hebrew, ""for the moment, I have chosen not to sell these translation rights to an Israeli-based publishing house"". Rooney said it was out of solidarity with the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which calls for a complete boycott of Israel. She could not, she said, ""accept a new contract with an Israeli company that does not publicly distance itself from apartheid and support the UN-stipulated rights of the Palestinian people"". Apartheid was a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white minority government against the black majority in South Africa from 1948 until 1991. Israel has long claimed BDS opposes the country's very existence and is motivated by anti-Semitism. It vehemently rejects any comparison with apartheid as a smear tactic. Rooney's decision was denounced by Israel's Diaspora Minister Nachman Shai, calling ""the cultural boycott of Israel anti-Semitism in a new guise"". The author said it would still ""be an honour"" to have Beautiful World, Where Are You translated into Hebrew by a company which shared her political position. The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel said Palestinians ""warmly welcomed"" her move, while others said she had been misrepresented. Rooney has received several book prizes in the UK, including The Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year Award in 2017 and a Costa Book Award in 2018.

"No 10 insists Boris Johnson followed the rules on declaring his holiday to Spain Opposition parties have called for an inquiry into Boris Johnson's free holiday at a Spanish villa owned by the family of minister Lord Zac Goldsmith. The PM declared the trip on theRegister of Ministers' Interests,external, saying he had ""a longstanding personal friendship"" with the family. But Labour and the Lib Dems say he should publish details on theRegister of Members' Interests,externalcovering all MPs. No 10 said he did not need to and had followed all transparency rules. The Register of Members' Interests is a list of any financial benefits MPs get away from Parliament, such as wages from a second job or gifts, like a company paying for a trip abroad. The idea behind it is to keep a check on any conflicts of interest and to ensure MPs do what they think is the best thing for the public, rather than for any external influencers. The Register of Ministers' Interests is similar but just covers government ministers, including the activities of close family members. It can also cover non-financial interests, like if they are a member of an organisation away from Parliament. But unlike the list for members, only the prime minister can dish out punishments for breaking the rules - for the wider group of MPs, they would face an investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. Johnson given free holiday by minister Goldsmith PM's explanation for Mustique trip criticised What does 'sleaze' mean when politicians use it? The investigations into Boris Johnson and the government A No 10 spokesman claimed the trip to Spain did not need to be on the MPs' register - where declarations often include the price - because it was not connected to his work as an MP. It was ""a family holiday at the home of longstanding family friends and is unconnected with a PM's parliamentary and political activities,"" the spokesman added. ""Given the hospitality was provided by another minister [Lord Goldsmith] it's right that the PM made this declaration in his ministerial capacity to ensure sufficient transparency."" But the two opposition parties said the prime minister had broken the code of conduct for MPs - the same rulesthe government tried to rewrite on Wednesday, before performing a U-turn. Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has written to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Stone, saying the public would draw the conclusion the PM was ""dishing out cushy jobs to his friends who pay for his luxury holidays"". She told reporters Mr Johnson had ""broken the rules more times than I've had hot dinners"", adding: ""If he's getting money and gifts that he's not declaring, that's very serious because we then don't know if these are people who are unduly able to influence the PM."" The Liberal Democrats said the Conservatives ""don't have a shred of integrity left"" after this week's row over standards. ""The Tories have shown they can't be trusted to mark their own homework on this issue,"" she added. ""They are now the party of sleaze,"" added Lib Dem chief whip Wendy Chamberlain. Mr Johnson took the trip to to southern Spain in October, with his wife Carrie and their son, and stayed in a villa owned by Lord Goldsmith's family for free. The peer is a close friend of the prime minister's wife and gave her her first job in politics. Goldsmith lost his seat as an MP for Richmond Park in 2019, but retained his job as an environment minister after Mr Johnson appointed him to the House of Lords. Carrie Johnson (left) and Lord Goldsmith (centre), pictured here campaigning with former Conservative leader Theresa May in 2017 The government is supposed to publish a list of any financial benefits received by ministers twice a year. Themost recent list includes,externalthe declaration that: ""The prime minister has a longstanding personal friendship with the Goldsmith family and, in that capacity, in October 2021, stayed in a holiday home in southern Spain which was provided free of charge by the Goldsmiths. ""Given Lord Goldsmith is a minister of the crown, the arrangement has accordingly been declared."" But Labour says he should also publish the details in the MPs' register that would likely show the cost of the accommodation. It is not the first time the PM has come under scrutiny for free holidays. He was been criticised over how slow he was to explain the funding of his trip to the Caribbean island of Mustique shortly after winning the 2019 election. Aninvestigation by the Committee on Standards,externalfound Mr Johnson had not broken the rules but criticised the arrangements as ""ad hoc and informal"". In her letter to the Commissioner, Labour's Ms Rayner claimed the PM had ""a long history of breaching the rules in relation to parliamentary standards and other integrity and anti-corruption measures"". She also pointed to the ruling over the Mustique trip, which said he was ""required under the House's rules to register the holiday accommodation he received"". Ms Rayner added: ""We cannot have a situation where Boris Johnson behaves like it's one rule for him and another for everyone else. ""I would be grateful for your guidance on whether this is a breach of the rules, and whether you will investigate the Member of Parliament for Uxbridge and South Ruislip."" The PM's spokesman said Mr Johnson did not need to declare the holiday on the list of MPs interests as ""ministerial code declarations fall outside the remit of the House of Commons registrar and Parliamentary Standards Commissioner"". He added: ""The PM has written to the House of Commons registrar to set out that this holiday has been declared under the ministerial code, because the arrangement is with another minister.""

"Maros Sefcovic says triggering Article 16 would cause unpredictability in Northern Ireland There will be ""serious consequences"" if the UK triggers Article 16, European Commission (EC) Vice-President Maros Sefcovic has warned. Mr Sefcovic said the move would be ""serious for Northern Ireland as it would lead to instability and unpredictability"". His comments follow a meeting with the UK's Brexit minister in Brussels overthe protocol dispute. Lord Frost said progress at the meeting was ""limited"". He said gaps could still be bridged through intensive negotiations. The protocol is the special Brexit deal agreed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are now subject to checks and control It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU.

"Flooding in Bangladesh: The world's poorest 50% will have the lowest carbon footprint, the study says The carbon footprint of the world's richest 1% is on track to be 30 times higher than what's needed to limit global warming to 1.5C, a study says. But emissions of the poorest 50% will continue to be below climate goals. The research, carried out by two European environmental agencies, comes as world leaders meet at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow. ""A tiny elite appear to have a free pass to pollute,"" says Naftoke Dabi at Oxfam. The charity commissioned the study from the Stockholm Environment Institute and the Institute for European Environmental Policy. ""Their over-sized emissions are fuelling extreme weather around the world and jeopardising the international goal of limiting global heating."" Climate scientists warn that there is a finite amount of greenhouse gases that we can continue to release into the atmosphere before the planet warms to more than 1.5C from pre-industrial levels. By 2030, they say, we need to only emit as much carbon dioxide as the planet can absorb. If this amount were split evenly and every adult on the planet had a share, by 2030 we could each emit 2.3 tonnes of CO2 every year. The super-rich - many of whom have multiple homes, private jets and superyachts - emit a lot more than others. Arecent study,externalthat tracked the air travel of celebrities via their social media accounts found some emitted over a thousand tonnes a year. But the global 1% are not just billionaires, or even millionaires - it includes anyone earning over $172,000. This study also looked at the world's richest 10% - anyone earning over $55,000 - and found emissions were still high. The richest 10% will emit nine times more carbon dioxide than their share. Traci Curth's family has three cars, which she says is normal for most American families One example of people in the top 10% is the Curths, a family of four in the suburbs of Toledo, Ohio. Traci Curth, her husband and her teenage daughter each drive a car. ""The suburb I live in, that's pretty much how everyone gets around,"" says Traci. Toledo has hot summers and cold winters, so the air-conditioning is on when the heating isn't. The family has a freezer loaded with chicken breasts and mince beef - they eat meat about four or five times a week. ""I would say that's pretty normal for most American families,"" says Traci. Togonin, an English teacher and environmental educator, doesn't own a car and goes to work on moped For English teacher Togonin Severin Togo in Kati, Mali, life is quite different. Like 80% of people in the world he doesn't have a car - he travels to work on his moped. ""Cars are considered to be for rich people,"" he says. He gave up meat recently, but before that he ate it just two or three times a week. And - like 90% of people around the world - he's never been on an aeroplane. But he does worry about emissions from people burning waste in his city, where the waste management system is not functional, as well as the inefficient wood and gas burners used for cooking. Oxfam's report found that it's the 40% in the middle doing the most to curb emissions. While their carbon footprint rose significantly between 1990 and 2015, it is set to drop, thanks to changes being made at government level in sectors like transport and energy since the Paris climate agreement in 2015. But governments need to do more, Oxfam's Naftoke Dabi says, calling for bans and taxes on ""carbon-intensive luxury goods, such as mega-mansions, SUVs or space tourism"". ""They need to tackle the emissions of the richest because they're hugely responsible for the climate crisis, and it's the poorest that are paying the highest price,"" she says.

"Electronic monitoring of home workers by companies is rising sharply, a survey suggests. The government is being urged to toughen the rules - and ban most webcam use. ""It was creepy,"" says Chris. ""One of my managers was watching people's personal computers to monitor what we were doing at home - all the time, not just when we were working. It was a bizarre way to carry on."" When the first lockdown started, the firm that employed Chris - a 31-year-old engineer from Sheffield - sent most of its staff home. They were ordered to connect their private laptop and desktop computers to more powerful office machines so they could continue their high-tech operations. ""We didn't mind,"" says Chris, ""but I found loads of screens switched on one day when I came in to the office, and everybody's desktops were there, on display. ""One of the managers wasn't just looking at our work. He could see exactly what we were doing all the time - what we were watching on YouTube, that kind of thing."" Call to ban out-of-hours emails from bosses How does it feel to be watched at work all the time? How more of us are ditching screens to work outside Is my boss allowed to spy on me? The pandemic forced millions of people, who previously carried out most or all of their work in the office, to do it at home instead. And many firms have been using technology once mostly confined to the office to monitor what staff are getting up to. Cameras can watch people at their desks. Movement sensors can be employed. Keyboard strokes and mouse movements can be recorded. Bosses can take screenshots of desktops to check staff are working rather than browsing the internet or watching videos. The trade union Prospect is calling for stronger regulation of the use of monitoring technology by employers. And it wants the government to make it explicitly illegal for employers to use webcams to monitor home workers, apart from when they are taking part in meetings and calls. This video can not be played Is your boss spying on you as you work from home? Prospect's latest polling suggests 32% of home workers are now being monitored by firms - up from 24% in April. The rate is highest - at 48% - among people aged 18-to-34, it adds. The union, which is launching a new sector to recruit tech workers, also says the proportion of people being monitored at home by camera has more than doubled - from 5% to 13% - since April. ""We are used to the idea of employers checking up on workers, but when people are working in their own homes, this assumes a whole new dimension,"" says general secretary Mike Clancy. ""New technology allows employers to have a constant window into their employees' homes, and the use of the technology is largely unregulated by government."" The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) advises that employers should ensure staff are aware of monitoring at work - whether at home or in the office - before it starts. They should also explicitly be informed of the reasons for this happening. The ICO urges employers to consider the potential negative effects of monitoring on staff and whether there are less intrusive alternatives, such as catch-up calls or email exchanges. Chris, who changed companies after he found out one of his managers was monitoring his home activities. thinks ""excessive"" surveillance is counter-productive. ""My productivity didn't go down when I started working from home,"" he says, ""and when I knew what was happening it made me more nervous. ""A lot of the time in my job is spent designing things on paper, away from the screen, so that doesn't register if someone is simply looking at what's going on on my desktop. ""It probably looked to that guy like I was downstairs watching Netflix or something, but I wasn't. It's a very blunt, depersonalising way of trying to ensure people behave in the way a company wants."" Anna Thomas, director of the Institute for the Future of Work think tank, says increased surveillance is ""driving an intensification"" of pressure on staff. But firms using the technology argue that they are acting reasonably, with so many employees now out of sight of managers and otherwise difficult to oversee. Official research suggests that, as Covid measures are relaxed,fewer people are working exclusively from home,externalor under hybrid arrangements - a mixture of home and office - than at the height of the pandemic. But many still are. The government is proposing that peopleshould get the right to flexible working,externalas soon as they start a new job. Its consultation, which includes looking at home working, closes on 1 December. ""People expect that they can keep their personal lives private and that they are also entitled to a degree of privacy in the workplace,"" an ICO spokesperson said. ""We are currently working on updating our employment practices guidance to address the changes in data protection law and to reflect the new ways employers use technology and interact with staff,"" they added. For Labour, shadow digital minister Chi Onwurah said: ""Ministers must urgently provide better regulatory oversight of online surveillance software to ensure people have the right to privacy, whether in their workplace or home."" For Prospect's survey, 2,424 UK workers were questioned by Opinium from 19 to 22 October. Chris's real name has been changed for this article.

"The Queen has left Windsor Castle for a private weekend away at her Sandringham home as she continues to rest following advice from her doctors. The 95-year-old monarch is thought to be spending a few days at her Norfolk residence as part of a long-planned trip. Aviation sources say she flew to the East Anglian estate by helicopter. Last week doctors advised the Queen to rest until mid-November following medical checks in hospital last month. Buckingham Palace said the Queen could carry out some light, desk-based duties during that time, but not undertake official visits. She recently recorded a video message for world leaders attending the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow,urging them to work together in ""common cause""to curb climate change. Queen spotted driving car near Windsor estate In pictures: The Queen's busy October Who gives the Queen medical advice? Earlier this week she was spotted driving her car near Windsor Castle, in an area she is known to take her Corgi dogs out for walks. She was photographed in a headscarf and sunglasses behind the wheel of a green Jaguar estate car. The UK's longest-reigning monarch also carried out her weekly meeting with Prime Minister Boris Johnson by telephone on Wednesday. Mr Johnson later said she was ""on very good form"" and that""the whole country wishes her well"". The Queen maintained a busy schedule in October with at least 16 formal events recorded in her official diary. She was seen using a walking stick at a Westminster Abbey service on 12 October - the first time she has done so at a major event. The Queen was seen using a walking stick at a Westminster Abbey service recently She went on to host a Global Investment Summit at Windsor Castle on 19 October. The next day a Palace spokesman said her planned trip to Northern Ireland had been cancelled, and the monarch had ""reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days"". In a later statement, Buckingham Palace said she had spent the night at the King Edward VII's Hospital in central London - her first overnight stay at a medical facility in eight years. She returned to Windsor the following day ""in good spirits"", the Palace said. She resumed public engagements on 26 October,holding virtual audiences with ambassadorsvia video link, and a few days later was advised by her doctors to rest until mid-November. Buckingham Palace previously said the monarch would miss the annual Festival of Remembrance on 13 November, which is held by the Royal British Legion and attended by senior members of the Royal Family.

"This video can not be played Welfare Officer Taz Harrison is worried about staff and customers getting a ride home at night More than half of licensed mini-cab taxi drivers have not returned to the trade since the pandemic, an industry group has said. The Licensed Private Hire Car Association (LPHCA) estimates the industry is short of 160,000 of the previously 300,000-strong workforce. Many drivers left the industry during lockdowns as demand plummeted. The shortage has prompted concerns over the safety of women, students and night time workers struggling to get home. A backlog in costly licensing and registration of vehicles, as well as criminal and medical checks for drivers, have led to what the LPHCA have called ""a perfect storm"". A mini-cab driver must apply to their local council for a licence, which can cost up to Â£600 a year. Drivers must also obtain a criminal record check and a full medical check, as well as the famous ""Knowledge"" examination in some cases. ""This is a real national problem that affects everywhere,"" said Steve Wright, chairman of the LPHCA. ""We have had calls from Inverness in Scotland, right down to Cornwall, with people saying they cannot get drivers and they cannot get licences quickly enough,"" he told the BBC. Why is there an HGV driver shortage? Taxi-hailing firm reveals 4,158 sexual assaults It is leaving thousands of customers in the lurch. Taxis provide a vital service; taking people to hospital appointments, back from the shops and of course safely home after an evening out. Taz Harrison, Welfare Officer at The Sugarmill in Stoke-on-Trent, said she was worried about both staff and customers getting a ride. ""I am finishing at the club at 4am and waiting until 5am or 6am in the morning to get a taxi,"" she explained. ""It's a long time to be stood by yourself in town - pre-pandemic it was 5-10 minutes."" ""I've worked in venues for 20 years and I've never known it this bad."" The Sugarmill is emptying its doors of 600 music fans at the same time as multiple venues across Hanley do the same. ""The majority of people are giving up and walking,"" Ms Harrison added. Students at Staffordshire University are unsurprised by this. ""There's no taxis anywhere, or they're all dodgy,"" one student explained. ""You get in and they want the money before you go anywhere,"" she continued. The student's friend also shared their experience: ""A taxi driver let another guy get in a taxi with me when I finished work and he was flat out drunk - I was like, no!"" Another student explained she asked her Mum and Dad for a lift instead. The National Union of Students said some universities were partnering with taxi firms to create safer routes to students. However, the union urged the government to do more. ""This is a public safety issue, and it vital that we address it now so that we stop seeing students stranded in unknown areas,"" said Hillary Gyebi-Ababio, vice president for higher education. In the current climate, of heightened safety concerns, especially for women, news of this shortage is particularly worrying. A few hours wait or a walk home on a balmy summer's evening may seem less of a problem than on a cold, dark, winter's night. As long queues grow in many towns waiting for the only available taxis, tempers fray and those travelling alone become even more vulnerable. The taxi shortage is impacting every corner of the UK. Some rural pubs, are already reporting that customers are being put off coming out when they know they'll struggle to get home. In bigger cities the shortage has been masked for a while by app services like Uber, but now people are experiencing longer waits, cancelled trips, and sky-high surcharging as drivers have more work than they can cover at any time of the day. One council taking a proactive approach to tackle the shortage is Torbay in Devon, where they have slashed the cost of licensing to just Â£50 to get more drivers behind the wheel. ""We were seeing massive queues for cabs and the tourist trade was being affected, so we thought we'd better step in,"" explained councillor Christine Carter. ""In the summer, we had taxi marshals to help people, and we are going to do that again at Christmas to make it as safe as possible."" However Torbay's approach has only provided half of the drivers they need so far. ""All we can keep doing is keep saying, 'please, please apply',"" Councillor Carter added. The Night Time Industries Association said the issue raises concerns over transport infrastructure. The association's chief executive Michael Kill said he was alarmed by the driver shortage and called for it to be prioritised by the government and city leaders across the country. ""With a focus on vulnerability, and the safety of women at night, and thousands of night workers across the country, we cannot underestimate the vital role these services play in keeping people safe at night,"" Mr Kill added. A spokesperson from the Department for Transport responded: ""While provision of taxi licences is the responsibility of Local Authorities, we continue to work with industry groups to address concerns over potential shortages."" ""Throughout the pandemic we have supported private hire vehicle drivers through grants from the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme,"" the spokesperson added. The Department for Transport also plans to revise licensing guidelines, but consultations on this will not happen until next year. Why is there an HGV driver shortage?

"Rooney's refusal to work with an Israeli publisher triggered a wave of both anger and praise Two of Israel's biggest bookstores say they are stopping selling works by Irish author Sally Rooney, after she refused to allow an Israeli publisher to translate her new book into Hebrew. The acclaimed writer said it was in support of calls to boycott Israel over its policies towards the Palestinians. The move by the bookstores follows a backlash against Rooney's decision. Her stance triggered a wave of both praise and condemnation, escalating into a war of words on social media. On Thursday, bookstores Steimatzky and Tzomet Sefarim said they would remove Rooney's books from their branches and online sites. The companies have more than 200 outlets across Israel. It is the first such action by Israeli booksellers since it emerged last month that Rooney had turned down a bid by Israeli publisher Modan for the rights to translate her book Beautiful World, Where Are You. She said that while she was ""very proud"" that her two previous novels had been translated into Hebrew, ""for the moment, I have chosen not to sell these translation rights to an Israeli-based publishing house"". Rooney said it was out of solidarity with the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which calls for a complete boycott of Israel. She could not, she said, ""accept a new contract with an Israeli company that does not publicly distance itself from apartheid and support the UN-stipulated rights of the Palestinian people"". Apartheid was a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white minority government against the black majority in South Africa from 1948 until 1991. Israel has long claimed BDS opposes the country's very existence and is motivated by anti-Semitism. It vehemently rejects any comparison with apartheid as a smear tactic. Rooney's decision was denounced by Israel's Diaspora Minister Nachman Shai, calling ""the cultural boycott of Israel anti-Semitism in a new guise"". The author said it would still ""be an honour"" to have Beautiful World, Where Are You translated into Hebrew by a company which shared her political position. The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel said Palestinians ""warmly welcomed"" her move, while others said she had been misrepresented. Rooney has received several book prizes in the UK, including The Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year Award in 2017 and a Costa Book Award in 2018.

"Growth in UK house prices accelerated again last month, with the average property price now Â£270,027, according to the UK's largest mortgage lender. Prices rose 8.1% in the year to October, up from an annual rate of 7.4% the month before. With interest rate rises still on the horizon, the lender said it expected house-buying demand to cool in coming months as borrowing costs rose. However, these would still be ""low by historical standards"", it added. ""Raising a deposit is likely to remain the primary obstacle for many. The impact on property prices may also be tempered by the continued limited supply of properties available on the market,"" said Russell Galley, managing director, Halifax, which is part of Lloyds Banking Group. October was the fourth month in a row of rising house prices, boosting the annual rate of growth to its highest since June. Bank of England hints at future interest rate rise Average house price now more than Â£250,000, says lender Surge in house prices predicted to slow The Halifax said the cost of a typical home rose 0.9% in October from the month before, an increase of more than Â£2,500. ""One of the key drivers of activity in the housing market over the past 18 months has been the race for space, with buyers seeking larger properties, often further from urban centres,"" said Mr Galley. Temporary measures such as the cut to Stamp Duty had also helped to lift prices, along with an influx of first-time buyers supported by parental deposits, he added. In regional terms, Wales remained the strongest performing area, the Halifax said, with annual house price inflation of 12.9% and an average house price of Â£198,880. In England, the North West has returned to being the strongest performing region. Prices rose by 10.4% over the 12 months, with the average house costing Â£205,881. Average house prices in London are still far higher than elsewhere in the country at Â£514,907. However, the capital saw the UK's lowest house price growth of just 0.8%. Earlier this week, rival lender the Nationwide said its research showed the price of a typical UK home was now Â£250,311 after prices rose by 9.9% in the last year. The building society said prices rose 0.7% in October compared with the previous month. The limited supply of housing being put up for sale has hit online estate agent Purplebricks, which cut its earnings outlook on Thursday because fewer properties were being added to its platform. It said it expected instructions from its clients to sell or rent out properties to have fallen by 38% to 22,000 in the six months to the end of October, as compared with a year earlier.

"MPs have called for investigations into the owners of Liberty Steel and boss Sanjeev Gupta in a bid to avert another crisis in the industry. Auditors that signed off the accounts at Liberty's parent GFG Alliance should also face questions, MPs on the business committee say in a report. The committee highlights ""red flags"" and ""systemic risks"" that should have alerted authorities to the problems. The steel industry is too important to lurch from ""crisis to crisis"", say MPs. Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance, one of the UK's biggest industrial groups, was forced into an urgent financial restructuring when its key lender, Greensill Capital, collapsed. Greensill made money through supply chain finance - making loans to companies that are waiting for invoices to be paid by their customers. When the invoices were paid, the cash would be there to pay investors back, with interest. But the report by the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee says the use of such finance and the way Mr Gupta structured his businesses was questionable, concluding: Ministers should reflect on the systemic risks to the UK steel industry posed by such unusual corporate structures as those used by GFG Alliance Mr Gupta put senior members of his staff in an ""unacceptable position"" by not giving them the required access to information or decision-making powers needed to perform their roles The regulatory authorities should undertake an investigation into King & King, the auditors of a number of GFG Alliance businesses The Insolvency Service should consider whether Mr Gupta has breached his fiduciary duties as a company director. Darren Jones, chairman of the committee, said the steel industry was too important strategically to be left to the mercy of such things as international competition, high risk finance, and volatile energy prices. It was time for a Steel Sector Deal to ensure the industry's resilience, with better use of public procurement to support UK steel and help towards transitioning to a low-carbon future. Sanjeev Gupta is executive chairman of GFG Alliance But the GFG affair had exposed the sector's vulnerabilities, Mr Jones said. ""The evidence we heard during our inquiry has highlighted serious problems with high-risk financial practices, weaknesses in audit, and about inadequate accountability and corporate governance arrangements within GFG Alliance,"" Mr Jones said. He added: ""Sanjeev Gupta must urgently fix these problems if he is to be seen as a fit and proper owner of steel companies in the UK."" MPs also questioned the suitability of a small audit firm like King & King to handle GFG's accounts. The report said it was ""utterly unconvincing"" that King & King had the ""capacity, expertise, or resources to audit the accounts of multiple large GFG Alliance and Liberty Steel UK companies representing over Â£2.5bn of revenue"". A spokesperson for GFG said the company ""takes note of the findings of the select committee. We will review and reflect upon its conclusions"". However, since the committee took evidence GFG had embarked a restructuring and refinancing that included injecting Â£50m to restart the Rotherham and Stockbridge operations, the statement said. In addition, GFG said the company had drawn up a strategy to help decarbonise the steel industry. However, the spokesperson said GFG was ""disappointed that the report fails to recognise the significant role Sanjeev Gupta and Liberty Steel has played in saving and safeguarding thousands of UK jobs which otherwise would have been lost"". ""Mr Gupta has consistently met his obligations as a director of a private company, and... has led GFG's global restructuring since Greensill's collapse."" The statement added: ""Since 2019 the group has been on a journey to improve governance and transparency."" The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said it was already taking action to ensure better corporate governance. A spokesperson said: ""The government has published plans to require higher standards of transparency and oversight in UK business, which will strengthen further the UK's system of audit and corporate governance. ""The Insolvency Service has the powers to investigate the conduct of directors where the company has gone through a formal insolvency process. Where there is evidence of misconduct and it is in the public interest, the Insolvency Service can formally launch disqualification proceedings."" And on the wider issue of support for the steel industry, the spokesperson added: ""We are determined to secure a competitive future for the UK steel industry and in recent years have provided it with extensive support, including more than Â£600m to help with the costs of energy and to protect jobs. ""We recognise the critical role the steel industry plays in all areas of the UK and in our economy and will carefully consider the report's recommendations.""

"The M&S Christmas advert features its Percy Pig character Customers are Christmas shopping early, retailer Marks & Spencer has said, with nearly half expecting to have finished buying gifts by the end of November. Rival John Lewis said that many people were planning big family get-togethers after lockdowns last Christmas. Retail expert Steve Dresser said people were ""spooked about shortages of stock"" and were budgeting in tough times. In October, shop footfall was higher than in September, British Retail Consortium (BRC) data suggested. Marks & Spencer said that many customers were shopping early and planning ahead, while nearly 40% were planning to do more to celebrate Christmas than prior to Covid. More than two thirds (68%) were planning to have a big family Christmas, the retailer added. A spokeswoman for John Lewis Group, which includes Waitrose, said customers were ""making plans and getting ready earlier than normal"". She said that ""after last year"" customers were ""keen to enjoy the festivities as much as possible this year"". Last Christmasthere were lockdown restrictions on gatherings, with people in London and Southeast England - the country's most populous region - only allowed to celebrate with their household and support bubbles. Both M&S and John Lewis have launched their Christmas adverts slightly earlier than last year to try to entice people to buy from them. The John Lewis Christmas advert, like the M&S one, was launched slightly earlier this year Steve Dresser, managing director of Grocery Insight, said that people were buying early due to uncertainty. This included being ""spooked"" by shortages of stock. He said household finances were being squeezed by inflation including higher fuel and energy prices, and ""shopping early is one way to spread the cost of Christmas"". Mr Dresser said that there was uncertainty as to whether coronavirus restrictions, which last year closed non-essential retail in London and the South East at short notice, would be brought back again. He added there was a chance that stock ""that lands very late in the season"" could mean ""that large mark-downs will have to be applied, almost reducing it as it goes on the shelf"", which would be ""bad news"" for retailers. Consumer confidence took a turn for the worse in October, according to research firm GfK. People were concerned about the future of the UK economy ""against a backdrop of cheerless domestic news"" including ""fuel and food shortages"" and ""surging inflation squeezing household budgets"", Joe Staton, client strategy director GfK,said,external. Retailers have ""brought forward Christmas range launches to help smooth out supply chain bumps ahead of the peak trading period"", said Sensormatic Solutions retail consultant Andy Sumpter. Stores have been dealing with supply chain disruption that has been causingshortages of products from cars to turkeys. People have been going to shops more compared with September, in part to do early Christmas shopping, Mr Sumpter said. Shipping boss: 'Christmas will be safe' from shortages Shortage problem: What's the UK running low on and why? In October, footfall in shops was up 3.2% compared with the previous month, and UK footfall was ahead of Spain, Germany, Italy and France, according to BRC data. But despite that October rise, footfall in shops is still substantially lower than pre-pandemic levels. Footfall was down much less in north-west England, which saw an 8.7% fall, compared with London, where footfall was down 21.4% compared with 2019. In total, across the UK, footfall in shops in October was down 13.7% compared with two years ago. This drop has been somewhat balanced out by the rise in online shopping, although online buying has declined since a peak in the Covid pandemic, a BRC spokeswoman said. In central London retailers have forecast that festive spending will hit Â£1.2bn, which is a third up on last year, but still half of 2019's pre-pandemic levels. Crucially, though, trading rates are down by more than half, and ""West End retailers are facing a challenging festive period due to the continued absence of high spending international travellers"", the New West End Company said. The company, which represents 600 retail, restaurant, hotel and property owners in Bond Street, Oxford Street, Regent Street and Mayfair, called for the government to bring back tax-free shopping for non-EU visitors, which was scrapped after the Brexit transition period ended on 31 December 2020. Since those tax-free sales were ended, places such as Paris and Milan ""have benefited from a 20% price advantage over the UK - a situation the West End desperately wants re-examined - pushing the UK further down the travel wish-list of festive holidaymakers, particularly high spenders from non-EU countries"", the company said.

"Headingley held the third Test between England and India this summer Yorkshire have been suspended from hosting England matches as the England and Wales Cricket Board delivered a devastating rebuke over the club's response to racism experienced by former player Azeem Rafiq. An investigation found Rafiq was a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" - but the club said it would take no disciplinary action. The ECB board says the ban will last until the club has ""clearly demonstrated that it can meet the standards expected"". Meanwhile, a number of members of the Yorkshire board are set to announce their resignations on Friday before an emergency board meeting, BBC Sport understands. The board is under pressure after criticism from the ECB, sponsors and the UK government over its handling of the Rafiq case. The ECB said it was ""clear"" Yorkshire's handling of the issue was ""wholly unacceptable and is causing serious damage to the reputation of the game"". A statement said: ""Given recent events, it is clear there are serious questions regarding the governance and management of YCCC. ""The club's failure in relation to actions and responses to their own report represent a significant breach of its obligations to the game."" Yorkshire cricket racism scandal - how we got here Yorkshire board calls meeting to discuss racism allegations 'Racist language isn't friendly banter,' say British-Pakistanis The fallout from Yorkshire's response to the racism report intensified on Monday when ESPN Cricinfo reported a racist term about Rafiq's Pakistani heritage was regularly used towards him, but the investigation concluded it was ""friendly and good-natured banter"". Yorkshire's Gary Ballance, who hasadmitted using racist language towards ex-team-mate Rafiq, has been suspended indefinitely from England selection. On Thursday evening, former England captain Michael Vaughanrevealed he was named in the reportbut denied any allegation of racism. Julian Knight MP, who called for the Yorkshire board to resign this week and is chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, said he hoped the sanctions handed down by the ECB would ""act as a short, sharp shock to bring the club to its senses"". ""Like the rest of us, I imagine the members of Yorkshire County Cricket Club will be questioning why the board is still in place,"" he added. He said it would have been ""completely unacceptable"" were Ballance still eligible for England. Headingley is due to host a men's Test against New Zealand and a men's one-day international against South Africa in 2022. The Leeds ground is also scheduled to host an Ashes Test against Australia in 2023. Kit suppliers Nike and several sponsors have cut ties with the club. The ECB board has also asked the ECB executive to commission a review, looking into whether of Yorkshire's leadership is fit for purpose. A full ECB investigation into the matter remains ongoing. Financial and further match allocation punishments could be given at the end of the ECB's investigation. Following Thursday's statement, Rafiq, 30, said: ""I need a little time to reflect on what the ECB has said this evening and the actions they're proposing to take. ""I will not be commenting further at this time."" A former England youth captain, Azeem Rafiq played for Yorkshire across two spells and captained the county in a Twenty20 fixture in 2012 Yorkshire's investigations began in September 2020 after Rafiq, who played for Yorkshire between 2008 and 2018, claimed ""institutional racism"" at the club left him close to taking his own life. After more than a year - and having been asked to do so by MPs - Yorkshire released the findings of an independent report in September which upheld seven of the 43 allegations made by Rafiq. But the club said no players, coaches or executives would face disciplinary action following the club's own investigation into the report's findings. That move - and subsequent claim that the report judged the use of a racist term as ""banter - has now led senior politicians, including health secretary Sajid Javid, to criticise the club. Senior Yorkshire officials have been called to attend a DCMS select committee hearing on 16 November, where Rafiq will also give evidence. Ballance, who has not played for England since 2017, said on Wednesday he ""regrets"" using the offensive terms. 2 September 2020:Following aninitial interview with Wisden,external,ESPN Cricinfo publish an article with Rafiq,externalin which he claims ""institutional racism"" at Yorkshire County Cricket Club left him close to taking his own life. 3 September 2020:Yorkshire saythey have launched a ""formal investigation"" into the claims made by Rafiq and chairman Roger Hutton says the club would be carrying out a ""wider review"" of their ""policies and culture"" 5 September 2020:Yorkshire ask an independent law firmto investigate racism allegations against the club by Rafiq. 13 November 2020:Rafiq sayshe hopes to bring about ""meaningful change"" after giving his first statement to the inquiry. 15 December 2020:Rafiq files a legal claimagainst Yorkshire ""claiming direct discrimination and harassment on the grounds of race, as well as victimisation and detriment as a result of trying to address racism at the club"". 2 February 2021:Yorkshire threaten a lifetime banfor anyone found to have made threats against Rafiq or his family and legal team, after ESPN Cricinfo show them messages sent to Rafiq's legal firm. 17 June 2021:An employment tribunal case between Rafiq and his former club Yorkshirefails to find a resolution.The independent investigation into his racism allegations remains ongoing. 16 August 2021:Yorkshire receive the findingsof an independent investigation into the racism allegations and, two days later, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB)asks for a copy. 19 August 2021:Yorkshire, yet to release the findings of the report at this stage,admitRafiq was ""the victim of inappropriate behaviour"" and offer him their ""profound apologies"". Rafiq accuses Yorkshire of downplaying racismby calling him the victim of ""inappropriate behaviour"". 8 September 2021:MPs tell Yorkshireto publish the findingsof the report ""immediately"". 10 September 2021:Yorkshire release the findings of the report,which says Rafiq was the ""victim of racial harassment and bullying"" and seven of the 43 allegations made by the player were upheld by an independent panel. According to Hutton, the report said there was ""insufficient evidence to conclude that Yorkshire County Cricket Club is institutionally racist"". Yorkshire released a summary of the panel's report and recommendations, but said the full report could not be released for legal reasons ""in relation to privacy law and defamation"". 8 October 2021:Yorkshire miss a deadlineto send the full report to Rafiq and his legal team after BBC Sport understands an employment judge ordered the club to release it in full by Friday, 8 October. 13 October 2021:Rafiq then receives a heavily redacted version,while the ECB says it is still awaiting the full report. 28 October 2021:Yorkshire says it carried out its own internal investigation after the findings in the reportand concludedthat ""there is no conduct or action taken by any of its employees, players or executives that warrants disciplinary action"". 2 November 2021:The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee calls on Hutton to appear before it to answer questions about Yorkshire's handling of a report into Rafiq's allegations of racism. MP Knight, chair of the DCMS select committee,calls on the board of Yorkshire County Cricket Club to resignafter a leaked report emerges apparently containing details of the investigation into the treatment of Rafiq. A story published by ESPN says the report had concluded that a racially offensive term used towards Rafiq was regarded as ""banter"". Knight makes his comments after health secretary Javid calls for ""heads to roll"" at Yorkshire and said if the ECB did not take action ""it's not fit for purpose"". He further states in a Twitter post that the term allegedly used to describe Rafiq was ""not banter"". The ECB announces it will conduct a ""full"" investigation into the situation. 3 November 2021:The date of the DCMS hearing is scheduled for 16 November andRafiq is called to give evidence in person,along with senior Yorkshire officials. Several sponsors, including primary sponsor Emerald Publishing and Yorkshire Tea,end their partnershipswith Yorkshire County Cricket Club. Ballance releases a lengthy statement expressing regret for using a racial slur against former Yorkshire team-mate Rafiq. 4 November 2021:The ECB board suspends Yorkshire from hosting international matches.

"On day six of the climate summit, the focus turned to youth and public engagement Climate activists Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate spoke to protesters, after marching through the streets of Glasgow Thunberg described COP26 as a ""failure"" and a ""PR exercise"", full of more ""blah blah blah"", while Nakate urged young people to ""hold leaders to account"" We were joined for Friday's live coverage by special guests, BBC Young Reporters Maisie, Nel and Donald They helped us hear directly from young people affected by climate change around the world, as well as youth activists and campaigners COP26's overall goal is to keep the world on track for 1.5C of warming, which scientists say will help us avoid the worst impacts Edited by Hamish Mackay and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman It's been another busy day in Glasgow, with the sixth day of COP26 coming to a close. Here's a recap of what happened today:  We're pausing our live coverage now, but we'll be back tomorrow morning. Until then...  Saturday's COP26 theme will be nature - underlying the importance of the natural world and sustainable land use. As the first week of the conference comes to an end, millions of people around the world are expected to take part in a Global Day of Action for Climate Justice. About 200 demonstrations are expected around the world - including another march in Glasgow and another event in London leaving from the Bank of England and onto a rally in Trafalgar Square. In Glasgow, climate actvist Greta Thunberg is also expected to give another speech. Read more:Who is Greta Thunberg and what are her aims? David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News Maybe itâs because the conference crowds have thinned and
the security queues are shorter but the mood does seem a fraction brighter at
the end of this first week. Perhaps the flurry of promises on everything frommethanetocoalandforeststofinanceshows momentum is possible. Or itâs India, a giant of the developing world thatâs long
resisted climate targets, signalling that itâscoming on board. But itâs wise to be cautious. Promises are not the same as
delivery. And US envoy John Kerry is emphatic that weâre still at the stage of
âjob not doneâ. The pledges made so far should lead to a less scary rise in
the projected temperature. But that depends on them being implemented - and given the
low levels of trust, will everyone do what they say they will? Thereâs another week of hard negotiating to go.

Former US vice president Al Gore has just finished giving a speech at the global legislators summit at the Scottish parliament. He told delegates the world is at a ""long-awaited political tipping point"" in the fight against climate change. Gore, who served two terms as vice president under Bill Clinton, said ""impressive"" pledges for action have been made in Glasgow. But he warned the climate crisis is getting worse ""faster than we are yet implementing solutions"", insisting that more political will is needed to tackle the problem. He added it is crucial more countries and organisations are held to account on net-zero pledges. With increasingly strong voices demanding governments do more, the job of legislators is to ""translate the popular will into effective solutions for the climate crisis"", he said. We must put the period of delay and distraction and expedience in the past, recognise that we have entered a period of consequences and make it a period of solutions.""  Reality Check While politicians at COP26 discuss saving the planet, many cities around the world
have been suffering particularly badly from air pollution in the last few
days. India's capital, Delhi, has
seen peak pollution levels following the festival of Diwali, during which
the use of millions of fireworksfills the air with harmful particles. In addition to the fireworks,
the industrial use of coal and the burning of crop stubble across the region
has contributed to extreme concentrations of small and harmful particles known as PM2.5. Smog envelopes a highway in the Delhi area Delhi, as well as the Chinese capital, Beijing, currently top the rankings for the cities with the worst air quality, according to the IQAir index,which monitors air pollution in real time.,external In Beijing. PM2.5 levels are 17 times higher than WHO guidelines, and the elderly, children and the sick are being advised to stay inside. Beijingâs air pollution is mainly caused by the burning of coal to produce electricity. As the worldâs biggest consumer and producer of coal, the country is heavily reliant on it, although President Xi Jinping has promised to âphase downâ coal use from 2026. Another country facing serious air pollution is Kyrgyzstan, whose capital Bishkek is sometimes enveloped in hazardous smog in winter. Officials have blamed pollution in the capital on the use of coal by nearby power plants. At the COP26 summit, Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov pledged to achieve a âcarbon-free green development platformâ by 2050, moving away from coal to hydropower. Earlier, we heard from Ineza Umuhoza Grace, a Rwandan advocate who has been at COP26 this week. She told BBC Young Reporters Maisie and Nel about how she decided to fight for communities affected by climate change in her country. This is her message to other young people: Donât be afraid to show your colours in terms of achieving climate justice because everyone, everywhere has a voice - and everyone, everywhere has an ability to believe in change.  We should be messengers to our elders, and tell them that we all have one planet... we are all interconnected. We can only survive if we work together.  Young people can make our leaders accountable.  We've also heard Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate address the thousands of climate
protestors gathered in Glasgowâs George Square. The
24-year-old from Kampala, inspired by Greta Thunberg, began her own strike in
January 2019 in front of the Ugandan parliament building. She says her country is witnessing the impacts of the climate crisis first hand. ""People
are dying, children are dropping out of school, peopleâs farms are being
destroyed,"" she says. ""We are in a crisis, we are in a disaster that is
happening every day."" Africa is suffering the worst impacts of climate change, Vanessa says, even though historically the continent is only responsible for 3% of global emissions. She ends on an upbeat note with a vision of what the future could be like - ""the farms can blossom again...the pain and suffering is gone,"" - but urges the crowd to ""continue to hold leaders to account"". ""We don't need any more empty promises,"" the teenage campaigner says to cheers from the crowd. Greta says they do not want ""commitments that are full of loopholes"" and ones that ""ignore historical emissions and climate justice"". ""And that's all we are getting."" Leaders ""cannot ignore the scientific consensus"" the people, or their own children, she says. ""We are tired of their blah, blah, blah. Our leaders are not leading."" Before concluding her speech, Greta thanks everyone for attending the march, and says she hopes to see them at tomorrow's march too. They have had 26 COPs, they have had decades of blah, blah, blah - and where has that got us?  ""The leaders are doing nothing,"" Greta tells the crowd. ""It seems like their main goal is to continue to fight for the status quo."" She goes on to say COP26 has been named ""the most exclusionary COP ever"". She calls it a ""global greenwash festival"", a ""failure"" and a ""PR exercise"". ""A two-week long celebration of business as usual and blah, blah, blah,"" she says, repeating a phrase heard in a previous speech. She says the people in the most affected areas ""still remain unheard"". It's now time for the speaker the crowd have been waiting for - as campaigner Greta Thunberg takes to the stage in Glasgow. The Swedish teenager begins by saying COP26 ""is a failure"". ""We cannot solve a crisis with the same methods that got us into this in the first place,"" she says. ""What will it take for the people in power to wake up?"" The protest in Glasgow has been hearing from activists from around the world The city's George Square is packed with climate activists Activists of all ages are at the protest Penty of handmade placards can be spotted in the crowd Some protesters were dressed in masks of world leaders Thousands of people are in the crowd Paul O'HareBBC Scotland News The moment many in this large crowd in George Square have
been waiting for is not far away now...it's almost time for Greta Thunberg to
address this Fridays for Future rally. Before it got under way it was clear the 18-year-old Swedish climate campaigner was the star attraction. In
a bid to warm up the Glasgow crowd, the MC shouted: âWhat do we want?â They
replied: âGreta!â The MC joked: âYou're supposed to say 'climate justice'.â Greta Thunberg (blue hat) waits in a group near the main stage in George Square Nel RichardsBBC Young Reporter Speaking with activist Ineza Umuhoza Grace was a pleasure. The true facts and impacts of climate change on her family in Rwanda were very clear and she taught me that we need to fight this crisis together. Her courage was inspirational and she is a true advocate for young people. I asked her: If you ever feel disheartened by the challenge ahead, what are your tips for staying positive and motivated? âI like to challenge my personality first, Iâm the type of person that doesnât like to give up, I like to focus on what I can do.  Iâm too positive for negativity but sometimes I need to be realistic and not to be scared to share my voice.  Ineza is an inspirational campaigner but a bad selfie taker... Ineza Umuhoza Grace, 25, is a environmental advocate from Rwanda who has been at COP26 events this week campaigning for greater financial
support for communities already experiencing damage because of climate change. She's been speaking to BBC Young Reporters Maisie Goodwin and Nel Richards in between a packed schedule at the conference centre. They started by asking what affects of climate change she had personally experienced: I was exposed to climate change from a very young age - five or six - because I have the memory of floods in my house and my bedroom was like a lake.  When I finished my secondary school classes, I wanted to study to become a pilot or a mechanical engineer because I was good in science. Then when I watched the news, I had the information that in one particular area in my country, a rural area, women and children were being forced to move because of erosion and flooding. When I saw the news, it reminded me of how hopeless I felt. Then I wanted to study environmental engineering because I wanted to learn how to contribute to my community.  In 2020 our country lost 4,000 hectares of crops, due to flooding and intense rainfall. This especially affects women and children - when they are forced to move their crop fields this is very problematic. We also see a lot of damage to schools and homes.â  Next up, Mail and Nel asked her about how she stays motivated and positive. While COP26 is focsued on how governments can avoid the worst impacts of climate change, there are many ways in which we as individuals can do our bit for the planet. One of the ways we can reduce our carbon footprint is through what we eat. Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, according to a major report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),which says the West's high consumption of meat and dairy is fuelling global warming. If youâre eating beef three to five times a week, over an entire year your consumption is contributing 1,611kg to your annual greenhouse gas emissions. That's the equivalent of driving a regular petrol car 4,112 miles (6,618km), or taking five return flights from London to Malaga. Hello â itâs Nel Richards and Maisie Goodwin here, two of the BBCâs Young Reporters. Weâve been speaking to James Miller, who is attending COP26 today as a delegate with Unicef. âYoung people have contributed least to the climate crisis but they are the ones who will be most impacted by it,â he tells us. âMore than half of the world's children are at extreme risk of climate related impacts - that's over a billion children.â The 19-year-old is calling for young peopleâs voices to be represented more in negotiations. He says he is pleased to see so many young people at COP today but they should be handed more power. âThere are a very few young people that are in those decision making roles, there are a few delegates representing countries who are under the UNâs definition of âyoungâ.â Helen BriggsBBC Environment Correspondent in Glasgow Inside COP's inner Blue Zone, face masks are everywhere. Most wear regular white ones, but brightly-coloured masks
are popping up around the conference centre - in shades of yellow, orange and
green. Why? Theyâre being worn to highlight that gender justice and
human rights are central to climate action. ""We demand nothing less,"" says Mara Dolan, a member of the
Women & Gender Constituency, a network of feminist activists at COP. Another member, Gina Cortes, says there are ""deep inequities
and deep injustices"" at this COP, with some observers, especially from the
global south, missing from the conference due to travel restrictions Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check This video can not be played What is Climate Justice? With many of today's protesters in Glasgow calling for ""climate justice"", what exactly does the term mean? Many of the countries worst affected by climate change have contributed least to the emissions that cause it. So where should the burden lie in taking action to counter it? Check out this video as Reality Check's Chris Morris examines some of the big questions. Activists from across the world are taking to the stage in George Square, Glasgow, to address the thousands of climate protesters that have gathered there.

"On day six of the climate summit, the focus turned to youth and public engagement Climate activists Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate spoke to protesters, after marching through the streets of Glasgow Thunberg described COP26 as a ""failure"" and a ""PR exercise"", full of more ""blah blah blah"", while Nakate urged young people to ""hold leaders to account"" We were joined for Friday's live coverage by special guests, BBC Young Reporters Maisie, Nel and Donald They helped us hear directly from young people affected by climate change around the world, as well as youth activists and campaigners COP26's overall goal is to keep the world on track for 1.5C of warming, which scientists say will help us avoid the worst impacts Edited by Hamish Mackay and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman It's been another busy day in Glasgow, with the sixth day of COP26 coming to a close. Here's a recap of what happened today:  We're pausing our live coverage now, but we'll be back tomorrow morning. Until then...  Saturday's COP26 theme will be nature - underlying the importance of the natural world and sustainable land use. As the first week of the conference comes to an end, millions of people around the world are expected to take part in a Global Day of Action for Climate Justice. About 200 demonstrations are expected around the world - including another march in Glasgow and another event in London leaving from the Bank of England and onto a rally in Trafalgar Square. In Glasgow, climate actvist Greta Thunberg is also expected to give another speech. Read more:Who is Greta Thunberg and what are her aims? David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News Maybe itâs because the conference crowds have thinned and
the security queues are shorter but the mood does seem a fraction brighter at
the end of this first week. Perhaps the flurry of promises on everything frommethanetocoalandforeststofinanceshows momentum is possible. Or itâs India, a giant of the developing world thatâs long
resisted climate targets, signalling that itâscoming on board. But itâs wise to be cautious. Promises are not the same as
delivery. And US envoy John Kerry is emphatic that weâre still at the stage of
âjob not doneâ. The pledges made so far should lead to a less scary rise in
the projected temperature. But that depends on them being implemented - and given the
low levels of trust, will everyone do what they say they will? Thereâs another week of hard negotiating to go.

Former US vice president Al Gore has just finished giving a speech at the global legislators summit at the Scottish parliament. He told delegates the world is at a ""long-awaited political tipping point"" in the fight against climate change. Gore, who served two terms as vice president under Bill Clinton, said ""impressive"" pledges for action have been made in Glasgow. But he warned the climate crisis is getting worse ""faster than we are yet implementing solutions"", insisting that more political will is needed to tackle the problem. He added it is crucial more countries and organisations are held to account on net-zero pledges. With increasingly strong voices demanding governments do more, the job of legislators is to ""translate the popular will into effective solutions for the climate crisis"", he said. We must put the period of delay and distraction and expedience in the past, recognise that we have entered a period of consequences and make it a period of solutions.""  Reality Check While politicians at COP26 discuss saving the planet, many cities around the world
have been suffering particularly badly from air pollution in the last few
days. India's capital, Delhi, has
seen peak pollution levels following the festival of Diwali, during which
the use of millions of fireworksfills the air with harmful particles. In addition to the fireworks,
the industrial use of coal and the burning of crop stubble across the region
has contributed to extreme concentrations of small and harmful particles known as PM2.5. Smog envelopes a highway in the Delhi area Delhi, as well as the Chinese capital, Beijing, currently top the rankings for the cities with the worst air quality, according to the IQAir index,which monitors air pollution in real time.,external In Beijing. PM2.5 levels are 17 times higher than WHO guidelines, and the elderly, children and the sick are being advised to stay inside. Beijingâs air pollution is mainly caused by the burning of coal to produce electricity. As the worldâs biggest consumer and producer of coal, the country is heavily reliant on it, although President Xi Jinping has promised to âphase downâ coal use from 2026. Another country facing serious air pollution is Kyrgyzstan, whose capital Bishkek is sometimes enveloped in hazardous smog in winter. Officials have blamed pollution in the capital on the use of coal by nearby power plants. At the COP26 summit, Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov pledged to achieve a âcarbon-free green development platformâ by 2050, moving away from coal to hydropower. Earlier, we heard from Ineza Umuhoza Grace, a Rwandan advocate who has been at COP26 this week. She told BBC Young Reporters Maisie and Nel about how she decided to fight for communities affected by climate change in her country. This is her message to other young people: Donât be afraid to show your colours in terms of achieving climate justice because everyone, everywhere has a voice - and everyone, everywhere has an ability to believe in change.  We should be messengers to our elders, and tell them that we all have one planet... we are all interconnected. We can only survive if we work together.  Young people can make our leaders accountable.  We've also heard Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate address the thousands of climate
protestors gathered in Glasgowâs George Square. The
24-year-old from Kampala, inspired by Greta Thunberg, began her own strike in
January 2019 in front of the Ugandan parliament building. She says her country is witnessing the impacts of the climate crisis first hand. ""People
are dying, children are dropping out of school, peopleâs farms are being
destroyed,"" she says. ""We are in a crisis, we are in a disaster that is
happening every day."" Africa is suffering the worst impacts of climate change, Vanessa says, even though historically the continent is only responsible for 3% of global emissions. She ends on an upbeat note with a vision of what the future could be like - ""the farms can blossom again...the pain and suffering is gone,"" - but urges the crowd to ""continue to hold leaders to account"". ""We don't need any more empty promises,"" the teenage campaigner says to cheers from the crowd. Greta says they do not want ""commitments that are full of loopholes"" and ones that ""ignore historical emissions and climate justice"". ""And that's all we are getting."" Leaders ""cannot ignore the scientific consensus"" the people, or their own children, she says. ""We are tired of their blah, blah, blah. Our leaders are not leading."" Before concluding her speech, Greta thanks everyone for attending the march, and says she hopes to see them at tomorrow's march too. They have had 26 COPs, they have had decades of blah, blah, blah - and where has that got us?  ""The leaders are doing nothing,"" Greta tells the crowd. ""It seems like their main goal is to continue to fight for the status quo."" She goes on to say COP26 has been named ""the most exclusionary COP ever"". She calls it a ""global greenwash festival"", a ""failure"" and a ""PR exercise"". ""A two-week long celebration of business as usual and blah, blah, blah,"" she says, repeating a phrase heard in a previous speech. She says the people in the most affected areas ""still remain unheard"". It's now time for the speaker the crowd have been waiting for - as campaigner Greta Thunberg takes to the stage in Glasgow. The Swedish teenager begins by saying COP26 ""is a failure"". ""We cannot solve a crisis with the same methods that got us into this in the first place,"" she says. ""What will it take for the people in power to wake up?"" The protest in Glasgow has been hearing from activists from around the world The city's George Square is packed with climate activists Activists of all ages are at the protest Penty of handmade placards can be spotted in the crowd Some protesters were dressed in masks of world leaders Thousands of people are in the crowd Paul O'HareBBC Scotland News The moment many in this large crowd in George Square have

"Former minister Owen Paterson has resigned as an MP after a backlash at the government's decision to block his suspension from parliament. Mr Paterson is the Conservative MP for North Shropshire. He served as Northern Ireland secretary and environment secretary under David Cameron. Since leaving government he has been a paid consultant for Randox Laboratories and Lynn's Country Foods. He is paid Â£8,333 a month by Randox for 16 hours work and Â£2,000 every other month from Lynn's Country Foods for four hours work. This is not against the rules, and he declared his positions in the public register of interests. Paterson quits as MP over lobbying row 'nightmare' In full: Owen Paterson resignation statement He was investigated by the Commissioner for Parliamentary Standards after being accused of breaking lobbying rules for MPs. The commissioner found that, on behalf of the companies, he approached and met officials at the Food Standards Agency and ministers at the Department for International Development a number of times. He also used his parliamentary office and stationery for his consultancy work and failed to declare his interests in some meetings, the report said. The commissioner decided that the contact with officials and ministers were ""serious breaches"" of the rules. MPs are forbidden from taking money to raise issues in the House of Commons or with the government. The code of conduct politicians have to follow says there must be not conflicts of interest between their personal interests and public interest. Mr Paterson works for Randox Laboratories as a consultant MPs who are found to have broken the rules may be asked to apologise to the House of Commons or be suspended as an MP. The Standards Committee called Mr Paterson's actions""an egregious case of paid advocacy"",externaland recommended at 30-day suspension. Made three approaches to Food Standards Agency for Randox about antibiotics in milk in 2016 and 2017 The committee found his first approach had been acceptable but subsequent contact sought a benefit for Randox and promoted its products and technology Made seven approaches to Food Standards Agency for Lynn's Country Foods in 2017 and 2018. Mr Paterson says the contact was acceptable because he was raising ""serious wrongs"" with officials. The commissioner rejected his position Made four approaches to ministers at the Department for International Development about Randox and blood testing technology in 2016 and 2017 The committee says that while the company did not gain government contracts from these meetings, it could have done Mr Paterson has criticised the decision and the way the investigation was carried out. He said his approaches to officials and ministers amounted to whistle-blowing. For instance, Randox's contact with the FSA was to warn them of illegal antibiotics that had been found in milk that was available in supermarkets. There is an exemption in lobbying rules for MPs who are alerting the government to ""a serious wrong or substantial injustice"", even if doing so would lead to ""incidental"" financial or material benefit for the MP. Mr Paterson has said he ""would not hesitate to act in the same way again if confronted with new information about serious harms or wrongs requiring urgent remedy"". This video can not be played MPs vote created ""a certain amount of controversy"", says Jacob Rees-Mogg The commissioner said only one of his approaches to officials qualified for the whistle-blowing exemption. He has argued that the investigation constituted an ""absolute denial of justice"" for a number of reasons, including his claim that several witnesses who had come forward in support of his case had been ignored. Mr Paterson accepted that he had broken the rules regarding stationary and apologised. Lobbying is when an individual or a group tries to persuade a public figure such as an MP, a minister or a government official to support a policy or campaign. It's a normal part of the democratic process and anybody can do it by signing a petition or writing to their MP, for example. MPs are expected to lobby on behalf of their constituents - they might try to persuade the government to build a new hospital in their constituency, for example. But because lobbying by MPs is likely to be more effective than lobbying by the general public there are rules to make sure they do not take advantage of their position for reasons other than the best interests of the people who elected them. They must declare any jobs they have or that a member of their family has that could influence their opinions. Boris Johnson questioned whether Mr Paterson had been given a ""fair opportunity"" to make his case And they are not allowed to take money for raising issues in the House of Commons or with ministers. Apart from Mr Paterson, more than 20 MPs get paid for consultancy work, including former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, who is paid Â£182,600 per year for 32.5 days work. Sir Ed Davey works as a consultant alongside his job as leader of the Liberal Democrats. He provides political and policy expertise to Herbert Smith Freehills, for six hours a month at Â£5,000. Other MPs have second jobs as doctors, nurses, barristers and even a football referee. Douglas Ross worked as a linesman and referee but gave it up when he became leader of the Scottish Conservative Party On Thursday afternoon Mr Paterson announced that he would be resigning as an MP, saying the last few days had been ""intolerable"". He criticised the investigative process, which doesn't allow MPs to bring appeals against judgements. Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said there was a ""very strong feeling on both sides of the House that there is a need for an appeals process"" and that he would work with other parties to make ""improvements"" to the system. There will be a by-election in Mr Paterson's constituency of Shropshire North, which the Conservative Party has held since its creation.

"Headingley held the third Test between England and India this summer Yorkshire have been suspended from hosting England matches as the England and Wales Cricket Board delivered a devastating rebuke over the club's response to racism experienced by former player Azeem Rafiq. An investigation found Rafiq was a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" - but the club said it would take no disciplinary action. The ECB board says the ban will last until the club has ""clearly demonstrated that it can meet the standards expected"". Meanwhile, a number of members of the Yorkshire board are set to announce their resignations on Friday before an emergency board meeting, BBC Sport understands. The board is under pressure after criticism from the ECB, sponsors and the UK government over its handling of the Rafiq case. The ECB said it was ""clear"" Yorkshire's handling of the issue was ""wholly unacceptable and is causing serious damage to the reputation of the game"". A statement said: ""Given recent events, it is clear there are serious questions regarding the governance and management of YCCC. ""The club's failure in relation to actions and responses to their own report represent a significant breach of its obligations to the game."" Yorkshire cricket racism scandal - how we got here Yorkshire board calls meeting to discuss racism allegations 'Racist language isn't friendly banter,' say British-Pakistanis The fallout from Yorkshire's response to the racism report intensified on Monday when ESPN Cricinfo reported a racist term about Rafiq's Pakistani heritage was regularly used towards him, but the investigation concluded it was ""friendly and good-natured banter"". Yorkshire's Gary Ballance, who hasadmitted using racist language towards ex-team-mate Rafiq, has been suspended indefinitely from England selection. On Thursday evening, former England captain Michael Vaughanrevealed he was named in the reportbut denied any allegation of racism. Julian Knight MP, who called for the Yorkshire board to resign this week and is chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, said he hoped the sanctions handed down by the ECB would ""act as a short, sharp shock to bring the club to its senses"". ""Like the rest of us, I imagine the members of Yorkshire County Cricket Club will be questioning why the board is still in place,"" he added. He said it would have been ""completely unacceptable"" were Ballance still eligible for England. Headingley is due to host a men's Test against New Zealand and a men's one-day international against South Africa in 2022. The Leeds ground is also scheduled to host an Ashes Test against Australia in 2023. Kit suppliers Nike and several sponsors have cut ties with the club. The ECB board has also asked the ECB executive to commission a review, looking into whether of Yorkshire's leadership is fit for purpose. A full ECB investigation into the matter remains ongoing. Financial and further match allocation punishments could be given at the end of the ECB's investigation. Following Thursday's statement, Rafiq, 30, said: ""I need a little time to reflect on what the ECB has said this evening and the actions they're proposing to take. ""I will not be commenting further at this time."" A former England youth captain, Azeem Rafiq played for Yorkshire across two spells and captained the county in a Twenty20 fixture in 2012 Yorkshire's investigations began in September 2020 after Rafiq, who played for Yorkshire between 2008 and 2018, claimed ""institutional racism"" at the club left him close to taking his own life. After more than a year - and having been asked to do so by MPs - Yorkshire released the findings of an independent report in September which upheld seven of the 43 allegations made by Rafiq. But the club said no players, coaches or executives would face disciplinary action following the club's own investigation into the report's findings. That move - and subsequent claim that the report judged the use of a racist term as ""banter - has now led senior politicians, including health secretary Sajid Javid, to criticise the club. Senior Yorkshire officials have been called to attend a DCMS select committee hearing on 16 November, where Rafiq will also give evidence. Ballance, who has not played for England since 2017, said on Wednesday he ""regrets"" using the offensive terms. 2 September 2020:Following aninitial interview with Wisden,external,ESPN Cricinfo publish an article with Rafiq,externalin which he claims ""institutional racism"" at Yorkshire County Cricket Club left him close to taking his own life. 3 September 2020:Yorkshire saythey have launched a ""formal investigation"" into the claims made by Rafiq and chairman Roger Hutton says the club would be carrying out a ""wider review"" of their ""policies and culture"" 5 September 2020:Yorkshire ask an independent law firmto investigate racism allegations against the club by Rafiq. 13 November 2020:Rafiq sayshe hopes to bring about ""meaningful change"" after giving his first statement to the inquiry. 15 December 2020:Rafiq files a legal claimagainst Yorkshire ""claiming direct discrimination and harassment on the grounds of race, as well as victimisation and detriment as a result of trying to address racism at the club"". 2 February 2021:Yorkshire threaten a lifetime banfor anyone found to have made threats against Rafiq or his family and legal team, after ESPN Cricinfo show them messages sent to Rafiq's legal firm. 17 June 2021:An employment tribunal case between Rafiq and his former club Yorkshirefails to find a resolution.The independent investigation into his racism allegations remains ongoing. 16 August 2021:Yorkshire receive the findingsof an independent investigation into the racism allegations and, two days later, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB)asks for a copy. 19 August 2021:Yorkshire, yet to release the findings of the report at this stage,admitRafiq was ""the victim of inappropriate behaviour"" and offer him their ""profound apologies"". Rafiq accuses Yorkshire of downplaying racismby calling him the victim of ""inappropriate behaviour"". 8 September 2021:MPs tell Yorkshireto publish the findingsof the report ""immediately"". 10 September 2021:Yorkshire release the findings of the report,which says Rafiq was the ""victim of racial harassment and bullying"" and seven of the 43 allegations made by the player were upheld by an independent panel. According to Hutton, the report said there was ""insufficient evidence to conclude that Yorkshire County Cricket Club is institutionally racist"". Yorkshire released a summary of the panel's report and recommendations, but said the full report could not be released for legal reasons ""in relation to privacy law and defamation"". 8 October 2021:Yorkshire miss a deadlineto send the full report to Rafiq and his legal team after BBC Sport understands an employment judge ordered the club to release it in full by Friday, 8 October. 13 October 2021:Rafiq then receives a heavily redacted version,while the ECB says it is still awaiting the full report. 28 October 2021:Yorkshire says it carried out its own internal investigation after the findings in the reportand concludedthat ""there is no conduct or action taken by any of its employees, players or executives that warrants disciplinary action"". 2 November 2021:The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee calls on Hutton to appear before it to answer questions about Yorkshire's handling of a report into Rafiq's allegations of racism.

"The M&S Christmas advert features its Percy Pig character Customers are Christmas shopping early, retailer Marks & Spencer has said, with nearly half expecting to have finished buying gifts by the end of November. Rival John Lewis said that many people were planning big family get-togethers after lockdowns last Christmas. Retail expert Steve Dresser said people were ""spooked about shortages of stock"" and were budgeting in tough times. In October, shop footfall was higher than in September, British Retail Consortium (BRC) data suggested. Marks & Spencer said that many customers were shopping early and planning ahead, while nearly 40% were planning to do more to celebrate Christmas than prior to Covid. More than two thirds (68%) were planning to have a big family Christmas, the retailer added. A spokeswoman for John Lewis Group, which includes Waitrose, said customers were ""making plans and getting ready earlier than normal"". She said that ""after last year"" customers were ""keen to enjoy the festivities as much as possible this year"". Last Christmasthere were lockdown restrictions on gatherings, with people in London and Southeast England - the country's most populous region - only allowed to celebrate with their household and support bubbles. Both M&S and John Lewis have launched their Christmas adverts slightly earlier than last year to try to entice people to buy from them. The John Lewis Christmas advert, like the M&S one, was launched slightly earlier this year Steve Dresser, managing director of Grocery Insight, said that people were buying early due to uncertainty. This included being ""spooked"" by shortages of stock. He said household finances were being squeezed by inflation including higher fuel and energy prices, and ""shopping early is one way to spread the cost of Christmas"". Mr Dresser said that there was uncertainty as to whether coronavirus restrictions, which last year closed non-essential retail in London and the South East at short notice, would be brought back again. He added there was a chance that stock ""that lands very late in the season"" could mean ""that large mark-downs will have to be applied, almost reducing it as it goes on the shelf"", which would be ""bad news"" for retailers. Consumer confidence took a turn for the worse in October, according to research firm GfK. People were concerned about the future of the UK economy ""against a backdrop of cheerless domestic news"" including ""fuel and food shortages"" and ""surging inflation squeezing household budgets"", Joe Staton, client strategy director GfK,said,external. Retailers have ""brought forward Christmas range launches to help smooth out supply chain bumps ahead of the peak trading period"", said Sensormatic Solutions retail consultant Andy Sumpter. Stores have been dealing with supply chain disruption that has been causingshortages of products from cars to turkeys. People have been going to shops more compared with September, in part to do early Christmas shopping, Mr Sumpter said. Shipping boss: 'Christmas will be safe' from shortages Shortage problem: What's the UK running low on and why? In October, footfall in shops was up 3.2% compared with the previous month, and UK footfall was ahead of Spain, Germany, Italy and France, according to BRC data. But despite that October rise, footfall in shops is still substantially lower than pre-pandemic levels. Footfall was down much less in north-west England, which saw an 8.7% fall, compared with London, where footfall was down 21.4% compared with 2019. In total, across the UK, footfall in shops in October was down 13.7% compared with two years ago. This drop has been somewhat balanced out by the rise in online shopping, although online buying has declined since a peak in the Covid pandemic, a BRC spokeswoman said. In central London retailers have forecast that festive spending will hit Â£1.2bn, which is a third up on last year, but still half of 2019's pre-pandemic levels. Crucially, though, trading rates are down by more than half, and ""West End retailers are facing a challenging festive period due to the continued absence of high spending international travellers"", the New West End Company said. The company, which represents 600 retail, restaurant, hotel and property owners in Bond Street, Oxford Street, Regent Street and Mayfair, called for the government to bring back tax-free shopping for non-EU visitors, which was scrapped after the Brexit transition period ended on 31 December 2020. Since those tax-free sales were ended, places such as Paris and Milan ""have benefited from a 20% price advantage over the UK - a situation the West End desperately wants re-examined - pushing the UK further down the travel wish-list of festive holidaymakers, particularly high spenders from non-EU countries"", the company said.

"This video can not be played Welfare Officer Taz Harrison is worried about staff and customers getting a ride home at night More than half of licensed mini-cab taxi drivers have not returned to the trade since the pandemic, an industry group has said. The Licensed Private Hire Car Association (LPHCA) estimates the industry is short of 160,000 of the previously 300,000-strong workforce. Many drivers left the industry during lockdowns as demand plummeted. The shortage has prompted concerns over the safety of women, students and night time workers struggling to get home. A backlog in costly licensing and registration of vehicles, as well as criminal and medical checks for drivers, have led to what the LPHCA have called ""a perfect storm"". A mini-cab driver must apply to their local council for a licence, which can cost up to Â£600 a year. Drivers must also obtain a criminal record check and a full medical check, as well as the famous ""Knowledge"" examination in some cases. ""This is a real national problem that affects everywhere,"" said Steve Wright, chairman of the LPHCA. ""We have had calls from Inverness in Scotland, right down to Cornwall, with people saying they cannot get drivers and they cannot get licences quickly enough,"" he told the BBC. Why is there an HGV driver shortage? Taxi-hailing firm reveals 4,158 sexual assaults It is leaving thousands of customers in the lurch. Taxis provide a vital service; taking people to hospital appointments, back from the shops and of course safely home after an evening out. Taz Harrison, Welfare Officer at The Sugarmill in Stoke-on-Trent, said she was worried about both staff and customers getting a ride. ""I am finishing at the club at 4am and waiting until 5am or 6am in the morning to get a taxi,"" she explained. ""It's a long time to be stood by yourself in town - pre-pandemic it was 5-10 minutes."" ""I've worked in venues for 20 years and I've never known it this bad."" The Sugarmill is emptying its doors of 600 music fans at the same time as multiple venues across Hanley do the same. ""The majority of people are giving up and walking,"" Ms Harrison added. Students at Staffordshire University are unsurprised by this. ""There's no taxis anywhere, or they're all dodgy,"" one student explained. ""You get in and they want the money before you go anywhere,"" she continued. The student's friend also shared their experience: ""A taxi driver let another guy get in a taxi with me when I finished work and he was flat out drunk - I was like, no!"" Another student explained she asked her Mum and Dad for a lift instead. The National Union of Students said some universities were partnering with taxi firms to create safer routes to students. However, the union urged the government to do more. ""This is a public safety issue, and it vital that we address it now so that we stop seeing students stranded in unknown areas,"" said Hillary Gyebi-Ababio, vice president for higher education. In the current climate, of heightened safety concerns, especially for women, news of this shortage is particularly worrying. A few hours wait or a walk home on a balmy summer's evening may seem less of a problem than on a cold, dark, winter's night. As long queues grow in many towns waiting for the only available taxis, tempers fray and those travelling alone become even more vulnerable. The taxi shortage is impacting every corner of the UK. Some rural pubs, are already reporting that customers are being put off coming out when they know they'll struggle to get home. In bigger cities the shortage has been masked for a while by app services like Uber, but now people are experiencing longer waits, cancelled trips, and sky-high surcharging as drivers have more work than they can cover at any time of the day. One council taking a proactive approach to tackle the shortage is Torbay in Devon, where they have slashed the cost of licensing to just Â£50 to get more drivers behind the wheel. ""We were seeing massive queues for cabs and the tourist trade was being affected, so we thought we'd better step in,"" explained councillor Christine Carter. ""In the summer, we had taxi marshals to help people, and we are going to do that again at Christmas to make it as safe as possible."" However Torbay's approach has only provided half of the drivers they need so far. ""All we can keep doing is keep saying, 'please, please apply',"" Councillor Carter added. The Night Time Industries Association said the issue raises concerns over transport infrastructure. The association's chief executive Michael Kill said he was alarmed by the driver shortage and called for it to be prioritised by the government and city leaders across the country. ""With a focus on vulnerability, and the safety of women at night, and thousands of night workers across the country, we cannot underestimate the vital role these services play in keeping people safe at night,"" Mr Kill added. A spokesperson from the Department for Transport responded: ""While provision of taxi licences is the responsibility of Local Authorities, we continue to work with industry groups to address concerns over potential shortages."" ""Throughout the pandemic we have supported private hire vehicle drivers through grants from the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme,"" the spokesperson added. The Department for Transport also plans to revise licensing guidelines, but consultations on this will not happen until next year. Why is there an HGV driver shortage?

"MPs have called for investigations into the owners of Liberty Steel and boss Sanjeev Gupta in a bid to avert another crisis in the industry. Auditors that signed off the accounts at Liberty's parent GFG Alliance should also face questions, MPs on the business committee say in a report. The committee highlights ""red flags"" and ""systemic risks"" that should have alerted authorities to the problems. The steel industry is too important to lurch from ""crisis to crisis"", say MPs. Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance, one of the UK's biggest industrial groups, was forced into an urgent financial restructuring when its key lender, Greensill Capital, collapsed. Greensill made money through supply chain finance - making loans to companies that are waiting for invoices to be paid by their customers. When the invoices were paid, the cash would be there to pay investors back, with interest. But the report by the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee says the use of such finance and the way Mr Gupta structured his businesses was questionable, concluding: Ministers should reflect on the systemic risks to the UK steel industry posed by such unusual corporate structures as those used by GFG Alliance Mr Gupta put senior members of his staff in an ""unacceptable position"" by not giving them the required access to information or decision-making powers needed to perform their roles The regulatory authorities should undertake an investigation into King & King, the auditors of a number of GFG Alliance businesses The Insolvency Service should consider whether Mr Gupta has breached his fiduciary duties as a company director. Darren Jones, chairman of the committee, said the steel industry was too important strategically to be left to the mercy of such things as international competition, high risk finance, and volatile energy prices. It was time for a Steel Sector Deal to ensure the industry's resilience, with better use of public procurement to support UK steel and help towards transitioning to a low-carbon future. Sanjeev Gupta is executive chairman of GFG Alliance But the GFG affair had exposed the sector's vulnerabilities, Mr Jones said. ""The evidence we heard during our inquiry has highlighted serious problems with high-risk financial practices, weaknesses in audit, and about inadequate accountability and corporate governance arrangements within GFG Alliance,"" Mr Jones said. He added: ""Sanjeev Gupta must urgently fix these problems if he is to be seen as a fit and proper owner of steel companies in the UK."" MPs also questioned the suitability of a small audit firm like King & King to handle GFG's accounts. The report said it was ""utterly unconvincing"" that King & King had the ""capacity, expertise, or resources to audit the accounts of multiple large GFG Alliance and Liberty Steel UK companies representing over Â£2.5bn of revenue"". A spokesperson for GFG said the company ""takes note of the findings of the select committee. We will review and reflect upon its conclusions"". However, since the committee took evidence GFG had embarked a restructuring and refinancing that included injecting Â£50m to restart the Rotherham and Stockbridge operations, the statement said. In addition, GFG said the company had drawn up a strategy to help decarbonise the steel industry. However, the spokesperson said GFG was ""disappointed that the report fails to recognise the significant role Sanjeev Gupta and Liberty Steel has played in saving and safeguarding thousands of UK jobs which otherwise would have been lost"". ""Mr Gupta has consistently met his obligations as a director of a private company, and... has led GFG's global restructuring since Greensill's collapse."" The statement added: ""Since 2019 the group has been on a journey to improve governance and transparency."" The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said it was already taking action to ensure better corporate governance. A spokesperson said: ""The government has published plans to require higher standards of transparency and oversight in UK business, which will strengthen further the UK's system of audit and corporate governance. ""The Insolvency Service has the powers to investigate the conduct of directors where the company has gone through a formal insolvency process. Where there is evidence of misconduct and it is in the public interest, the Insolvency Service can formally launch disqualification proceedings."" And on the wider issue of support for the steel industry, the spokesperson added: ""We are determined to secure a competitive future for the UK steel industry and in recent years have provided it with extensive support, including more than Â£600m to help with the costs of energy and to protect jobs. ""We recognise the critical role the steel industry plays in all areas of the UK and in our economy and will carefully consider the report's recommendations.""

"Staff and students in a protest march at University College London (UCL) in support of strikes in 2019 Academics at 37 universities have voted in favour of more strike action in a long-running row over pensions. Members of the University and College Union (UCU) who took part voted 76% in favour of strike action - with 88% in favour of action short of a strike. The vote does not mean that industrial action is inevitable. Universities UK said the result was ""disappointing"" but said the union had failed to secure a mandate at almost half the institutions that had ballots. The UCU said universities needed ""to urgently revoke the pension cuts and return to the negotiating table to avoid strike action"". The ballot covered 68 universities - of those, 35 met the 50% turnout threshold that is legally required for a strike. The threshold does not apply to two universities in Northern Ireland - Ulster and Queen's University Belfast. The dispute over pensions has been rumbling on for nearly a decade, and was reignited because of what the UCU described as a ""flawed valuation"" of the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) pension fund. The UCU said it was ""carried out at the start of the pandemic when global markets were crashing"" and would lower members' guaranteed retirement income by 35%. The union is expecting the results of another ballot on pay and conditions on Friday. Following that, the union's higher education committee will meet to decide the next steps, after consulting branches. Further strikes looming at universities this term UCU general secretary Jo Grady said: ""These results are a clear mandate for strike action over pension cuts and should be heard loud and clear by university employers. ""Staff in universities have given their all to support students during the pandemic, but management have responded by trying to slash their guaranteed pension by 35%."" Ms Grady said avoiding strike action was ""the outcome staff want"", and called on universities to ""withdraw the needless cuts"". For some students a winter of disruption lies ahead. As well as this vote on pensions, the results of ballots at many more universities across the UK on pay and conditions are expected. But so far the results suggest lecturers and other staff, such as librarians, have mixed feelings about causing students to miss out any further. When this dispute began students joined picket lines in 2020 in support of their lecturers. But that was before the pandemic left many studying for their degrees online, from their bedrooms. The transformative shift to online learning during lockdowns may also provide universities with a way to minimise the impact. The National Union of Students (NUS) said it stood ""in solidarity"" with staff who voted for industrial action because they were doing ""more work for less reward"". Hillary Gyebi-Ababio, its vice-president for higher education, said: ""Staff working conditions are our learning conditions, and we must stand together if we are to realise a system that is truly student-centered and democratised."" Universities UK said: ""While it is disappointing to see some UCU members think industrial action over pensions is justified, the union has failed to secure a mandate for industrial action in 31 of the 68 institutions, meaning fewer branches have reached the threshold than in previous ballots. ""Union members voting 'yes' to strike action at eligible branches account for less than 7% of the scheme's total active membership... ""The employers' proposals for reform are the only viable plans under current regulations that will keep the scheme affordable for members and universities and keep the defined benefit section of the scheme open."" The universities also say a range of measures could mitigate the impact of the pension changes on employees. Last year, staff at 74 universities held a 14-day strikeover pensions, pay, and conditions,and there was also actionin 2019and 2018. The 37 institutions where staff are able to take strike action over pensions are:Institute of Development Studies; Aston University; Birkbeck, UoL; Durham University; Goldsmiths, UoL; Heriot-Watt University; Imperial College London; Keele University; King's College London; London School of Economics; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; Loughborough University; Open University; Royal Holloway, UoL; SOAS, UoL; The University of Birmingham; The University of Dundee; The University of Kent; The University of Leeds; The University of Nottingham; The University of Sheffield; The University of Stirling; University of Bath; University of Belfast; University of Bradford; University of Bristol; University of Cambridge; University of Edinburgh; University of Essex; University of Glasgow; University of Lancaster; University of Liverpool; University of Reading; University of St Andrews; University of Sussex; University of Ulster; University of York Further strikes looming at universities this term Students hit by 14-day university staff strike University staff strike over pensions and pay Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Headingley held the third Test between England and India this summer Yorkshire have been suspended from hosting England matches as the England and Wales Cricket Board delivered a devastating rebuke over the club's response to racism experienced by former player Azeem Rafiq. An investigation found Rafiq was a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" - but the club said it would take no disciplinary action. The ECB board says the ban will last until the club has ""clearly demonstrated that it can meet the standards expected"". Meanwhile, a number of members of the Yorkshire board are set to announce their resignations on Friday before an emergency board meeting, BBC Sport understands. The board is under pressure after criticism from the ECB, sponsors and the UK government over its handling of the Rafiq case. The ECB said it was ""clear"" Yorkshire's handling of the issue was ""wholly unacceptable and is causing serious damage to the reputation of the game"". A statement said: ""Given recent events, it is clear there are serious questions regarding the governance and management of YCCC. ""The club's failure in relation to actions and responses to their own report represent a significant breach of its obligations to the game."" Yorkshire cricket racism scandal - how we got here Yorkshire board calls meeting to discuss racism allegations 'Racist language isn't friendly banter,' say British-Pakistanis The fallout from Yorkshire's response to the racism report intensified on Monday when ESPN Cricinfo reported a racist term about Rafiq's Pakistani heritage was regularly used towards him, but the investigation concluded it was ""friendly and good-natured banter"". Yorkshire's Gary Ballance, who hasadmitted using racist language towards ex-team-mate Rafiq, has been suspended indefinitely from England selection. On Thursday evening, former England captain Michael Vaughanrevealed he was named in the reportbut denied any allegation of racism. Julian Knight MP, who called for the Yorkshire board to resign this week and is chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, said he hoped the sanctions handed down by the ECB would ""act as a short, sharp shock to bring the club to its senses"". ""Like the rest of us, I imagine the members of Yorkshire County Cricket Club will be questioning why the board is still in place,"" he added. He said it would have been ""completely unacceptable"" were Ballance still eligible for England. Headingley is due to host a men's Test against New Zealand and a men's one-day international against South Africa in 2022. The Leeds ground is also scheduled to host an Ashes Test against Australia in 2023. Kit suppliers Nike and several sponsors have cut ties with the club. The ECB board has also asked the ECB executive to commission a review, looking into whether of Yorkshire's leadership is fit for purpose. A full ECB investigation into the matter remains ongoing. Financial and further match allocation punishments could be given at the end of the ECB's investigation. Following Thursday's statement, Rafiq, 30, said: ""I need a little time to reflect on what the ECB has said this evening and the actions they're proposing to take. ""I will not be commenting further at this time."" A former England youth captain, Azeem Rafiq played for Yorkshire across two spells and captained the county in a Twenty20 fixture in 2012 Yorkshire's investigations began in September 2020 after Rafiq, who played for Yorkshire between 2008 and 2018, claimed ""institutional racism"" at the club left him close to taking his own life. After more than a year - and having been asked to do so by MPs - Yorkshire released the findings of an independent report in September which upheld seven of the 43 allegations made by Rafiq. But the club said no players, coaches or executives would face disciplinary action following the club's own investigation into the report's findings. That move - and subsequent claim that the report judged the use of a racist term as ""banter - has now led senior politicians, including health secretary Sajid Javid, to criticise the club. Senior Yorkshire officials have been called to attend a DCMS select committee hearing on 16 November, where Rafiq will also give evidence. Ballance, who has not played for England since 2017, said on Wednesday he ""regrets"" using the offensive terms. 2 September 2020:Following aninitial interview with Wisden,external,ESPN Cricinfo publish an article with Rafiq,externalin which he claims ""institutional racism"" at Yorkshire County Cricket Club left him close to taking his own life. 3 September 2020:Yorkshire saythey have launched a ""formal investigation"" into the claims made by Rafiq and chairman Roger Hutton says the club would be carrying out a ""wider review"" of their ""policies and culture"" 5 September 2020:Yorkshire ask an independent law firmto investigate racism allegations against the club by Rafiq. 13 November 2020:Rafiq sayshe hopes to bring about ""meaningful change"" after giving his first statement to the inquiry. 15 December 2020:Rafiq files a legal claimagainst Yorkshire ""claiming direct discrimination and harassment on the grounds of race, as well as victimisation and detriment as a result of trying to address racism at the club"". 2 February 2021:Yorkshire threaten a lifetime banfor anyone found to have made threats against Rafiq or his family and legal team, after ESPN Cricinfo show them messages sent to Rafiq's legal firm. 17 June 2021:An employment tribunal case between Rafiq and his former club Yorkshirefails to find a resolution.The independent investigation into his racism allegations remains ongoing. 16 August 2021:Yorkshire receive the findingsof an independent investigation into the racism allegations and, two days later, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB)asks for a copy. 19 August 2021:Yorkshire, yet to release the findings of the report at this stage,admitRafiq was ""the victim of inappropriate behaviour"" and offer him their ""profound apologies"". Rafiq accuses Yorkshire of downplaying racismby calling him the victim of ""inappropriate behaviour"". 8 September 2021:MPs tell Yorkshireto publish the findingsof the report ""immediately"". 10 September 2021:Yorkshire release the findings of the report,which says Rafiq was the ""victim of racial harassment and bullying"" and seven of the 43 allegations made by the player were upheld by an independent panel. According to Hutton, the report said there was ""insufficient evidence to conclude that Yorkshire County Cricket Club is institutionally racist"". Yorkshire released a summary of the panel's report and recommendations, but said the full report could not be released for legal reasons ""in relation to privacy law and defamation"". 8 October 2021:Yorkshire miss a deadlineto send the full report to Rafiq and his legal team after BBC Sport understands an employment judge ordered the club to release it in full by Friday, 8 October. 13 October 2021:Rafiq then receives a heavily redacted version,while the ECB says it is still awaiting the full report. 28 October 2021:Yorkshire says it carried out its own internal investigation after the findings in the reportand concludedthat ""there is no conduct or action taken by any of its employees, players or executives that warrants disciplinary action"". 2 November 2021:The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee calls on Hutton to appear before it to answer questions about Yorkshire's handling of a report into Rafiq's allegations of racism. MP Knight, chair of the DCMS select committee,calls on the board of Yorkshire County Cricket Club to resignafter a leaked report emerges apparently containing details of the investigation into the treatment of Rafiq. A story published by ESPN says the report had concluded that a racially offensive term used towards Rafiq was regarded as ""banter"". Knight makes his comments after health secretary Javid calls for ""heads to roll"" at Yorkshire and said if the ECB did not take action ""it's not fit for purpose"". He further states in a Twitter post that the term allegedly used to describe Rafiq was ""not banter"". The ECB announces it will conduct a ""full"" investigation into the situation. 3 November 2021:The date of the DCMS hearing is scheduled for 16 November andRafiq is called to give evidence in person,along with senior Yorkshire officials.
