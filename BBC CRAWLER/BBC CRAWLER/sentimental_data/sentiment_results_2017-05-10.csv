"This video can not be played Stanley chairman on 'obscene' Pogba fees and the Premier League Accrington Stanley chairman Andy Holt has refused to back down despite what he considers a threat from the Premier League after his criticism of spending. Holt had said Football League clubs were like ""a starving peasant begging for scraps"" from the top flight. The Premier League responded: ""We will be writing to Mr Holt to ask him if he wishes the Premier League to continue the support we currently provide for his and other clubs in the EFL."" Holt said other chairmen supported him. On Tuesday, Holtaccused the Premier League of ""destroying"" the gameand tweeted: ""Hang your heads in shame. @premierleague you're an absolute disgrace to English football."" He posted a series of messages on Twitter after the Daily Mail revealed reported figures of wages and agent fees paid by Manchester United. A book published in Germany this week - The Football Leaks: The Dirty Business of Football - includes what it says is a breakdown of the fee forPaul Pogba's move to Unitedlast summer, and alleges his agent Mino Raiola earned Â£41m from the deal. Raiola has declined to comment and said the matter was in the hands of his lawyers. In an interview with BBC Sport on Wednesday, Holt said lower-league clubs needed more financial help. ""Football is in crisis. The lower league is really struggling, and I'm not the only chairman who feels like this,"" he said. He accused the Premier League of ""losing all sense of scale"" in what he called a ""threatening, dark"" response to his original comments. ""What they're saying is not only are they not bothered about it, anybody who complains about it, we'll take your money away and shut you down,"" he said. ""Other EFL clubs share my views, not all of them. I'm not trying to lead a rabble, I'm expressing an opinion but I'm not alone."" Accrington Stanley were promoted to the Football League in 2006 The Premier League says it intends to write to Holt and ""to explain the many ways it has supported Accrington Stanley FC and all EFL clubs this season"". Holt said the club had an annual turnover of about Â£2.2m and any withdrawal of Premier League funding would threaten its future. ""They can do what they want,"" he added. ""It would be a quarter of our revenue, and it would close Accrington down. ""I can't do anything about it. I don't like the agent's fee, I don't like the largesse of the Premier League and I won't like it in five years' time and I won't like it in 10 years' time. My opinion's the same, whatever they do."" The Premier League has provided Â£200m in ""solidarity funding"" to EFL clubs this season. Additional parachute payments to relegated clubs take its contribution to more than Â£400m. It is understood the Premier League made a Â£430,000 payment to Accrington this season, in addition to a Â£340,000 grant towards its youth development programme Accrington finished 13th in League Two this season with an average gate of 1,699 - the smallest in the Football League. ""I accept they do a bit for the community,"" said Holt. ""I don't really have a problem with the Premier League, I have a problem with it being unsustainable."" Holt's views were supported by Darragh MacAnthony, chairman of League One side Peterborough United, who tweeted: ""Andy is 100% correct in his comments & 99% of Football League owners would agree I'd think."" MacAnthony later told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire: ""Andy has gone to the extreme; I'm not disagreeing with what he's saying. He's a frustrated man. I wouldn't have said starving peasant, I would compare it to being like a family member. ""We're meant to all be part of one family, the Premier League and the Football League. It's a bit like the poor member of the family that every time they go for a handout they're made to feel guilty instead of being family where they help you out."" The Premier League has previously said it is the only top-flight league in world football which funds the fourth tier of its football pyramid.

"The New York Times called for the president to leave office immediately, describing it as ""the last great service"" he could perform for the country. The Washington Post demanded impeachment, followed by a Senate trial. Time magazine, deeming it necessary to publish its first-ever editorial, thundered: ""The president should resign."" Outside the White House, protesters waved placards at passing motorists: ""Honk for Impeachment."" Even Washington's most influential columnist, Stewart Alsop, who was normally supportive of the president, called him an ""ass."" The president had lost his moral authority, argued his critics, and with it, his ability to govern. The country faced a constitutional crisis. The republic was imperilled. Such was the feverish reaction to the events of 20 October, 1973, a date remembered in the national memory as the ""Saturday Night Massacre"" - a pivotal moment in the unfolding Watergate controversy. With scandal engulfing the White House, Richard Nixon decided to fire Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor appointed to investigate ""all offenses arising out of the 1972 electionâ¦ involving the president, the White House staff or presidential appointments"". This video can not be played John Dean spoke to BBC radio about Watergate Nixon's Attorney General, Elliot Richardson, and his Deputy Attorney General, William Ruckelshaus, resigned rather than carry out the president's order. Eventually, the Solicitor General Robert Bork, who was third in command at the justice department, was prepared to fire Cox. The White House announced the news at 20:22 that Saturday evening. On Wednesday, almost as quickly as the news that he had been sacked as head of the FBI reached James Comey in Los Angeles, these two dramatic episodes were being described as historically analogous. The president had fired the lead figure in an investigation into alleged wrongdoing by members of his own team. The Nixonian parallels were obvious. Roger Stone, a Trump associate who also worked in 1972 for the notorious Committee to Re-elect the President, told the New York Times: ""Somewhere Dick Nixon is smiling."" The Nixon presidential library even trolled the White House on Twitter: ""FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector #notNixonian."" Democrats insinuated that Comey was fired for similar reasons to Cox, because he was closing in on the truth. There were other resemblances, too. In the lead-up to the Saturday Night Massacre, the Nixon White House was still reeling from the resignation of the president's chief of staff, Bob Haldeman, a central figure in the Watergate scandal, just as the Trump administration continues to be buffeted by the swirl of controversy surrounding the forced departure of Gen Michael Flynn, his former National Security Adviser. There's the suspicion now, as there was four decades ago, that an embattled White House has something to hide. So is this truly a re-run of the events of 1973? Is the past repeating itself? Even by the standards of the Nixon presidency, the autumn of 1973 was unusually chaotic. Flynn before his departure from the White House It saw the resignation of Vice-President Spiro Agnew because of fraud, tax evasion, bribery and extortion allegations. The Middle East was in the grip of the Yom Kippur war, a conflict between US-backed Israel and Arab forces armed by the Soviets that threatened to blow-up into a broader conflagration between Washington and Moscow. In Washington, Nixon was fighting a pitched battle with Archibald Cox and the courts. Cox, a Harvard professor who had been appointed as special prosecutor in May that year, had issued a subpoena ordering the White House to hand over nine tapes of phone calls and West Wing conversations in connection with the Watergate break-in. Nixon's legal team argued the principle of executive privilege should apply, and the tapes should remain private. Echoes of Watergate as Trump-Russia links probed Live: Turmoil in Washington as Comey fired Anthony Zurcher: Was Comey fired as part of a cover up? On 12 October, however, the Court of Appeals in Washington upheld a lower court's ruling granting Cox's request. Rather than comply, Nixon decided to fire the special prosecutor, something his Attorney General Elliot Richardson had promised Congress would never happen. A president stood in defiance of the courts, putting himself above the law of the land. It was a textbook constitutional crisis. Donald Trump's sacking of his FBI director, while highly unusual and deeply controversial, is constitutionally permissible. No court orders have been flouted. The president, while breaking with the norm of allowing FBI directors to serve out their 10-year terms unimpeded, is not putting himself above the law. Trump's motivations may also be different. Nixon sacked Cox through fear his criminality was about to exposed. Within the FBI, agents believe that Trump sacked Comey primarily out of pique and spite because of his refusal to publicly exonerate Trump against allegations of collusion with the Kremlin, and also because Comey refused to back up Trump's unsubstantiated claims that Barack Obama ordered the wire-tapping of Trump Tower. This video can not be played Trump's love-hate relationship with Comey over a tumultuous year Unlike the Saturday Night Massacre, the president is at one with the most high-ranking figures in the justice department rather than at odds with them. The president, the attorney general and the deputy attorney general together they made the case that Comey should go - not purportedly because of his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, but because of the former director's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. The politics is also very different. Back in 1973, the Democrats controlled both the Senate and House of Representatives. That put the investigative machinery of Congress in their hands. Senate hearings were already under way, and the Saturday Night Massacre gave them fresh impetus. Nixon also faced an acid shower of criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill and around the country. ""Clearly we face a constitutional crisis,"" lamented the Republican governor of Michigan. Literally Nixonian: Trump and Nixon Secretary of State Henry Kissinger talking in the Oval Office the day after Comey's firing There have been Republican critics of Trump's decision to fire Comey. But so far they haven't been so vehement. Crucially, the Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell is resisting demands from the Democrats, and some in his own party, to back calls for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the 2016 election. Politically, Donald Trump remains strong, because of the support of the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill and his grassroots supporters in the American heartland. Nixon, by contrast, was politically weak. This became apparent only a few days later when the White House indicated it would hand over the tapes, which included a recording of the infamous conversation between the president and Haldeman, eighteen and half minutes of which were missing. Nixon was also forced to appoint a new special prosecutor. And eventually, of course, the push for impeachment gathered unstoppable momentum, and he was forced to resign as president. In 1973, Democrats were hollering impeachment. In 2017, the party's congressional leadership has not publicly uttered that explosive word. What may be similar between now and then is the intemperate mood of the president. As demonstrated by his Twitter tirades, Donald Trump is lashing out publicly against his critics, much as Nixon did privately in his final months in office. Senator Marco Rubio being interviewed by reporters about Comey firing Politico is reporting that Trump shouted at the television over the Russian investigation, which again has echoes of Nixon's executive mansion tantrums. Curiously, both presidents also saw Florida as a bolt-hole from the pressures of Washington, Nixon opting for Key Biscayne, Trump regularly visiting Mar-a-Lago - although a key difference is that Nixon medicated himself with alcohol, while Trump is famously teetotal. But the Saturday Night Massacre and the Tuesday Night 'You're fired"" are not directly comparable. The sacking of Archibald Cox contributed heavily to Nixon's forced departure from the White House. It was widely seen as an impeachable offence. The removal of James Comey, in and of itself, does not pose such an existential threat to the Trump administration.

"While generations of Westerners were growing up on the films of James Bond, Soviet citizens had their own favourite spy, a wartime agent who went under the name of Max Otto von Stierlitz. And it could easily have been Stierlitz who prompted Vladimir Putin to join the KGB, writes Dina Newman. The USSR's answer to James Bond was a very different kind of spy. He had no time for women or gadgets. His life was devoted entirely to his work in Berlin in World War Two, where, under cover, he infiltrated the German high command. Stierlitz was the hero of a 12-part series, Seventeen Moments of Spring, screened on Soviet TV every year around 9 May - the date the USSR marked as the end of World War Two. The first broadcast, in 1973, was watched by an estimated 50 to 80 million people. ""Every evening the streets were deserted and people rushed home from work to watch the latest episode and to find out what would happen next,"" says Eleonora Shashkova, one of the stars of the series. Apart from being a gripping drama, it has a perfect Cold War plotline, with Stierlitz disrupting secret peace negotiations between the Nazis and the Americans in 1945. But the film also had another hidden purpose. ""The film showed the importance of secret agents, who are highly respected people in our country. It instilled patriotism in the post-war generation,"" says Shashkova. In fact, it was commissioned by Yuri Andropov - then head of the KGB, later the country's leader - as part of a PR campaign designed to attract young, educated recruits. Andropov personally approved the series before it went on air, shooting was overseen by his first deputy, and two KGB operatives employed as consultants appeared in the credits under aliases. Vladimir Putin has never said whether or not it was Stierlitz who inspired him to become a spy. But he was 21 when the film was first screened, and he joined the KGB two years later. In time, like Stierlitz himself, he was posted to Germany. If Bond was a pathologically heavy drinker, Stierlitz - like Putin - was quite the opposite. In the film he spends most of his time alone, smoking, drinking coffee and looking pensively out of windows. Listen toDina Newman talking to Eleonora Shashkovafor Witness, on the BBC World Service Download theWitness podcast In fact, Kim Philby, the British spy who defected to the USSR in 1963, commented that a spy who looked so thoughtful would not last long in his job. In 1991, when Putin had already left the KGB and was working for the mayor of St Petersburg, he admitted for the first time to his career as a spy in a TV documentary, which includes a re-enacted scene from Seventeen Moments of Spring. Instead of Stierlitz driving his car back to Berlin, Putin is seen at the wheel of a Russian Volga car, with the film's theme tune playing in the background. In the documentary, the future Russian president warns there is a risk that ""for a period of time, our country will turn to totalitarianism"". He goes on: ""But the danger lies not in the law enforcement organs, nor in the state security services nor in the police - and not even in the army. The danger lies in our own mentality. We all think - and even I think it sometimes - that if we bring order with an iron fist, life will be easier, more comfortable and safer. But in reality, we won't be comfortable for long: the iron fist will soon strangle us all."" Some years later, in the chaos of the late 1990s, many Russians did indeed begin to yearn for law and order, and some for the iron fist. Opinion polls indicated that voters were keen for the next president to be young, ethnically Russian, a former member of the security services and a non-drinker. The actor Vyacheslav Tikhonov as Stierlitz, in Seventeen Moments of Spring ""Having lost faith in liberals, the country was searching for its Stierlitz,"" writes Arkady Ostrovsky, Russia and Eastern Europe editor for the Economist, in his book, The Invention of Russia. In 1999, he notes, the Kommersant newspaper commissioned a poll asking which film character Russians would like as their next president. Stierlitz came second, after the wartime military commander Marshal Zhukov. The cover of the newspaper's weekly supplement carried a picture of Stierlitz with the caption, ""President-2000"". And in March 2000, after a period as acting president, Putin was duly elected to the post. Vladimir Putin revisits an old haunt in Dresden, in 2006 Anyone who wants to understand Vladimir Putin today needs to know the story of what happened to him on a dramatic night in East Germany a quarter of a century ago, writes Chris Bowlby (March 2015). Vladimir Putin's formative German years Eleonora Shashkova plays Stierlitz's wife in Seventeen Moments of Spring, but interestingly, the two characters never meet - except in one famous scene, where she is taken from Russia to Berlin, and visits a cafe with another man. Stierlitz is already sitting at another table in the cafe, and from time to time they manage to exchange furtive glances, full of longing. The viewer sees his eyes, then hers, then his eyes again. Ater a few minutes she gets up and slowly walks out. On her 70th birthday, in December 2007 - more than seven years into the Putin era - Shashkova received a special present, unprecedented in the history of Soviet cinema. It was a thank you gift from the Russian secret service, for her portrayal of the wife of a foreign agent.

"Miles wanted his biggest hit to help stop Italy's ""Saturday night slaughter"" DJ Robert Miles hasdied at the age of 47. The track that defined his career, Children, was one of the biggest-selling instrumentals in Europe and inspired a whole new genre. But Miles had an unusual motivation for it - helping to tackle ""Saturday night slaughter"" on Italy's roads. Children is one of the most iconic tracks in the history of dance music. It launched a new genre - ""dream house"" - and although that did not last long, the more melancholy, cerebral sound opened the door for trance music, which would come to dominate clubs in the late 1990s, going fully mainstream into the new millennium. That sound was a very deliberate choice by Miles, whose real name was Roberto Concina. Although Children was initially written in response to images of the child victims of the Balkans war as Yugoslavia tore itself apart, the track then took on a different life - and a different motivation. Miles wanted to make it big to help save the lives of clubbers. The sound of Europe's clubs in the mid-1990s - in particular in Italy, where Miles lived - was amped-up tracks and hard beats. But the high this music induced in clubbers - plus any substances they may have taken to enhance their experience - meant that when the night was over, they were still feeling the full effects of drugs and adrenaline. This was blamed for a rise in car crashes at the weekends. Having danced all night and often driven many miles to get to the clubs, young drivers were losing control and ending up in appalling accidents. In fact, so bad was the problem that it had its own term in Italy - ""stragi del sabato sera"" - Saturday night slaughter. Children, therefore, was an option for DJs to put on as the last track of the night. It had a soft beat, slower and far less frenetic than the music that would have preceded it. The full-length version started without any instruments at all - it began with the natural sound of a thunderstorm. But it was the piano riff that really made Children different. Miles was named Best international newcomer at the 1997 Brit Awards It was mournful, a sound that triggered deep emotions. To listeners, the children of the title were not literally the world's under-16s but their own younger selves. To those in the right frame of mind, the track brought feelings of nostalgia, calm and longing, like the regret of remembering a beautiful dream. Not for nothing was the track's parent album called Dreamland. Miles once described the reaction the first time he played the track: ""I lifted my gaze and saw a sea of hands reaching up high and a smile stamped on every face,"" he said. ""A girl approached me in tears. 'What music is this?' she asked me. I don't think I shall ever forget that moment, when I realised that my feelings had been conveyed through my music. My dream turned into reality."" The video for Children played on these themes, shot in moody black and white, with a child looking out of a car window at a rainy world. Italian authorities and parents welcomed the release of the track. And before long, so did Europe's record-buying public. In the UK, BBC Radio 1's Pete Tong named it Essential Tune of The Week three weeks in a row. It was the eighth best-selling single of 1996. In Europe - doubtless aided by its lack of vocals, giving it a more universal appeal - Children did even better. It was number one in France for 11 weeks, Germany and Spain for seven, and - crucially - Italy for five. In Miles's home country of Switzerland, it lasted at the top for an extraordinary 13 weeks. Ultimately, it went top five in every European country that counted record sales. Miles followed Children's success with another couple of hits from Dreamland - Fable and One & One - and briefly revived the career of Sister Sledge's Kathy Sledge with their collaboration Freedom. He then devoted his musical career to experimentation, taking his sound in a dramatically different direction that no longer had the commercial appeal that made him a star name. But his track had changed dance music forever - and perhaps also changed the lives of certain clubbers who thought twice about exhaustedly staggering into their cars on hot nights in mid-90s Italy.

"Tour de France winner Chris Froome escaped injury when he was ""rammed on purpose"" by a motorist while training in southern France. Other professional riders have recently been hurt or even killed. How dangerous are the open roads for cyclists? About 100 cyclists die as a result of collisions or coming off their bikes on the roads in Great Britain each year. And more than 3,000 are seriously injured. But the good news is the number of deaths has dropped. There were 55 cyclist fatalities per billion miles cycled in 2005, which fell to 31 deaths per billion miles in 2015. However, when the fatalities are combined with the overall number of serious injuries, the risk of life-changing injury is still higher than it was a decade ago. The rate of cyclist deaths on the road varies from country to country. In France, where Olympic bronze medallist Froome posted a picture of his mangled bike on Twitter, about four in every 100 road deaths are cyclists. That is slightly lower than in the UK, where cyclists make up 6% of those killed, according to European Commission statistics. For more stories from the BBC England Data Unit visit our Pinterest board.,external Chris Froome carried on training after being knocked from his bike Team Sky said the 31-year-old three-time Tour de France winner had returned to his home in Monaco to get a spare bicycle and had continued his training after the incident, which was being reported to the police. In April, Wanty-Groupe Gobert rider Yoann Offredoposted pictures on social media of himself badly bloodied,external, saying he had been the victim of an assault while out riding with two friends in the Chevreuse Valley, south west of Paris. Another professional rider was not so fortunate. In April,Michele Scarponi, who won the 2011 Giro d'Italia, was killed when he was knocked off his bike by a van while training close to home in Italy. Wanty-Groupe Gobert rider Yoann Offredo posted pictures of the aftermath of an attack In Italy cyclists account for about 7% of all road deaths and the average across the European Union is about 8%. The rate is especially high in countries where cycling is more popular. In the Netherlands, for example, cyclists account for almost a quarter of road deaths. In Great Britain, cyclists are the second most at risk group of road users after motorcycle riders. When the number of deaths and serious injuries is divided by the total number of miles travelled by all people using that form of transport, cyclists are far more at risk than car drivers. In 2015, there were 43 more cyclists than car drivers killed or seriously hurt per billion miles travelled. However, these figures do not take account of the health benefits of cycling. A study of commuters suggested there was a link between cycling to work and areduced risk of cancer and heart disease. The charity Cycling UK says cycling in Britain is a""relatively safe activity"",externalbut that ""the behaviour and attitudes of some road users, sub-standard highway layout and motor traffic volume and speed all conspire to make cycling feel and look more dangerous than it actually is"". Campaign co-ordinator Sam Jones says: ""Cycling is no more dangerous than walking or doing your gardening, but we do find the increased risk of injury is worrying and there are a number of things that can be done to address this."" The charity wants to see 20mph limits on narrow roads and a network of cycling routes. Itstips for safer cycling,externalinclude: Don't rely on being seen by drivers, no matter how brightly you are dressed Be proactive - change road position, interact with other road users, ride assertively Make eye contact where possible or at least try and gauge whether or not you've been seen Cover your brakes so you can slow down or stop when approaching junctions or on roundabouts if you are not sure you have been seen Move out early and create as much space as possible so you can see and be seen Cycling to work 'halves cancer risk' Do cyclists get enough legal protection?

"The Chibok girls who have been released will have to take part in a government rehabilitation programme There was huge relief when 82 of the girls kidnapped by Islamist militants Boko Haram in Chibok, north-east Nigeria, in 2014 were freed on Saturday. But, as the BBC's Alastair Leithead has been finding out, they may still not be able to go back home. The ordeal of being kidnapped by Boko Haram does not end with the release of the captives. In fact, it is just the start of a long struggle back into family and community life. Captured as children, the Chibok girls, as they have come to be known, are being freed as young women. An already fraught transition from adolescence to womanhood complicated by their captivity. The 82 will, albeit briefly, be reunited with their families over the coming days. Some families are frustrated that their daughters have not been allowed to go home A representative from the group of Chibok parents has visited them, to check their identities against the list of those freed, and to tell those waiting for confirmation either the good or the bad news. Most relatives are still living in the remote town of Chibok, 900km (600 miles) north-east of the capital, Abuja. And it will be a long but joyous journey for those told to come. There will be tearful reunions and a mixture of emotions as both parents and daughters will have changed a great deal over the past three years. And then what? If the treatment of the 21 girls released last October, and the few who escaped, is a guide, the young women will go through a process of re-integration or rehabilitation. This is either government care or government custody depending on the point of view. Some families support the process, others are angry that more than six months after being released from Boko Haram, they still do not have their children back. This video can not be played Mother of escaped Chibok schoolgirl: ""She said, 'mama, you should be happy that I came out alive'."" One of the parents who visited a secure government facility in the capital, Abuja, last week said they are being treated well and are living comfortably. ""I was happy with the conditions the girls are staying in. They are doing fine,"" said Ali Maiyanga Askira who went to see his daughter Maryam. ""I wish she was with us, but I couldn't take care of her as well as the government is. ""They are teaching vocational work like tailoring and knitting, and they are also taking lessons. ""The minister of education told us in the next four months they would go back to school. ""I am happy with whatever decision the government takes,"" he said. But some other families just want their girls back. The abduction of the Chibok girls received global attention through a social media campaign There was anger at Christmas when they were brought to Chibok to meet relatives, but were not allowed home. They were taken to a local politician's house and their families were only allowed to visit them for a short time. ""I can't believe my daughter has come this close to home, but can't come home,"" said one father at the time. But the chairman of the Chibok community in Abuja, Tsambido Hosea, said parents were being invited to visit Abuja in small groups. ""They are in a rehabilitation centre. The government says it is giving them some instruction so they will be ready to go to school,"" he said. As to whether they are allowed to go home or not, the community doesn't care that they are being held by the government. ""We know they are in the hands of people we know, that we can call, to answer at any moment. It's different from when they were in the hands of the terrorists."" Psychologists who have worked with those previously released from the Islamist group said family therapy rather than isolation would be a better way of reintegrating them. But there is also the suspicion that the former captives are not being allowed home because the huge publicity around the case could make them targets for kidnapping again. This video can not be played Zara John: ""They gave us a choice to be married or to be a slave - I decided to marry"" There have been times when those, not from the Chibok group, who were allowed home without proper psychological support have been alienated by their communities or even parts of their own families. Some converted from Christianity to Islam, and some were married to Boko Haram fighters and had children with them, leading them to be shunned. It is clear that once the violence is over the militant's impact in the region will remain for a generation, unless those abducted can be quickly and effectively re-integrated in society. At the moment though, those recently released will have to contemplate a future still far away from their families. What next for freed Chibok girls?

"Pippa was just two-and-a-half years old when she died from Alabama Rot Tearing through woods in Wiltshire was a regular activity for Pippa the Cocker Spaniel - running off her energy amid the trees and mud of the local landscape. But little did her owner know that just six days later, she would pass away in a London animal hospital having contracted Alabama rot. The disease was first discovered in the US during the late 1980s, but did not appear on UK shores until December 2012 when the first case was reported. Since then, 98 dogs have died from it, with 15 cases confirmed already in 2017. Yet, there is still little information on its cause or cure. Specialists are meeting in Reading for the UK's first conference focused on Alabama rot, as vets, nurses and academics continue to search for the answer to the disease. Pippa belonged to veterinary nurse Jessica Worthington, who lives in Swindon. ""I had her from when she was an eight-week old puppy,"" she said. ""She was just like her breed, always running around and excited."" Jessica took Pippa and her other dog Molly to woods near the village of Marlborough in December 2015 and let the dogs play, as she had done plenty of other times. She gave them a good shampoo after to stop her house being covered in mud but noticed something was wrong with her one pet. ""I thought Pippa seemed a little lame so I took her into work with me that night,"" said Jessica. ""Then, the next morning, six or seven lesions had appeared on her feet."" When she checked Molly, she had the same thing. Cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (CRGV) or Alabama rot is a serious disease which has only recently been recognised in dogs in the UK. It causes lesions on the skin and occasionally in the mouth, which can look like bites, sores, wounds or stings. Some dogs go on to develop life-threatening kidney failure. It causes tiny blood clots to form in the blood vessels which blocks them and can ultimately lead to damage of the affected tissue. In the skin, this causes ulceration, but in the kidney it can lead to severe organ dysfunction. Any age, sex, or breed of dog can be affected and it is fatal in nine out of 10 dogs. SOURCE: Alabamarot.co.uk Jessica rushed the pair to specialist vets Anderson Moores, in Hursley, Hampshire, where David Walker leads research in the UK into Alabama Rot. Within days, Pippa's kidneys and liver were failing and she died at the Royal Veterinary College. Pippa being treated at the Royal Veterinary College ""It was heartbreaking,"" said Jessica. ""Molly had the exact same treatment and improved. Luckily, she seems to have recovered and is back to her normal self. ""But we will never forget Pippa."" Gabrielle Williams from Magor, in Monmouthshire, South Wales, lost her five-year-old whippet Fleur to the disease in March. ""It started when she was sick one morning,"" she said. ""I didn't think much of it. She was fine the rest of the day and ate her food."" But soon things began to get worse. Fleur (right) died just a week after first showing symptoms ""A day after she had an intermittent limp,"" said Gabrielle. ""Then a lesion appeared. ""She deteriorated extremely quickly. They did blood tests and found that her kidneys were failing too. Then more lesions appeared, also in her mouth."" From the first symptom of her being sick to her being put to sleep was just one week. ""It was extremely quick and devastating to see her deteriorate so badly,"" added Gabrielle. ""There was nothing the vets could do."" ""Fleur was a fantastic character and losing her has broken my heart. I take comfort in the fact I have my other dogs... but they still look for Fleur and seem lost without her around."" In February, Cathy Moss, from Bournemouth, went through the same experience with her three-year-old Cocker Spaniel Maggie. They had been for a walk in a forest near her home for a change of scenery and over the next few days Cathy noticed a change in Maggie's behaviour. ""It all happened so quickly,"" she said. ""She was quieter than usual and had lost interest in her food for a couple of days. Maggie's owners said she will never be replaced in their family ""She then started licking her back paw and we spotted a sore, so took her to the vet where they took tests and said it looked like it could be Alabama rot."" Cathy knew the disease could be fatal, but still didn't believe she would lose her. However, soon after she was transferred to specialists, Maggie's kidneys began failing and they could not save her. ""It's so sad to lose a dog so young,"" said Cathy. ""I would hate for another dog to have to go through this. More research needs to be done."" Anderson Moores vet Mr Walker said he did not want dog owners to panic, as Alabama rot is still a very rare disease, but he called on people to be aware. ""Without us knowing the cause of the disease, it is incredibly difficult for us to give preventative advice,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""But I think the best thing that we can tell pet owners is to be vigilant. ""If they see a skin sore on their dog and they don't know why that has developed, they should go and seek veterinary attention. We suspect there is an environmental trigger for this disease, although to date we haven't been able to find one [but if] people want to know the geographical location of the affected cases, then they can look online. ""It probably will help if pet owners can get their dogs to the vet early when they see that skin sore the chances are the outcome might be better. We have got dogs through this.""

"Louise says she realised she may have been raped after reading aNewsbeat article on 'stealthing'. Stealthing is a term given to the act of removing a condom in the middle of sex, without asking your partner's permission. A recentreport from the US,externalsuggests that cases are on the rise, and that it is a hugely under-reported issue. Twenty-two-year-old Louise (not her real name) has been telling Newsbeat it happened to her. Louise says she fell victim to stealthing some time ago, but only realised after reading Newsbeat's article last month that it could have been rape. ""I saw [the article] posted. The more I read I thought, 'Oh my God, that's actually me. That's what happened to me.' ""I didn't even know it was something that happened this commonly, to be given a name."" Louise recalls finishing sex with a partner, and then noticing that the condom had been removed. ""It was completely casual - a 'friends with benefits' kind of thing. ""I hate that term but that is kind of how it was. ""After it had happened, we just lay there and [the condom] was on the floor. ""I said, 'I didn't see you take it off.' ""He was like, 'I did it halfway through.' ""I said, 'What? Was it an accident?' ""He said, 'No, I just thought I'd do it.'"" ""For starters, it's selfish. It was such a violation. How and why would you do something like that? ""Not even to tell me, or warn me. ""He was really casual about it - saying he didn't know it would be such an issue. ""He said he thought it would be a benefit for both of us, but it was putting us both at risk. ""I just got out of there. I got my things and went. ""I phoned my friend, and asked her to come with me to a pharmacy to sort things out. ""The minute stealthing happens, he has done something then that is 'I've done this, and you can suffer the consequences.' ""One minute. That's all it takes. A change of positions and it could be gone. You wouldn't even notice. ""Think about the consequences. ""You've put your sexual health at risk, her sexual health at risk, there's the risk of pregnancy - for that however long of heightened pleasure, I suppose."" Sandra Paul is a partner in the law firm Kingsley Napley and specialises in sexual crime. She says the law is clear - that stealthing could definitely be classed as rape. ""You're doing something that's quite deliberate, which you don't have permission for,"" she says. ""If that is penetrative sex, then that is the definition of rape."" Sandra Paul is a solicitor who specialises in sexual crime No-one has ever brought a stealthing case to court, but she says there is legal precedent. She says: ""There's a case where a man failed to withdraw. ""[He and his partner] had an agreement that their method of contraception was that he would withdraw. ""On one occasion he decided that he just wasn't going to do that. This scenario is legally similar to stealthing in that the sex act was changed midway through, so that it was no longer what had been consented to. Ms Paul says: ""The court in that case said that factual scenario was capable of being rape, and so this was something that should go in front of a jury."" The NPCC - the body that represents police chiefs - agrees. They've told Newsbeat in a statement: ""Sex without informed and freely given consent is rape. ""So-called 'stealthing' fits that definition."" They add that anyone who thinks they have been a victim should contact police. There is help atBBC Advice.

"Donald Trump's letter sacking FBI boss James Comey It is not just Donald Trump's decisionto fire FBI director James Comeythat has raised eyebrows. The way he was sacked, especially the termination letter, has come under scrutiny too. So what tips do HR experts have for getting a sacking right? Mr Comey's dismissal seems to have broken lots of conventional rules. Firstly, he was not told personally by the President that he was out of a job. Instead he was addressing FBI agents in Los Angeles when he saw the news on television.  Aides had to pull him to one side and confirm it was not a prank. Reaction to James Comey's sacking What powers does President Trump have? Deconstructing Comey's testimony on Clinton emails President Trump did not tell Mr Comey of his decision in person ""That must have been very humiliating for him,"" says Rachel Suff, employment adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD). ""It has come out of the blue and so he (Trump) should have done it face to face."" Lucy Adams, chief executive of The Disruptive HR Agency (and former director of human resources at the BBC) agrees. ""If you are going to fire someone, you should at least do it in person."" What do you say in your dismissal letter? ""These break-up letters tend to fall into a number of categories,"" says Ms Adams. She categorises them as 'It's not you, it's me', 'Can we stay friends?' or 'I never want to see you again.' ""Trump's letter has bits of all of these,"" she says. ""Most of all, though, a letter should reference the face to face conversations you have already had with them."" How to end such a letter is also a thorny subject. President Trump opted for: ""I wish you the best in your future endeavours"". But Ms Adams says these letters should avoid such ""platitudes"". President Trump's sign-off in his letter ""came across as sarcastic"", says Rachel Suff Trump's sign-off was all wrong, agrees Rachel Suff. ""Given how short and terse the letter was, it just came across as sarcastic,"" she says. But in more ""normal circumstances"" it would be good to end a letter of dismissal ""on a positive, encouraging note"", she adds. Whether you're sacking someone in person or putting it in writing, the general message is keep it concise. ""Being to the point, and not having an hour-long chat about the last football game before sharing the decision is very important,"" says Jeannine Hertel, chief operating officer at the Singapore operation of recruitment firm Mercuri Urval. Perhaps the most controversial section of Mr Trump's letter is its second paragraph. This seemingly expressed gratitude to Mr Comey for telling him ""on three separate occasions"" that the President was exonerated from involvement in any Russian interference in the 2016 US election. The letter highlighted Mr Comey's remarks that the President was exonerated from involvement in any Russian interference in the US election On social media this has been derided as ""ham-fisted"" and ""self-serving"". Says Lucy Adams, it brings ""an incredible new dimension of self-absorption"" to the world of sacking people. Rachel Suff was equally unimpressed. ""I couldn't believe Donald Trump's letter. Not only was it short, but a big chunk of it was about himself."" Thankfully this is very rare, she says, but adds it's important for bosses to remember that in employment, the balance of power is rarely equal. ""Resist using the situation for your own personal gratification."" Another no-no in the Trump/Comey letter, according to our HR experts, was writing that the decision had been made following correspondence ""from the attorney general and deputy attorney general... recommending your dismissal"". Mr Trump should have taken responsibility for his decision in his letter, say HR experts ""If you look at it, he's basically passing the buck, he's not really taking responsibility for it,"" says Rachel Suff. And blaming others for the move did not sit well either with Jeannine Hertel. ""The manager in charge makes the decision and stands for the decision,"" she says. ""Never say it's the group management's decision or HR's decision and never ever push the responsibility away."" Lucy Adams agrees. ""There's no right way to write a letter telling someone they're fired but in my experience it should be short and sweet and shouldn't try and pass the blame for the decision onto anyone."" Or email, or SMS, or on Facebook.  It might sound crazy but firmshave done just that.,external Mr Trump's move came as a surprise to Washington ""It's not a respectful way to connect with an individual,"" says Rosemary Guyatt, HR Manager at the Australian HR Institute. ""If someone is dismissed inappropriately you're going to have a very disgruntled ex-employee. A letter is the only correct way to put things in writing. ""A text message for example would be too brief and wouldn't constitute a legal document."" And quite apart from that, says Rachel Suff, word about how you treat staff would soon get round, which is likely to damage your brand. If you're sacking someone - follow the law - otherwise you're likely to regret it ""In the days of social media reputation is everything."" Employment rules vary wildly across the world, but one bit of advice all our experts agreed on was that if you're sacking someone - follow the law. ""There's legislation in place to protect employees and if it's not a fair dismissal and the processes are not followed, it will come back to haunt you,"" says Rachel Suff. Like Trump's letter to Comey, letters should be clear why someone is being dismissed and when the dismissal is effective from. It should also address issues like compensation or outstanding payments. ""Make sure you check your contractual obligations,"" is Rosemary Guyatt's advice. ""It's right that companies can sack people in the right circumstances and if proper processes have been followed,"" says Rachel Suff. Before you fire somebody, you should have tried to improve things first ""But you can't sack someone willy-nilly."" When there's gross misconduct involved things are a little trickier. But most agree that before firing someone over performance, you need to have tried to improve things. ""The manager should have run several performance discussions, developed an improvement plan and made sure the employee has a fair chance to change his behaviour or actions,"" says Jeannine Hertel. ""And the employee should be aware what the process could finally lead to."" Which means that James Comey's dismissal seems to have broken another HR rule: that a termination should never be a total surprise.

Footage has also emerged of shadow chancellor John McDonnellÂ saying that Labour would scrap tuition fees as part of its national
education service. Speaking at a rally in Mansfield in April, Mr McDonnellÂ said:Â ""We believe - we've always believed as a movement - that education is a gift from one generation to another, it's not a commodity to be bought and sold. So we want to introduce, just as the Attlee government with Nye Bevan introduced the National Health Service, we want to introduce a national  education service, free at the point of need throughout life. That means ending the cuts in the schools at primary and second level, that means free childcare, it means free skills training whenever you need it  throughout life. And yes, it means scrapping tuition fees once and for all, so we don't burden our kids with debt in the future.""  The ECJ ruling could have implications for those affected by the UK's decision to leave the EU. The Scottish Greens say they will have a ""targeted"" campaign, with the focus on getting Patrick Harvie elected. Theresa May has told an audience at a factory
at Mansfield that a Conservative government after the election would not scrap
university tuition fees in England. Pressed over the issue
following reports that Labour may be planning to get rid of tuition fees, Mrs May said
the question for Labour was how they would pay for that pledge, warning that it
would ""wreck the economy"". She added: ""If you
wreck the economy you aren't able to support students, you aren't able to
support public services, you see businesses going under, you see jobs going.""  The Labour leader is in York Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Theresa May continues her East Midlands campaign day in Mansfield. She argues that ""government has a role to play"" in creating a society with opportunities for all, for example by providing affordable homes and good education. She then takes questions, kicking off with one asking why she will not appear in a live TV debate with other party leaders? The PM says she ""approaching people in other ways"" - appearing at events such as this and knocking on doors instead.Â It's a ""more traditional campaign"", she says. TheÂ Federation of Small Businesses has called for more clarity from Labour about its corporation tax plans. Labour says it will fund its education plans by raising corporation tax from 19% to 26% over the course of the next Parliament. Speaking earlier, Jeremy Corbyn said this rate would still be lower than the 28% rate in 2010. However, that was the main rate of corporation tax in 2010, with the rate for small businesses set at 21%.The rate for both now currently stands at 19%,,externalwhile a 20% rate applies to UK oil extraction. An FSB spokeswoman said: We are pressing Jeremy Corbyn to honour the commitment he made when he met with FSB members last month, for no increases to corporation tax for small businesses under a future Labour government.

"Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, campaigning in Kingston and Surbiton The 2015 election result was a bit of a surprise. Pollsters got it wrong - and so did the media. Had we paid closer attention to where the Conservative Party was choosing to campaign, we might have spotted a gap between polling forecasts and Tory ambitions. We might have noticed David Cameron was fighting in the sort of seats that implied he thought a victory was coming. This time, we hope to avoid that sort of mistake by paying closer attention to the campaigns.

Sorry, your browser cannot display this map To help you understand this pattern, below is a chart explaining the significance of where these two have been. Each dot represents a seat where the Tories and Labour are head-to-head. The further left you go, the more Labour won by in the 2015 election. On the right, we have seats where the Conservatives did best. The UKIP vote is on the vertical axis: higher up means more UKIP votes. On top of that, there are markers to show the seats Mrs May and Mr Corbyn have been to. UKIP voters have recently been drifting to the Conservative Party. To reflect that, we've drawn a dotted line into the Labour side of the graph: all the seats above that line are places where the Labour margin of victory is smaller than the local UKIP vote share. Theresa May has so far been visiting seats with a considerable Labour majority but where UKIP also did well in the 2015 elections See how Mrs May is visiting seats which have some very big Labour majorities - look atLeeds East. But she is targeting Labour seats with big UKIP voter populations, where hoovering up the UKIP vote can do much of the work of taking the seat off Labour. InDudley North, UKIP votes would be enough to take the seat on their own. See also how Mrs May is largely not visiting the same sorts of places as Mr Corbyn. She is fighting in places which imply she wants a three-digit majority. The Labour Party either regards the ""front line"" as being nowhere near so gloomy for them or they are choosing not to deploy Mr Corbyn into their front line. If Labour were winning inHarlow, where Mr Corbyn went to campaign, it would probably be winning a majority. What, then of the other leaders? Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron has been clocking up the miles. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map The Lib Dems' strong pro-EU stance now distinguishes them from other UK-wide parties. So far, Mr Farron has only been to one seat that, according to academic estimates, voted Leave in the EU referendum - the Lib Dem-heldCarshalton & Wallington. And 14 of the 20 places he's visited had Remain votes in excess of 60%. The map shows he's hoping to take seats from both Labour and the SNP. The really big questions about the Lib Dems' future, however, are in their fight with the Tories. Both Theresa May and Tim Farron have visited the marginal seat of Lewes in the early stage of this election campaign In the Tory-Labour battleground, Mrs May and Mr Corbyn seemed to be fighting different elections. In the Tory-Lib Dem fight, both parties seem to think the election is going to be largely about Lib Dems taking seats back from the Tories. Both went to marginalLewes, for example. Mr Farron has paid a visit toOxford West & Abingdon, for example, and Mrs May has been to shore up support inSt Austell & Newquay. Both are current Tory seats taken from the Lib Dems. But the Lib Dems' meagre resources will be spread thin at this election. It is not a by-election. The Tories are also polling well - and just look at the three seats above the dotted line. Those three seats - Norfolk North,Carshalton & Wallingtonand Southport - could all be taken by the Tories if they can win over UKIP voters. And the Tories have already started advertising in the Southport local press.

"This video can not be played General election 2017: Sophie Walker on WEP party policies A policy of offering free childcare would get the economy moving for the benefit of all, the leader of the Women's Equality Party has said. Speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics programme, Sophie Walker said her party would prioritise investment in the ""social infrastructure"" of the UK. She said free childcare would transform lives, increase the tax base and mean fewer people on out-of-work benefits. The party is fielding seven candidates in the general election. Ms Walker told the programme the party was offering voters a ""better option"" than other parties, with candidates from diverse backgrounds bringing ""new and fresh"" voices. General election 2017: Policy pledge tracker Who is the most searched-for party leader? Labour's Â£20bn tax plan to fund schools She said policies designed to work for women would result in a political system that worked better for everyone. Investing in free childcare in the same way previous governments had invested in physical infrastructure, for example, would ""have a positive knock-on for everyone in a very, very positive way"". She added that women in the UK still did not have the same options as men, with men still outnumbering women in Parliament, the continued existence of a pay gap between men and women and women suffering disproportionately from austerity measures.

"A distinguished group of former military top brass haswritten an open letter to the prime ministerwarning that Britain's security is at risk unless the armed forces are properly funded. The letter reflects concern right across the ranks. The list includes not just the ""old and the bold"" - retired admirals, generals and air marshals - but former colonels, corporals and academics, too. The reality is that defence is not always top of the list of voters' concerns at an election. These are some of the questions behind the letter: There's always the danger of crying wolf. But few would disagree that the world is dangerous. The letter cites risks from all over the globe - whether from hostile states or extremist groups. Ministers have long argued that Britain's armed forces are the envy of the world and that even outside the European Union they'll play an important role. Some have even suggested that defence and security could be the UK's trump card in the difficult negotiations. The implication being that Europe's own security would suffer if they turned their back on Britain. Those who've signed this letter are not so sure. Brexit has already made the pound weaker. The letter says its fall ""threatens the purchase of meaningful numbers of jets"" for the Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers. Almost $30bn (Â£22bn) worth of foreign military purchases planned by the MOD are exposed to currency fluctuations. That said, Britain is not leaving Nato - and it remains the cornerstone of European defence. The Nato alliance has set a target for its members to spend 2% of their national income, or GDP, on defence. Britain currently meets and is committed to that goal. In fact,Britain is one of the few Nato members to spend at least 2% on defence, according to the alliance's own figures. But MPs on the Commons Defence Committee say it'sbeen reached by ""creative accounting"",external. Those who've signed the letter put it more bluntly. They say it's a deception. In 2015, the government started adding several items of expenditure not previously included, such as military and civil service pensions, contributions to UN peacekeeping missions as well as much of the MOD's Â£1.4bn income. In the words of the letter ""most analysts now agree core defence expenditure for hard military power is well below 2%."" However, the calculations are entirely in accordance with Nato's own rules. It is true that defence spending rose this year. But it follows years of cuts. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon says the lean years are behind us. He says the MOD is spending Â£178bnon new equipment - including new jets, warships, aircraft carriers and armoured vehicles. Though that money is being spent over the next 10 years and also includes the cost of renewing Britain's Trident weapons system. The Treasury used to help foot that bill. A number of recent reports also question whether the MOD's equipment programme has been fully funded. Earlier this year, the government spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, noted that billions of pounds of efficiencieshad not yet been identified,external. While those who've signed the letter praise the government's2015 Defence and Security Review,externalas setting ""the right path for our long term security"", they say it has not been fully funded. They cite another report by MPs on the Public Accounts Committee who said ""the affordability of the Equipment Plan is at greater risk than at any time since its inception"". Policy tracker: What the parties have promised Election questions, answered Britain's armed forces are now at their smallest since the Napoleonic wars. The size of the army alone has been cut from more than 100,000 to just 82,000. Even then, the army is struggling with recruitment and is still below its fully trained strength. The government would argue that, though smaller, the armed forces are now more capable. Investment has been made in new equipment from body armour to drones. But there are still significant gaps. For example, Royal Navy warships are no longer fitted with any anti-ship missiles. The Navy can't afford them. Some capabilities have been ""hollowed out"". While the Royal Navy will soon have two new aircraft carriers, it's still not clear how many jets the MOD will be able to afford. Or how many new warships will be built to protect them. Those who've signed the letter warn that the armed forces are ""having to seek further very damaging savings in manpower support and training"". The seats where parties are choosing to stand aside Where Britain's parties stand on Brexit The last coalition government accused Labour of leaving a Â£34bn black hole in the MOD's budget. It was the reason why the 2010 Defence Review resulted in such savage cuts. However, during his time as defence secretary, Philip Hammond claimed to have balanced the books. Under Sir Michael Fallon, though, the accounts are under significant pressure. The recentreport by the National Audit Officesaid there's now a real risk of a return to the ""previous practice where affordability could only be maintained by delaying or reducing the cost of projects"". It's probably too early to say whether there's now a new black hole in the MODs accounts. But some estimate a gap of at least Â£10bn and growing. This is by no means the first time that former senior military officers have warned of a crisis in defence. But it's still not clear whether those concerns are shared by the voters, and whether defence features much in the general election.

"Most manifestos are not out yet - so, while we wait, here's a rundown of significant policy commitments made so far during the election campaign. It will be updated as new pledges are made. TheLib Demmanifesto will include acommitment to another EU referendumon the final Brexit deal, in which the party would campaign for Remain. Tim Farron has said campaigning against ""hard"" Brexit will be ""front and centre"" of the party's election campaign. The party says the UK should remain in the single market and a vote should take place on the ""final deal"" between the UK and the European Union. Labour'sshadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer hasruled out a second referendum, but said there would have to be transitional arrangements at the end of the two-year Article 50 process. He said Labour would prioritise trade with the EU; it might stay in the customs union; it would give EU citizens a unilateral guarantee that they could stay on in Britain, and replace the government's proposed Great Repeal Bill - which would scrap the 1972 European Communities Act and incorporate many existing EU laws applying to the UK into domestic law - with an EU Rights and Protections Bill. Conservativeleader Theresa May has said theUK ""cannot possibly"" remain part of the single marketas it would mean ""not leaving the EU at all"". She also says the UK must seek a new customs agreement as its current membership of the customs union prevents it from striking trade deals around the world. She says voters need to give a strong message that they back her to boost her UK's negotiating position in the talks with the rest of the EU. SNPleader Nicola Sturgeon has been pushing for Scotland - which voted to remain in the EU - to have a special status after Brexit, including remaining in the single market. She has called for asecond independence referendumbefore the Brexit package has been finalised. TheGreen Partywould offera second referendumon the details of any Brexit deal, with 16 and 17-year-olds given a vote. Read more: Where the parties stand on Brexit Labourhas pledgednot to raise income tax for those earning less than Â£80,000 a yearas part of an election ""personal tax guarantee"" for 95% of taxpayers - the top 5% of earners would pay more to fund public services. Recent cuts to capital gains tax would be reversed. VAT would not rise. The party plans to create one million new jobs by pumping Â£250bn directly into the economy over ten years. Another Â£100bn would be spent to set up a publicly-owned national investment bank, which would be expected to raise another Â£150bn. Banks would be required in law to keep high street branches open. Any company bidding for a public sector contract would be required to pay its own suppliers within 30 days, and fines might be introduced for private firms who persistently pay late. TheConservativeshaveruled out a VAT rise. Theresa May has also said she has ""no plans"" to raise other taxes after the election, but has so far not repeated a 2015 pledge that also ruled out rises in income tax and National Insurance. There are plans to press ahead with increases to the effective Inheritance Tax threshold for married couples and civil partners to Â£1m, with a new transferable main residence allowance of Â£175,000 per person. This will be paid for by reducing the tax relief on pension contributions for people earning more than Â£150,000. TheLib Demspledge to put 1p on income tax to pay for increased health spending.  The money raised would primarily be invested in social care which will get Â£2bn a year, and care outside of hospital, mental health and public health. The married couples tax allowance abolished. TheGreen Partyis expected to unveil plans to raise income tax for the better off, and changes to inheritance tax. Scotland has powers to set its own rate of income tax. However,SNPfirst minister Nicola Sturgeon hasdismissed the idea of raising the top rate of income taxfor those earning more than Â£150,000 from 45% to 50%, as has been proposed by Scottish Labour. Labourhas pledged to raise corporation tax for larger businesses from its present rate of 19% to 26% by the end of the next parliament. Smaller firms with profits below Â£300,000 a year will see more modest rises - up to 21% by 2020-21. The party says itwould raise billions of pounds for public services with a new taxon financial transactions - known as a ""Robin Hood"" tax. It has also warned BAE Systems it could lose future contracts under Labour unless its boss took a Â£7m pay cut. Analysis: The problem with corporation tax TheLib Demswould raise corporation tax to 20%. TheGreen Partyis expected to unveil plans to raise corporation tax for big businesses. Jeremy Corbyn has said""all aspects"" of defence would be reviewedifLabourwon power. Military action would only be taken as a last resort. The UK would pursue anindependent foreign policy, and would not ""hand hold"" US president Donald Trump. Corbyn would appoint a minister for peace. TheLib Demswould""maintain a credible nuclear deterrent"", but Tim Farron has advocated replacing the current system of continuous-at-sea deterrence with more irregular patrolling patterns. The party would givegraduates in technical and engineering subjects Â£10,000 to join the armed forces, under plans to tackle recruitment problems. It also pledged to keep defence spending at the Nato benchmark of 2% of national income. There is no indication that theConservativesare about to abandon their commitment to go ahead with building replacements for the UK's Vanguard fleet of four submarines carrying Trident nuclear missiles. TheConservativeswill once again aim tocut net migration to the ""tens of thousands""in their election manifesto. The target, set by David Cameron in 2010, has so far not been met. Laboursays it accepts that the principle of the free movement of people - which EU leaders say goes hand-in-hand with single market membership - would have to end after Brexit but that new immigration controls should not be the ""overarching priority"" as the UK leaves. For theLib Dems, Tim Farron has said fixed migration target hurt UK businesses, hospitals and universities. UKIPsay they wouldcut net migration levels to zerowithin five years by almost halving immigration into the UK. They want to align the number of people coming to the UK with those leaving. Unskilled and low-skilled labour would be banned for five years while skilled workers and students would need visas. Laboursays it willspend an extra Â£37bn on the NHS in Englandover the next five years if it wins power. This would include Â£10bn on upgrading IT systems and repairing buildings, would be funded by tax increases and capital borrowing. The party also plans toban adverts for junk food and sweetsfrom all TV shows broadcast before 9pm as part of a planned child health bill to tackle childhood obesity. The aim is to halve the number of overweight youngsters within 10 years, and cut the Â£6bn annual cost to the NHS of obesity. Public health budgets would be ring-fenced to allow councils to invest in leisure activities and health awareness campaigns.A planned programme of hospital services closures would be suspendedacross England,the current 1% cap on pay rises for NHS workers would be scrapped, tuition free for student nurses  and midwives would be protected, and safe NHS staffing levels enshrined in law.Car parking charges at NHS England hospitals would be scrappedby raising insurance tax on private healthcare to 20%. TheConservatives'childhood obesity plan announced last August,externalset out the action local communities, the food industry, schools and the NHS should be taking over the next 10 years.The 1983 Mental Health Act would be replacedwith new laws tackling ""unnecessary detention"" in England and Wales, and 10,000 more NHS mental health staff recruited in England by 2020. TheLib Demssupport the introduction of aregulated cannabis market in the UK, arguing legalising and regulating cannabis delivers significant benefits to public health and takes pressure off the criminal justice system. They would ensure access to HIV prevention drug Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) on the NHS for people in high-risk groups. TheGreen Partywould remove the involvement of the private sector in the health service, and increase spending. It would match mental health spending to the amount spent on physical health. TheWomen's Equality Partywould introduce a right to paid leave for carers. Labourwouldspend Â£4.8bn a year to keep up with rising costs and Â£335m so no school loses from a funding overhaul, to be paid for by corporation tax rises. There are also plans toextend free school mealsto all primary school pupils in England, proposing that the cost would be covered by introducing VAT on private school fees.Scrapped Education Maintenance Allowance grants would be reinstated. These were means-tested payments of between Â£10 and Â£30 per week intended to encourage 16- to 18-year-olds to stay in sixth forms and further education colleges. Labour would also boost adult education, making some free courses available, and fund an ""arts pupil premium"" for primary schools. It is believed the party's manifesto could make the abolition of tuition fees for higher education a goal. TheLib Demswouldspend Â£7bn to protect per-pupil funding, to be partly funded by staying in the EU single market. TheGreen Partywouldscrap tuition fees, and reinstate the Education Maintenance Allowance grant. UKIPwould block the opening of new Muslim schools until, it says, more progress has been made integrating Muslims into mainstream society, and close any school where there iÂ­s evidence of IslamisÂ­t ideology being taugÂ­ht or imposed on chilÂ­dren. Theresa May has said aConservativegovernment would not scrap university tuition fees in England. TheSNPis toincrease the budget of head teachers in Scotland by Â£120mto invest in measures it believes would improve levels of literacy and numeracy. TheLib Demshave pledged toprotect the ""triple lock"" on state pensions. This guarantee, introduced by the 2010 coalition government, sees the state pension rise in line with wages, inflation or by 2.5% - whichever is highest. The party would scrap annual winter fuel payments for retired people in the 40% tax bracket to pay for it. Labourhas also pledge to retain the ""triple lock"". It would also amend company takeover rules to protect employees' pensions. Theresa May has declined opportunities to confirm theConservativeswould guarantee the ""triple lock"", so far. The Tories have pledged toincrease the powers of regulators over company pensions, including fines for employers who deliberately underfund schemes. Labourhas pledged torecruit 10,000 new police officersin England and Wales. TheLib Demsplan a move away from short sentences, which they claim are ineffective, to non-custodial alternatives. TheLib Demswould introduce a month's paid parental leave for fathers. TheWomen's Equality Partyis offeringfree childcare. TheConservativeshave ruled out a rethink on the current system for restricting child benefit for people earning over Â£50,000. TheConservativesarepromising a ""new generation"" of social housing in England, funded by Â£1.4bn already set aside for infrastructure spending. The plans involve offering ""fixed term"" council houses to be sold off after 10 to 15 years, with any proceeds reinvested in social housing. Labourwouldbuild a million new homes over five years. Half would be council and housing association homes which would be ""for rent and totally affordable"". There would also benew legal standards for rented homes, with landlords who fail to meet minimum standards facing fines of up to Â£100,000. TheLib Demswould introduce a Housing Investment Bank to generate funding for new homes. TheGreen Partywould introduce rent controls, build 500,000 socially-rented affordable homes and introduce a Landlord Licensing Scheme to ensure that every landlord must adhere to minimum standards. TheConservativeshavepromised the biggest expansion of workers' rightsunder their leadership, with pledges to keep all workers' rights currently guaranteed by EU law, put worker representation on company boards and protect pensions. There would also be a statutory right to a year's unpaid leave to care for a relative. Labourhas a20-point plan to end the ""rigged economy"" in the workplace,external, which includes giving all workers equal rights from day one, a ban on zero-hours contracts; guaranteeing trade unions a right to access workplaces, ending the public sector pay cap, raising the minimum wage, banning unpaid internships, abolishing employment tribunal fees, and increasing and extending paternity pay. It also plans tointroduce a ""real living wage"" of at least Â£10 an hour, and to introducefour new UK-wide bank holidays. TheLib Demsplan to introduce mandatory reporting on the ethnicity pay gap for organisations with 250 employees or more. The party haspledged to scrap the public sector pay cap, which limits pay rises for workers to 1% per year until 2020. Labourplans to reduce the number of people sleeping rough bydoubling the number of homes available for use by homeless people. Four thousand new flats and homes would be ring-fenced for rough sleepers in cities such as Bristol, Liverpool and Birmingham. The carer's allowance would be increased by an extra Â£10 a week - a 17% increase. The two-child limit on child benefit would be scrapped. The Winter Fuel Allowance and free bus passes for pensioners would be retained. TheLib Demswant to end rough sleeping in Britain by placing long-term homeless people straight into independent homes rather than emergency shelters, and increasing grants to local authorities to fund homelessness prevention services more effectively. The party would also reverse cuts to universal credit, and abolish the work capability assessment. The party would also introduce civil partnerships for heterosexual couples. TheConservativeswould hold a free vote on overturning the ban on fox hunting UKIPwouldban Sharia courts and the wearing of face coverings in public places, which it argues are ""a deliberate barrier to integration and in many contexts, a security risk too"". It would also introduce annual school-baseÂ­d medical checks on gÂ­irls from groups at hÂ­igh risk of sufferingÂ­ female genital mutilation. TheConservativesplana cap on gas and electricity billsfor households that pay standard variable tariffs. Analysis: How might an energy cap work? Theresa May hasruled out cuts to the UK foreign aid budgetunder theConservatives, saying the commitment to spending 0.7% of national income on aid ""will remain"". TheLib Demswould replace the first-past-the-post electoral system with a proportional voting system, extend the vote to 16 and 17-year-olds, and introduce a democratically-elected upper chamber. TheGreen Partywould alsoextend the voteto 16-year-olds. The Conservatives have ruled out lowering the voting ageat UK elections, with Theresa May saying this is one of those questions ""where you have to draw a line"". UKIPwant postal voting on demand to be scrapped, with applicants having to demonstrate a genuine need before a postal vote is granted. TheGreen Partywould ban fracking, scrap plans for all new nuclear power stations, including Hinkley Point C, create a Green Investment and Innovation Centre to help secure finance for a transition to a low-carbon economy, set up an energy system with progressive tariffs so people who use less energy pay less per unit than the big consumers, retro-fit insulation to nine million homes, and encourage local communities to create energy and municipal heating projects. TheGreen Partywould introduce a new Clean Act, an Environmental Protection Act to safeguard EU laws that protect British nature, wildlife and countryside, a diesel scrappage scheme, a strengthened Clean Air Zone network across the country, a levy on emissions-cheating car manufacturers and a bottle deposit scheme to stop 16 million plastic bottles ending up in the environment every day.

"Nicola Sturgeon, Jeremy Corbyn, Theresa May - but who came top? Internet searches are the main source of information for many voters at a general election. So what happens if you redraw the political map of the UK based around Google searches for the names of party leaders over the six months before the election was called? At first glance, it looks a lot like the actual political map, with the SNP dominant in Scotland and Conservative blue covering large swathes of England. But there are some interesting differences. Conservative leader Theresa Maytopped the search rankings in 444 constituencies, withLabour leader Jeremy Corbyncoming top in 97 constituencies. However, this is not an indication of support for Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn - we don't know the reason why people are searching for their names or whether they view the leaders positively or negatively. The prime minister tends to get more media coverage in a non-election period, so this may account for the greater levels of interest.

"Natalie-Jade bought her slimming pills online Fake drugs are now a multibillion dollar international industry, but for those who have ended up inadvertently taking them the personal consequences can be life-changing. Natalie-Jade from Manchester was 18 when she decided she wanted to lose weight. The British teenager did a quick Google search, and the pills she found promised instant results. ""The pictures [of the people] looked great,"" she says. ""Photoshop does wonders for the internet."" She didn't think too much about any side effects. ""I just thought I was a bit invincible."" But when she first took them she started sweating more and her heart was racing. She hardly ate, and had to drink lots of water. After eight weeks she stopped taking them, but the symptoms continued, and two years later she collapsed and ended up in hospital. The doctors who examined her said her heart rate was so fast it was as though she'd had 30 cups of coffee. They were surprised she hadn't had a heart attack. Now aged 26, Natalie-Jade still has occasional heart murmurs. Last year the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) shut down more than 4,000 websites selling fake medicines Natalie-Jade bought her pills online. Websites offering fake medicines such as the ones that she bought are increasing rapidly. ""A big problem is that many of the websites are hosted in jurisdictions which may not be receptive to takedown requests from a UK government agency,"" says Lynda Scammell. Ms Scammell is senior policy adviser to the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which regulates medicines in the UK. Last year the MHRA took down more than 4,000 websites selling fake medicines, up from just under 1,400 websites in 2015. In 2016, more than Â£13.6m worth of fake medicines and medical devices were seized in the annual operation organised by Interpol, including three million doses of erectile dysfunction pills and more than 300,000 doses of slimming pills. Fake medicines for life-threatening conditions, including breast cancer, bone cancer and leprosy were also taken. Ms Scammell says ""an embarrassment factor"" is contributing to the problem, with people wanting to buy slimming or erectile dysfunction drugs online instead of in person. But there is also a convenience factor. ""People get used to 'I want it, I want it now',"" she says. The end result is that fake drugs are now a multibillion dollar industry, according to the World Health Organization. Big seizures of fake drugs only scratch the surface of the illegal trade But it is not only a problem outside of official channels. Fake drugs can also make their way into legitimate supply chains. The global nature and complexity of the supply chain increases the risks of that chain being infiltrated. For example, one dose of a pneumococcal vaccine made by a large drug firm involves 1,700 people and more than 400 raw materials. From start to finish, this process takes more than two-and-a-half years. ""It is one of the most technically complex vaccines to manufacture and we produce it in many parts of the world,"" the firm says. In 2007fake medicines got into the NHS,external, with the MHRA forced to issue four emergency recall notices in a matter of days. More recently in 2011, fake versions of Roche's multibillion-dollar cancer drug Avastin made their way into the US healthcare system. The big drugs firms say they have cleaned up their act since then and that their supply chains are safe. They are reluctant to discuss the security measures they've taken for fear of revealing their methods to the very counterfeiters they are trying to prevent. But processes can include having dedicated testing laboratories using packaging and printing that make counterfeits more easy to spot. But the problem is that in some countries, manufacturers ""will buy from sources they can't trust"", says Michael Deats, World Health Organization group lead on substandard and falsified medical products. ""That's dangerous,"" he says. An outbreak of meningitis in Niger led to a proliferation of fake drugs West and Central Africa and South East Asian countries in particular have problems with criminals being able to sell fake drugs to licensed distributors, who then sell them on to places people trust, such as hospitals and pharmacies. The criminals behind the fake drugs increase the supply when there's a big demand. An outbreak of meningitis in Niger, for example, led to a shortage of vaccines, which was responded to quickly by the fakers, Mr Deats says. ""Natural disaster, war, civil unrest - it's a business opportunity,"" he says. The criminals behind many fake medicine operations can be highly organised, but are probably not what everyone thinks of as being part of ""organised crime"" - gangsters with interests in narcotics and guns, says Mr Deats. The people behind fake drugs have often built sophisticated networks He says they are more likely to be rogue businessmen, who may have worked in legitimate pharmaceutical supplies, and who know the systems. They'll often deal through offshore companies locked up in tax havens, and have the wherewithal to produce millions of doses of a particular fake medicine. ""These are very sophisticated networks,"" he says. ""You see a fair bit of investment in some cases... industrial-scale production."" It's not in their interests to be discovered, so rather than obviously poisoning people, which would attract attention, it's far better to make medicines with ineffective ingredients. ""These are tough to identify. These medicines visually look like the real thing,"" he says. ""But they just don't work."" So if someone then dies of a disease like malaria, it's assumed that they didn't respond to the treatment, rather than the treatment being fake, he says. ""It is a low-risk activity, and it's lucrative. Of course that's going to attract the wrong sort of people,"" he says. ""The risks of capture are low, and the profits are high."" But for those who have taken fake drugs, such as Natalie-Jade, the consequences can be life changing. Natalie-Jade's advice to people like her who are trying to slim is to go through the proper channels rather than trying to find a quick fix online. ""Don't believe that you're invincible,"" she says.

"This video can not be played Jason Evans father died of Aids after being infected with contaminated blood Jason Evans was just four years old when his father Jonathan died after being infected with HIV through treatment with contaminated blood. Now in what is understood to be the first case of its kind, Jason is taking legal action against the government for its role in his father's death. More than 2,000 people - mostly haemophiliacs - have died after being infected with HIV and hepatitis C through blood treatments. The victims were infected over 25 years ago, in what has been called the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. But even now new cases are still being diagnosed. BBC Panorama has spoken to Jason and some of the other families affected. Jason says patients would not have played Russian Roulette with their lives if they had known the risks ""My first memory of my dad is the last time I ever saw him,"" says Jason Evans. ""It was my birthday, I was four years old."" Six weeks later, his father Jonathan died. He was 31 years old. Jonathan Evans was one of many people to have been given a treatment known as Factor VIII. Made in huge vats from the blood plasma of thousands of people it meant if just one donation was infected with a virus, it could contaminate the whole batch. In England and Wales, the NHS relied on blood products from the US, but as the Aids crisis unfolded, in 1983 newspapers had begun asking questions about the safety of American blood products. Jason recently discovered that in late 1984 - his father had raised concerns with his doctors about Factor VIII but he says he was told ""there was nothing to worry about, this is sensationalism and not to pay attention to it. And he trusted his doctor"". ""I think the moment there was a suspicion the Aids virus may be in these products, patients should have been given the choice of whether they wanted to take that gamble and play Russian roulette with their life,"" Jason says. Jason is now suing the government for negligence and a breach of statutory duty for ""their role in this scandal that ultimately led to infecting my father with HIV for a product they knew to be dangerous"". Des Collins of Collins Solicitors, acting for Jason, says: ""This will be the first direct challenge of its type and throughout, our aim will be to support and represent families affected by this scandal."" Two inquiries have been carried out and, in 2015, the then Prime Minster David Cameron apologised to thousands of victims. The current government has resisted calls for a fresh inquiry but last year it announced more money would be available to those affected by the scandal. Janet and Colin Smith say there are still so many unanswered questions about their son's death It has been 27 years since Janet and Colin Smith's son Colin died aged seven. Colin was born with haemophilia - but it was the treatment he was given that killed him. In June 1983, eight weeks before he was first treated, a letter was sent out to haemophilia centres recommending children should be treated with NHS concentrates, not US Factor VIII. But the guidelines were not followed and Colin was given his first dose of American concentrate shortly before his first birthday. His parents still do not know why. The couple were eventually told in a hospital corridor their son had tested positive for HIV. ""They said: 'Oh, Colin's tested positive for HIV'. We didn't even know what it was really,"" Mr Smith says. The couple say they became known as ""the Aids family"" and were forced to move. ""It was written on the side of the house... just 'AIDS' in big capital letters."" ""Towards the end, we were picking up our son in sheepskin because we'd hurt him - he'd lost so much weight,"" Mrs Smith says. They want the government to be held to account. ""Who's to blame? Are they stupid or just incompetent? It's one or the other isn't it? It's somebody's fault,"" she says. The couple visit their son's grave twice a week. ""I miss him so much some days... He could have lived a normal life. Such a lovely little boy. Just so unnecessary."" Michelle says she was made to feel like a ""silly child"" by her GP after requesting a blood test In 2015, Michelle Tolley was told she had hepatitis C. In 1987, she had been given a blood transfusion after haemorrhaging when she gave birth to her first child, and again after giving birth to twins in 1991. ""I was like 'no, no, no... you're telling me I've had hepatitis C for 28 years?' Growing silently - because they call it the silent killer,"" she told Panorama. The NHS had run a campaign to encourage people who might have been given contaminated blood to get tested. ""I went along to my GP at the time to inquire, just to be told 'don't be silly, you won't have that'. It made me feel like a silly little child, that was just wasting somebody's time,"" she says. Hepatitis C gave Michelle cirrhosis of the liver - which can cause cancer. ""I get angry days - really, really angry where I feel like I'm being deprived of my life,"" she says. ""And I'm frightened I'm going to die."" Watch Panorama -Contaminated Blood: The Search for Truthon Wednesday 10 May at 21:00 BST on BBC One and afterwards on BBC iPlayer.

"The polls andrecent local election resultsmay paint a different picture, but on Facebook, Jeremy Corbyn dwarfs his political rivals. His official page has more than twice as many likes as Theresa May (860,000, compared with 360,000), and nearly 30 times as many as Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron. But the scale of Facebook operations mounted by pro-Corbyn supporters is what really stands out. They organise to hit out at the Conservatives and Tony Blair, game online opinion polls to bolster the apparent popularity of the Labour leader, and remain relentlessly positive about his chances on 8 June. As part of our mission to examine the impact of social media, the BBC Trending team will be delving inside ""Filter Bubble Britain"", looking into groups from across the political spectrum over the coming weeks. Much has been made of political news sites and blogs set up bythe pro-Corbyn movement,external, but there's also an entire eco-system of Facebook groups run by individuals - so we are kicking off our series by looking at those. Many political journalists are obsessed with Twitter, but in fact Facebook is the key organising platform for the group dubbed (often by their opponents) ""Corbynistas"" - those dedicated Labour campaigners led by the Momentum group. One of their key tools has been these groups, which share positive news stories about Corbyn and co-ordinate online campaigns. Filter Bubble Britain: General Election coverage from BBC Trending Over the course of the 2017 General Election campaign, BBC Trending will be delving inside ""filter bubbles"" - tight online communities created by algorithms and the way we all use social media. If you'd like to help report on online communities, email theBBC Trending team,externalto express interest. We have a number of tools which will allow us to examine your own ""filter bubble"" on social media - but there's no commitment, all information will be anonymised, and we'll keep all of your personal information private. Read more:What pro-Tory Facebook really wants They are sizeable communities - and there are many of them. One of the largest groups, ""We support Jeremy Corbyn,external"", has nearly 40,000 members, and several others boast more than 10,000. In total, there are hundreds of thousands of likes for these pages. The ""We support"" group's stated purpose is ""to share ideas and fight back against media lies"" - and a feeling that the mainstream media is stacked against their leader is a common perception within these groups. It is difficult to keep up with the sheer number of posts in the pro-Corbyn communities, as heavily-engaged members provide a minute-by-minute commentary on British politics. Many of the posts attempt to channel members towards online polls and Facebook surveys. They encourage Corbynistas to vote en masse to inflate the perceived popularity of their leader. This tactic even extends to relatively obscure corners of Facebook. For example, when the community page ofNew Newbury and Thatcham Berkshire,externalasked who locals would like as prime minister, ""We support Jeremy Corbyn"" mobilised behind the Labour leader. Less than three hours after the poll had been launched, Corbyn hadreceived,external13,000 votes, compared with 4,000 for May and 109 for Farron. The New Newbury and Thatcham Facebook page has only about 5,000 members. In these cliques, the Conservative Party is the primary enemy. One of the most popular recent posts in ""We support Jeremy Corbyn"" highlighted a joke by Andy Hamilton, who implied that Theresa May suffers from dementia on an episode of Have I Got News For You. One of the most liked comments on the post said the prime minister ""should stop acting weird"". BBC Trending spoke to Caroline Tipler, who founded the group ""Jeremy Corbyn leads us to 2017 victory,external"", which has more than 11,000 members (and in the wake of the snap election surprise announcement was swiftly renamed from ""Jeremy Corbyn leads us to 2020 victory""). Tipler said she established the group to allow Corbyn supporters to connect with each other, to provide information on Corbyn's policies and to counter what she calls the ""appalling, destructive"" actions of ""plotters"" who want to remove Corbyn as Labour leader. Tipler feels that Corbyn has reinvigorated politics, and denies the main criticism of these groups - that they have turned into self-perpetuating echo chambers. ""Members seek to share values and to have their values of honesty and decency reinforced and placed into political life,"" she says. ""Debate and a broad church approach is encouraged. No one is 'right' or 'more right', we are all learning."" Another main theme of the groups is that Corbyn's political allies must be defended against attacks. Following interviews from Diane Abbott, duringwhich she made some widely covered mathematical slip-ups, one Jeremy Corbyn fandefended,externalthe shadow Home Secretary with heavy sarcasm: ""Shock, horror! Diane Abbott doesn't have a chip in her brain relaying the live election results, which are actually coming in WHILST she's being interviewed!"" In these groups, many of the articles posted originate from a crop of pro-Corbyn political bloggers and writers, perhaps the biggest of which is a popular political blog calledThe Canary,external. These blogs are media success stories in their own right. They often publish pieces that spread more widely than mainstream media reports and, in the case of The Canary,pay writers in part based on their click numbers,external. Kerry-Anne Mendoza, editor of The Canary, is unsurprisingly a big supporter of the active pro-Corbyn Facebook wave. ""I love that the pro-Corbyn groups are out there,"" she told BBC Trending. ""They will be able to amplify Corbyn's messages all the way up to the election."" In the early weeks of the election campaign, The Canary has been one of the most popular news sources on Facebook, at times drawing in numbers comparable to the BBC and national newspapers to some of its stories. But are the people in these groups confident that their man can win the general election? Most are, but some still question why the Labour Party is not performing better, and put the blame on party rebels: Others reserve criticism for Tony Blair, who is frequently accused on these groups of being a Conservative sympathiser. There's also a mischievous approach to news circulating in some of these groups. Here's an example: in the wake of the local council elections on 6 May, several links were posted to an Independent article from the 2016 local elections. The headline was: ""Not that you'd know it, but the Tories lost far more seats in the election than Labour"".  The article was 100% correct - but it referred to an election a year ago. However, on many of the posts there was no acknowledgement of those inconvenient facts. That said, it was illustrated with a picture of the former Conservative leader David Cameron, which may have been a giveaway to those who looked carefully: Labour's losses in the most recent local elections - 382 seats and the control of seven councils - has not quelled the expectations of many Corbynistas: Blog by Sam Bright You can follow BBC Trending on Twitter@BBCtrending,external, and find us onFacebook,external.

"The Labour party has said it will raise corporation tax to spend Â£4.8bn on improving education It sounds like a simple equation. Announce more money for a public policy initiative and say you will pay for it with an increase in taxes. On Wednesdaythe Labour Party said that it plans to spend more than Â£5bn improving education in England. To fund the initiative, the party also announced the details of its proposals to increase corporation tax from its present rate of 19% to 26% by 2020-21. A move described by Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies as one of the most significant tax increases for 30 years. Smaller firms with profits below Â£300,000 a year will see more modest rises - up to 21% by 2020-21. Labour, using figures from the government's official economic watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, says the increases in corporation tax will raise Â£20bn by 2022. The Liberal Democrats have also pledged more money for education (Â£7bn) paid for by a slightly lower increase in the business tax and the scrapping of tax allowances for married couples. As both Labour and the Liberal Democrats will know, income from corporation tax (a tax on profits made by firms), is notoriously difficult to forecast. In 2010, corporation tax raised just over Â£43bn in revenue for the government. Since then it has been cut from 28% (interestingly, above the level announced today by Labour) to 19%. One would suppose that would reduce the tax take for the government. Not quite. Former chancellor George Osborne cut the headline rate of corporation tax In 2016, corporation tax raised Â£49.7bn, an increase of Â£6.7bn. That is due to a number of interrelated issues. First, economic growth has returned, leading to higher profits for firms. Higher profits mean higher levels of tax receipts. Now, supporters of corporation tax cuts argue that the very act of reducing the rate increases firms' propensity to invest and increases confidence that Britain is a ""business friendly"" economy. Reducing business taxes ultimately creates wealth, they argue. Second, although George Osborne reduced the headline rate (some joke it is called that for a reason as cutting it produces some nice headlines), he also announced a series of other, more Delphic, measures that actually increased business taxes. The amount of tax that can be offset against capital investment in new buildings and machinery (called capital allowances) has been reduced. Taxes on foreign income has also been reformed and rules over the shifting of profits between different tax jurisdictions have been tightened under the ""base erosion"" changes agreed with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Alongside these changes, the government has also introduced the banking levy, an extra tax on the City which brought in Â£1.6bn in 2012 - a figure that rose to just under Â£3bn by 2016. Many businesses would argue that, yes, the corporation tax cut is welcome but business taxes are already bringing in significantly more money. And increasing the rate to 26% will simply reduce Britain's attractiveness to business investors and lose Britain vital places in the competitiveness league tables - given that the headline rate is low by G7 standards but other business taxes are relatively high. Further, any change would come just at the time that Brexit has left a number of firms with their fingers hovering over the ""relocate"" button. The new president of France, Emmanuel Macron, says he wants to see the French corporation tax rate cut to 25% from the present 33.3%. As Mr Johnson said on the Today programme: ""The risk is, that while this [Labour plan] would raise knocking on for Â£20bn in the short run, it is probably going to raise rather less than that in the long run as companies invest less and take other opportunities to reduce the amount of tax that they pay. ""So, the long run behavioural result of this tax would result in revenues being less than the immediate headline increase."" Corporation tax is what is known as ""dynamic"" - that is, changes to it result in rapid changes in behaviour as sophisticated firms manage their balance sheet in such a way as to minimise any effects and support profits and returns to shareholders (which of course, don't forget, include our pension funds). This leads to substantial levels of forecast error. In 2013, the OBR forecast that corporation tax receipts for 2016-17 would fall to Â£38.2bn. In fact, receipts were 30% higher. That suggests that Labour and the Liberal Democrats' plans could raise more than the forecast Â£20bn. Or - given the possible economic effect on business investment - far less. That is the problem with pledges on tax - they are predicated on a forecast about an uncertain future. That does not mean that political parties should avoid making policy funding announcements based on best revenue estimates by official bodies. But it does mean that voters should be aware - forecasts can be wrong.

"This video can not be played Philip May: ""I take the bins out"" Politicians always want to ""connect"" with hard-to-reach voters. So Theresa May took to the One Show sofa to catch the tea-time TV audience alongside her husband Philip. She looked apprehensive, but she needn't have worried. Mr May was as careful to avoid gaffes as Mrs May always is. He spent most of the interview turned towards her, nodding vigorously, and murmuring ""mmh"" in loyal agreement. It's the same at home, he claims. How much do the political parties know about you? What have the parties pledged so far during the campaign? General election: What you need to know Asked whether she was a tough negotiator, he said: ""Well, there's give and take in every marriage. ""I get to decide when I take the bins out. Not if I take them out."" His wife jumped in. ""There's boy jobs and girls jobs, you see,"" she clarifies. ""I definitely do the bins,"" Mr May confirmed, before adding: ""I do the traditional boy jobs, by and large."" Apart, of course, from what's traditionally been a ""boy job"" - being prime minister. He revealed that his wife had first harboured an interest in being PM when she was in the Shadow Cabinet, which she joined in 1999. This video can not be played Political partners - a potted history Although he'd spoken at the Conservative Party conference in his youth, it was Theresa who first embarked on the political career, while he worked in finance. Mrs May revealed one difficult moment for the couple, who don't have children, when she was looking for a constituency - and a newspaper predicted she'd have trouble being selected as a Conservative candidate because of her new baby. She said her mother-in-law had rung up hoping there was happy news. ""So she was disappointed,"" said Mrs May. There were questions about the walking holidays, her childhood at the vicarage, and meeting for the first time. They were introduced at an Oxford University student disco by a mutual friend, Benazir Bhutto, the future prime minister of Pakistan. On first impressions: ""I thought 'what a lovely girl' - it was love at first sight,"" according to Philip. ""Likewise,"" Theresa reassured him. But there were few genuine revelations about the couple's private side. Mrs May certainly looked rather relieved whenever the conversation veered towards politics. Asked about the downside to being married to the prime minister, Mr May insisted it was a privilege, and would go no further than saying: ""If you're the kind of man who expects his tea to be on the table at six o'clock every evening, you could be a disappointed man."" But he added gallantly that she was a very good cook. And then, of course, there was a question about her love of fashion, and in particular shoes - with a close-up of her black loafers with diamante-studded heels. Mrs May confirmed that she did, indeed, like buying shoes.  But she promised there was a serious side to it - and recounted meeting a young woman in the lift in the House of Commons. After admiring each other's shoes, the woman revealed that it was Mrs May's interest in shoes that had turned her on to politics.  A future prime minister in the making, surely. But fashion isn't just for women. ""And what's your shoe-equivalent?"" Mr May was asked. Looking hunted, he replied... ""I quite like ties.""

"Nicola Sturgeon, Jeremy Corbyn, Theresa May - but who came top? Internet searches are the main source of information for many voters at a general election. So what happens if you redraw the political map of the UK based around Google searches for the names of party leaders over the six months before the election was called? At first glance, it looks a lot like the actual political map, with the SNP dominant in Scotland and Conservative blue covering large swathes of England. But there are some interesting differences. Conservative leader Theresa Maytopped the search rankings in 444 constituencies, withLabour leader Jeremy Corbyncoming top in 97 constituencies. However, this is not an indication of support for Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn - we don't know the reason why people are searching for their names or whether they view the leaders positively or negatively. The prime minister tends to get more media coverage in a non-election period, so this may account for the greater levels of interest. She was the most searched-for party leader in most of Labour-held inner London, while Mr Corbyn topped the rankings in quite a few Conservative strongholds in the south of England. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map SNP leader Nicola Sturgeoncame top in 75 constituencies - many of them in England, from Labour-held Workington, in Cumbria, to Conservative strongholds like Folkestone and Hythe and Dorset South, on the south coast. Paul Nuttall- who replaced Nigel Farage as UKIP leader in October last year - topped the rankings in 17 constituencies, generating interest in Wales and Northern England in particular. Lib Dem leader Tim Farroncame top in eight constituencies - a fairly random selection geographically, none of which are currently held by the party or on their likely target list. Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucastopped the rankings in just one constituency - Newbury, in Berkshire, where her party is involved in anti-fracking campaigns. Voters in her own Brighton Pavilion seat searched for Theresa May the most, according to the data. In Northern Ireland searches were analysed for the DUP, Sinn Fein, SDLP and the UUP, of themDUP leader Arlene Fosterhad the most interest in eight seats. Google Trends collected search results for 1,876 cities, and then allocated those locations to the relevant constituencies.

"Who can forget Scooch, who flew the flag for the UK 10 years ago? Break out the sequins and pop the champagne - it's Eurovision time again. It's that time of year when delegations from across Europe - and further afield - come together to find out which country will be crowned the winner of the annual song contest-cum-live TV spectacle. This year marks the 62nd edition of the international gathering that, over the years, has brought us such gems as Waterloo by Abba, Making Your Mind Up by Bucks Fizz and Flying the Flag by Scooch. For some it's a deluge of gaudiness, kitsch and music to make your ears bleed. To many aficionados, though, it's a yearly delight that can be relied upon to deliver emotion, tension and laughter in bucketloads. Here's what you need to know ahead of this year's event. When Eurovision started in the Swiss resort of Lugano back in 1956, only seven countries took part. Each country submitted two songs each, with host country Switzerland eventually winning. But over the years there has been a steady rise in participating countries - so steady in fact that the contest is now preceded by two semi-finals. The first semitook place on Tuesday, with the second following on Thursday. The aim is to whittle the semi-finalists - 36 this year - down to a more manageable 20. Those 20 progress to the final on Saturday, when they will be joined by the so-called ""big five"" - France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK - and host nation Ukraine. The ""big five"" get an automatic pass to the final as they pay the most towards keeping the contest going. Once the final starts it's a level playing field, with all 26 acts at the mercy of the juries and viewers who cast their votes on the night. The winning act is awarded a glass trophy in the shape of a microphone, and their country is given the right to host the following year's contest. Before last year, each competing country's jury and public votes were combined and announced at the same time. But now the votes are split, with each country's jury vote cast first, and votes from viewers in all countries combined and announced at the end. Jamala pulled off a shock last year by winning for Ukraine This can result in dramatic reversals - as was shown at last year's contest, when Ukraine's entry leapfrogged Australia's at the last minute to claim the top spot. Lulu represented the UK the year the contest ended in a four-way tie There have been 61 contests to date, but 64 winners. That's because the 1969 contest resulted in a four-way split, with France, Spain, the Netherlands and the UK all ending up with the same points tally. The so-called voting ""scandal"" led to a change in the rules that ensured there would always be just the one overall winner in future. Ireland lead the way on the all-time leader board, having won the contest seven times between 1970 and 1996. Sweden has won six times, while the UK has five victories under its belt along with France and Luxembourg. Katrina and the Waves were the last act to earn the UK the coveted top spot The UK's last triumph came in Dublin 20 years ago, when Katrina and the Waves stormed to victory with Love Shine a Light. Since then we've had distinctly mixed fortunes, with three last-place finishes and a dreaded ""nul points"" in 2003. Recent attempts to better our lot by enlisting the likes ofBlueandEngelbert Humperdinckhave had little impact on how we've performed. Indeed, it's been eight years since we even finished inside the top 10. This year it will beLucie Joneswho'll be representing us withNever Give Up on You, a tender ballad co-written by the Danish singer-songwriter who won the contest in 2013. Jones, 26, has dismissed suggestions she might suffer as a consequence of Britain's decision to leave the EU, insisting she is ""not worried,external"" about a potential Brexit backlash. Australia through to Eurovision final Will Russia's absence spoil Eurovision party in Ukraine? Paul Weller: I want to help the UK win Eurovision The decision to give Australiaa wild card entry in 2015was a surprise to many, not least those in possession of an atlas. Yet it was considered a successful enough experiment for the Land Down Under to compete for real in 2016 - and they'll be back again this year to try their luck once more. Isaiah is a former winner of the Australian X Factor and has 11 siblings Seventeen-year-old Isaiah Firebrace, the first indigenous male to represent Australia at Eurovision, will be hoping he can go all the way with his ballad Don't Come Easy. The appearance of Justin Timberlake at last year's eventled to speculation,externalthe United States might also be invited to participate at future Eurovisions. Timberlake performed Can't Stop the Feeling in Stockholm last year This year sees the contest make a return visit to the Ukrainian capital Kiev, 12 years since it was first held there in 2005. This year's contest comes from Kiev'sInternational Exhibition Centre,external, a giant complex with capacity for up to 11,000 spectators. Julia Samoilova was barred from the contest due to her visiting Crimea in 2015 The run-up to the contest has been dominated by adiplomatic rowbetween Ukraine and Russia over the Russian entrant, 27-year-old Julia Samoilova. Ukraine refused to allow her to perform at the contest because she has visited Crimea, the peninsula seized by Russia in 2014. Last month Russian broadcaster Channel One announced itwould not be broadcastingthis year's event, removing any chance of Russia taking part. Sir Terry Wogan was a Eurovision fixture for many years Thanks in part to the mocking asides thatSir Terry Wogan,externalused to issue from his commentary booth, Eurovision-bashing has become a national pastime for us Brits. Yet the competition is taken extremely seriously by some of our neighbours  on the Continent, many of whom see competing in the contest as a badge of national pride. Eurovision's legion of die-hard fans take it very seriously too, travelling to the event in numbers to support their country's act and enjoy the party atmosphere. And it can also launch careers, as Michael Flatley discovered when hetook to the stage with Riverdance,externalduring the 1994 contest in Dublin. The first semi-final will be shown on BBC Four on Tuesday at 20:00 BST. You can also follow it onlineon a special BBC live page. The second semi on Thursday is on the same time and place - andthere's a live page for that too.

"Is the selfie culture coming into serious academic research? Or is it a valid way of using first-hand experience? There are strong opinions about an increasingly popular international research method which has been dubbed ""mesearch"". ""Mesearch"", which is properly known as autoethnography, is when a researcher uses their personal experiences to tackle academic questions. Critics dismiss it as ""unscientific"", ""academic narcissism"" and ""diary-writing for the over-educated"". They say it is a very modern phenomenon - a high-brow version of taking selfies, watching reality television and posting thoughts into the echo chambers of social media. But it is being used in many fields like sociology, education and psychology, published by mainstream journals, and taught in universities in the United States. The term autoethnography dates back to the 1970s, and an early study described a researcher's ""unsuccessful self-treatment of a case of writer's block"". The fact the article was published suggests he managed to overcome the problem in the end. While most qualitative researchers base their theories on in-depth interviews with a small number of people, an autoethnographer only uses his or her own experiences and feelings to understand a wider subject. Autoethnographic articles are often written in the form of a story, rather than precise academic language. There are claims that ""mesearch"" gives perspectives missing from conventional research This is a break from the traditional scientific method which requires academics to be objective and detached from their subject, and base their theories on data and experiments that can be tested, verified and reproduced. So it is not surprising that many academics are suspicious - even the name ""mesearch"" is used to undermine the method. Vincent F Hendricks, professor of formal philosophy at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, says autoethnography fails to meet the standard criteria for science. He says autoethnographic studies cannot claim to have ""falsifiability, testability, representability, extrapolation, prediction, and other conditions securing reliable scientific enquiry"". Sceptical academics have taken to Twitter to expose what they regard as the most self-indulgent and unscientific examples of autoethnography. Their latest targets include a researcher using her experience of learning how to do glassblowing to understand hand-eye coordination, and an academic describing how walking in the hills helped him to develop his sense of identity. Another autoethnographer recently described how Donald Trump's presidential election victory left him unable to sleep. All three were published in peer-reviewed journals. More stories from theBBC's Global education series,externallooking at education from an international perspective, andhow to get in touch. You can join the debate at theBBC's Family & Education News Facebook page,external. Professor Carolyn Ellis of the University of South Florida, who is one of the world's leading autoethnographers, rejects the charges of ""narcissism"". ""It's narcissistic to leave out your own experience and to act all-knowing, as though you can stand apart, and that you are not subject to the same forces as those you write about,"" she says. ""It's narcissistic to think that ""we"" academics should write only about ""them"" and not subject ourselves to the same scrutiny. She says autoethnography has given a voice to people from working class, ethnic minority and indigenous backgrounds ""who would not have written otherwise in the more traditional social science prose"". Prof Ellis argues that an autoethnographic approach can give insights which would not be possible using traditional research methods. For example, she has challenged theories about ""minor bodily stigmas"" by giving an honest and personal account of why she has always disliked her own lisp. Does the idea of ""mesearch"" come out of a culture of social media and reality television? She also says training in autoethnography can make someone a better teacher. By sharing her stories with a class, she says it ""creates a positive atmosphere in the course"" which encourages students to open up about ""the issues that really concern them and they care about"". Other advocates of the method say it allows people to share experiences in greater depth and analyse their meaning. Dr Jill Bolte Taylor from Harvard University made first-hand observations about the workings of the brain and how it is rehabilitated while she recovered from a stroke. She says that watching her brain deteriorate gave her ""an understanding of the brain that academia could not teach me"" - and wrote a book about it called My Stroke of Insight. Could Sir Isaac Newton's revelation about gravity after an apple fell on his head, and Descartes' observation that ""I think, therefore I am"", be called examples of autoethnography? ""You'd have to ask them, but I'd have no problem calling these observations autoethnographic,"" says Prof Ellis. The Journal of Loss and Trauma has now published almost 100 autoethnographic studies, and its editor Prof John Harvey says the technique can be useful for the in-depth study of traumatic events. But he warns that autoethnographic studies often struggle to make the case that one person's story represents the likely experiences of a wider group. Autoethnography's rise shows no sign of stopping - with more journals publishing studies and more universities offering courses in the method. This means more work for the next generation of autoethnographers, and more work for the cynics who trawl journals for ""self-indulgent"" studies to mock on Twitter.

"No team has reached the Champions League final on more occasions than Juventus What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, so the saying goes, and it certainly appears to be the case with Juventus. Ten years ago, Juve were dragging themselves out of the second tier of Italian football following a tumultuous sequence of events that saw themdemoted from Serie A.,external Now, afterbeating Monaco 4-1on aggregate, the Old Lady will face Real Madrid in the Champions League final in Cardiff on 3 June. ""Magic Dani Alves, fantastic Juventus,"" read the headline on Italian newspaper Tuttosport. Gazzetta dello Sport, meanwhile, went with: ""Great Juve!"" The media are gushing, and who can blame them? Two Champions League finals in three years, on the cusp of winning a sixth successive Serie A title and 23 games unbeaten in Europe. Former Manchester United striker Dimitar Berbatov, speaking on BT Sport, described Juve's performance on Tuesday as a ""masterclass"". ""Attack and defence everywhere,"" he said. After a rollercoaster decade, Juve may have put together the perfectly balanced side. Didier Deschamps persuaded a number of big-name players to stay at Juventus following demotion to Serie B Just five days after lifting the World Cup trophy in 2006, Juve team-mates Gianluigi Buffon, Alessandro del Piero and Mauro Camoranesi were faced with the prospect of preparing for life in the second tier of Italian football. Juve, along with Lazio and Fiorentina, were implicated in a match-fixing scandal that resulted in the three teams being demoted to Serie B for 2006-07, though the latter two had their sentences reduced to points deductions on appeal. Juve were also given a 30-point deduction, later reduced to nine, and their hopes of an immediate return to the top flight were further hampered by the departures of several key players, including Patrick Vieira, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Fabio Cannavaro. The club's trio of World Cup winners stayed, though, and were instrumental as Juve bounced back at the first attempt - winning Serie B by six points, losing just four of their 42 league games. Didier Deschamps, a Champions League winner with Juventus in 1996, returned to coach his former club following their demotion but left two games before the end of their title-winning season after a disagreement with the club's hierarchy. This was Juventus' team on the final day of the 2005-06 Serie A season. That summer, Fabio Cannavaro and Emerson joined Real Madrid, Lilian Thuram and Gianluca Zambrotta moved to Barcelona, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Patrick Vieira moved to Inter Milan Claudio Ranieri was the man brought in to lead Juve in their first season back in Serie A, and he led them into the Champions League with a third-place finish. But the Italian was unable to build on that, with Juve knocked out of Europe by Chelsea and finishing 10 points adrift of Inter Milan in the league. Ranieri was sacked, but the next three managers - Ciro Ferrara, Alberto Zaccheroni and Luigi Delneri - made little impact in short spells in charge. Though the team appeared to be regressing, a significant appointment had been made by club owner Andrea Agnelli. He made former Sampdoria chief executive Giuseppe Marotta Juve's sporting director, and he brought about significant changes in the playing and coaching staff. Marotta oversaw the arrivals of Leonardo Bonucci and Andrea Barzagli - two players who would become key parts of Juve's near-impenetrable defence - before appointing Antonio Conte as coach in the summer of 2011. Just as he has at Chelsea, Conte implemented a gameplan founded on a three-man defence, turning Juve into a side that dominated possession and was tough to break down. The results were immediate - the club's first Scudetto in nine years in his first season followed by another two just for good measure. Antonio Conte, who signed Paul Pogba from Manchester United in 2012, led Juventus to the Serie A title in 2011-12 Also significant in Juve's revival was their move to the Juventus Stadium - built on the site of their former home the Stadio delle Alpi - during Conte's first season. Though capacity is significantly reduced - from 69,000 to 41,254 - the atmosphere in the arena has improved dramatically. ""The Delle Alpi was hugely unpopular with fans, who were stationed far away from the pitch because of a running track, and sightlines were almost universally poor,"" says European football expert Andy Brassell. ""It was rarely filled. In their last Champions League campaign at the old stadium, the Delle Alpi had an average attendance of just 12,285 in the group stage. Even the visit of Bayern Munich attracted only 16,076. The only way was to rip it up and start again."" In the six seasons since opening their new home, Juve have lost just three Serie A games there. Juventus struggled to fill their old stadium (left) but their new one (right) is regularly packed out While Conte brought back domestic glory, European success continued to elude Juve. They were beaten by Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals of the 2012-13 Champions League and failed to even get out of their group the following season. When Conte left in July 2014 to become Italy boss, he suggested he had not had the financial clout to compete with Europe's top clubs, saying: ""When you sit in a restaurant where a meal costs 100 euros, you can't think about eating with just 10 euros."" That was, perhaps, a final gift from Conte. With Juve's players determined to prove themselves to new boss Massimiliano Allegri - and perhaps show Conte was wrong - they reached the Champions League final in 2015,losing 3-1 to Barcelona. ""The change of coach gave Juventus something more, because in the first two months of the season we wanted to prove that we were still the best,"" defender Giorgio Chiellini said in March 2015. ""We want to prove to everyone and, above all, to ourselves that we are a great team."" Defeat by Barcelona prompted wholesale changes to the playing squad as Allegri looked to move them to the next level. Juve's formidable defence was largely unaltered, but more flair and bite has been added in attack. Former Roma midfielder Miralem Pjanic, for example, has proven a more-than-able replacement for Paul Pogba, who made a world-record Â£89m move to Manchester United last summer. Up front, the exciting Paulo Dybala, signed from Palermo in 2015, has drawn comparisons to Lionel Messi while ex-Napoli striker Gonzalo Higuain has scored 32 goals in 49 appearances this season. As Conte said, eating a 10 euro meal at a 100 euro restaurant is not really the done thing - and Juve paid Napoli Â£75.3m to sign Higuain last summer. But the manner of their victories over Barcelona and Monaco suggests they are now dining at the top table alongside Europe's elite.

"This video can not be played Jason Evans father died of Aids after being infected with contaminated blood Jason Evans was just four years old when his father Jonathan died after being infected with HIV through treatment with contaminated blood. Now in what is understood to be the first case of its kind, Jason is taking legal action against the government for its role in his father's death. More than 2,000 people - mostly haemophiliacs - have died after being infected with HIV and hepatitis C through blood treatments. The victims were infected over 25 years ago, in what has been called the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. But even now new cases are still being diagnosed. BBC Panorama has spoken to Jason and some of the other families affected. Jason says patients would not have played Russian Roulette with their lives if they had known the risks ""My first memory of my dad is the last time I ever saw him,"" says Jason Evans. ""It was my birthday, I was four years old."" Six weeks later, his father Jonathan died. He was 31 years old. Jonathan Evans was one of many people to have been given a treatment known as Factor VIII. Made in huge vats from the blood plasma of thousands of people it meant if just one donation was infected with a virus, it could contaminate the whole batch. In England and Wales, the NHS relied on blood products from the US, but as the Aids crisis unfolded, in 1983 newspapers had begun asking questions about the safety of American blood products. Jason recently discovered that in late 1984 - his father had raised concerns with his doctors about Factor VIII but he says he was told ""there was nothing to worry about, this is sensationalism and not to pay attention to it. And he trusted his doctor"". ""I think the moment there was a suspicion the Aids virus may be in these products, patients should have been given the choice of whether they wanted to take that gamble and play Russian roulette with their life,"" Jason says. Jason is now suing the government for negligence and a breach of statutory duty for ""their role in this scandal that ultimately led to infecting my father with HIV for a product they knew to be dangerous"". Des Collins of Collins Solicitors, acting for Jason, says: ""This will be the first direct challenge of its type and throughout, our aim will be to support and represent families affected by this scandal."" Two inquiries have been carried out and, in 2015, the then Prime Minster David Cameron apologised to thousands of victims. The current government has resisted calls for a fresh inquiry but last year it announced more money would be available to those affected by the scandal. Janet and Colin Smith say there are still so many unanswered questions about their son's death It has been 27 years since Janet and Colin Smith's son Colin died aged seven. Colin was born with haemophilia - but it was the treatment he was given that killed him. In June 1983, eight weeks before he was first treated, a letter was sent out to haemophilia centres recommending children should be treated with NHS concentrates, not US Factor VIII. But the guidelines were not followed and Colin was given his first dose of American concentrate shortly before his first birthday. His parents still do not know why. The couple were eventually told in a hospital corridor their son had tested positive for HIV. ""They said: 'Oh, Colin's tested positive for HIV'. We didn't even know what it was really,"" Mr Smith says. The couple say they became known as ""the Aids family"" and were forced to move. ""It was written on the side of the house... just 'AIDS' in big capital letters."" ""Towards the end, we were picking up our son in sheepskin because we'd hurt him - he'd lost so much weight,"" Mrs Smith says. They want the government to be held to account. ""Who's to blame? Are they stupid or just incompetent? It's one or the other isn't it? It's somebody's fault,"" she says. The couple visit their son's grave twice a week. ""I miss him so much some days... He could have lived a normal life. Such a lovely little boy. Just so unnecessary."" Michelle says she was made to feel like a ""silly child"" by her GP after requesting a blood test In 2015, Michelle Tolley was told she had hepatitis C. In 1987, she had been given a blood transfusion after haemorrhaging when she gave birth to her first child, and again after giving birth to twins in 1991. ""I was like 'no, no, no... you're telling me I've had hepatitis C for 28 years?' Growing silently - because they call it the silent killer,"" she told Panorama. The NHS had run a campaign to encourage people who might have been given contaminated blood to get tested. ""I went along to my GP at the time to inquire, just to be told 'don't be silly, you won't have that'. It made me feel like a silly little child, that was just wasting somebody's time,"" she says. Hepatitis C gave Michelle cirrhosis of the liver - which can cause cancer. ""I get angry days - really, really angry where I feel like I'm being deprived of my life,"" she says.
