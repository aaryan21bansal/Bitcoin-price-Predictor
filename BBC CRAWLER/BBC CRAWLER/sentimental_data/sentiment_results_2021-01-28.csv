"Roman Abramovich (L) and Alisher Usmanov are both involved with Premier League clubs. The UK government has been challenged by opposition MPs to impose sanctions on two billionaire oligarchs linked to English football clubs. It comes after Russia's detained opposition figure Alexei Navalny called for action to be taken against Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and Alisher Usmanov, who has ties with Everton. The government said it was ""considering all options for further action"". Mr Navalny has been detained since 17 January, after returning to Moscow for the first time since he was poisoned last year. The UK has urged Russia to release him. The dissident has blamed the nerve agent attack that almost killed him on Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin denies involvement. Navalny slams 'illegal' Russian case against him 'Thousands detained' at Navalny protests in Russia Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic An associate of Mr Navalny's has released a list of eight individuals drawn up by the opposition leader whom he says should face sanctions in order to put pressure on President Putin. Mr Abramovich, who bought Chelsea in 2003, and former Arsenal shareholder Mr Usmanov, who owns a company that sponsors Everton, and who has links with the club's majority shareholder, were both included. They were described in the list as being among ""key enablers and beneficiaries of Russian kleptocracy, with significant ties/assets in the West"". During an emergency debate in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge said: ""The best way we can show our support for Alexei Navalny is not by words but by actions."" ""Navalny himself has said he wants the international community to use sanctions against complicit Russian kleptocrats who live outside Russia. ""He has named Abramovich and Usmanov, both of whom have significant wealth, property and links to English football clubs. ""But on Facebook Navalny has said that the sanctions haven't worked, because the West has refrained from sanctioning the people with the money."" Asked to comment, a spokesman for Mr Abramovich said there was ""no foundation"" to Mr Navalny's claims. Alexei Navalny was arrested earlier this month, when he flew back to Moscow from Berlin. Foreign Office Minister Wendy Morton said: ""We continue to work and protect human rights and civil society in Russia. We are considering all options for further action... it would be inappropriate for me to speculate on any future listings."" The Liberal Democrats have urged the government to consider sanctions. Layla Moran, the party's foreign affairs spokesperson, said: ""Navalny's team have released a list of names drawn up by Navalny just days before his return and arrest, which included Abramovich and Usmanov."" ""Both individuals were described as key enablers with significant ties and assets in the West."" Representatives for Mr Usmanov declined to comment. Both men have always insisted their businesses are legitimate.

"Dubbed by Forbes magazine ""the world's best stock-picking firm"", an investment in Tesla has driven a low-key Edinburgh partnership to staggering profits last year Just one fund managed by Baillie Gifford emerged as Scotland's biggest company by valuation, and that was after having to offload Tesla shares because they were becoming too valuable Its approach to technology is to look for smart, disruptive leaders with ideas that harness technology for a purpose. Investment managers are then given the freedom to wait patiently - and to give some of their winnings to Scottish football Tesla last year made half a million new cars. That means the pioneer of electric vehicles is a relatively small auto manufacturer, and only half the scale it intended to be by now. Yet its stock price says it's the most valuable auto maker on the planet, worth more than $800bn(Â£580bn). That has made its boss, Elon Musk, the world's richest man, owning 21% of the stock.  At the start of last year, wealth watchers say he was worth a mere $27bn. By year's end, it was more like $150bn. He is the number one poster boy for entrepreneurs. Not only is he minted, but he's controversial, unpredictable, and a stand-out visionary who makes the coolest products - batteries and solar panels to tackle global warming, while his space rockets reverse launch into their own parking spaces. Elon Musk is seen as the number one poster boy for entrepreneurs That ought to mean the stock pickers who backed him and Tesla get some kudos too, and gobsmacking profits for their investors. So which is the next biggest owner of Tesla stock? You would find it at the foot of Calton Hill in Edinburgh, next to a large building site, a multiplex cinema and the capital's John Lewis store. (It happens to be on a site earmarked nearly 50 years ago for the headquarters of BBC Scotland, but that remained in Glasgow instead.) You might not notice it. Baillie Gifford can seem low key to capital residents. It's not a big consumer brand. Owned by its 47 partners, it gets by with a modest profile. Founded as a law firm in 1907, it's canny and long-term. But as an investment partnership, it's now huge and getting a lot bigger. At the end of last month, it had Â£326bn in funds under management. Forbes magazine last month rated it ""the world's best stock-picking firm"". The partnership's profit on holdings of Tesla shares last year alone was a staggering $29.5bn (Â£21.2bn). As the share price rocketed by more than 700% over the year, it had to sell some stock. The rules of various funds, including the flagship Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, require them to limit investors' exposure to a single stock within the portfolio. So it made a profit of nearly $15bn (Â£10.8bn) on shares it had to sell, and the rest was paper profit on the equity it retained. By the end of last month, that stake was worth $19.5bn (Â£14bn). Much of the stock-picking credit goes to managers of the Scottish Mortgage fund, James Anderson and Tom Slater. They are among 80 or so investment managers within a Baillie Gifford staff of 1,300, most of them in two Edinburgh offices, soon to be merged at the new office complex going up at Haymarket. If the former manager's name sounds familiar as someone with cash to splash, then yes, that's the same James Anderson who poured Â£3.5m into Scottish football last year, without even being much of a football fan. Clubs are important for local communities at a tough time, and particularly for smaller towns, he explained. The duo began investing in Tesla only eight years ago. By last year, they owned nearly 8% of it. After last year's sales, that is now below 3%. When they started investing, a share traded at $6. By close of trading on Wednesday, it was $846. The intention is not to back technology firms, but to find those that are ""technology-enabled"" - using tech to do something, and companies whose visionary leaders have ideas for disrupting markets. Other companies backed include online retailers Amazon and Alibaba, Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO, genetic sequencer Illumina and Chinese conglomerate Tencent. The funds realised by selling Tesla shares have been ploughed into promising younger ventures, such as Swedish green battery-maker Northvolt. Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO is among companies which have been backed The company emphasises that the profits are not made by Baillie Gifford itself, but by its clients - those who invest in its funds. The investment partnership makes it money out of managing those funds, while partners may also have their own personal stakes in the funds. Scottish Mortgage was the first fund launched by Baillie & Gifford in 1908. It now has little focus on Scotland and nothing to do with mortgages. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange, and as the real and paper profit on Tesla stock grew by $5.5 billion (Â£4bn) during last year, leaving a stake worth $2.2bn (Â£1.6bn), the Investment Trust share price grew so much that it emerged as the biggest riser on the FTSE100 index, and, by valuation, Scotland's biggest company. In November, as Scottish Mortgage had to offload Tesla stock, James Anderson voiced the approach of the company as one that invests with patience and a purpose: ""We are privileged to have been Tesla's largest external shareholder over a critical period for the development of the company. ""We are immensely grateful for the extraordinary efforts and achievements of Tesla in driving forward a transportation and energy revolution in the face of persistent scepticism and often downright hostility. Without Tesla's efforts the possibility of averting climate disaster would have been significantly reduced. ""In our view the underlying purpose of providing equity capital at scale is to try to assist in mitigating, and hopefully solving, the most serious problems the world faces. For sure, we and our clients are extremely happy with the progress of the share price but we see this as but a reflection of the ultimate objective."" Being a partnership without external shareholders, there's no pressure to deliver quarterly returns. And with the returns they get over time, investors in their funds are unlikely to be anxious that Tesla's earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020, announced on Wednesday night, came in below market expectations. It seems that the move down a gear into the mid-market of electric cars will mean growth in vehicle production each year of around 50%, and more than that this year, but that comes at the price of lower margins. So in after-market trading, the stock price was down by 5%. Baillie Gifford clients can afford that kind of paper loss.

"This video can not be played Video of 'power hungry' male police officer goes viral A man said he felt degraded after being detained in a police car when challenged on his way to work by an officer citing Covid legislation. His video of the events in Solihull on Wednesday has been viewed more than a million times on Twitter. It shows Nino Romano, 21, questioned on his plans, before he is called an idiot and threatened with ""locking up"". West Midlands Police said the officer's actions were ""unacceptable"" and there was no suspicion of any offence. Mr Romano accused him of being ""power-hungry"". The force said it had reviewed both the footage and police camera video of the challenge to Mr Romano and concluded ""conduct fell far below what we would expect"". A spokesperson added: ""[The officer's] manner was not acceptable, not the face of [the force] and we will deal with the situation."" The male officer was with a colleague and their duties were to ensure people adhered to Covid restrictions, police said. Footage shows him asking Mr Romano what he is up to and where he lives - information readily shared by the 21-year-old, who says he is going to work. But matters take a turn when Mr Romano - on his way to catch a train to his job in nearby Birmingham - refuses to give police his name. Nino Romano says he feels ""annoyed"" and ""degraded"" The government's website,externalsays police might stop members of the public to ask their name, their purpose in the area and where they are going, but people do not have to stop or answer. It adds not giving the detail cannot be used as a basis for search or arrest if there is no other reason to suspect a person. The officer can be heard saying that as Mr Romano had refused to give his name, he had ""reasonable suspicion"" he was ""telling lies"". West Midlands Police said: ""[Mr Romano] explained he was heading to work - that's clearly a justifiable reason to be out and about and there was no suspicion he had committed any offences."" Mr Romano said when put into the police car he eventually gave his name, and was released without being formally arrested. But he said the episode had left him ""annoyed"", and accused the officer of being ""power hungry"". He said: ""I've just got used to it, that's how the police act to the younger generation. ""I think they targeted me because of the clothes I was wearing - a tracksuit and a coat. ""I'm going to carry on going to work, but the fact they feel entitled to stop people [is] a bit degrading; it's not nice at all. ""There were so many people around, why pick me?"" In the video, the officer says that under virus legislation Mr Romano must provide his details, otherwise he will be arrested. He is then threatened with ""locking up"". Mr Romano accuses the officer of harassment, and suggests he has been targeted due to his hoodie, and adds he takes issue with someone pulling him over. ""We're the police, we're not just someone, you idiot,"" the officer says. Mr Romano then states ""just 'cause you're the police that gives you the right to stop anyone you want and get their details?"", to which the officer says ""yes"". On saying the officer needed to be ""re-informed"" about the law, Mr Romano is put into a police car and told the matter will be settled in a police station.

"The government has withdrawn a social media advert urging people to ""Stay Home. Save Lives"" after it was criticised for stereotyping women. The image showed women home schooling children and doing domestic chores, while the only man featured was depicted relaxing on a sofa. The infographic was withdrawn after going viral on social media and facing criticism for being ""sexist"". The government said the ad did ""not reflect"" its ""view on women"". Carrying the slogan ""Stay Home, Save lives. The new Covid-19 variant is spreading fast"", it was widely shared on social media earlier this week. Covid has 'devastating' impact on gender equality Covid 'could set women's equality back 25 years' 'Girl boss' ad banned for gender stereotyping Three scenes showed women cleaning, ironing and teaching children. Another depicted a family on a sofa, mother and daughter curled up beside a man who has his feet on the ground. Commenting on Instagram, Lorraine Candy, former editor of Sunday Times Style Magazine who reported on the advert, along with Glamour magazine, said: ""Are there no intelligent, smart women advising the government about this? I am perplexed by the lack of awareness."" Parenting blogger Anna Whitehouse said: ""Showing a man lounging about while women (and girls) 'do it all' may bear some truth but it can't be the blueprint from the top. How did this get signed off in 2021?"" For Labour, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson said the advert put ""women back 'in their place'"", adding: ""How out of touch can this government get?"" Conservative former minister Caroline Nokes, chair of the Women and Equalities Committee, also criticised the image, tweeting: ""Someone signed this off."" The prime minister's spokesman said : ""We have provided information for the public throughout the pandemic.[The advert] does not reflect our view on women and we have removed it."" The Advertising Standards Authority stipulates that campaigns ""must not include gender stereotypes that are likely to cause harm, or serious or widespread offence"". Amongscenarios it deems ""likely to be unacceptable"",externalis one ""that depicts a man with his feet up and family members creating mess around a home, while a woman is solely responsible for cleaning up the mess"". Another is an ""ad that belittles a man for carrying out stereotypically 'female' roles or tasks"". A report last November by the Fawcett Society, a charity campaigning for equal rights, found the pandemic was having a ""devastating"" effect on gender equality in the workplace, with women more likely than men to lose their jobs or be left dealing with childcare.

"The prime minister and Public Health England have both defended the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, afterGermany recommended that it should only be given to people aged under 65. Dr Mary Ramsay of PHE said the jab offers ""high levels of protection"" against Covid-19, particularly against severe illness. Boris Johnson said he was not concerned by Germany's recommendation. AstraZeneca said the jab's trial data supported efficacy in the over-65s. Germany's vaccine committee said the AstraZeneca vaccineshould only be given to people aged under 65, citing a lack of sufficient data to recommend use among older age groups. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is to decide on Friday whether to approve the vaccine for use across the EU. But Dr Ramsay, head of immunisations at Public Health England, said: ""Both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are safe and provide high levels of protection against Covid-19, particularly against severe disease. ""There were too few cases in older people in the AstraZeneca trials to observe precise levels of protection in this group, but data on immune responses were very reassuring."" What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Cough, fever or loss of smell: Could it be Covid? Mr Johnson said he was not concerned by Germany's recommendation, adding that the UK's watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), had ""made it very clear"" that the AstraZeneca vaccine is ""very good and efficacious"" and gives a ""high degree of protection after just one dose, and even more after two doses"". Speaking during a visit to Scotland, the prime minister added: ""The evidence that they've supplied is that they think it is effective across all age groups [and] provides a good immune response across all age groups, so I don't agree with that [Germany's recommendation]."" An AstraZeneca spokesperson said the latest analyses of clinical trial data for its vaccine ""support efficacy in the over 65 years age group"", adding that the firm was awaiting ""a regulatory decision on the vaccine by the EMA in the coming days"". All of the regulators and experts in different countries have been looking at the same data on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. That data comes from clinical trials, and those did recruit fewer elderly people overall. That's because they started off first with younger volunteers to get results as quickly as possible, given the urgency to find out if a vaccine would work well enough to help get us out of the pandemic. The scientists who ran the trials have always been upfront about this. But they say there is other evidence to suggest the vaccine will work well in older adults. Studies show the over-65s have a strong immune responses to the vaccine. After receiving the shots their blood has plenty of the required antibodies that can fight coronavirus. The UK has been using the AstraZeneca vaccine in its mass immunisation programme for weeks now and should soon have more proof from the real world setting about how much protection the shots give. Prof Paul Hunter, of the University of East Anglia, told BBC News that the elderly should not worry about receiving the jab. He said: ""I'm almost 65 myself and I would happily take any of the vaccines, including the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. We do know that it is safe in people over 65. ""They have much fewer side effects than younger people and it almost certainly provides substantial benefits in terms of preventing severe disease and reducing the chances of going into hospital."" Prof Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), told BBC's Radio 4's PM programme that Germany's recommendation ""just reflects different levels of caution"", adding: ""What they are basically doing is saying 'We'd like to wait a big longer and know a bit more before we move."" Prof Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, said: ""We have no concerns about the safety of the vaccine in any age group"". This video can not be played Covid vaccine safety: How does a vaccine get approved? Dr Doug Brown, chief executive of the British Society for Immunology, said the MHRA would have ""carefully scrutinised the evidence"" on the AstraZeneca jab before making their recommendation, and referred to itsoriginal report,externalwhich stated that there is ""there is limited information available on efficacy in participants aged 65 or over, although there is nothing to suggest lack of protection"". He said this reflected a ""need for more data"" on the effectiveness of the jab in this age group, but noted the jab had shown a ""good safety profile"" in all published reports. Prof Jim Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute at the University of Oxford, said German scientists had ""not said the vaccine is ineffective for over-65s"". He added: ""Scientists often disagree about how much evidence is needed for any new advance and there is always more data to be secured. ""Normally this all happens out of sight of the glare of the media and not in a pandemic, but such debates are an important part of the scientific process that is familiar to anyone who has ever been through peer review."" Meanwhile, the EU and AstraZeneca are involved in a row over vaccine supply shortages. AstraZeneca has previously said it could deliver only a fraction of the doses between January and March that it had promised to the bloc, blaming production issues at EU plants for a reported 50 million-dose shortfall. The EU has demanded that UK-made jabs are diverted to mainland Europe to fulfil contractual obligations. However,both sides pledged to work together to resolve the crisis. But Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove hassaid there would ""be no interruption"" to UK vaccine supplies. It comes as the UK recorded a further 1,239 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test on Thursday, according to government figures. There have also been another 28,680 new infections.

"Biotech firm Novavax has labs in the US (pictured) and has carried out trials in the UK and South Africa A new coronavirus vaccine has been shown to be 89% effective in large-scale UK trials. The Novavax jab is the first to show in trials that it is effective against the new virus variant found in the UK, the BBC's medical editor Fergus Walsh said. The UK has secured 60 million doses of the jab, which will be made in Stockton-on-Tees in north-east England. Meanwhile,a single-dose vaccine developed by Janssen is 66% effective, trial results have shown. Janssen, a company owned by Johnson & Johnson, is also investigating whether giving two doses will give either stronger or longer-lasting protection. The company said its initial findings showed one dose prevented 85% of severe cases. Both the Novavax and Janssen jabs will need to be reviewed by regulators before they can be used. EU chief wants AstraZeneca jab contract published When will I get a Covid vaccine? Coronavirus: A year of high-speed discovery The PM welcomed the ""good news"", with doses of the Novavax jab expected to be delivered in the second half of this year if approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the government said. The UK has so far approved three coronavirus vaccines for emergency use - one from Oxford University and AstraZeneca, another by Pfizer and BioNTech, and a third from drug firm Moderna. The Novavax jab, which is given in two doses, was shown to be 89.3% effective at preventing Covid-19 in participants in its Phase 3 clinical trial in the UK, and around 86% effective at protecting against the new UK variant. The jab's efficacy against the original Covid-19 strainwas calculated to be 95.6%,external. The Phase 3 trials - the final stage before a vaccine is looked at by a regulator - enrolled more than 15,000 people aged between 18-84, of whom 27% were older than 65, US firm Novavax said. In the South African part of the trial, where most of the cases were the South African variant of the virus, the vaccine was 60% effective among those without HIV. Stan Erck, chief executive of Novavax, said the results from the UK trial were ""spectacular"" and ""as good as we could have hoped"", while the efficacy in South Africa was ""above people's expectations"". He told the BBC the manufacturing plant in Stockton-on-Tees should be up and running by March or April, with the company hoping to get approval for the vaccine from the MHRA around the same time. This video can not be played Novavax chief executive: UK trial results are ""spectacular"" Minister Lucy Frazer told BBC Breakfast the government could not put an exact timeframe on when the Novavax jab might be approved as the regulation process is ""out of our control"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the new vaccine would be ""another weapon in our arsenal to beat this awful virus"", if approved. Prof Paul Heath, chief investigator of the UK Novavax trial, said the trial findings were ""enormously exciting"", particularly because of the jab's efficacy against the UK variant. These extremely encouraging trial results suggest another powerful vaccine against coronavirus could soon be within reach. It works in a slightly different way to the ones that are already available - but does the same job of teaching the body's immune system to recognise and fight the pandemic virus. What is more, it appears to be effective against emerging and more infectious variants of coronavirus too - something scientists have feared might not be possible because the vaccines were all designed to match the original virus, not these new, mutated versions. Protection against illness from the new UK variant was high - around 86%. Even with the South Africa variant, which has undergone the most worrisome changes, it offered a level of protection similar to that given by flu shots against influenza. England's chief medical officerProf Chris Whitty said,external, if the jab is approved, it ""increases our future resilience"" against the virus. Nadhim Zahawi, the UK minister responsible for the vaccine rollout, said he was ""particularly thrilled"" to see the positive results as he had taken part in Novavax's trials himself. This video can not be played Covid vaccine safety: How does a vaccine get approved? In total,the UK has ordered100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and 40 million of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - both are currently being rolled out in the UK. Another 17 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, which was approved by the MHRA in early January, are expected in the spring. The aim is to give everyone in the top four priority groups - up to 15 million people - a first dose by mid-February. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines rely on technology that has not been used in previous vaccines, but the Novavax jab uses a more traditional method of recreating part of the spike protein of the virus to stimulate the immune system. How does the Pfizer vaccine work? Watch: Covid vaccine differences Ministers take part in Covid vaccine trial Like the Oxford vaccine, the Novavax jab can be stored at regular fridge temperature - which means it can be distributed more easily. More than 7.4 million people in the UK have so far received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine,according to the latest government figures.,external Meanwhile,the latest estimate for the UK's R rate,externalfrom the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, is 0.7 to 1.1. It means that on average, every 10 people with the virus will infect between seven and 11 other people. Last week, the R rate was between 0.8 and 1. The latest growth rate range is between -5% and 0%, indicating that the number of new infections is broadly flat or shrinking by up to 5% every day. TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

Separately, the EU's vaccine contract with AstraZenecahas been published, in a growing row over reduced supplies of their jab. Kate Bingham, who used to chair the UK's Vaccine Taskforce, said the reason the UK had a good supply of vaccines compared with other countries was because of its ability to get clinical trials completed quickly and at a high standard through the NHS's registry - with some 400,000 volunteers signing up ""before the US even started their Phase 3 studies"". The UK recorded a further 1,239 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test on Thursday. There have also been another 28,680 new infections.

"Amateur investors are responding with outrage after trading platforms curbed buying of shares in the US games firm GameStop and other companies. The moves by Robinhood and Interactive Brokers follow days of frenzied trading that led to massive gains for some stocks. Shares in GameStop dived by as much as 55% after the restrictions. It is the latest twist in a battle that has pitted amateur investors against Wall Street giants. Major hedge funds had bet billions of dollars that GameStop's shares would fall. But they have faced major losses after amateurs, swapping tips on social media sites such as Reddit, drove up the share price by more than 700% in a week. Other firms, such as AMC Entertainment, Koss Corp and BlackBerry, also saw sharp gains. They were embraced by day traders after hedge funds bet against them. The activity has drawn questions from regulators, who are monitoring trading amid fears of illegal actions. GameStop: What is it and why is it trending? 'Failing' firm soars in value as amateurs buy stock Victims typically lose Â£45,000 in investment scams However, the amateur investors say they are just playing Wall Street at its own game. In online forums they discussed legal action and accused Robinhood and other brokerages enacting their own form of market manipulation by restricting purchases of certain shares. Robinhood co-founder Vladimir Tenev tweeted that the firm had taken its decision based on regulatory requirements, and said limited buys of the restricted stocks would be allowed from Friday.

Myron Sakkas says traders like him are angry ""They support a capitalist free market only when it works for them. What we saw today was not a free market and it forced an awful lot of people to lose an awful lot of money,"" said 18-year-old Myron Sakkas of Coventry, a student at Warwick University. Myron, who has had an account on the Trading 212 platform since August last year, said he had lost Â£30 on Gamestop shares, which he owned for ""a couple of hours"" and sold when he saw what was happening. Myron said he had since been locked out of his account and unable to use it while his identity is being checked. But when he gains access again, he plans to take out the Â£1,000 he has in it and call a halt. Though hoping to go into investment banking after he gets his degree, he said he was disillusioned by what he sees as ""market manipulation"" directed against people like him. ""When ordinary people try to make money in a system where only rich traders can make money, that's what happens,"" he told the BBC. ""Maybe I won't trade for a while, to be honest,"" he added. ""I've got other stuff to do."" Key to what's going on is ""short selling"" or ""shorting"", where a big investment company such as a hedge fund tries to make money by betting that a company's share price will fall. The hedge fund borrows shares in a company from other investors (for a fee) and sells the shares on the markets at, for example, $10 each, waits until they fall to $5, and buys them back. The borrowed shares are returned to the original owner, and the hedge fund pockets a profit. GameStop - which saw heavy losses last year and was described as ""failing"" by one big investor - is the most shorted stock on Wall Street. But in the last week, amateur investors who follow the Wall Street Bets forum on Reddit have poured money into buying the company's stock with the aim of pushing up the price. If the price rises dramatically, short sellers face big losses and they need to buy back the shares they have borrowed quickly to prevent bigger losses  - a process known as covering. However, buying back the shares only adds to demand for the stock and pushes its price higher still. And amateurs aren't the only ones getting in on the action. This week, for example, private equity firm Silver Lake Group, which had loaned money to AMC Entertainment, converted its bonds to shares after the surge in the firm's prices, a swap worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In the US, anger over the trading restrictions united politicians whose stances typically sharply diverge. Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who is taking over as chair of the banking committee, said he would hold a hearing about the ""state of the stock market"". ""People on Wall Street only care about the rules when they're the ones getting hurt,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Dave Portnoy, founder of the Barstool Sports blog, who has emerged as one of the most high-profile amateur traders during the pandemic, also attacked the restrictions, singling out Robinhood, which has cast itself as a platform aimed at making Wall Street more accessible. The firm also makes money through fees paid by Wall Street firms that execute trades for its users. ""'Democratizing finance for all' except when we manipulate the market, cause too many ordinary people are getting rich,"" he wrote. Allow Twitter content?

""Among the many aspects of this story that are strange, what is so unusual is the peculiar vigilante morality of the traders pumping the stock. They seem hell-bent on taking on Wall Street, they seem to hate hedge funds and threads are peppered with insults about 'boomer' money. ""It's a generational fight, redistributive and all about robbing the rich to give to the millennial 'poor'."" Elon Musk,who has a history of feuding with short sellers, also joined the fight, tweeting: ""Here come the shorty apologists. Give them no respect. Get Shorty."" Allow Twitter content?

A one-word tweet by the billionaire entrepreneur on Tuesday - he tweeted ""Gamestonk!!"" -had been seen as giving Gamestop shares an extra boost. The fracas follows a jump in casual investing during the pandemic, which saw people stuck at home with time on their hands and limited places to spend pour money into the market. This video can not be played Despite the economy shrinking, US stocks have rallied The surge has produced ripples of worry on Wall Street, including concerns that inexperienced investors could cause bubbles in certain stocks or were dabbling in investments with risks they did not fully understand. Robinhood - which has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the new interest in investing - has faced particular scrutiny for the way its app has made investment seem like a game. Last year, Massachusetts regulators filed a complaint accusing the company of marketing to inexperienced users and failing to protect them. Officials said this week they were following the market battle. Press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday President Joe Bidenâs economic team, including newly-appointed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, was âmonitoring the situationâ. Massachusetts state regulator William Galvin called on the New York Stock Exchange to suspend GameStop for 30 days to allow a cooling-off period.

"This video can not be played A large group of people have been filmed in a snowball fight in Leeds Two men who organised a mass snowball fight during the latest coronavirus lockdown have each been fined Â£10,000. Hundreds descended on Hyde Park in Leeds when heavy snowfall carpeted the city earlier this month. West Yorkshire Police said the men, aged 20 and 23, had put those who took part or watched at ""a significant and completely unnecessary risk"". Ch Supt Damien Miller said the event on 14 January had been a ""blatant breach"" of the rules. ""We take absolutely no pleasure in handing out such heavy fines to these two young men, but their actions encouraged hundreds of people to be in close proximity to each other,"" he said. The 23-year-old had previously received a fine for breaching restrictions on mixing households, the force said. Police declined to give any further details about how the men encouraged people to attend the snowball fight.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is visiting Scotland despite the country's first minister questioning whether the trip is necessary during lockdown The EU and the UK-based Covid vaccine maker AstraZeneca have vowed to work together to resolve a bitter row over supply shortages to the 27-member bloc Germany is likely to face a vaccine shortage until at least April, its health minister warns - and it may limit the AstraZeneca jab to under-65s It would be ""premature to imagine"" lockdown restrictions in England will be lifted before 8 March, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove says Black MPs from across the UK political spectrum join together in a video encouraging people to get the coronavirus vaccine Imperial College London scientists tracking coronavirus in England say there are signs of a ""shallow decline"" in infection levels but they remain high And a World Health Organization team is out of quarantine and set for face-to-face meetings as part of their probe into the origins of the virus in the Chinese city of Wuhan Edited by Hamish Mackay Our live coronavirus coverage has come to an end for the day. Thanks for joining us. Here are some of the main news stories from the day: Today's live page was brought to you by James Clarke, Hamish Mackay, Jennifer Meierhans, Alex Therrien, Lauren Turner and Ella Wills. BBC World Service The Africa Centre for Disease Control says the African Union (AU) has secured an additional 400 million doses of coronavirus vaccines for its members. This comes on top of another 270 million announced earlier. It is estimated Africa will need 1.5 billion vaccine doses to vaccinate 60% of its inhabitants. Most countries on the continent have not started vaccinating people, lacking the funds to purchase the drugs. South Africa's leading coronavirus expertSalim Abdool Karim recently urged the world's wealthier nations not to hoard vaccine supplies, describing the behaviour as ""unconscionable"" and warning ""no-one is safe until everyone is safe"". The AU said earlier this month 50 million vaccines would be available between April and June. The others will come later this year and next year. Read more: A further 1,239 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test were reported in the UK earlier. The daily totals can fluctuate due to delays in reporting. However, the seven-day average for deaths is at a similar level. Cases, meanwhile, continue to fall. The current seven-day average stands at 28,584. Despite the ongoing fall in cases, the number of people in hospital with Covid-19 remains high (36,931). Radio 4 PM Earlier, we heard that Germany's vaccine committee said AstraZeneca's Covid jab should only be given to people aged under 65 due to ""insufficient evidence"" about is efficacy in older people. But vacine expert Prof Adam Finn - a member of the UK's joint committee on vaccination and immunisation - told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that the decision ""just reflects different levels of caution"". Prof Finn, of the University of Bristol, told the programme: ""What they are basically doing is saying 'we'd like to wait a big longer and know a bit more before we move.' ""We have no concerns about the safety of the vaccine in any age group."" You can read more about the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine here. People may soon be offered a 'spit in a pot' coronavirus test, after promising trial results. The LampORE test checks for the virus in saliva samples and work carried out with the help of more than 1,000 NHS volunteers shows it is good at finding cases, even if someone has no symptoms. Pop-up labs that can process up to 2,000 tests a day have been set up in trucks that could travel the country. Four have already been deployed, says the government. These mobile units are located in Aberdeen, Telford, Brent and Newbury. They will continue testing people in the coming weeks and the results will be evaluated to see how helpful the service is.

""I couldn't move for 10 days,"" she says. ""It's been rough - probably one of the hardest experiences of my life."" She's a fit 31-year-old but says she was ""shocked at how much it beat my body"" and even her friends were scared. ""I didn't even get mild symptoms - I feel like it can happen to anyone, it's such a serious thing."" You can read the full story from Harpz here.

Small business owner Mike Hemming, 53, from Melksham in Wiltshire, had pneumonia and blood clots on his lungs. Despite not having any underlying health conditions, Mr Hemming got steadily worse and was rushed to the Royal United Hospital in Bath on 11 January. ""For her to sit there and give me a hug was amazing. She didn't know me from Adam. It was very special and absolutely needed,"" Mr Hemming said. A pharmacist hasgiven a coronavirus jab to his 85-year-old fatherin an Islamic community centre - saying he wanted to boost vaccination rates and debunk myths about the virus. Aftab Rehman, from Pear Tree Pharmacy in Derby, began vaccinations at Ikhlas Islamic Education Centre on Thursday. Administering the vaccine to his father, Rehmat Khan, a former stroke patient who has diabetes, he said he hoped doing so would ""give confidence"" to the community. Mr Rehman said it was ""extremely important"" for pharmacists to go to community centres to carry out vaccinations and counter fake news. ""The problem is, via social media, we have misinformation and we have people who want to share conspiracy theories,"" he said. ""A lot of the vaccinators here will be nurses and pharmacists from the community so people will know them."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst CCTV shows Ma Yaqing and her colleagues at one venue Chinaâs official broadcaster, CCTV, has shown a liveâcloud weddingâ,externalbetween two essential workers in the country's north-eastern
Hebei province. The bride, Ma Yaqing, is a doctor from Shijiazhuang, and her now husband, Yu Yang, is a firefighter from nearby Xingtang County. Since the start of the year, both have become front-line workers,
after an outbreak of Covid-19 led to hundreds of peoplecontracting the virus in the region. Yu Yang with his colleagues as witnesses Parts of Shijiazhuang are currently under full lockdown, meaning peopleâs movements are restricted and all public events are banned. However, the couple were given authorisation to exchange their vows remotely. CCTV showed the groom at one venue, with his colleagues as witnesses, and the doctor and her colleagues at another. There are currently more than 600 people being treated in hospital for Covid-19 in Hebei province, but cases are falling. Gary Matthews was found dead the day after he tested positive for Covid-19 A man whose cousin died after a positive Covid test says coronavirus deniers are ""complicit"" in the death. Gary Matthews, 46, was found dead in his flat in Shrewsbury, Shropshire the day after he tested positive. He had been part of a Facebook group that, according to Tristan Copeland, spread false conspiracy theories about Covid-19. ""I think they were complicit in Gary's death for sure,"" Mr Copeland says. ""They encouraged him not to wear a mask and I think if he had been wearing a mask, if he had been locking down, if he had not been going to work, I think he would have had a greater protection - I think he would be alive today."" Mr Copeland says his cousin had been sick for about a week. ""He tested positive and he was told to go home and isolate, which he did, and I think he died the next morning."" Read the full story here. BBC Radio 5 Live Almost one in three police officers  - around 32% in England and Wales - have saidtheyâve had coronavirus used as a weaponagainst them, according to a Police Federation survey. BBC Radio 5 Live has heard from other members of the emergency services about their experiences. Mike Jones, a paramedic and violence reduction lead for the South Western ambulance service, said he has been directly targeted. âBack in September, in Cornwall, a patient decided that it was appropriate to hit my colleague and spit in my face,"" he told 5 Live. âI donât think he did [have coronavirus] but unfortunately what weâre seeing is incidents throughout the trust where people are weaponising coronavirus. ""Weâve had increases in spitting and coughing incidents on all members of staff unfortunately due to the pandemic."" He said his trust has a ""zero tolerance"" approach to such incidents and that staff wore protection like glasses and face masks. But he said for any ambulance or police staff spat at, the worry isn't just catching Covid - it's that if any spit gets in their eyes or mouth, they need six months of blood tests to check for pathogens. As he described it: ""Six months living in fear that actually you might have something from a member of the public."" Pupils in Northern Ireland will not return to school until Monday 8 March at the earliest, the Stormont Executive has agreed. First Minister Arlene Foster said the ongoing public health situation meant remote learning must continue. If a return is possible on 8 March, it might be that only some year groups go back. Mrs Foster said she recognised it would come as a ""disappointment"" for many parents and pupils. ""The kitchen table is no substitute for the school desk,"" she said. Read more. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has tweeted to confirm that the UAE, Burundi and Rwanda will all be added to the UK's ""red list"" from 13:00 GMT tomorrow. That means people arriving from those countries or transiting through will be denied entry - except for British, Irish and third country nationals with residence rights, who must self-isolate for 10 days at home. Those passengers must still have proof of a negative test and complete a passenger location form before arrival. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Germany's government has been criticised for its vaccine programme's slow start Germany's vaccine committee has said AstraZeneca's Covid jab should only be given to people aged under 65. The committee cited ""insufficient data"" over its efficacy for older people. The European Medicines Agency is to decide on Friday whether to approve the vaccine for use across the EU. The UK has been using the AstraZeneca vaccine in its mass immunisation programme for weeks now, and public health officials say it is safe and provides ""high levels of protection"". The German announcement comes as the EU is in dispute with leading manufacturers over a shortage of vaccines on the continent. UK-based AstraZeneca has said production issues at its Europe-based plants mean it will be unable to deliver the promised number of doses to the bloc. But the EU says the firm must honour its commitments and deliver the jabs by diverting stock from the UK. It is calling on members to ""make use of all legal means"" to secure the supply. Pfizer-BioNTech has also cut the number of doses it is delivering to the 27-member bloc. What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? UK vaccine supplies 'won't be interrupted' EU vaccine delays prompt press frustration Is it OK to get a leftover Covid-19 vaccine? The independent vaccine commission advising the German government said there were ""currently insufficient data available to assess the vaccine efficacy from 65 years of age"" and recommended ""the AstraZeneca vaccine... should only be offered to people aged 18-64 years at each stage"". But Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisations at Public Health England, said both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are ""safe and provide high levels of protection against Covid-19. ""There were too few cases in older people in the AstraZeneca trials to observe precise levels of protection in this group, but data on immune responses were very reassuring."" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was not worried by the German recommendation, saying British health authorities had made clear the AstraZeneca vaccine was ""effective across all age groups"". Meanwhile, Paul Hunter, professor of Medicine at the University of East Anglia, told BBC News that the jab was safe for people over 65 ""almost certainly provides substantial benefits in terms of preventing severe disease and reduce the chances of going into hospital"". How effective is the Oxford vaccine? The global plan to share Covid-19 vaccines fairly All of the regulators and experts in different countries have been looking at the same data on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. That data comes from clinical trials, and those did recruit fewer elderly people overall. That's because they started off first with younger volunteers to get results as quickly as possible, given the urgency to find out if a vaccine would work well enough to help get us out of the pandemic. The scientists who ran the trials have always been upfront about this. But they say there is other evidence to suggest the vaccine will work well in older adults. Studies show the over 65s have a strong immune responses to the vaccine. After receiving the shots their blood has plenty of the required antibodies that can fight coronavirus. The UK has been using the AstraZeneca vaccine in its mass immunisation programme for weeks now and should soon have more proof from the real world setting about how much protection the shots give. The pace of the EU's vaccination programme has been criticised in recent weeks. There are shortages due to delays in shipments of both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which are the only ones currently approved for use in the block. Vaccination appointments are being delayed in many countries. In Madrid, Spain, authorities have suspended first doses of the vaccination for at least two weeks. Sweden was set to receive one million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in February but is now expected to get just 400,000 doses. European Council President Charles Michel commented on AstraZeneca's inability to provide all the doses expected over the coming weeks. ""If no satisfactory solution can be found, I believe we should explore all options and make use of all legal means and enforcement measures at our disposal,"" he said in a letter to EU leaders. Toned down rhetoric On Thursday the EU tried to dial down the emotion in its ongoing battle to get AstraZeneca to deliver the number of vaccines stipulated in their contract. Until now Brussels had reacted with outrage at the news it might only get a fraction of the vaccines expected from Astra Zeneca. Now it's toning down the rhetoric. Instead the president of the European Council threatened legal action. The EU has also stepped away from involving the UK in the row. It is still arguing that AstraZeneca should use its plants in the UK, as well as those in the EU, to supply the bloc with promised vaccines. Brussels also disagrees with the UK government that its contract with AstraZeneca should get priority as it was signed first. But in public, the European Commission was keen to underline today that its dispute was with AstraZeneca, not the UK government. The EU signed a deal with AstraZeneca in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more, but the UK-Swedish company has reported production delays at plants in the Netherlands and Belgium. AstraZeneca's CEO said production was ""basically two months behind where we wanted to be"". This video can not be played Stella Kyriakides: ""AstraZeneca needs to deliver on its commitments"" The EU had hoped that as soon as approval was given - which is expected on Friday - delivery would start straight away, but the production issues have dented this hope. Reports said last week the EU would get 60% fewer vaccine doses - about 50 million jabs - than promised in the first quarter of the year. The bloc is also facing delays with supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and it has a much bigger deal with the US-German vaccine maker. Both the EU and AstraZeneca have vowed to work together to resolve the problems.

"The prime minister and Public Health England have both defended the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, afterGermany recommended that it should only be given to people aged under 65. Dr Mary Ramsay of PHE said the jab offers ""high levels of protection"" against Covid-19, particularly against severe illness. Boris Johnson said he was not concerned by Germany's recommendation. AstraZeneca said the jab's trial data supported efficacy in the over-65s. Germany's vaccine committee said the AstraZeneca vaccineshould only be given to people aged under 65, citing a lack of sufficient data to recommend use among older age groups. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is to decide on Friday whether to approve the vaccine for use across the EU. But Dr Ramsay, head of immunisations at Public Health England, said: ""Both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are safe and provide high levels of protection against Covid-19, particularly against severe disease. ""There were too few cases in older people in the AstraZeneca trials to observe precise levels of protection in this group, but data on immune responses were very reassuring."" What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Cough, fever or loss of smell: Could it be Covid? Mr Johnson said he was not concerned by Germany's recommendation, adding that the UK's watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), had ""made it very clear"" that the AstraZeneca vaccine is ""very good and efficacious"" and gives a ""high degree of protection after just one dose, and even more after two doses"". Speaking during a visit to Scotland, the prime minister added: ""The evidence that they've supplied is that they think it is effective across all age groups [and] provides a good immune response across all age groups, so I don't agree with that [Germany's recommendation]."" An AstraZeneca spokesperson said the latest analyses of clinical trial data for its vaccine ""support efficacy in the over 65 years age group"", adding that the firm was awaiting ""a regulatory decision on the vaccine by the EMA in the coming days"". All of the regulators and experts in different countries have been looking at the same data on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. That data comes from clinical trials, and those did recruit fewer elderly people overall.

The UK has been using the AstraZeneca vaccine in its mass immunisation programme for weeks now and should soon have more proof from the real world setting about how much protection the shots give. Prof Paul Hunter, of the University of East Anglia, told BBC News that the elderly should not worry about receiving the jab. He said: ""I'm almost 65 myself and I would happily take any of the vaccines, including the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. We do know that it is safe in people over 65. ""They have much fewer side effects than younger people and it almost certainly provides substantial benefits in terms of preventing severe disease and reducing the chances of going into hospital."" Prof Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), told BBC's Radio 4's PM programme that Germany's recommendation ""just reflects different levels of caution"", adding: ""What they are basically doing is saying 'We'd like to wait a big longer and know a bit more before we move."" Prof Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, said: ""We have no concerns about the safety of the vaccine in any age group"". This video can not be played Covid vaccine safety: How does a vaccine get approved? Dr Doug Brown, chief executive of the British Society for Immunology, said the MHRA would have ""carefully scrutinised the evidence"" on the AstraZeneca jab before making their recommendation, and referred to itsoriginal report,externalwhich stated that there is ""there is limited information available on efficacy in participants aged 65 or over, although there is nothing to suggest lack of protection"". He said this reflected a ""need for more data"" on the effectiveness of the jab in this age group, but noted the jab had shown a ""good safety profile"" in all published reports. Prof Jim Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute at the University of Oxford, said German scientists had ""not said the vaccine is ineffective for over-65s"". He added: ""Scientists often disagree about how much evidence is needed for any new advance and there is always more data to be secured. ""Normally this all happens out of sight of the glare of the media and not in a pandemic, but such debates are an important part of the scientific process that is familiar to anyone who has ever been through peer review."" Meanwhile, the EU and AstraZeneca are involved in a row over vaccine supply shortages. AstraZeneca has previously said it could deliver only a fraction of the doses between January and March that it had promised to the bloc, blaming production issues at EU plants for a reported 50 million-dose shortfall. The EU has demanded that UK-made jabs are diverted to mainland Europe to fulfil contractual obligations. However,both sides pledged to work together to resolve the crisis. But Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove hassaid there would ""be no interruption"" to UK vaccine supplies. It comes as the UK recorded a further 1,239 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test on Thursday, according to government figures. There have also been another 28,680 new infections.

"The ongoing row over vaccine delays in the EU is making headlines Latest news of delays in deliveries of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNtech vaccines to the European Union has been received with anguish and impatience from commentators and leaders across the continent. While the EU comes in for some blame for the delays, there is also interest in looking to other companies to meet vaccination needs. Spanish daily El PaÃ­ssays the slow rollout is a ""lethal threat to the EU"" and distribution poses a ""political risk"" for the union. ""A failure of the vaccination plan would unleash a crisis of European institutions' competence and confidence in them, which is difficult to restore."" Blame might lie with the EU for ""massively overestimating"" the production capacities of manufacturers and ""underestimating"" the price, saysGerman public broadcaster ZDF. ""There is suspicion that manufacturers are  delivering faster to countries that are paying higher prices."" Czech daily Hospodarske Novinyalso pointed the finger at the EU, but added: ""Production and distribution of the vaccine is simply a global business, and logistical exercise on a scale that humankind has not yet experienced. And it would be a surprise if everything went smoothly."" ""Everyone has a right to the vaccine, and the best way to guarantee this right is to remain calm - politically, economically and individually,"" urgesBelgium's Le Soir. The idea of buying vaccines from elsewhere has been gaining ground in some parts of Europe. Hungarycontroversially decided to buy Russia's Sputnik V vaccine before it has received EU approval but now pro-government papers are weighing in.Magyar Hirlapargues that the Russian vaccine ""could be life-saving"" andMagyar Nemzetsays failure to get vaccines on time ""could take hundreds of thousands of lives"". But left-wing dailyNepszavaaccuses Prime Minister Viktor Orban of using the vaccine policy for his own political ends, so that he ""can say with a sly smile, you see, we have won again, we have just managed to overtake Brussels at the revolving door."" CroatianPrime Minister Andrej Plenkovicsays ""Covid-19 vaccine diplomacy is turning into vaccine hijacking"", but he's stated that Croatia has not  yet turned towards other vaccine manufacturers, due to the agreement stipulating that EU member states would not contact manufacturers themselves. On the possibility that Russia and China might step in to provide their own vaccines,Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babissaid ""if they want to supply a vaccine to the EU, they need to ask the EMA [for approval]"". Polish Health Minister Adam Niedzielskihas said that, though his government ""has no alternative plans to procure vaccines"", there are more reasons to buy additional vaccines, as producers do not always honour their commitments, according to Gazeta Wyborcza. The Polish government was ""analysing various opportunities, but the matter is rather delicate, so we cannot share any details"", it quoted him as saying. Romanian news outlet KrÃ³nikasuggests Hungary's decision to buy the Russian vaccine is entirely justifiable in the face of supply issues. ""The Hungarian leadership has at least made an effort to find a solution to the crisis,"" the outlet said. Calls for a more diverse vaccine provision are not limited to Central and Eastern Europe. InItaly, where the government said it would take legal action against Pfizer and AstraZeneca over the delays, the regional head of the department of health for Rome said the Sputnik V vaccine was ""needed"" and that the European Medicines Agency should approve it. ""This isn't about geopolitics: it's a race against the spread of the mutations,"" Alessio D'Amato said. What is happening with the EU vaccine rollout?

"Amateur investors are responding with outrage after trading platforms curbed buying of shares in the US games firm GameStop and other companies. The moves by Robinhood and Interactive Brokers follow days of frenzied trading that led to massive gains for some stocks. Shares in GameStop dived by as much as 55% after the restrictions. It is the latest twist in a battle that has pitted amateur investors against Wall Street giants. Major hedge funds had bet billions of dollars that GameStop's shares would fall. But they have faced major losses after amateurs, swapping tips on social media sites such as Reddit, drove up the share price by more than 700% in a week. Other firms, such as AMC Entertainment, Koss Corp and BlackBerry, also saw sharp gains. They were embraced by day traders after hedge funds bet against them. The activity has drawn questions from regulators, who are monitoring trading amid fears of illegal actions. GameStop: What is it and why is it trending? 'Failing' firm soars in value as amateurs buy stock Victims typically lose Â£45,000 in investment scams However, the amateur investors say they are just playing Wall Street at its own game. In online forums they discussed legal action and accused Robinhood and other brokerages enacting their own form of market manipulation by restricting purchases of certain shares. Robinhood co-founder Vladimir Tenev tweeted that the firm had taken its decision based on regulatory requirements, and said limited buys of the restricted stocks would be allowed from Friday.

Myron Sakkas says traders like him are angry ""They support a capitalist free market only when it works for them. What we saw today was not a free market and it forced an awful lot of people to lose an awful lot of money,"" said 18-year-old Myron Sakkas of Coventry, a student at Warwick University. Myron, who has had an account on the Trading 212 platform since August last year, said he had lost Â£30 on Gamestop shares, which he owned for ""a couple of hours"" and sold when he saw what was happening. Myron said he had since been locked out of his account and unable to use it while his identity is being checked. But when he gains access again, he plans to take out the Â£1,000 he has in it and call a halt. Though hoping to go into investment banking after he gets his degree, he said he was disillusioned by what he sees as ""market manipulation"" directed against people like him. ""When ordinary people try to make money in a system where only rich traders can make money, that's what happens,"" he told the BBC. ""Maybe I won't trade for a while, to be honest,"" he added. ""I've got other stuff to do."" Key to what's going on is ""short selling"" or ""shorting"", where a big investment company such as a hedge fund tries to make money by betting that a company's share price will fall. The hedge fund borrows shares in a company from other investors (for a fee) and sells the shares on the markets at, for example, $10 each, waits until they fall to $5, and buys them back. The borrowed shares are returned to the original owner, and the hedge fund pockets a profit. GameStop - which saw heavy losses last year and was described as ""failing"" by one big investor - is the most shorted stock on Wall Street. But in the last week, amateur investors who follow the Wall Street Bets forum on Reddit have poured money into buying the company's stock with the aim of pushing up the price. If the price rises dramatically, short sellers face big losses and they need to buy back the shares they have borrowed quickly to prevent bigger losses  - a process known as covering. However, buying back the shares only adds to demand for the stock and pushes its price higher still. And amateurs aren't the only ones getting in on the action. This week, for example, private equity firm Silver Lake Group, which had loaned money to AMC Entertainment, converted its bonds to shares after the surge in the firm's prices, a swap worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In the US, anger over the trading restrictions united politicians whose stances typically sharply diverge. Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who is taking over as chair of the banking committee, said he would hold a hearing about the ""state of the stock market"". ""People on Wall Street only care about the rules when they're the ones getting hurt,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The fracas follows a jump in casual investing during the pandemic, which saw people stuck at home with time on their hands and limited places to spend pour money into the market.

Robinhood - which has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the new interest in investing - has faced particular scrutiny for the way its app has made investment seem like a game.

"Stationery chain Paperchase has been bought out of administration in a deal rescuing up to 90 of its 127 stores. The sale to a newly incorporated company, Aspen Phoenix NewCo, means that about 1,000 of its 1,500 employees will keep their jobs. Paperchase chief executive Ollie Raeburn said the deal was ""tough but necessary"" to secure the firm's future. He said it had suffered from ""the cumulative impact of lockdowns and related restrictions"". The second lockdown in November came at a crucial period for the firm, which makes a high proportion of its sales then. Just under half its sales, 40%, come from trade in November and December. On 5 January,the firm filed a notice to appoint administrators, a move designed to give it breathing space from its creditors while it worked out a rescue plan. In its latest announcement, Paperchase said the sale had been completed following the appointment of PwC as administrators. The business has been sold in what is known as a pre-pack administration after seeing a collapse in sales due to the lockdowns and restrictions on the High Street. This allows for continuation of the business and the ability to safeguard jobs while avoiding the need to liquidate the company. The chain is the latest of a string of high-profile retailers to hit trouble in the past year. The sector was already battling with the shift to online sales, coupled with rising costs, including rents and higher minimum wages. Coronavirus restrictions which shut non-essential shops piled on the pressure. Paperchase said that under its new ownership, it would remain ""an omni-channel business, albeit with a smaller, more relevant, retail footprint"".

"Amateur investors are responding with outrage after trading platforms curbed buying of shares in the US games firm GameStop and other companies. The moves by Robinhood and Interactive Brokers follow days of frenzied trading that led to massive gains for some stocks. Shares in GameStop dived by as much as 55% after the restrictions. It is the latest twist in a battle that has pitted amateur investors against Wall Street giants. Major hedge funds had bet billions of dollars that GameStop's shares would fall. But they have faced major losses after amateurs, swapping tips on social media sites such as Reddit, drove up the share price by more than 700% in a week. Other firms, such as AMC Entertainment, Koss Corp and BlackBerry, also saw sharp gains. They were embraced by day traders after hedge funds bet against them. The activity has drawn questions from regulators, who are monitoring trading amid fears of illegal actions. GameStop: What is it and why is it trending? 'Failing' firm soars in value as amateurs buy stock Victims typically lose Â£45,000 in investment scams However, the amateur investors say they are just playing Wall Street at its own game. In online forums they discussed legal action and accused Robinhood and other brokerages enacting their own form of market manipulation by restricting purchases of certain shares. Robinhood co-founder Vladimir Tenev tweeted that the firm had taken its decision based on regulatory requirements, and said limited buys of the restricted stocks would be allowed from Friday.

Myron Sakkas says traders like him are angry ""They support a capitalist free market only when it works for them. What we saw today was not a free market and it forced an awful lot of people to lose an awful lot of money,"" said 18-year-old Myron Sakkas of Coventry, a student at Warwick University. Myron, who has had an account on the Trading 212 platform since August last year, said he had lost Â£30 on Gamestop shares, which he owned for ""a couple of hours"" and sold when he saw what was happening. Myron said he had since been locked out of his account and unable to use it while his identity is being checked. But when he gains access again, he plans to take out the Â£1,000 he has in it and call a halt. Though hoping to go into investment banking after he gets his degree, he said he was disillusioned by what he sees as ""market manipulation"" directed against people like him. ""When ordinary people try to make money in a system where only rich traders can make money, that's what happens,"" he told the BBC. ""Maybe I won't trade for a while, to be honest,"" he added. ""I've got other stuff to do."" Key to what's going on is ""short selling"" or ""shorting"", where a big investment company such as a hedge fund tries to make money by betting that a company's share price will fall. The hedge fund borrows shares in a company from other investors (for a fee) and sells the shares on the markets at, for example, $10 each, waits until they fall to $5, and buys them back. The borrowed shares are returned to the original owner, and the hedge fund pockets a profit. GameStop - which saw heavy losses last year and was described as ""failing"" by one big investor - is the most shorted stock on Wall Street. But in the last week, amateur investors who follow the Wall Street Bets forum on Reddit have poured money into buying the company's stock with the aim of pushing up the price. If the price rises dramatically, short sellers face big losses and they need to buy back the shares they have borrowed quickly to prevent bigger losses  - a process known as covering. However, buying back the shares only adds to demand for the stock and pushes its price higher still. And amateurs aren't the only ones getting in on the action. This week, for example, private equity firm Silver Lake Group, which had loaned money to AMC Entertainment, converted its bonds to shares after the surge in the firm's prices, a swap worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In the US, anger over the trading restrictions united politicians whose stances typically sharply diverge. Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who is taking over as chair of the banking committee, said he would hold a hearing about the ""state of the stock market"". ""People on Wall Street only care about the rules when they're the ones getting hurt,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The fracas follows a jump in casual investing during the pandemic, which saw people stuck at home with time on their hands and limited places to spend pour money into the market. This video can not be played Despite the economy shrinking, US stocks have rallied The surge has produced ripples of worry on Wall Street, including concerns that inexperienced investors could cause bubbles in certain stocks or were dabbling in investments with risks they did not fully understand. Robinhood - which has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the new interest in investing - has faced particular scrutiny for the way its app has made investment seem like a game. Last year, Massachusetts regulators filed a complaint accusing the company of marketing to inexperienced users and failing to protect them. Officials said this week they were following the market battle. Press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday President Joe Bidenâs economic team, including newly-appointed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, was âmonitoring the situationâ.

"After the news that British residents arriving in England from Covid hotspots will have to quarantine in hotels, many would-be holidaymakers are thinking of opting for UK destinations this summer. Understandably, they don't want to undergo the ""managed isolation process"" requiring them to spend 10 days in a hotel on their return to the UK. But there may be a shortage of the kind of UK accommodation they are looking for, say providers of holiday lets. From cottages to campsites, demand is on the increase. Even the UK's luxury hotels are expecting the move to give them a boost. Arrivals from Covid hotspots face hotel quarantine Which UK arrivals have to quarantine in a hotel? Sarah and Steve Jarvis, who run theIndependent Cottages,externalwebsite listing more than 1,800 properties, say inquiries during the current lockdown in England are 300% up on the first lockdown in March to July 2020. However, they also point out that many properties still need to honour bookings that were rolled over from 2020 because of earlier virus curbs, restricting availability for new requests. ""People started the year with bookings already in the calendar,"" Sarah told the BBC. ""We're going to end up in a situation where we have demand outstripping supply again."" ""It's almost like the perfect storm,"" adds Steve. ""People will be hesitant about going abroad with the new travel restrictions and the UK is looking like a very good option. ""People have got confidence in UK self-catering holidays, because the bookings are coming in thick and fast."" Sarah and Steve Jarvis say demand for cottages is high In normal times, says Sarah, people are looking for accommodation for an average of four people to go away on holiday together. But at the moment, they are getting lots of inquiries for groups of up to nine people, as extended families or groups of friends seek to make up for the family Christmas celebrations they missed out on. ""Families are going to go away and they want to take their parents with them,"" Sarah says. ""It's a safe option for elderly relatives."" Unusually, some are also booking ahead for next Christmas already. ""Straight after Boxing Day, people usually start thinking about summer holidays, but we're also seeing very early bookings for the festive season,"" says Steve. Another holiday provider,holidaycottages.co.uk,external, says it has seen a sharp increase in demand since mid-January. The firm's chief marketing officer, James Starkey, says: ""In the past week, bookings taken for May half-term onwards are up 39% compared to last year, with the summer holidays up 98%. We do still have just over half of our properties available for seven-night breaks in the summer holidays but, with them booking more quickly this year, we anticipate another strong summer for the UK staycation industry."" Trencreek Holiday Park owner Julliette Hautot is seeing a rise in demand AtTrencreek Holiday Park,externalin Newquay, Cornwall, there is definitely a pick-up in interest from holidaymakers. The park offers a mixture of camping and self-catering accommodation, covering a wide range of travel needs. ""Since Monday, the phone's been getting a lot busier,"" says Julliette Hautot, who runs the business with her husband. ""The calls are on the up and it's definitely going to be busy for the summer,"" she told the BBC. ""Slots are filling up for July and August. There's not a lot left, especially for the school holidays."" She is also noticing more inquiries for September than usual, perhaps reflecting a feeling that pandemic restrictions will ease later rather than sooner. Hotels are noticing the staycation trend as well. TheBest Western,externalchain has just done a survey of 6,000 of its UK customers and found that 90% of them felt safer holidaying in Britain this summer rather than abroad. ""With the worries around quarantine, we are now starting to see bookings landing for the big summer months coming through in the last 24 hours,"" spokesperson Andrew Denton told the BBC. ""The experience of last summer has taught people not to leave it to the last minute as Britain gets booked, so to book ahead and quit worrying about quarantine, which might impact an international trip."" At the upper end of the spectrum, the UK's luxury hotels are anticipating opportunities as a result of the hotel quarantine measures for international travel. Pride of Britain Hotels,external, a collection of 50 of independently-owned luxury hotels including the Athenaeum in London's Mayfair, says the measures are set to benefit home-grown tourism. ""Anything that makes international travel more difficult will clearly add to the appeal of a holiday taken within one's own country this year,"" said the consortium's chief executive, Peter Hancock. ""For luxury hotels in the UK, we believe there is huge pent-up demand that is just waiting for the restrictions to be eased. ""It could be a brilliant summer for domestic tourism, marking a desperately-needed return to profitability in our sector.""

"This video can not be played Samantha Cameron tells Emma Barnett about the impact Brexit is having on her business. Samantha Cameron says her fashion brand is finding post-Brexit trading with the EU ""challenging and difficult"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, she said there were ""teething issues"" in trading with the bloc and appealed to government to talk to small firms. Mrs Cameron said she discusses the problems with her husband, ex-Prime Minister David Cameron, who called the EU referendum and campaigned to remain. ""[We] definitely deal with having this problem at work,"" she added. Cameron launches Cefinn fashion range Brexit export EU costs a 'nasty shock' for small business owners Samantha Cameron: I was terrible at waving to crowds Mrs Cameron worked as the director of fashion brand Smythson of Bond Street before her husband entered Downing Street in 2010. In 2017, after he had left office, she founded her own company, Cefinn, focusing on contemporary womenswear. In her first solo broadcast interview, Mrs Cameron was asked by Woman's Hour host Emma Barnett if her company had experienced any supply chain issues since the UK agreed its post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. She said: ""There's been a bit of that - I think a mixture of Covid and Brexit, actually, although there would be no issues trading with the US or outside the EU. ""Until they sort out some of [what] I hope [is] teething issues, definitely trading with the EU, if you're bringing goods into the country from outside the UK, and then trying to sell them back into Europe, that currently is challenging and difficult."" Mrs Cameron said her message to the latest of her husband's successors, Boris Johnson, was to ""talk to all the businesses out there who are in a similar position to me, of which there are lots"". She added: ""It is the smaller businesses [affected] because we can't afford to have warehouses in Europe and that sort of thing. And I'm sure there are ways of sorting it out. ""It does need to be looked at because otherwise we can't grow our business [and] if we can't grow our business, it is frustrating. ""Unless some of the expense and cost of doing that is looked at, it will be challenging."" Samantha Cameron standing next to her husband when he announced he was resigning as prime minister Mrs Cameron also spoke about the challenges facing the PM's fiancee, Carrie Symonds, agreeing that criticisms of her over advising the PM were sexist. The former No 10 resident said it was ""very unfair to pick [Ms Symonds] out as having some kind of undue influence"" and it was ""demeaning"" for Mr Johnson, who is ""quite able to take decisions"" for himself. Asked what advice she would give the PM's partner, Mrs Cameron said: ""You've got to find your own way. ""Do the things that you enjoy, do the things that you feel that you're good at and, you know, be supportive as you can to Boris.""

"There ""will be no interruption"" to UK vaccine supplies, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said, after the EU urged AstraZeneca to supply it with doses from UK plants. ""It is the case that the supplies that have been planned, paid for and scheduled should continue,"" he added. The EU and AstraZeneca are involved in a row over vaccine supply shortages. Meanwhile, Germany's vaccine committee has said the AstraZeneca vaccineshould only be given to people aged under 65. It cited a lack of sufficient data to recommend use in older age groups. What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Cough, fever or loss of smell: Could it be Covid? The EU has demanded that UK-made jabs are diverted to mainland Europe to fulfil contractual obligations. AstraZeneca has previously said it could deliver only a fraction of the doses between January and March that it had promised to the bloc, blaming production issues at EU plants for a reported 50 million-dose shortfall. However, they haveboth pledged to work together to resolve the crisis. Mr Gove said the UK must continue with the ""acceleration"" of its vaccine rollout, which relies on ""the supply schedule that has been agreed to be honoured"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""we all want to do everything possible"" to ensure that as many people in neighbouring countries are vaccinated, which he said was best achieved through ""dialogue and co-operation and friendship"". Pressed on whether the government will allow vaccines to go to the EU, he said: ""No"", adding that vaccine supplies ""that have been planned, paid for and scheduled should continue. ""There will be no interruption to that."" The prime minister's official spokesman said it ""remains our priority to vaccinate the most vulnerable across the UK"" when asked whether No 10 was considering the idea of sending jabs to the EU. Asked to clarify what he meant by ""most vulnerable"", he said that meant the top nine groups identified as most at risk - all those over 50, care home and health service staff and others at clinical risk - and the plan remained to vaccinate them by spring. He would not comment on whether that meant vaccines manufactured in the UK could be delivered to the EU after that date. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the UK government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said it was in the UK's ""national interests"" to ensure as many people in the world as possible were vaccinated. Asked if vaccine nationalism was a reality in Europe, he told the Today programme: ""Yes, I'm afraid it is and it's something that we absolutely have to negotiate, we have to avoid, and it doesn't serve anybody to have these fights over vaccine supply."" The UK government is taking a firm line on this - and for good reason it believes. It invested in the research done by Oxford University that developed this jab and was then quick to sign a deal with AstraZeneca for supply. The deal was done in May, three months before the EU signed its contract. That gave the UK a head start. The UK supply is manufactured here - at plants in Oxfordshire and Staffordshire. Some doses were sent to Germany and the Netherlands last year for a process called fill-and-finish, which involves putting it into vials. This is now being done at a plant in Wrexham, creating a complete UK supply chain. And that arrangement, AstraZeneca sources say, had no impact on the production problems the EU vaccine manufacturing plants experienced. Making a vaccine is a biological process - there are no guarantees in terms of quantity. The fact the UK was quick off the mark gave the UK plants more time to tweak the process to get a better yield. If the UK was to give the vaccine to the EU, why not then other countries? And would that be right when more than 1,000 people a day are dying with Covid here? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the ""war of words"" between the EU and AstraZeneca has ""got to be resolved"". He told LBC Radio that he wanted to rectify the issue by ""ramping up manufacture"" globally, but he did not want a solution that would ""interrupt"" the UK's vaccination effort. AstraZeneca has blamed supply issues on manufacturing problems in two plants - one in Belgium and another in the Netherlands. The EU, which signed a deal for 300 million doses in August, said it should not receive fewer doses just because the UK signed a contract with the UK-Swedish company earlier. EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said AstraZeneca's two UK plants ""had to deliver"" doses. Responding to Germany's recommendation that the AstraZeneca jab should only be given to the under 65s, Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at Public Health England, said: ""Both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are safe and provide high levels of protection against Covid-19, particularly against severe disease. ""There were too few cases in older people in the AstraZeneca trials to observe precise levels of protection in this group, but data on immune responses were very reassuring."" An AstraZeneca spokesperson said the latest analyses of clinical trial data for its vaccine ""support efficacy in the over 65 years age group"", adding that the firm was awaiting ""a regulatory decision on the vaccine by the European medicines Agency (EMA) in the coming days"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was not concerned by Germany's recommendation, adding that the UK's watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), had ""made it very clear"" that the AstraZeneca vaccine gives a ""high degree of protection after just one dose, and even more after two doses"". He added: ""The evidence that they've supplied is that they think it is effective across all age groups [and] provides a good immune response across all age groups, so I don't agree with that [Germany's recommendation]."" The UK government has promised to to deliver a first vaccine dose to 15 million of the most vulnerable by mid-February and to offer all adults their first dose by autumn. Latest figures show that more than 7.1 million people in the UK have now received a first jab. LOCKDOWN:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? TRAVEL:What are the UK's rules? Asked about Labour's calls for teachers to be vaccinated over half-term, Mr Gove said the government wanted to concentrate on vaccinating ""the most vulnerable first"", adding that any decision on who should be prioritised next would be based on scientific advice. He reiterated comments from England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, by saying that schools ""were in themselves safe"" but that children could pass on the virus to each other and then back into the community. Prof Van-Tam also told Wednesday's Downing Street briefing there was not a ""markedly increased rate of infection or mortality"" from Covid-19 among teachers. However, Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has contested that, saying that teachers ""by virtue of them having to go out and do a frontline facing job, are more at risk of catching Covid"". Pressed on why she was bringing herself into conflict with the scientific advice, she told the Today programme she said data showed ""all frontline key workers, including teachers... are more at risk of infection and death - that's a fact"". The UK recorded a further 1,239 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test on Thursday, according to government figures. There have also been another 28,680 new infections.

"The ongoing row over vaccine delays in the EU is making headlines Latest news of delays in deliveries of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNtech vaccines to the European Union has been received with anguish and impatience from commentators and leaders across the continent. While the EU comes in for some blame for the delays, there is also interest in looking to other companies to meet vaccination needs. Spanish daily El PaÃ­ssays the slow rollout is a ""lethal threat to the EU"" and distribution poses a ""political risk"" for the union. ""A failure of the vaccination plan would unleash a crisis of European institutions' competence and confidence in them, which is difficult to restore."" Blame might lie with the EU for ""massively overestimating"" the production capacities of manufacturers and ""underestimating"" the price, saysGerman public broadcaster ZDF. ""There is suspicion that manufacturers are  delivering faster to countries that are paying higher prices."" Czech daily Hospodarske Novinyalso pointed the finger at the EU, but added: ""Production and distribution of the vaccine is simply a global business, and logistical exercise on a scale that humankind has not yet experienced. And it would be a surprise if everything went smoothly."" ""Everyone has a right to the vaccine, and the best way to guarantee this right is to remain calm - politically, economically and individually,"" urgesBelgium's Le Soir. The idea of buying vaccines from elsewhere has been gaining ground in some parts of Europe. Hungarycontroversially decided to buy Russia's Sputnik V vaccine before it has received EU approval but now pro-government papers are weighing in.Magyar Hirlapargues that the Russian vaccine ""could be life-saving"" andMagyar Nemzetsays failure to get vaccines on time ""could take hundreds of thousands of lives"". But left-wing dailyNepszavaaccuses Prime Minister Viktor Orban of using the vaccine policy for his own political ends, so that he ""can say with a sly smile, you see, we have won again, we have just managed to overtake Brussels at the revolving door."" CroatianPrime Minister Andrej Plenkovicsays ""Covid-19 vaccine diplomacy is turning into vaccine hijacking"", but he's stated that Croatia has not  yet turned towards other vaccine manufacturers, due to the agreement stipulating that EU member states would not contact manufacturers themselves. On the possibility that Russia and China might step in to provide their own vaccines,Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babissaid ""if they want to supply a vaccine to the EU, they need to ask the EMA [for approval]"". Polish Health Minister Adam Niedzielskihas said that, though his government ""has no alternative plans to procure vaccines"", there are more reasons to buy additional vaccines, as producers do not always honour their commitments, according to Gazeta Wyborcza. The Polish government was ""analysing various opportunities, but the matter is rather delicate, so we cannot share any details"", it quoted him as saying. Romanian news outlet KrÃ³nikasuggests Hungary's decision to buy the Russian vaccine is entirely justifiable in the face of supply issues. ""The Hungarian leadership has at least made an effort to find a solution to the crisis,"" the outlet said. Calls for a more diverse vaccine provision are not limited to Central and Eastern Europe. InItaly, where the government said it would take legal action against Pfizer and AstraZeneca over the delays, the regional head of the department of health for Rome said the Sputnik V vaccine was ""needed"" and that the European Medicines Agency should approve it. ""This isn't about geopolitics: it's a race against the spread of the mutations,"" Alessio D'Amato said. What is happening with the EU vaccine rollout?

"Amateur investors are responding with outrage after trading platforms curbed buying of shares in the US games firm GameStop and other companies. The moves by Robinhood and Interactive Brokers follow days of frenzied trading that led to massive gains for some stocks. Shares in GameStop dived by as much as 55% after the restrictions. It is the latest twist in a battle that has pitted amateur investors against Wall Street giants. Major hedge funds had bet billions of dollars that GameStop's shares would fall. But they have faced major losses after amateurs, swapping tips on social media sites such as Reddit, drove up the share price by more than 700% in a week. Other firms, such as AMC Entertainment, Koss Corp and BlackBerry, also saw sharp gains. They were embraced by day traders after hedge funds bet against them. The activity has drawn questions from regulators, who are monitoring trading amid fears of illegal actions. GameStop: What is it and why is it trending? 'Failing' firm soars in value as amateurs buy stock Victims typically lose Â£45,000 in investment scams However, the amateur investors say they are just playing Wall Street at its own game. In online forums they discussed legal action and accused Robinhood and other brokerages enacting their own form of market manipulation by restricting purchases of certain shares. Robinhood co-founder Vladimir Tenev tweeted that the firm had taken its decision based on regulatory requirements, and said limited buys of the restricted stocks would be allowed from Friday.

Myron Sakkas says traders like him are angry ""They support a capitalist free market only when it works for them. What we saw today was not a free market and it forced an awful lot of people to lose an awful lot of money,"" said 18-year-old Myron Sakkas of Coventry, a student at Warwick University. Myron, who has had an account on the Trading 212 platform since August last year, said he had lost Â£30 on Gamestop shares, which he owned for ""a couple of hours"" and sold when he saw what was happening. Myron said he had since been locked out of his account and unable to use it while his identity is being checked. But when he gains access again, he plans to take out the Â£1,000 he has in it and call a halt. Though hoping to go into investment banking after he gets his degree, he said he was disillusioned by what he sees as ""market manipulation"" directed against people like him. ""When ordinary people try to make money in a system where only rich traders can make money, that's what happens,"" he told the BBC. ""Maybe I won't trade for a while, to be honest,"" he added. ""I've got other stuff to do."" Key to what's going on is ""short selling"" or ""shorting"", where a big investment company such as a hedge fund tries to make money by betting that a company's share price will fall. The hedge fund borrows shares in a company from other investors (for a fee) and sells the shares on the markets at, for example, $10 each, waits until they fall to $5, and buys them back. The borrowed shares are returned to the original owner, and the hedge fund pockets a profit. GameStop - which saw heavy losses last year and was described as ""failing"" by one big investor - is the most shorted stock on Wall Street. But in the last week, amateur investors who follow the Wall Street Bets forum on Reddit have poured money into buying the company's stock with the aim of pushing up the price. If the price rises dramatically, short sellers face big losses and they need to buy back the shares they have borrowed quickly to prevent bigger losses  - a process known as covering. However, buying back the shares only adds to demand for the stock and pushes its price higher still. And amateurs aren't the only ones getting in on the action. This week, for example, private equity firm Silver Lake Group, which had loaned money to AMC Entertainment, converted its bonds to shares after the surge in the firm's prices, a swap worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In the US, anger over the trading restrictions united politicians whose stances typically sharply diverge. Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who is taking over as chair of the banking committee, said he would hold a hearing about the ""state of the stock market"". ""People on Wall Street only care about the rules when they're the ones getting hurt,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Dave Portnoy, founder of the Barstool Sports blog, who has emerged as one of the most high-profile amateur traders during the pandemic, also attacked the restrictions, singling out Robinhood, which has cast itself as a platform aimed at making Wall Street more accessible.

A one-word tweet by the billionaire entrepreneur on Tuesday - he tweeted ""Gamestonk!!"" -had been seen as giving Gamestop shares an extra boost. The fracas follows a jump in casual investing during the pandemic, which saw people stuck at home with time on their hands and limited places to spend pour money into the market. This video can not be played Despite the economy shrinking, US stocks have rallied The surge has produced ripples of worry on Wall Street, including concerns that inexperienced investors could cause bubbles in certain stocks or were dabbling in investments with risks they did not fully understand. Robinhood - which has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the new interest in investing - has faced particular scrutiny for the way its app has made investment seem like a game. Last year, Massachusetts regulators filed a complaint accusing the company of marketing to inexperienced users and failing to protect them. Officials said this week they were following the market battle. Press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday President Joe Bidenâs economic team, including newly-appointed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, was âmonitoring the situationâ. Massachusetts state regulator William Galvin called on the New York Stock Exchange to suspend GameStop for 30 days to allow a cooling-off period.

"Schools may reopen in England from 8 March A UK-wide policy for reopening schools would make sense, Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has said. Mr Hart said differences between the nations on schools policy are confusing for parents and children. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has given the date of 8 March ""at the earliest"" for the reopening of schools in England, which have been closed across the UK during lockdown. The Welsh Government is yet to set such a date. There have been calls for ministers to say what milestones should be reachedbefore children return to classrooms. On Wednesday Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the situationhad not changed in Wales,externaland the first minister would be providing an update on Friday. Asked by BBC Wales whether he would like to see a similar target in set in Wales, Mr Hart said: ""I always think, and I thought right from the beginning, that if we can do these things on a UK-wide basis, it makes sense. ""It makes sense because public compliance is easier to achieve that way, people understand exactly what the rules are, what the restraints are, what the support might be, whether it's financial or otherwise."" Fifth of pupils in some schools lack digital device March 'earliest' England school return date When will schools reopen? He said where there are differences on Covid rules between the four nations ""it can be a bit confusing for parents and businesses and even kids too for that matter"". But, asked if he thought the Welsh Government should provide a detailed plan for coming out of lockdown, he said that setting out timescales for lifting restrictions ""is quite risky"". Simon Hart said UK-wide coronavirus policies make ""sense"" The Welsh secretary said Covid ""doesn't follow a predictable pattern"". ""The danger of me standing here now and saying it'll definitely be like this is it probably, definitely won't,"" he said. A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: ""As the first minister has said on many occasions, where we can work together as four nations it makes sense to do so. ""However, education is devolved to Wales and any decision on schools will be made by the first minister and the education minister."" Meanwhile Plaid Cymru has accused Labour of being split on making teachers a priority for vaccinations. While UK Labour has called for all teachers to be vaccinated in England, the Welsh Government has declined to put them in a priority list. Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman SiÃ¢n Gwenllian said that the safety of all pupils and school staff should be the main driver of policy in preparation for the reopening of schools. ""When it comes to vaccinating teachers, the Labour Party is facing both ways in Westminster and in Wales,"" she said. The party called for teachers to be vaccinated before schools reopen. The Welsh Government said: ""We are following the priority groups set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and all people in the highest priority groups will be immunised as safely and as soon as possible. ""Teaching staff, whose role it is to provide intimate personal care for some of our most vulnerable students (in school or college) with complex medical needs, are included as part of the priority list for vaccination along with social care workers."".

"The government has withdrawn a social media advert urging people to ""Stay Home. Save Lives"" after it was criticised for stereotyping women. The image showed women home schooling children and doing domestic chores, while the only man featured was depicted relaxing on a sofa. The infographic was withdrawn after going viral on social media and facing criticism for being ""sexist"". The government said the ad did ""not reflect"" its ""view on women"". Carrying the slogan ""Stay Home, Save lives. The new Covid-19 variant is spreading fast"", it was widely shared on social media earlier this week. Covid has 'devastating' impact on gender equality Covid 'could set women's equality back 25 years' 'Girl boss' ad banned for gender stereotyping Three scenes showed women cleaning, ironing and teaching children. Another depicted a family on a sofa, mother and daughter curled up beside a man who has his feet on the ground. Commenting on Instagram, Lorraine Candy, former editor of Sunday Times Style Magazine who reported on the advert, along with Glamour magazine, said: ""Are there no intelligent, smart women advising the government about this? I am perplexed by the lack of awareness."" Parenting blogger Anna Whitehouse said: ""Showing a man lounging about while women (and girls) 'do it all' may bear some truth but it can't be the blueprint from the top. How did this get signed off in 2021?"" For Labour, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson said the advert put ""women back 'in their place'"", adding: ""How out of touch can this government get?"" Conservative former minister Caroline Nokes, chair of the Women and Equalities Committee, also criticised the image, tweeting: ""Someone signed this off."" The prime minister's spokesman said : ""We have provided information for the public throughout the pandemic.[The advert] does not reflect our view on women and we have removed it."" The Advertising Standards Authority stipulates that campaigns ""must not include gender stereotypes that are likely to cause harm, or serious or widespread offence"". Amongscenarios it deems ""likely to be unacceptable"",externalis one ""that depicts a man with his feet up and family members creating mess around a home, while a woman is solely responsible for cleaning up the mess"". Another is an ""ad that belittles a man for carrying out stereotypically 'female' roles or tasks"". A report last November by the Fawcett Society, a charity campaigning for equal rights, found the pandemic was having a ""devastating"" effect on gender equality in the workplace, with women more likely than men to lose their jobs or be left dealing with childcare.

"Germany's government has been criticised for its vaccine programme's slow start Germany's vaccine committee has said AstraZeneca's Covid jab should only be given to people aged under 65. The committee cited ""insufficient data"" over its efficacy for older people. The European Medicines Agency is to decide on Friday whether to approve the vaccine for use across the EU. The UK has been using the AstraZeneca vaccine in its mass immunisation programme for weeks now, and public health officials say it is safe and provides ""high levels of protection"". The German announcement comes as the EU is in dispute with leading manufacturers over a shortage of vaccines on the continent. UK-based AstraZeneca has said production issues at its Europe-based plants mean it will be unable to deliver the promised number of doses to the bloc. But the EU says the firm must honour its commitments and deliver the jabs by diverting stock from the UK. It is calling on members to ""make use of all legal means"" to secure the supply. Pfizer-BioNTech has also cut the number of doses it is delivering to the 27-member bloc. What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? UK vaccine supplies 'won't be interrupted' EU vaccine delays prompt press frustration Is it OK to get a leftover Covid-19 vaccine? The independent vaccine commission advising the German government said there were ""currently insufficient data available to assess the vaccine efficacy from 65 years of age"" and recommended ""the AstraZeneca vaccine... should only be offered to people aged 18-64 years at each stage"". But Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisations at Public Health England, said both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are ""safe and provide high levels of protection against Covid-19. ""There were too few cases in older people in the AstraZeneca trials to observe precise levels of protection in this group, but data on immune responses were very reassuring."" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was not worried by the German recommendation, saying British health authorities had made clear the AstraZeneca vaccine was ""effective across all age groups"". Meanwhile, Paul Hunter, professor of Medicine at the University of East Anglia, told BBC News that the jab was safe for people over 65 ""almost certainly provides substantial benefits in terms of preventing severe disease and reduce the chances of going into hospital"". How effective is the Oxford vaccine? The global plan to share Covid-19 vaccines fairly All of the regulators and experts in different countries have been looking at the same data on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. That data comes from clinical trials, and those did recruit fewer elderly people overall. That's because they started off first with younger volunteers to get results as quickly as possible, given the urgency to find out if a vaccine would work well enough to help get us out of the pandemic. The scientists who ran the trials have always been upfront about this. But they say there is other evidence to suggest the vaccine will work well in older adults. Studies show the over 65s have a strong immune responses to the vaccine. After receiving the shots their blood has plenty of the required antibodies that can fight coronavirus. The UK has been using the AstraZeneca vaccine in its mass immunisation programme for weeks now and should soon have more proof from the real world setting about how much protection the shots give. The pace of the EU's vaccination programme has been criticised in recent weeks. There are shortages due to delays in shipments of both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which are the only ones currently approved for use in the block. Vaccination appointments are being delayed in many countries. In Madrid, Spain, authorities have suspended first doses of the vaccination for at least two weeks. Sweden was set to receive one million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in February but is now expected to get just 400,000 doses. European Council President Charles Michel commented on AstraZeneca's inability to provide all the doses expected over the coming weeks. ""If no satisfactory solution can be found, I believe we should explore all options and make use of all legal means and enforcement measures at our disposal,"" he said in a letter to EU leaders. Toned down rhetoric On Thursday the EU tried to dial down the emotion in its ongoing battle to get AstraZeneca to deliver the number of vaccines stipulated in their contract. Until now Brussels had reacted with outrage at the news it might only get a fraction of the vaccines expected from Astra Zeneca. Now it's toning down the rhetoric. Instead the president of the European Council threatened legal action. The EU has also stepped away from involving the UK in the row. It is still arguing that AstraZeneca should use its plants in the UK, as well as those in the EU, to supply the bloc with promised vaccines. Brussels also disagrees with the UK government that its contract with AstraZeneca should get priority as it was signed first. But in public, the European Commission was keen to underline today that its dispute was with AstraZeneca, not the UK government. The EU signed a deal with AstraZeneca in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more, but the UK-Swedish company has reported production delays at plants in the Netherlands and Belgium. AstraZeneca's CEO said production was ""basically two months behind where we wanted to be"". This video can not be played Stella Kyriakides: ""AstraZeneca needs to deliver on its commitments"" The EU had hoped that as soon as approval was given - which is expected on Friday - delivery would start straight away, but the production issues have dented this hope. Reports said last week the EU would get 60% fewer vaccine doses - about 50 million jabs - than promised in the first quarter of the year. The bloc is also facing delays with supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and it has a much bigger deal with the US-German vaccine maker. Both the EU and AstraZeneca have vowed to work together to resolve the problems.

"The Scottish government is to set out its budget plans for the year ahead on Thursday. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes will detail her tax and spending proposals against the continuing backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, the SNP government's partnership agreement with the Greens, and a fresh set of election pledges to be delivered. So how big is the Scottish budget, where does the money come from, and where is it likely to go? In 2022-23, the Scottish government's core revenue block grant - the cash it will have to spend on day-to-day matters - will be Â£35bn. Politicians, prone to such rows, are locked in a dispute about whether this is enough to be getting on with. The Conservatives point out that it is about 8% more than ministers typically had to spend prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the SNP note that it is still less than there was on hand over the past two years, when extra billions were ploughed in to fund relief programmes - and given the pandemic has not gone away, nor should the funding. This block grant - a share of the UK-wide budget as calculated viathe Barnett Formula- accounts for a fair chunk of the Scottish budget, but tax revenues raised in Scotland have played an increasingly large role in recent years. And as we saw throughout the pandemic, the measures announced now can be topped up on an ongoing basis through the year via ""Barnett consequentials"" - effectively Holyrood's share of cash committed to devolved areas by the UK government, which Scottish ministers can spend as they like. Leaving the row over how much money there is aside, it is clear that there is an ever-increasing list of demands on that funding which Ms Forbes will need to manage. The biggest wad of cash goes on health, which usually accounts for more than 40% of the overall spend. Covid has only boosted what was already a huge portfolio. The government has already committed to increasing health spending still further, with Nicola Sturgeon promising to increase investment by 20% over the parliamentary term. A ""significant down payment on that commitment"" is expected on Thursday. Social care is also set to suck up a fair chunk of the budget, even before the new National Care Service is set up.  For example, thedoubling of the Scottish Child Paymentis forecast to cost Â£90m next year, and more than Â£300m per year when fully rolled out. The next biggest recipient in the budget is generally local government, which takes about a quarter of the cash while delivering many core services from schools to bin collections. There are always calls for town halls to be given more funding - or the power to raise it themselves via council tax hikes - and this debate is likely to be intensified in light of the role they played in the pandemic, and indeed local elections coming up in May. Education, transport and justice also take up hefty chunks of spending, with funding for the likes of the police usually likely to be maintained if not increased. There will also likely be extra support for businesses, as efforts to get them back on their feet post-pandemic continue. This has implications, however - theFraser of Allander Institute estimates,externalthat the current set of rates reliefs for tourism, hospitality and leisure firms costs the government around Â£736m in reduced revenue. Ms Forbes faces a decision over how far and how long she should continue to fund such programmes. And there is also sure to be a focus on environmental initiatives, with Greens in government and COP26 still large in the memory. This will likely range across a number of portfolios, with everything from low-carbon transport to renewable energy and ""just transition"" funding to support jobs during the move away from oil and gas. Since 2018, Scotland has hada separate system of income taxrates and bands to the rest of the UK. This added two extra tax rates - one just below the basic rate, providing a break for low earners, and just one above it, to squeeze a little more from those who earn above the median wage. Meanwhile, the higher and top rates of tax are both a percentage point higher than elsewhere in the UK, in what the finance secretary terms a ""progressive"" move to bolster local services. and thresholds 19% starter rateÂ£12,500 to Â£14,585 20% basic rateÂ£14,585 to Â£25,158 21% middle rateÂ£25,158 to Â£43,430 41% higher rateÂ£43,430 to Â£150,000 46% top rateÂ£150,000 and up It seems unlikely the government will make big changes again, with the SNP having pledged in May's election manifesto that it would ""freeze income tax rates and bands"". Scottish income tax - how it affects you Ms Forbes could potentially tinker with the thresholds - the point at which the various rates kick in. The Fraser of Allander Institute reckon that freezing thresholds, rather than raising them in line with inflation, would generate an extra Â£140m of revenues. However, this would constitute a tax increase, which may not be popular at a time whenNational Insurance Contributions are also going up. One thing to watch out for alongside the budget is the latest set of forecasts from the Scottish Fiscal Commission, which may provide an insight into the impact of the pandemic, the recovery of the economy and the employment market through 2022. Kate Forbes won't need to negotiate with opposition parties for the next five years In previous years, this was the part of the budget that really got people excited at Holyrood - the political horse-trading where Ms Forbes would bargain with opposition parties to thrash out a budget deal. However, with the Scottish Greens joining the SNP in government, this backroom intrigue has disappeared. There will still be some discussion within St Andrews House about what should be in the budget, and Ms Forbes may still meet with other parties for the sake of appearances. But with the votes of the seven Green MSPs locked in, the plans announced on Thursday will not need to be revised - and the budget bill looks set to coast through parliament with minimal fuss.

"This video can not be played Stella Kyriakides: ""AstraZeneca needs to deliver on its commitments"" The EU and the UK-based Covid vaccine maker AstraZeneca have vowed to work together to resolve a bitter row over supply shortages to the bloc. AstraZeneca had agreed to deliver millions of doses in January-March but then said significantly fewer jabs would arrive on time. It blamed production problems at European plants. The EU is demanding the firm divert jabs from the UK. The UK government has said there ""will be no interruption"" to UK supply. Cabinet Minister Michael Gove said it was ""critical"" to make sure that the ""schedule that has been agreed and on which our vaccine has been based goes ahead"". The EU signed a deal with AstraZeneca in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more, but the UK-Swedish company has reported production delays at plants in the Netherlands and Belgium. AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said production was ""basically two months behind where we wanted to be"". UK factories have not experienced problems. On Thursday, scientific adviser to the UK government Sir Jeremy Farrar urged against vaccine nationalism, saying ""it doesn't serve anybody to have these fights over vaccine supply"". What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? Vaccine plant evacuated over suspicious package The global plan to share Covid-19 vaccines fairly The contract between the EU and AstraZeneca contains a confidentiality clause - but the EU has asked the company to release the details nevertheless. The EU says the shortfall is greater than previous reports suggested. Instead of receiving around 100 million doses before the end of March, they are now expecting 25 million, one official said on Wednesday. The AstraZeneca vaccine, developed with Oxford University, has not yet been approved by the EU, although this is expected on Friday. The EU has been criticised for the slow rollout of inoculations for its population of around 450 million. It has a much bigger vaccine deal with US-German vaccine-maker Pfizer-BioNTech but it is also facing delays in supplies. The dispute comes as countries globally race to get their hands on vaccines to protect populations against Covid-19 and deal with the fallout of the pandemic. After crisis talks on Wednesday between the EU and AstraZeneca, EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides expressed regret over the ""continued lack of clarity on the delivery schedule"". ""We will work with the company to find solutions and deliver vaccines rapidly for EU citizens,"",externalshe tweeted. An AstraZeneca spokesman said the company had ""committed to even closer co-ordination to jointly chart a path for the delivery of our vaccine over the coming months"". Before the talks, Ms Kyriakides insisted that UK factories were part of the EU's deal with the company. Covid map: Where have the 100m cases been? Some symptoms 'more common' with new variant In an interview on Tuesday with Italian newspaper La Repubblica, AstraZenecaCEO Pascal Soriot said the contract compelled it to make its ""best effort"", rather than obliging it to meet a set deadline for delivery of the vaccines,external. Ms Kyriakides said this characterisation of the deal was ""not correct or acceptable"". She added that the EU rejected ""the logic of first-come first-serve"". ""That may work at the neighbourhood butcher's but not in contracts, and not in our advanced purchase agreements."" Ms Kyriakides appeared to be responding to Mr Soriot, who said that the UK had signed its contract with AstraZeneca three months before the EU and that this extra time had been used to ""fix all the glitches we experienced"" regarding the UK. The EU had hoped that, as soon as approval was given, delivery would start straight away, with some 80 million doses arriving in the 27 nations by March. However the delays reported by AstraZeneca have dented that hope. Italy was among the countries threatening to sue over the delays.  448mEU population 8.4mPeople received vaccine so far (1.9%) 2.3bnDoses ordered overall 400mDoses ordered from AstraZeneca (Not yet EMA approved) - 17% of total Officials have not confirmed publicly how big the shortfall will be, but Reuters news agency reported that deliveries would be reduced to 31 million in the first quarter of this year. The EU has also ordered 2.3 billion doses of vaccines from four other companies, of which only those of Pfizer/BioNTech (600 million) and Moderna (160 million) have been approved. Pfizer has not been able to supply the 12.5 million vaccines it promised the EU by the end of 2020, saying last week it was delaying shipments for the next few weeks because of work to increase capacity at its Belgian processing plant. As a result of delays, Spanish officials said the Madrid region was halting almost all vaccinations for two weeks and supplies in Catalonia were also threatened. The EU has threatened to restrict the exports of vaccines made within the bloc to deal with the shortfall. What is happening with the EU vaccine rollout?

"This video can not be played Samantha Cameron tells Emma Barnett about the impact Brexit is having on her business. Samantha Cameron says her fashion brand is finding post-Brexit trading with the EU ""challenging and difficult"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, she said there were ""teething issues"" in trading with the bloc and appealed to government to talk to small firms. Mrs Cameron said she discusses the problems with her husband, ex-Prime Minister David Cameron, who called the EU referendum and campaigned to remain. ""[We] definitely deal with having this problem at work,"" she added. Cameron launches Cefinn fashion range Brexit export EU costs a 'nasty shock' for small business owners Samantha Cameron: I was terrible at waving to crowds Mrs Cameron worked as the director of fashion brand Smythson of Bond Street before her husband entered Downing Street in 2010. In 2017, after he had left office, she founded her own company, Cefinn, focusing on contemporary womenswear. In her first solo broadcast interview, Mrs Cameron was asked by Woman's Hour host Emma Barnett if her company had experienced any supply chain issues since the UK agreed its post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. She said: ""There's been a bit of that - I think a mixture of Covid and Brexit, actually, although there would be no issues trading with the US or outside the EU. ""Until they sort out some of [what] I hope [is] teething issues, definitely trading with the EU, if you're bringing goods into the country from outside the UK, and then trying to sell them back into Europe, that currently is challenging and difficult."" Mrs Cameron said her message to the latest of her husband's successors, Boris Johnson, was to ""talk to all the businesses out there who are in a similar position to me, of which there are lots"". She added: ""It is the smaller businesses [affected] because we can't afford to have warehouses in Europe and that sort of thing. And I'm sure there are ways of sorting it out. ""It does need to be looked at because otherwise we can't grow our business [and] if we can't grow our business, it is frustrating. ""Unless some of the expense and cost of doing that is looked at, it will be challenging."" Samantha Cameron standing next to her husband when he announced he was resigning as prime minister Mrs Cameron also spoke about the challenges facing the PM's fiancee, Carrie Symonds, agreeing that criticisms of her over advising the PM were sexist. The former No 10 resident said it was ""very unfair to pick [Ms Symonds] out as having some kind of undue influence"" and it was ""demeaning"" for Mr Johnson, who is ""quite able to take decisions"" for himself. Asked what advice she would give the PM's partner, Mrs Cameron said: ""You've got to find your own way. ""Do the things that you enjoy, do the things that you feel that you're good at and, you know, be supportive as you can to Boris.""

"Covid-19 was first detected in Wuhan in late 2019 A World Health Organization (WHO) team has come out of quarantine and will start on-the-ground investigations into the origins of the coronavirus in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The scientists will begin interviewing people from research institutes, hospitals and the seafood market linked to the initial outbreak. Their research will rely upon evidence provided by Chinese officials. This comes after months of negotiations between the WHO and Beijing. Some relatives of Covid-19 victims in China are hoping to meet with the investigators.  Zhang Hai, a Wuhan native whose father died in February, told the BBC he hopes speaking to the WHO can ""aid their investigation"". The group of 13 experts arrived in Wuhan on 14 January, and spent two weeks in quarantine that ended on Thursday. While in isolation, the team had been in video calls with each other and Chinese scientists. On Thursday afternoon they exited their hotel and boarded a bus without speaking to journalists. Earlier in the day members of the team tweeted about the end of their quarantine, including pictures of themselves receiving letters certifying they had completed medical isolation. ""New phase, new priorities,"" tweeted Dutch virologist Marion Koopmans. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Thea Fischer, a Danish member of the investigation team, told Reuters news agency that going outside after quarantining ""is just as if one has landed from the moon"". ""I lived opposite two of the others in the team, so it was my hope that every time they knocked on the door, that the other two also went out and had their temperature measured, so you could at least exchange a few words and see a human being,"" she said on Thursday. The WHOhad said its investigators were denied entry into Chinaafter one member of the team was turned back and another got stuck in transit. Beijing later said it was a misunderstanding. Covid-19 was first detected in Wuhan in late 2019, but China has been saying for months that it is not necessarily the place where the virus originated from. State media have recently suggested the pandemic might have begun outside of China - Spain, Italy or even the US - and have also carried claims that the virus has been entering the country through frozen food imports, though experts have cast doubt on this. Searching for answers in Wuhan China's painful year of fighting the virus Wuhan marks its anniversary with triumph and denial On Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki raised concern about ""misinformation"" from ""some sources in China"" and said it was ""imperative we get to the bottom"" of where the virus originated and how it was able to spread worldwide. Her comments sparked outrage in China with Zhao Lijian, the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, calling on the US to ""respect facts and science, respect the hard work"" of the WHO experts. In an earlier interview with the BBC, Professor Dale Fisher, chair of the global outbreak and response unit at the WHO, said he hoped the world would consider the investigation in Wuhan a scientific visit. ""It's not about politics or blame but getting to the bottom of a scientific question,"" he said. Prof Fisher added that most scientists believed that the virus was a ""natural event"". It was initially believed the virus originated in a market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat. It was suggested that this was where the virus made the leap from animals to humans. Meanwhilea year on since the outbreak began in Wuhanseveral families of Covid-19 victims are still looking for answers. ""I think it's necessary that the experts meet me and other people who have lost family members to the virus, and hear from our experiences,"" said Mr Zhang. ""I hope the WHO will not be used as a tool to spread lies,"" the 51-year-old told the BBC. Zhang Hai (right) and his late father Mr Zhang said he believes delayed reporting about the virus by Wuhan city officials in the initial days of the outbreak had cost his father his life. His family had travelled to the city in January last year from the city of Shenzhen, where they currently live, so that Mr Zhang's father could receive subsidised surgery for a leg fracture. The surgery was successful, but Mr Zhang's father then contracted Covid-19 and subsequently died. ""If it was made known that there was a virus outbreak in the city, we wouldn't have gone there,"" he said. ""By covering up that fact at the time, many lives were lost, so the Wuhan government has knowingly committed murder. They need to be held accountable for that. Until I get an official apology from the local authorities over what happened to my father, I will not give up."" Local government officials in Wuhan and its surrounding Hubei province have been accused of downplaying the virus in the early days of the pandemic, and several were fired last year. Mr Zhang claimed Chinese authorities have blocked his online calls for accountability as well as efforts to organise other families of Covid victims. He said a WeChat group formed by the families that had at least 80 members was deleted recently without explanation. Six separate accounts which Mr Zhang had set up on microblogging platform Weibo to share his story have also been blocked. ""Every time I write something, it'll just get blocked,"" he told the BBC. Mr Zhang said police have paid visits to his home in Shenzhen as well, and in November last year he was summoned to a police station for questioning. But he remains unafraid about potential repercussions. ""I know I have done nothing wrong,"" he said.

"There ""will be no interruption"" to UK vaccine supplies, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said, after the EU urged AstraZeneca to supply it with doses from UK plants. ""It is the case that the supplies that have been planned, paid for and scheduled should continue,"" he added. The EU and AstraZeneca are involved in a row over vaccine supply shortages. Meanwhile, Germany's vaccine committee has said the AstraZeneca vaccineshould only be given to people aged under 65. It cited a lack of sufficient data to recommend use in older age groups. What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Cough, fever or loss of smell: Could it be Covid? The EU has demanded that UK-made jabs are diverted to mainland Europe to fulfil contractual obligations. AstraZeneca has previously said it could deliver only a fraction of the doses between January and March that it had promised to the bloc, blaming production issues at EU plants for a reported 50 million-dose shortfall. However, they haveboth pledged to work together to resolve the crisis. Mr Gove said the UK must continue with the ""acceleration"" of its vaccine rollout, which relies on ""the supply schedule that has been agreed to be honoured"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""we all want to do everything possible"" to ensure that as many people in neighbouring countries are vaccinated, which he said was best achieved through ""dialogue and co-operation and friendship"". Pressed on whether the government will allow vaccines to go to the EU, he said: ""No"", adding that vaccine supplies ""that have been planned, paid for and scheduled should continue. ""There will be no interruption to that."" The prime minister's official spokesman said it ""remains our priority to vaccinate the most vulnerable across the UK"" when asked whether No 10 was considering the idea of sending jabs to the EU. Asked to clarify what he meant by ""most vulnerable"", he said that meant the top nine groups identified as most at risk - all those over 50, care home and health service staff and others at clinical risk - and the plan remained to vaccinate them by spring. He would not comment on whether that meant vaccines manufactured in the UK could be delivered to the EU after that date. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the UK government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said it was in the UK's ""national interests"" to ensure as many people in the world as possible were vaccinated. Asked if vaccine nationalism was a reality in Europe, he told the Today programme: ""Yes, I'm afraid it is and it's something that we absolutely have to negotiate, we have to avoid, and it doesn't serve anybody to have these fights over vaccine supply."" The UK government is taking a firm line on this - and for good reason it believes. It invested in the research done by Oxford University that developed this jab and was then quick to sign a deal with AstraZeneca for supply. The deal was done in May, three months before the EU signed its contract. That gave the UK a head start. The UK supply is manufactured here - at plants in Oxfordshire and Staffordshire. Some doses were sent to Germany and the Netherlands last year for a process called fill-and-finish, which involves putting it into vials. This is now being done at a plant in Wrexham, creating a complete UK supply chain. And that arrangement, AstraZeneca sources say, had no impact on the production problems the EU vaccine manufacturing plants experienced. Making a vaccine is a biological process - there are no guarantees in terms of quantity. The fact the UK was quick off the mark gave the UK plants more time to tweak the process to get a better yield. If the UK was to give the vaccine to the EU, why not then other countries? And would that be right when more than 1,000 people a day are dying with Covid here? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the ""war of words"" between the EU and AstraZeneca has ""got to be resolved"". He told LBC Radio that he wanted to rectify the issue by ""ramping up manufacture"" globally, but he did not want a solution that would ""interrupt"" the UK's vaccination effort. AstraZeneca has blamed supply issues on manufacturing problems in two plants - one in Belgium and another in the Netherlands. The EU, which signed a deal for 300 million doses in August, said it should not receive fewer doses just because the UK signed a contract with the UK-Swedish company earlier. EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said AstraZeneca's two UK plants ""had to deliver"" doses. Responding to Germany's recommendation that the AstraZeneca jab should only be given to the under 65s, Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at Public Health England, said: ""Both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are safe and provide high levels of protection against Covid-19, particularly against severe disease. ""There were too few cases in older people in the AstraZeneca trials to observe precise levels of protection in this group, but data on immune responses were very reassuring."" An AstraZeneca spokesperson said the latest analyses of clinical trial data for its vaccine ""support efficacy in the over 65 years age group"", adding that the firm was awaiting ""a regulatory decision on the vaccine by the European medicines Agency (EMA) in the coming days"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was not concerned by Germany's recommendation, adding that the UK's watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), had ""made it very clear"" that the AstraZeneca vaccine gives a ""high degree of protection after just one dose, and even more after two doses"". He added: ""The evidence that they've supplied is that they think it is effective across all age groups [and] provides a good immune response across all age groups, so I don't agree with that [Germany's recommendation]."" The UK government has promised to to deliver a first vaccine dose to 15 million of the most vulnerable by mid-February and to offer all adults their first dose by autumn. Latest figures show that more than 7.1 million people in the UK have now received a first jab. LOCKDOWN:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? TRAVEL:What are the UK's rules? Asked about Labour's calls for teachers to be vaccinated over half-term, Mr Gove said the government wanted to concentrate on vaccinating ""the most vulnerable first"", adding that any decision on who should be prioritised next would be based on scientific advice. He reiterated comments from England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, by saying that schools ""were in themselves safe"" but that children could pass on the virus to each other and then back into the community. Prof Van-Tam also told Wednesday's Downing Street briefing there was not a ""markedly increased rate of infection or mortality"" from Covid-19 among teachers. However, Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has contested that, saying that teachers ""by virtue of them having to go out and do a frontline facing job, are more at risk of catching Covid"". Pressed on why she was bringing herself into conflict with the scientific advice, she told the Today programme she said data showed ""all frontline key workers, including teachers... are more at risk of infection and death - that's a fact"".

"Nissan has committed to making cars at its Sunderland plant The number of new cars built in the UK last year fell by a third to just under 921,000, the lowest total since 1984, latest industry figures reveal. Output was 920,928 vehicles, a 29.3% fall on 2019, rounding off a ""dreadful year"", Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders chief Mike Hawes said. Pandemic-enforced plant closures and falling consumer demand meant the worst output ""in a generation"", he said. But he said the vaccine roll out and EU trade deal inspired optimism for 2021 Production for UK and export markets fell 30.4% and 29.1% respectively last year. Eight in ten UK-built cars still head overseas, which Mr Hawes said reinforced the importance of tariff-free trade with the EU. The EU remained the UK's biggest export destination, taking a 53.5% share, despite volumes falling 30.8% to 400,460 units. In December, output was down 2.3% to 71,403 vehicles, with some manufacturers, including Honda, affected by border closures and subsequent component supply issues. Nissan commits to keep making cars in Sunderland Future of Vauxhall car plant hangs in the balance Honda factory temporarily suspends production Shipments to the US, Japan and Australia last year all fell, down 33.7%, 21.6% and 21.8% respectively. Exports to China, however, ended the year up 2.3%, and those to South Korea and Taiwan also rose 3.6% and 16.7% respectively as these nations travelled on different trajectories in dealing with the pandemic. Despite the gloom, the UK continued to roll out battery electric, plug-hybrid and hybrid vehicles to buyers at home and around the world. Combined production of these models rose to 18.8% of all cars made in Britain, up from 14.8% a year before. Mr Hawes said: ""These figures, the worst in a generation, reflect the devastating impact of the pandemic... The industry faces 2021 with more optimism, however, with a vaccine being rolled out and clarity on how we trade with Europe, which remains by far our biggest market. ""The immediate challenge is to adapt to the new conditions, to overcome the additional customs burdens and regain our global competitiveness while delivering zero emission transport."" Independent forecasts say UK car production will partly recover in 2021 to one million, but Mr Hawes said much will depend on the continued impact of the virus, the speed with which showrooms can reopen, and how quickly manufacturers can come to terms with new trading arrangements with the EU, which he described as ""much more complicated"". He hoped the latest figures reflected the ""lowest ebb"" for the industry, but added that significant investment would be needed to return to the figure of 1.7 million reported in 2016. This is terrible news for car makers and workers, and in the old days when economic growth was the overriding indicator of a nation's success, it would be 100% bad. But now climate change is also a priority, and some argue that requires a new perspective. If fewer cars are bought, it's likely to mean fewer miles driven - and that's exactly what the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says we need to combat climate change and air pollution (which is still produced even from electric car tyres and brakes). The young are already shunning driving in favour of Uber in a trend that will swell if driverless taxis ever hit the road. Many city councils want green, calm streets with people walking and cycling on space taken back from cars. Suppose a two-car family sells one and buys a bike: is this a fear, or an aspiration - or both?

"There ""will be no interruption"" to UK vaccine supplies, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said, after the EU urged AstraZeneca to supply it with doses from UK plants. ""It is the case that the supplies that have been planned, paid for and scheduled should continue,"" he added. The EU and AstraZeneca are involved in a row over vaccine supply shortages. Meanwhile, Germany's vaccine committee has said the AstraZeneca vaccineshould only be given to people aged under 65. It cited a lack of sufficient data to recommend use in older age groups. What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Cough, fever or loss of smell: Could it be Covid? The EU has demanded that UK-made jabs are diverted to mainland Europe to fulfil contractual obligations. AstraZeneca has previously said it could deliver only a fraction of the doses between January and March that it had promised to the bloc, blaming production issues at EU plants for a reported 50 million-dose shortfall. However, they haveboth pledged to work together to resolve the crisis. Mr Gove said the UK must continue with the ""acceleration"" of its vaccine rollout, which relies on ""the supply schedule that has been agreed to be honoured"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""we all want to do everything possible"" to ensure that as many people in neighbouring countries are vaccinated, which he said was best achieved through ""dialogue and co-operation and friendship"". Pressed on whether the government will allow vaccines to go to the EU, he said: ""No"", adding that vaccine supplies ""that have been planned, paid for and scheduled should continue. ""There will be no interruption to that."" The prime minister's official spokesman said it ""remains our priority to vaccinate the most vulnerable across the UK"" when asked whether No 10 was considering the idea of sending jabs to the EU. Asked to clarify what he meant by ""most vulnerable"", he said that meant the top nine groups identified as most at risk - all those over 50, care home and health service staff and others at clinical risk - and the plan remained to vaccinate them by spring. He would not comment on whether that meant vaccines manufactured in the UK could be delivered to the EU after that date. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the UK government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said it was in the UK's ""national interests"" to ensure as many people in the world as possible were vaccinated. Asked if vaccine nationalism was a reality in Europe, he told the Today programme: ""Yes, I'm afraid it is and it's something that we absolutely have to negotiate, we have to avoid, and it doesn't serve anybody to have these fights over vaccine supply."" The UK government is taking a firm line on this - and for good reason it believes. It invested in the research done by Oxford University that developed this jab and was then quick to sign a deal with AstraZeneca for supply. The deal was done in May, three months before the EU signed its contract. That gave the UK a head start. The UK supply is manufactured here - at plants in Oxfordshire and Staffordshire. Some doses were sent to Germany and the Netherlands last year for a process called fill-and-finish, which involves putting it into vials. This is now being done at a plant in Wrexham, creating a complete UK supply chain. And that arrangement, AstraZeneca sources say, had no impact on the production problems the EU vaccine manufacturing plants experienced. Making a vaccine is a biological process - there are no guarantees in terms of quantity. The fact the UK was quick off the mark gave the UK plants more time to tweak the process to get a better yield. If the UK was to give the vaccine to the EU, why not then other countries? And would that be right when more than 1,000 people a day are dying with Covid here? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the ""war of words"" between the EU and AstraZeneca has ""got to be resolved"".

"After the news that British residents arriving in England from Covid hotspots will have to quarantine in hotels, many would-be holidaymakers are thinking of opting for UK destinations this summer. Understandably, they don't want to undergo the ""managed isolation process"" requiring them to spend 10 days in a hotel on their return to the UK. But there may be a shortage of the kind of UK accommodation they are looking for, say providers of holiday lets. From cottages to campsites, demand is on the increase. Even the UK's luxury hotels are expecting the move to give them a boost. Arrivals from Covid hotspots face hotel quarantine Which UK arrivals have to quarantine in a hotel? Sarah and Steve Jarvis, who run theIndependent Cottages,externalwebsite listing more than 1,800 properties, say inquiries during the current lockdown in England are 300% up on the first lockdown in March to July 2020. However, they also point out that many properties still need to honour bookings that were rolled over from 2020 because of earlier virus curbs, restricting availability for new requests. ""People started the year with bookings already in the calendar,"" Sarah told the BBC. ""We're going to end up in a situation where we have demand outstripping supply again."" ""It's almost like the perfect storm,"" adds Steve. ""People will be hesitant about going abroad with the new travel restrictions and the UK is looking like a very good option. ""People have got confidence in UK self-catering holidays, because the bookings are coming in thick and fast."" Sarah and Steve Jarvis say demand for cottages is high In normal times, says Sarah, people are looking for accommodation for an average of four people to go away on holiday together. But at the moment, they are getting lots of inquiries for groups of up to nine people, as extended families or groups of friends seek to make up for the family Christmas celebrations they missed out on. ""Families are going to go away and they want to take their parents with them,"" Sarah says. ""It's a safe option for elderly relatives."" Unusually, some are also booking ahead for next Christmas already. ""Straight after Boxing Day, people usually start thinking about summer holidays, but we're also seeing very early bookings for the festive season,"" says Steve. Another holiday provider,holidaycottages.co.uk,external, says it has seen a sharp increase in demand since mid-January. The firm's chief marketing officer, James Starkey, says: ""In the past week, bookings taken for May half-term onwards are up 39% compared to last year, with the summer holidays up 98%. We do still have just over half of our properties available for seven-night breaks in the summer holidays but, with them booking more quickly this year, we anticipate another strong summer for the UK staycation industry."" Trencreek Holiday Park owner Julliette Hautot is seeing a rise in demand AtTrencreek Holiday Park,externalin Newquay, Cornwall, there is definitely a pick-up in interest from holidaymakers. The park offers a mixture of camping and self-catering accommodation, covering a wide range of travel needs. ""Since Monday, the phone's been getting a lot busier,"" says Julliette Hautot, who runs the business with her husband. ""The calls are on the up and it's definitely going to be busy for the summer,"" she told the BBC. ""Slots are filling up for July and August. There's not a lot left, especially for the school holidays."" She is also noticing more inquiries for September than usual, perhaps reflecting a feeling that pandemic restrictions will ease later rather than sooner. Hotels are noticing the staycation trend as well. TheBest Western,externalchain has just done a survey of 6,000 of its UK customers and found that 90% of them felt safer holidaying in Britain this summer rather than abroad. ""With the worries around quarantine, we are now starting to see bookings landing for the big summer months coming through in the last 24 hours,"" spokesperson Andrew Denton told the BBC. ""The experience of last summer has taught people not to leave it to the last minute as Britain gets booked, so to book ahead and quit worrying about quarantine, which might impact an international trip."" At the upper end of the spectrum, the UK's luxury hotels are anticipating opportunities as a result of the hotel quarantine measures for international travel. Pride of Britain Hotels,external, a collection of 50 of independently-owned luxury hotels including the Athenaeum in London's Mayfair, says the measures are set to benefit home-grown tourism. ""Anything that makes international travel more difficult will clearly add to the appeal of a holiday taken within one's own country this year,"" said the consortium's chief executive, Peter Hancock. ""For luxury hotels in the UK, we believe there is huge pent-up demand that is just waiting for the restrictions to be eased. ""It could be a brilliant summer for domestic tourism, marking a desperately-needed return to profitability in our sector.""

"The Scottish government is to set out its budget plans for the year ahead on Thursday. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes will detail her tax and spending proposals against the continuing backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, the SNP government's partnership agreement with the Greens, and a fresh set of election pledges to be delivered. So how big is the Scottish budget, where does the money come from, and where is it likely to go? In 2022-23, the Scottish government's core revenue block grant - the cash it will have to spend on day-to-day matters - will be Â£35bn. Politicians, prone to such rows, are locked in a dispute about whether this is enough to be getting on with. The Conservatives point out that it is about 8% more than ministers typically had to spend prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the SNP note that it is still less than there was on hand over the past two years, when extra billions were ploughed in to fund relief programmes - and given the pandemic has not gone away, nor should the funding. This block grant - a share of the UK-wide budget as calculated viathe Barnett Formula- accounts for a fair chunk of the Scottish budget, but tax revenues raised in Scotland have played an increasingly large role in recent years. And as we saw throughout the pandemic, the measures announced now can be topped up on an ongoing basis through the year via ""Barnett consequentials"" - effectively Holyrood's share of cash committed to devolved areas by the UK government, which Scottish ministers can spend as they like. Leaving the row over how much money there is aside, it is clear that there is an ever-increasing list of demands on that funding which Ms Forbes will need to manage. The biggest wad of cash goes on health, which usually accounts for more than 40% of the overall spend. Covid has only boosted what was already a huge portfolio. The government has already committed to increasing health spending still further, with Nicola Sturgeon promising to increase investment by 20% over the parliamentary term. A ""significant down payment on that commitment"" is expected on Thursday. Social care is also set to suck up a fair chunk of the budget, even before the new National Care Service is set up.  For example, thedoubling of the Scottish Child Paymentis forecast to cost Â£90m next year, and more than Â£300m per year when fully rolled out. The next biggest recipient in the budget is generally local government, which takes about a quarter of the cash while delivering many core services from schools to bin collections. There are always calls for town halls to be given more funding - or the power to raise it themselves via council tax hikes - and this debate is likely to be intensified in light of the role they played in the pandemic, and indeed local elections coming up in May. Education, transport and justice also take up hefty chunks of spending, with funding for the likes of the police usually likely to be maintained if not increased. There will also likely be extra support for businesses, as efforts to get them back on their feet post-pandemic continue. This has implications, however - theFraser of Allander Institute estimates,externalthat the current set of rates reliefs for tourism, hospitality and leisure firms costs the government around Â£736m in reduced revenue. Ms Forbes faces a decision over how far and how long she should continue to fund such programmes. And there is also sure to be a focus on environmental initiatives, with Greens in government and COP26 still large in the memory. This will likely range across a number of portfolios, with everything from low-carbon transport to renewable energy and ""just transition"" funding to support jobs during the move away from oil and gas. Since 2018, Scotland has hada separate system of income taxrates and bands to the rest of the UK. This added two extra tax rates - one just below the basic rate, providing a break for low earners, and just one above it, to squeeze a little more from those who earn above the median wage. Meanwhile, the higher and top rates of tax are both a percentage point higher than elsewhere in the UK, in what the finance secretary terms a ""progressive"" move to bolster local services. and thresholds 19% starter rateÂ£12,500 to Â£14,585 20% basic rateÂ£14,585 to Â£25,158 21% middle rateÂ£25,158 to Â£43,430 41% higher rateÂ£43,430 to Â£150,000 46% top rateÂ£150,000 and up It seems unlikely the government will make big changes again, with the SNP having pledged in May's election manifesto that it would ""freeze income tax rates and bands"". Scottish income tax - how it affects you Ms Forbes could potentially tinker with the thresholds - the point at which the various rates kick in. The Fraser of Allander Institute reckon that freezing thresholds, rather than raising them in line with inflation, would generate an extra Â£140m of revenues. However, this would constitute a tax increase, which may not be popular at a time whenNational Insurance Contributions are also going up. One thing to watch out for alongside the budget is the latest set of forecasts from the Scottish Fiscal Commission, which may provide an insight into the impact of the pandemic, the recovery of the economy and the employment market through 2022. Kate Forbes won't need to negotiate with opposition parties for the next five years In previous years, this was the part of the budget that really got people excited at Holyrood - the political horse-trading where Ms Forbes would bargain with opposition parties to thrash out a budget deal. However, with the Scottish Greens joining the SNP in government, this backroom intrigue has disappeared. There will still be some discussion within St Andrews House about what should be in the budget, and Ms Forbes may still meet with other parties for the sake of appearances. But with the votes of the seven Green MSPs locked in, the plans announced on Thursday will not need to be revised - and the budget bill looks set to coast through parliament with minimal fuss.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is visiting Scotland despite the country's first minister questioning whether the trip is necessary during lockdown The EU and the UK-based Covid vaccine maker AstraZeneca have vowed to work together to resolve a bitter row over supply shortages to the 27-member bloc Germany is likely to face a vaccine shortage until at least April, its health minister warns - and it may limit the AstraZeneca jab to under-65s It would be ""premature to imagine"" lockdown restrictions in England will be lifted before 8 March, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove says Black MPs from across the UK political spectrum join together in a video encouraging people to get the coronavirus vaccine Imperial College London scientists tracking coronavirus in England say there are signs of a ""shallow decline"" in infection levels but they remain high And a World Health Organization team is out of quarantine and set for face-to-face meetings as part of their probe into the origins of the virus in the Chinese city of Wuhan Edited by Hamish Mackay Our live coronavirus coverage has come to an end for the day. Thanks for joining us. Here are some of the main news stories from the day: Today's live page was brought to you by James Clarke, Hamish Mackay, Jennifer Meierhans, Alex Therrien, Lauren Turner and Ella Wills. BBC World Service The Africa Centre for Disease Control says the African Union (AU) has secured an additional 400 million doses of coronavirus vaccines for its members. This comes on top of another 270 million announced earlier. It is estimated Africa will need 1.5 billion vaccine doses to vaccinate 60% of its inhabitants. Most countries on the continent have not started vaccinating people, lacking the funds to purchase the drugs. South Africa's leading coronavirus expertSalim Abdool Karim recently urged the world's wealthier nations not to hoard vaccine supplies, describing the behaviour as ""unconscionable"" and warning ""no-one is safe until everyone is safe"". The AU said earlier this month 50 million vaccines would be available between April and June. The others will come later this year and next year. Read more: A further 1,239 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test were reported in the UK earlier. The daily totals can fluctuate due to delays in reporting. However, the seven-day average for deaths is at a similar level. Cases, meanwhile, continue to fall. The current seven-day average stands at 28,584. Despite the ongoing fall in cases, the number of people in hospital with Covid-19 remains high (36,931). Radio 4 PM Earlier, we heard that Germany's vaccine committee said AstraZeneca's Covid jab should only be given to people aged under 65 due to ""insufficient evidence"" about is efficacy in older people. But vacine expert Prof Adam Finn - a member of the UK's joint committee on vaccination and immunisation - told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that the decision ""just reflects different levels of caution"". Prof Finn, of the University of Bristol, told the programme: ""What they are basically doing is saying 'we'd like to wait a big longer and know a bit more before we move.' ""We have no concerns about the safety of the vaccine in any age group."" You can read more about the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine here. People may soon be offered a 'spit in a pot' coronavirus test, after promising trial results. The LampORE test checks for the virus in saliva samples and work carried out with the help of more than 1,000 NHS volunteers shows it is good at finding cases, even if someone has no symptoms. Pop-up labs that can process up to 2,000 tests a day have been set up in trucks that could travel the country. Four have already been deployed, says the government. These mobile units are located in Aberdeen, Telford, Brent and Newbury. They will continue testing people in the coming weeks and the results will be evaluated to see how helpful the service is.

""I couldn't move for 10 days,"" she says. ""It's been rough - probably one of the hardest experiences of my life."" She's a fit 31-year-old but says she was ""shocked at how much it beat my body"" and even her friends were scared. ""I didn't even get mild symptoms - I feel like it can happen to anyone, it's such a serious thing."" You can read the full story from Harpz here. This video can not be played 'We both had tears in our eyes' A man with coronavirus has described how a young nurse cried with him when the doctor told him he might die. Small business owner Mike Hemming, 53, from Melksham in Wiltshire, had pneumonia and blood clots on his lungs. Despite not having any underlying health conditions, Mr Hemming got steadily worse and was rushed to the Royal United Hospital in Bath on 11 January. ""For her to sit there and give me a hug was amazing. She didn't know me from Adam. It was very special and absolutely needed,"" Mr Hemming said. A pharmacist hasgiven a coronavirus jab to his 85-year-old fatherin an Islamic community centre - saying he wanted to boost vaccination rates and debunk myths about the virus. Aftab Rehman, from Pear Tree Pharmacy in Derby, began vaccinations at Ikhlas Islamic Education Centre on Thursday. Administering the vaccine to his father, Rehmat Khan, a former stroke patient who has diabetes, he said he hoped doing so would ""give confidence"" to the community. Mr Rehman said it was ""extremely important"" for pharmacists to go to community centres to carry out vaccinations and counter fake news. ""The problem is, via social media, we have misinformation and we have people who want to share conspiracy theories,"" he said. ""A lot of the vaccinators here will be nurses and pharmacists from the community so people will know them."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst CCTV shows Ma Yaqing and her colleagues at one venue Chinaâs official broadcaster, CCTV, has shown a liveâcloud weddingâ,externalbetween two essential workers in the country's north-eastern
Hebei province. The bride, Ma Yaqing, is a doctor from Shijiazhuang, and her now husband, Yu Yang, is a firefighter from nearby Xingtang County. Since the start of the year, both have become front-line workers,
after an outbreak of Covid-19 led to hundreds of peoplecontracting the virus in the region. Yu Yang with his colleagues as witnesses Parts of Shijiazhuang are currently under full lockdown, meaning peopleâs movements are restricted and all public events are banned. However, the couple were given authorisation to exchange their vows remotely. CCTV showed the groom at one venue, with his colleagues as witnesses, and the doctor and her colleagues at another. There are currently more than 600 people being treated in hospital for Covid-19 in Hebei province, but cases are falling. Gary Matthews was found dead the day after he tested positive for Covid-19 A man whose cousin died after a positive Covid test says coronavirus deniers are ""complicit"" in the death. Gary Matthews, 46, was found dead in his flat in Shrewsbury, Shropshire the day after he tested positive. He had been part of a Facebook group that, according to Tristan Copeland, spread false conspiracy theories about Covid-19. ""I think they were complicit in Gary's death for sure,"" Mr Copeland says. ""They encouraged him not to wear a mask and I think if he had been wearing a mask, if he had been locking down, if he had not been going to work, I think he would have had a greater protection - I think he would be alive today."" Mr Copeland says his cousin had been sick for about a week. ""He tested positive and he was told to go home and isolate, which he did, and I think he died the next morning."" Read the full story here. BBC Radio 5 Live Almost one in three police officers  - around 32% in England and Wales - have saidtheyâve had coronavirus used as a weaponagainst them, according to a Police Federation survey. BBC Radio 5 Live has heard from other members of the emergency services about their experiences. Mike Jones, a paramedic and violence reduction lead for the South Western ambulance service, said he has been directly targeted. âBack in September, in Cornwall, a patient decided that it was appropriate to hit my colleague and spit in my face,"" he told 5 Live. âI donât think he did [have coronavirus] but unfortunately what weâre seeing is incidents throughout the trust where people are weaponising coronavirus. ""Weâve had increases in spitting and coughing incidents on all members of staff unfortunately due to the pandemic."" He said his trust has a ""zero tolerance"" approach to such incidents and that staff wore protection like glasses and face masks. But he said for any ambulance or police staff spat at, the worry isn't just catching Covid - it's that if any spit gets in their eyes or mouth, they need six months of blood tests to check for pathogens. As he described it: ""Six months living in fear that actually you might have something from a member of the public."" Pupils in Northern Ireland will not return to school until Monday 8 March at the earliest, the Stormont Executive has agreed. First Minister Arlene Foster said the ongoing public health situation meant remote learning must continue. If a return is possible on 8 March, it might be that only some year groups go back. Mrs Foster said she recognised it would come as a ""disappointment"" for many parents and pupils. ""The kitchen table is no substitute for the school desk,"" she said. Read more. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has tweeted to confirm that the UAE, Burundi and Rwanda will all be added to the UK's ""red list"" from 13:00 GMT tomorrow. That means people arriving from those countries or transiting through will be denied entry - except for British, Irish and third country nationals with residence rights, who must self-isolate for 10 days at home. Those passengers must still have proof of a negative test and complete a passenger location form before arrival. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Jagtar Singh Johal, from Dumbarton, is being held under India's anti-terror law A Scottish man who has been held in an Indian jail without conviction for three years has told the BBC he was tortured to sign a blank confession. Jagtar Singh Johal, from Dumbarton, is being held under India's anti-terror laws, accused of conspiring to murder a number of right-wing Hindu leaders. Court documents allege he helped fund the crimes and claim he was a member of a ""terrorist gang"". Mr Johal told the BBC via his lawyer he had been ""falsely implicated"". In answers to BBC questions obtained by his lawyer during a virtual prison meeting, the 33-year-old says he was physically tortured into signing a blank confession and forced to record a video which was broadcast on Indian TV. ""They made me sign blank pieces of paper and asked me to say certain lines in front of a camera under fear of extreme torture,"" he said via his lawyer. Mr Johal's legal team also shared a copy of what they say is a handwritten letter from shortly after his arrest in November 2017 in which he details allegations of how the torture took place. ""Multiple shocks were administered by placing (the) crocodile clips on my earlobes, nipples and private parts,"" the letter says. ""Multiple shocks were given each day. ""Two people would stretch my legs, another person would slap and strike me from behind, and the shocks were given by the seated officers."" ""At some stages I was left unable to walk and had to be carried out of the interrogation room."" The BBC has been unable to independently verify these allegations of torture. The Indian authorities strongly deny them, and have said ""there is no evidence of mistreatment or torture as alleged"". Jagtar got married in India in 2017 Mr Johal travelled to India in October 2017 for his wedding. Videos of the occasion show the new groom jumping enthusiastically to Bhangra music as he celebrated. In another he is seen holding his wife's hand, as they perform their first dance in front of friends and family. ""It was a cheerful day for us, it went exactly as planned,"" recalls his brother Gurpreet Singh Johal. But a fortnight later, while on a shopping trip with his new bride in the North Indian state of Punjab, Mr Johal was taken away by police and has been in detention ever since. Follow Rajini on Twitter,external His brother Gurpreet, who lives in Scotland, says Mr Johal was a peaceful activist and is convinced he was arrested because he had written about historical human rights violations against Sikhs in India. ""I believe my brother is being targeted because he was outspoken,"" Gurpreet says. ""I believe he is innocent and will be proved innocent once the trial starts. ""Otherwise Indian officials should release him and return him back to his country."" Jagtar Singh Johal (right) arrives at court in India in November 2017 Charge-sheets from the Indian authorities outline the case against Mr Johal and a group of men whom they believe were involved in a ""series of killings"" of right wing Hindu leaders. It is claimed Mr Johal was a member of Khalistan Liberation Front (KLF), described in the documents as an international ""terrorist gang"". He is accused of paying Â£3,000 to the former head of the KLF to help fund the crimes. The documents claim he ""actively participated and had complete knowledge of the conspiracy"". ""There are very serious charges against him including murder and abetment of terrorism,"" an Indian government official told the BBC. ""The seriousness of charges against him have been shared with the British authorities,"" they added. Footage which claims to show Mr Johal in custody was broadcast on Indian TV Mr Johal's lawyer, Jaspal Singh Manjphur, who has represented him since he was first arrested, told the BBC he was concerned by the length of time it was taking for the case to go through the Indian legal system. ""He has been in custody for over three years,"" Mr Manjphur said. ""Normally, if the prosecution wants, they can complete the case in that much time."" Mr Manjphur said the authorities had yet to provide any him with any evidence linking his client to the crimes and feared he was being framed, a charge denied by officials. A few weeks ago, Mr Johal was accused of being involved in another crime. While in prison he has been arrested for helping to plot the murder of a man in October 2020. ""He is in a high security jail, he is under CCTV surveillance for 24 hours. How can he be in contact with anyone?"", Mr Manjphur said. Mr Johal was last seen in public at court in Delhi earlier this month Mr Johal is being held at Delhi's maximum security Tihar jail. He claims he is often forced to stay in solitary confinement and is denied the same facilities as other prisoners, such as hot water. ""By making me stay in these conditions, they are ensuring that my mental condition remains disturbed,"" he said. ""It is very tough to live here,"" he said. The vast majority of inmates at the prison are, like Mr Johal, held before a conviction in what is known as an ""under-trial"" in India. At the end of 2019, 82% of prisoners held in Tihar jail had yet to complete the trial process. In India it can take many years before under-trial prisoners ever get to court, especially in terror cases where bail is hard to secure, a concern for Mr Johal's lawyer. ""He will languish in jail until the trial is completed, in such cases it could take anywhere between five to 10 years,"" Mr Manjphur said. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has raised the case with his Indian counterpart The human rights charity Reprieve has written to the UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, asking that he calls for Mr Johal's immediate release. Reprieve is also worried that some of the charges Mr Johal is awaiting trial for carry the death penalty as the maximum punishment. But experts stress that executions in India are extremely rare. The UK's Foreign Commonwealth and Development office told the BBC that Mr Raab did raise the case with his Indian counterpart during his trip to India in December. ""We have consistently raised concerns about his case with the Government of India, including allegations of torture and mistreatment and his right to a fair trial,"" it said in a statement. ""Our staff continue to support Jagtar Singh Johal following his detention in India, and are in regular contact with his family and prison officials about his health and wellbeing."" Hundreds of people protested outside the Foreign Office But Mr Johal's brother Gurpreet said the family was still waiting for a meeting with the foreign secretary. He said: ""We are calling for either Jagtar to be charged and a fair trial to take place or to be returned back to his country so he can spend his life with his wife in the UK."" In August last year Gurpreet Singh Johal was joined by dozens who protested outside Downing Street. Jagtar Singh Johal's case has sparked protests around the world, from Westminster to Washington, Geneva to Toronto. In his statement to the BBC, Mr Johal had this message for officials back home: ""I plead to the UK government to support me, I'm a British citizen and the government should understand that.""

"After the news that British residents arriving in England from Covid hotspots will have to quarantine in hotels, many would-be holidaymakers are thinking of opting for UK destinations this summer. Understandably, they don't want to undergo the ""managed isolation process"" requiring them to spend 10 days in a hotel on their return to the UK. But there may be a shortage of the kind of UK accommodation they are looking for, say providers of holiday lets. From cottages to campsites, demand is on the increase. Even the UK's luxury hotels are expecting the move to give them a boost. Arrivals from Covid hotspots face hotel quarantine Which UK arrivals have to quarantine in a hotel? Sarah and Steve Jarvis, who run theIndependent Cottages,externalwebsite listing more than 1,800 properties, say inquiries during the current lockdown in England are 300% up on the first lockdown in March to July 2020. However, they also point out that many properties still need to honour bookings that were rolled over from 2020 because of earlier virus curbs, restricting availability for new requests. ""People started the year with bookings already in the calendar,"" Sarah told the BBC. ""We're going to end up in a situation where we have demand outstripping supply again."" ""It's almost like the perfect storm,"" adds Steve. ""People will be hesitant about going abroad with the new travel restrictions and the UK is looking like a very good option. ""People have got confidence in UK self-catering holidays, because the bookings are coming in thick and fast."" Sarah and Steve Jarvis say demand for cottages is high In normal times, says Sarah, people are looking for accommodation for an average of four people to go away on holiday together. But at the moment, they are getting lots of inquiries for groups of up to nine people, as extended families or groups of friends seek to make up for the family Christmas celebrations they missed out on. ""Families are going to go away and they want to take their parents with them,"" Sarah says. ""It's a safe option for elderly relatives."" Unusually, some are also booking ahead for next Christmas already. ""Straight after Boxing Day, people usually start thinking about summer holidays, but we're also seeing very early bookings for the festive season,"" says Steve. Another holiday provider,holidaycottages.co.uk,external, says it has seen a sharp increase in demand since mid-January. The firm's chief marketing officer, James Starkey, says: ""In the past week, bookings taken for May half-term onwards are up 39% compared to last year, with the summer holidays up 98%. We do still have just over half of our properties available for seven-night breaks in the summer holidays but, with them booking more quickly this year, we anticipate another strong summer for the UK staycation industry."" Trencreek Holiday Park owner Julliette Hautot is seeing a rise in demand AtTrencreek Holiday Park,externalin Newquay, Cornwall, there is definitely a pick-up in interest from holidaymakers. The park offers a mixture of camping and self-catering accommodation, covering a wide range of travel needs. ""Since Monday, the phone's been getting a lot busier,"" says Julliette Hautot, who runs the business with her husband. ""The calls are on the up and it's definitely going to be busy for the summer,"" she told the BBC. ""Slots are filling up for July and August. There's not a lot left, especially for the school holidays."" She is also noticing more inquiries for September than usual, perhaps reflecting a feeling that pandemic restrictions will ease later rather than sooner. Hotels are noticing the staycation trend as well. TheBest Western,externalchain has just done a survey of 6,000 of its UK customers and found that 90% of them felt safer holidaying in Britain this summer rather than abroad. ""With the worries around quarantine, we are now starting to see bookings landing for the big summer months coming through in the last 24 hours,"" spokesperson Andrew Denton told the BBC. ""The experience of last summer has taught people not to leave it to the last minute as Britain gets booked, so to book ahead and quit worrying about quarantine, which might impact an international trip."" At the upper end of the spectrum, the UK's luxury hotels are anticipating opportunities as a result of the hotel quarantine measures for international travel. Pride of Britain Hotels,external, a collection of 50 of independently-owned luxury hotels including the Athenaeum in London's Mayfair, says the measures are set to benefit home-grown tourism. ""Anything that makes international travel more difficult will clearly add to the appeal of a holiday taken within one's own country this year,"" said the consortium's chief executive, Peter Hancock. ""For luxury hotels in the UK, we believe there is huge pent-up demand that is just waiting for the restrictions to be eased.

Here are some of the main news stories from the day: Today's live page was brought to you by James Clarke, Hamish Mackay, Jennifer Meierhans, Alex Therrien, Lauren Turner and Ella Wills. BBC World Service The Africa Centre for Disease Control says the African Union (AU) has secured an additional 400 million doses of coronavirus vaccines for its members. This comes on top of another 270 million announced earlier. It is estimated Africa will need 1.5 billion vaccine doses to vaccinate 60% of its inhabitants. Most countries on the continent have not started vaccinating people, lacking the funds to purchase the drugs. South Africa's leading coronavirus expertSalim Abdool Karim recently urged the world's wealthier nations not to hoard vaccine supplies, describing the behaviour as ""unconscionable"" and warning ""no-one is safe until everyone is safe"". The AU said earlier this month 50 million vaccines would be available between April and June. The others will come later this year and next year.

However, the seven-day average for deaths is at a similar level. Cases, meanwhile, continue to fall. The current seven-day average stands at 28,584. Despite the ongoing fall in cases, the number of people in hospital with Covid-19 remains high (36,931). Radio 4 PM Earlier, we heard that Germany's vaccine committee said AstraZeneca's Covid jab should only be given to people aged under 65 due to ""insufficient evidence"" about is efficacy in older people. But vacine expert Prof Adam Finn - a member of the UK's joint committee on vaccination and immunisation - told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that the decision ""just reflects different levels of caution"". Prof Finn, of the University of Bristol, told the programme: ""What they are basically doing is saying 'we'd like to wait a big longer and know a bit more before we move.' ""We have no concerns about the safety of the vaccine in any age group."" You can read more about the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine here.

""I couldn't move for 10 days,"" she says. ""It's been rough - probably one of the hardest experiences of my life."" She's a fit 31-year-old but says she was ""shocked at how much it beat my body"" and even her friends were scared.

Gary Matthews was found dead the day after he tested positive for Covid-19 A man whose cousin died after a positive Covid test says coronavirus deniers are ""complicit"" in the death. Gary Matthews, 46, was found dead in his flat in Shrewsbury, Shropshire the day after he tested positive. He had been part of a Facebook group that, according to Tristan Copeland, spread false conspiracy theories about Covid-19. ""I think they were complicit in Gary's death for sure,"" Mr Copeland says. ""They encouraged him not to wear a mask and I think if he had been wearing a mask, if he had been locking down, if he had not been going to work, I think he would have had a greater protection - I think he would be alive today.""

BBC Radio 5 Live Almost one in three police officers  - around 32% in England and Wales - have saidtheyâve had coronavirus used as a weaponagainst them, according to a Police Federation survey. BBC Radio 5 Live has heard from other members of the emergency services about their experiences. Mike Jones, a paramedic and violence reduction lead for the South Western ambulance service, said he has been directly targeted. âBack in September, in Cornwall, a patient decided that it was appropriate to hit my colleague and spit in my face,"" he told 5 Live. âI donât think he did [have coronavirus] but unfortunately what weâre seeing is incidents throughout the trust where people are weaponising coronavirus. ""Weâve had increases in spitting and coughing incidents on all members of staff unfortunately due to the pandemic."" He said his trust has a ""zero tolerance"" approach to such incidents and that staff wore protection like glasses and face masks. But he said for any ambulance or police staff spat at, the worry isn't just catching Covid - it's that if any spit gets in their eyes or mouth, they need six months of blood tests to check for pathogens. As he described it: ""Six months living in fear that actually you might have something from a member of the public."" Pupils in Northern Ireland will not return to school until Monday 8 March at the earliest, the Stormont Executive has agreed. First Minister Arlene Foster said the ongoing public health situation meant remote learning must continue. If a return is possible on 8 March, it might be that only some year groups go back. Mrs Foster said she recognised it would come as a ""disappointment"" for many parents and pupils. ""The kitchen table is no substitute for the school desk,"" she said. Read more. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has tweeted to confirm that the UAE, Burundi and Rwanda will all be added to the UK's ""red list"" from 13:00 GMT tomorrow.

"There ""will be no interruption"" to UK vaccine supplies, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said, after the EU urged AstraZeneca to supply it with doses from UK plants. ""It is the case that the supplies that have been planned, paid for and scheduled should continue,"" he added. The EU and AstraZeneca are involved in a row over vaccine supply shortages. Meanwhile, Germany's vaccine committee has said the AstraZeneca vaccineshould only be given to people aged under 65. It cited a lack of sufficient data to recommend use in older age groups. What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Cough, fever or loss of smell: Could it be Covid? The EU has demanded that UK-made jabs are diverted to mainland Europe to fulfil contractual obligations. AstraZeneca has previously said it could deliver only a fraction of the doses between January and March that it had promised to the bloc, blaming production issues at EU plants for a reported 50 million-dose shortfall. However, they haveboth pledged to work together to resolve the crisis. Mr Gove said the UK must continue with the ""acceleration"" of its vaccine rollout, which relies on ""the supply schedule that has been agreed to be honoured"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""we all want to do everything possible"" to ensure that as many people in neighbouring countries are vaccinated, which he said was best achieved through ""dialogue and co-operation and friendship"". Pressed on whether the government will allow vaccines to go to the EU, he said: ""No"", adding that vaccine supplies ""that have been planned, paid for and scheduled should continue. ""There will be no interruption to that."" The prime minister's official spokesman said it ""remains our priority to vaccinate the most vulnerable across the UK"" when asked whether No 10 was considering the idea of sending jabs to the EU. Asked to clarify what he meant by ""most vulnerable"", he said that meant the top nine groups identified as most at risk - all those over 50, care home and health service staff and others at clinical risk - and the plan remained to vaccinate them by spring. He would not comment on whether that meant vaccines manufactured in the UK could be delivered to the EU after that date. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the UK government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said it was in the UK's ""national interests"" to ensure as many people in the world as possible were vaccinated. Asked if vaccine nationalism was a reality in Europe, he told the Today programme: ""Yes, I'm afraid it is and it's something that we absolutely have to negotiate, we have to avoid, and it doesn't serve anybody to have these fights over vaccine supply."" The UK government is taking a firm line on this - and for good reason it believes. It invested in the research done by Oxford University that developed this jab and was then quick to sign a deal with AstraZeneca for supply. The deal was done in May, three months before the EU signed its contract. That gave the UK a head start. The UK supply is manufactured here - at plants in Oxfordshire and Staffordshire. Some doses were sent to Germany and the Netherlands last year for a process called fill-and-finish, which involves putting it into vials. This is now being done at a plant in Wrexham, creating a complete UK supply chain. And that arrangement, AstraZeneca sources say, had no impact on the production problems the EU vaccine manufacturing plants experienced. Making a vaccine is a biological process - there are no guarantees in terms of quantity. The fact the UK was quick off the mark gave the UK plants more time to tweak the process to get a better yield. If the UK was to give the vaccine to the EU, why not then other countries? And would that be right when more than 1,000 people a day are dying with Covid here? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the ""war of words"" between the EU and AstraZeneca has ""got to be resolved"". He told LBC Radio that he wanted to rectify the issue by ""ramping up manufacture"" globally, but he did not want a solution that would ""interrupt"" the UK's vaccination effort. AstraZeneca has blamed supply issues on manufacturing problems in two plants - one in Belgium and another in the Netherlands. The EU, which signed a deal for 300 million doses in August, said it should not receive fewer doses just because the UK signed a contract with the UK-Swedish company earlier. EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said AstraZeneca's two UK plants ""had to deliver"" doses. Responding to Germany's recommendation that the AstraZeneca jab should only be given to the under 65s, Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at Public Health England, said: ""Both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are safe and provide high levels of protection against Covid-19, particularly against severe disease. ""There were too few cases in older people in the AstraZeneca trials to observe precise levels of protection in this group, but data on immune responses were very reassuring."" An AstraZeneca spokesperson said the latest analyses of clinical trial data for its vaccine ""support efficacy in the over 65 years age group"", adding that the firm was awaiting ""a regulatory decision on the vaccine by the European medicines Agency (EMA) in the coming days"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was not concerned by Germany's recommendation, adding that the UK's watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), had ""made it very clear"" that the AstraZeneca vaccine gives a ""high degree of protection after just one dose, and even more after two doses"". He added: ""The evidence that they've supplied is that they think it is effective across all age groups [and] provides a good immune response across all age groups, so I don't agree with that [Germany's recommendation]."" The UK government has promised to to deliver a first vaccine dose to 15 million of the most vulnerable by mid-February and to offer all adults their first dose by autumn. Latest figures show that more than 7.1 million people in the UK have now received a first jab. LOCKDOWN:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? TRAVEL:What are the UK's rules? Asked about Labour's calls for teachers to be vaccinated over half-term, Mr Gove said the government wanted to concentrate on vaccinating ""the most vulnerable first"", adding that any decision on who should be prioritised next would be based on scientific advice. He reiterated comments from England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, by saying that schools ""were in themselves safe"" but that children could pass on the virus to each other and then back into the community. Prof Van-Tam also told Wednesday's Downing Street briefing there was not a ""markedly increased rate of infection or mortality"" from Covid-19 among teachers. However, Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, has contested that, saying that teachers ""by virtue of them having to go out and do a frontline facing job, are more at risk of catching Covid"". Pressed on why she was bringing herself into conflict with the scientific advice, she told the Today programme she said data showed ""all frontline key workers, including teachers... are more at risk of infection and death - that's a fact"". The UK recorded a further 1,239 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test on Thursday, according to government figures. There have also been another 28,680 new infections. In other developments: Scotland is ""on track"" to meet its Covid-19 vaccine targets,First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said One in three police officers has been threatened by someone who they believed had coronavirus,a survey suggests Scientists behind a study tracking coronavirus in England saythere are signs of a ""shallow decline"" in infection levels Welsh Secretary Simon Hart saysa UK-wide policy for reopening schools would make sense Black MPs from across the parties havejoined together in a video encouraging people to get a Covid vaccine DOCTOR CHATTERJEE:With another lockdown in place, how can we manage our health and wellbeing without feeling overwhelmed?

Mike Jones, a paramedic and violence reduction lead for the South Western ambulance service, said he has been directly targeted. âBack in September, in Cornwall, a patient decided that it was appropriate to hit my colleague and spit in my face,"" he told 5 Live. âI donât think he did [have coronavirus] but unfortunately what weâre seeing is incidents throughout the trust where people are weaponising coronavirus. ""Weâve had increases in spitting and coughing incidents on all members of staff unfortunately due to the pandemic."" He said his trust has a ""zero tolerance"" approach to such incidents and that staff wore protection like glasses and face masks. But he said for any ambulance or police staff spat at, the worry isn't just catching Covid - it's that if any spit gets in their eyes or mouth, they need six months of blood tests to check for pathogens. As he described it: ""Six months living in fear that actually you might have something from a member of the public."" Pupils in Northern Ireland will not return to school until Monday 8 March at the earliest, the Stormont Executive has agreed. First Minister Arlene Foster said the ongoing public health situation meant remote learning must continue. If a return is possible on 8 March, it might be that only some year groups go back. Mrs Foster said she recognised it would come as a ""disappointment"" for many parents and pupils. ""The kitchen table is no substitute for the school desk,"" she said. Read more. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has tweeted to confirm that the UAE, Burundi and Rwanda will all be added to the UK's ""red list"" from 13:00 GMT tomorrow. That means people arriving from those countries or transiting through will be denied entry - except for British, Irish and third country nationals with residence rights, who must self-isolate for 10 days at home. Those passengers must still have proof of a negative test and complete a passenger location form before arrival. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Nissan has committed to making cars at its Sunderland plant The number of new cars built in the UK last year fell by a third to just under 921,000, the lowest total since 1984, latest industry figures reveal. Output was 920,928 vehicles, a 29.3% fall on 2019, rounding off a ""dreadful year"", Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders chief Mike Hawes said. Pandemic-enforced plant closures and falling consumer demand meant the worst output ""in a generation"", he said. But he said the vaccine roll out and EU trade deal inspired optimism for 2021 Production for UK and export markets fell 30.4% and 29.1% respectively last year. Eight in ten UK-built cars still head overseas, which Mr Hawes said reinforced the importance of tariff-free trade with the EU. The EU remained the UK's biggest export destination, taking a 53.5% share, despite volumes falling 30.8% to 400,460 units. In December, output was down 2.3% to 71,403 vehicles, with some manufacturers, including Honda, affected by border closures and subsequent component supply issues. Nissan commits to keep making cars in Sunderland Future of Vauxhall car plant hangs in the balance Honda factory temporarily suspends production Shipments to the US, Japan and Australia last year all fell, down 33.7%, 21.6% and 21.8% respectively. Exports to China, however, ended the year up 2.3%, and those to South Korea and Taiwan also rose 3.6% and 16.7% respectively as these nations travelled on different trajectories in dealing with the pandemic. Despite the gloom, the UK continued to roll out battery electric, plug-hybrid and hybrid vehicles to buyers at home and around the world. Combined production of these models rose to 18.8% of all cars made in Britain, up from 14.8% a year before. Mr Hawes said: ""These figures, the worst in a generation, reflect the devastating impact of the pandemic... The industry faces 2021 with more optimism, however, with a vaccine being rolled out and clarity on how we trade with Europe, which remains by far our biggest market. ""The immediate challenge is to adapt to the new conditions, to overcome the additional customs burdens and regain our global competitiveness while delivering zero emission transport."" Independent forecasts say UK car production will partly recover in 2021 to one million, but Mr Hawes said much will depend on the continued impact of the virus, the speed with which showrooms can reopen, and how quickly manufacturers can come to terms with new trading arrangements with the EU, which he described as ""much more complicated"". He hoped the latest figures reflected the ""lowest ebb"" for the industry, but added that significant investment would be needed to return to the figure of 1.7 million reported in 2016. This is terrible news for car makers and workers, and in the old days when economic growth was the overriding indicator of a nation's success, it would be 100% bad.

"Families are entitled to nursery places for pre-school children Councils are being warned to ensure free nursery places are genuinely free after a large chain was found to wrongly charge parents top-up fees. The local government watchdog found the Kiddi Caru nursery chain had broken the rules on government-funded places. Some two- and all three- and four-year-olds are entitled to fully funded early years places, but nurseries have long argued funding levels are too low. Local government ombudsman Michael King said: ""Free must mean free."" ""While I acknowledge local authorities - and the early years sector - are struggling financially, the government's intentions have always been that these places are provided free of charge to parents, and it is up to local authorities to administer them accordingly,"" he said. Covid: Early years staff safety 'cause for concern' Ministers told to come clean over nursery funding Nurseries 'teetering on the edge' during pandemic ""We are concerned that local authorities may not be delivering on the government's pledge to parents."" His comments come after he upheld the complaint of a father from Leicestershire who was charged top-up fees by Kiddi Caru nursery in Market Harborough for his daughter. Damian Roache was charged an extra Â£1.08 per hour on top of the council grant of Â£3.50 for care for his daughter. This prompted the finding that they did not receive their entitlement free of charge. This amounted to nearly Â£1,000 in extra fees. The ruling said the county council had audited the nursery and considered the complaint but failed to identify the problems with the nursery's invoices or charges. As a result, the ""council has failed to comply with government guidance. This is fault,"" it said. Mr Roache first raised the issue with the nursery in March 2019, to be told the charging policy was correct. Leicestershire County Council turned down two complaints from the Roache family before finally accepting the Ombudsman's ruling. Mr Roache told the BBC: ""Everyone was telling me I was wrong, but I knew I was right.  The government guidelines were very clear. ""I am sympathetic with the fact that educational establishments are underfunded by the government, but they need to take their fight to the government, don't have your fight with me. ""It doesn't give them the right to overcharge me."" The ombudsman said that ""free must mean free"" In his report, Mr King told the council to make sure the complainant, and any other families who were wrongly charged top-fees by the nursery, be reimbursed.  A clear statement dating back to 2018 should set out what was overpaid. Councillor Deborah Taylor, Leicestershire County Council cabinet member for children and families, said, they had reviewed the charging arrangements for the nursery involved and found they were ""unnecessarily complex."" ""Due to the variable hourly charge, it was hard for the concerned parents to understand precisely what they were being charged for each hour of private nursery care.  Improvements have since been made at this nursery."" Mr King urged all other councils across England to check that the early years providers in their areas offering places through the Free Early Years Entitlement were ""not making the same errors."" The Childcare Act 2006 places a duty on councils to secure early years provision free of charge for local families, so it is down to local authorities to ensure schemes are within the law. Providers can charge for meals and snacks, and consumables such as nappies or sun cream, as part of a free entitlement place, but these charges must be voluntary. A spokesman for Kiddi Caru, which runs nurseries in central and southern England, said it had taken over the nursery in question in 2017, changed the way it offered free education entitlement and improved invoicing. ""We will continue to work with local authorities, including Leicestershire County Council, as they monitor early years' providers around the delivery of the free early education entitlement to families."" Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said: ""Parents rightly do not expect to pay for something they have been told is free. ""But equally, it cannot be right that nurseries, pre-schools and childminders are expected to deliver these places at an often substantial loss, simply because government refuses to fund its flagship childcare policy adequately."" Purnima Tanuku of the National Day Nurseries Association said it always advised providers to be very clear with parents about any additional costs. But she added that the rates nurseries receive through the government grant were inadequate. She added: ""The places aren't 'free' because the hourly rate provided by government does not cover the full cost of the delivery. In the end it is parents and providers who pay the price of chronic underfunding to the sector.""

"Robin Swann says all health workers are valued and have worked tirelessly during the pandemic Health workers in Northern Ireland are to get a ""special recognition"" payment for their work during the pandemic. It is intended that all staff will receive a payment of Â£500, said Health Minister Robin Swann. However, it will be subject to approval from the Department of Finance. There had been calls from some political parties and health unions for staff to be recognised for their efforts. Scotland has already announced a similar one-off payment and Mr Swann said it would reflect the ""principle of parity"". ""There are no words to properly convey what health workers have done for us, we will never be able to repay that debt,"" added the minister. The development comes as Northern Ireland's Department of Health has recorded 16 more coronavirus-related deaths, taking its toll so far to 1,779. A further 527 people have tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours. There are 775 people in Northern Ireland's hospitals who are being treated for the virus - 68 of them are in intensive care and the number of people requiring ventilators has risen to 56. In the Republic of Ireland, 54 more Covid-19 related deaths were recorded on Wednesday. It brings the Republic of Ireland's death toll to 3,120. The Irish Department of Health also confirmed 1,335 more Covid-19 cases. Speaking at the weekly health news conference on Wednesday, Mr Swann said the pandemic had caused ""destruction"" and left ""heartbreak in its wake"". ""Staying at home is making a difference. The R-number has been moving in the right direction,"" he said. ""We have to sustain and build on that progress."" The reproductive rate of the virus - known as the R rate, measures the infection rate of Covid-19 and had risen to about 1.8 after Christmas relaxations. It has been falling since lockdown restrictions were introduced on 26 December, and Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said NI's R-number for hospital admissions has now fallen back below one. But he warned that the pressure on the system was still significant and would continue for several more weeks. He added that there would need to be a ""sustained"" drop in the figures before relaxations of the lockdown could be considered by the executive. It has also been confirmed that the number of people in Northern Ireland who have received their first Covid-19 now stands at 168,140. More than 50,000 people aged over 80 have been vaccinated. On the payment to health workers, Mr Swann said it would ""not be without its challenges"" but that he valued all staff in the health service. ""For some people, especially some of our lower paid workers, it may in fact have an adverse impact on their social security payments or supports that recipients may be claiming,"" he added. ""I have written to the ministers of finance and communities asking them to urgently consider the issue and to engage with the tax and benefit authorities in Great Britain to request that these payments are excluded from consideration in this regard."" There will also be a one-off payment of Â£2,000 for all non-salaried students on clinical placements in the health service. Mr Swann added that he intends to provide a one-off payment for carers as well, describing them as ""among the greatest unsung heroes"" of the pandemic. But he said: ""There is still more work to be done in this regard and it will be significantly more complex to administer than the staff payment."" Kevin McAdam, who is from Unite the union, said the ""recognition payments"" will be allocated with assurances that this will not affect pay negotiations with healthcare workers. Mr McAdam welcomed that health care workers and non-salaried students on placements will be ""receiving something more tangible than applause"". ""The student payment is a recognition payment, it does not solve the problems around whether student placements should be paid, I think that is an argument for another day."" Meanwhile, a senior Department of Finance official has warned there is ""a higher than usual risk"" ofsome Â£430m unspent by the NI Executivebeing returned to the Treasury. Ministers must submit further funding bids, or risk it being handed back at the end of the financial year. A department official, Jeff McGuinness, said the Treasury was being pressed to show flexibility in carrying unspent money over but added that it was ""imperative"" Stormont pressed ahead, rather then rely on agreement from Treasury. He said the other devolved administrations were also asking the Treasury for similar levels of carry-forward of unspent fiscal allocations.

"Jagtar Singh Johal, from Dumbarton, is being held under India's anti-terror law A Scottish man who has been held in an Indian jail without conviction for three years has told the BBC he was tortured to sign a blank confession. Jagtar Singh Johal, from Dumbarton, is being held under India's anti-terror laws, accused of conspiring to murder a number of right-wing Hindu leaders. Court documents allege he helped fund the crimes and claim he was a member of a ""terrorist gang"". Mr Johal told the BBC via his lawyer he had been ""falsely implicated"". In answers to BBC questions obtained by his lawyer during a virtual prison meeting, the 33-year-old says he was physically tortured into signing a blank confession and forced to record a video which was broadcast on Indian TV. ""They made me sign blank pieces of paper and asked me to say certain lines in front of a camera under fear of extreme torture,"" he said via his lawyer. Mr Johal's legal team also shared a copy of what they say is a handwritten letter from shortly after his arrest in November 2017 in which he details allegations of how the torture took place. ""Multiple shocks were administered by placing (the) crocodile clips on my earlobes, nipples and private parts,"" the letter says. ""Multiple shocks were given each day. ""Two people would stretch my legs, another person would slap and strike me from behind, and the shocks were given by the seated officers."" ""At some stages I was left unable to walk and had to be carried out of the interrogation room."" The BBC has been unable to independently verify these allegations of torture. The Indian authorities strongly deny them, and have said ""there is no evidence of mistreatment or torture as alleged"". Jagtar got married in India in 2017 Mr Johal travelled to India in October 2017 for his wedding. Videos of the occasion show the new groom jumping enthusiastically to Bhangra music as he celebrated. In another he is seen holding his wife's hand, as they perform their first dance in front of friends and family. ""It was a cheerful day for us, it went exactly as planned,"" recalls his brother Gurpreet Singh Johal. But a fortnight later, while on a shopping trip with his new bride in the North Indian state of Punjab, Mr Johal was taken away by police and has been in detention ever since. Follow Rajini on Twitter,external His brother Gurpreet, who lives in Scotland, says Mr Johal was a peaceful activist and is convinced he was arrested because he had written about historical human rights violations against Sikhs in India. ""I believe my brother is being targeted because he was outspoken,"" Gurpreet says. ""I believe he is innocent and will be proved innocent once the trial starts. ""Otherwise Indian officials should release him and return him back to his country."" Jagtar Singh Johal (right) arrives at court in India in November 2017 Charge-sheets from the Indian authorities outline the case against Mr Johal and a group of men whom they believe were involved in a ""series of killings"" of right wing Hindu leaders. It is claimed Mr Johal was a member of Khalistan Liberation Front (KLF), described in the documents as an international ""terrorist gang"". He is accused of paying Â£3,000 to the former head of the KLF to help fund the crimes. The documents claim he ""actively participated and had complete knowledge of the conspiracy"". ""There are very serious charges against him including murder and abetment of terrorism,"" an Indian government official told the BBC. ""The seriousness of charges against him have been shared with the British authorities,"" they added. Footage which claims to show Mr Johal in custody was broadcast on Indian TV Mr Johal's lawyer, Jaspal Singh Manjphur, who has represented him since he was first arrested, told the BBC he was concerned by the length of time it was taking for the case to go through the Indian legal system. ""He has been in custody for over three years,"" Mr Manjphur said. ""Normally, if the prosecution wants, they can complete the case in that much time."" Mr Manjphur said the authorities had yet to provide any him with any evidence linking his client to the crimes and feared he was being framed, a charge denied by officials. A few weeks ago, Mr Johal was accused of being involved in another crime. While in prison he has been arrested for helping to plot the murder of a man in October 2020. ""He is in a high security jail, he is under CCTV surveillance for 24 hours. How can he be in contact with anyone?"", Mr Manjphur said. Mr Johal was last seen in public at court in Delhi earlier this month Mr Johal is being held at Delhi's maximum security Tihar jail. He claims he is often forced to stay in solitary confinement and is denied the same facilities as other prisoners, such as hot water. ""By making me stay in these conditions, they are ensuring that my mental condition remains disturbed,"" he said. ""It is very tough to live here,"" he said. The vast majority of inmates at the prison are, like Mr Johal, held before a conviction in what is known as an ""under-trial"" in India. At the end of 2019, 82% of prisoners held in Tihar jail had yet to complete the trial process. In India it can take many years before under-trial prisoners ever get to court, especially in terror cases where bail is hard to secure, a concern for Mr Johal's lawyer. ""He will languish in jail until the trial is completed, in such cases it could take anywhere between five to 10 years,"" Mr Manjphur said. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has raised the case with his Indian counterpart The human rights charity Reprieve has written to the UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, asking that he calls for Mr Johal's immediate release. Reprieve is also worried that some of the charges Mr Johal is awaiting trial for carry the death penalty as the maximum punishment. But experts stress that executions in India are extremely rare. The UK's Foreign Commonwealth and Development office told the BBC that Mr Raab did raise the case with his Indian counterpart during his trip to India in December. ""We have consistently raised concerns about his case with the Government of India, including allegations of torture and mistreatment and his right to a fair trial,"" it said in a statement. ""Our staff continue to support Jagtar Singh Johal following his detention in India, and are in regular contact with his family and prison officials about his health and wellbeing."" Hundreds of people protested outside the Foreign Office But Mr Johal's brother Gurpreet said the family was still waiting for a meeting with the foreign secretary. He said: ""We are calling for either Jagtar to be charged and a fair trial to take place or to be returned back to his country so he can spend his life with his wife in the UK."" In August last year Gurpreet Singh Johal was joined by dozens who protested outside Downing Street. Jagtar Singh Johal's case has sparked protests around the world, from Westminster to Washington, Geneva to Toronto. In his statement to the BBC, Mr Johal had this message for officials back home: ""I plead to the UK government to support me, I'm a British citizen and the government should understand that.""

"Tourists usually flock to Tenby when the sun is out It is ""crucial"" tourism is allowed to reopen by Easter after a ""catastrophic"" year, an industry insider has said. North Wales Tourism chief executive Jim Jones said firms had spent ""extremely heavily"" to make them Covid-secure. He warned of job losses in an industry that employed 43,000 people in north Wales. The Welsh Government said it was ""committed to doing all we can to protect businesses during this very challenging time"". In normal times, Llandudno would be a draw for tourists Many businesses had already ""gone under,"" and others were ""teetering on the edge of failure,"" Mr Jones said. ""If we don't get the opportunity to open by Easter it means a lot more loss of jobs, loss of business and also the economy is going to be so hard hit it's going to take a long, long time to recover. ""So, it's crucial we get the opportunity to open this Easter."" The Cottage Company has seen a 13% increase in bookings on the same time last year - pre-pandemic For one holiday cottage agent, bookings have increased by 13% on the same time last year, which was before the pandemic struck. Ruaridh MacDonald, who owns The Cottage Company with his wife Caroline, said it was unsurprising given the restrictions on foreign travel. ""Rightly or wrongly, people feel they may be able to go on holiday in the UK rather than abroad,"" Mr MacDonald said. ""We can feel confidence levels rising and you can see it day by day."" But businesses have had to nurture that confidence, including offering ""no-quibble"" refund or reschedule options. Vale Holiday Parks owns 14 parks across Wales and south-west England, including in New Quay, Ceredigion Thomas Scarrott is the director of Vale Holiday Parks, which is based near Aberystwyth, in Ceredigion, but has 14 sites across Wales and south-west England. Despite a ""difficult"" 2020, Mr Scarrott said the company had received about 1,500 bookings from the start of the Easter holiday period until the end of summer. But while bookings are ""looking good"", they are nowhere near where they would usually be - and can be cancelled by the customer if restrictions are not lifted. Despite an encouraging number of bookings, caravan parks director Thomas Scarrott says they will only benefit if they are allowed to open ""Because of the way in which the law and consumer rights works, there's no risk to booking a domestic holiday - you are not going to lose out financially,"" Mr Scarrott explained. ""So as good as the bookings are, that income will only be realised once the holiday is realised."" When the restrictions are lifted, Mr Scarrott knows his staff will be busy taking bookings - but has called for certainty as early as possible. He added: ""We strongly believe we can open and offer a service without shared facilities - people would come to the caravan, go to the beach and enjoy the coast path."" Hide Wales would have usually taken 40% of bookings in the first two weeks of January - but did not take any this year Paula Warren, owner of Hide Wales cabins, shepherd's hut and lodge in St Donats, Vale of Glamorgan, said they had seen some bookings for later in the summer, but spring and early summer is still ""very, very quiet"". ""We would usually take 40% of our bookings in the first two weeks of January, but this year we didn't take any,"" she said. But Ms Warren said she is ""not panicked"" and remained ""hopeful"", adding customers had been ""so kind"" in choosing to defer bookings rather than cancel them. Hide Wales owner Paula Warren says they want to ease customer booking concerns Customer confidence is fragile, Ms Warren suggested, which means making them feel comfortable enough to book with them is all the more important. ""The first question they will ask is 'what are the terms and conditions',"" she said. ""Our previous Ts and Cs were slightly more looking after our business, but we have changed that - we have tried to put ourselves in their shoes."" Cottage lets in north Wales are starting to pick up, according to one agent Despite a ""tricky time"" for the domestic tourism sector, Luke Edwards, of cottage lettings agent Menai Holidays, in Anglesey, said ""we are starting to see signs of bookings picking up"". ""It's still too early to say whether there will be a boom, but confidence in the UK holiday market seems to be on the up,"" he said. ""Hopefully, once we have a clear idea of when we will be allowed to welcome people to north Wales again, we are hopeful of seeing the tourism industry in Wales and the UK blossom."" North Wales Tourism boss Jim Jones added businesses ""totally"" understood the need for safety, and for Covid-19 case numbers to drop, but the ""uncertainty, and not knowing, is adding to the anxiety that our businesses are suffering"". He said the industry was down Â£2.17bn on revenues of Â£3.6bn in 2019. He called on the Welsh Government to support the industry with measures including business funds and rates relief. Jim Jones said it was crucial tourism businesses be allowed to reopen in time for Easter ""We're not seeing any sign of any road map to recovery,"" said Mr Jones. ""We're still waiting to see what that entails so I think it's really, really important that the Welsh Government starts to share with us what their plans are for recovery into 2021."" Businesses outside of tourism are also calling for an Easter start-up. Arete Outdoor Learning Centre sits a few miles from the foot of Snowdon, in the village of Llanrug, providing residential courses for school children across the UK. Covid: Hope for tourism in Wales after 'devastating' pandemic Coronavirus: Is virtual reality tourism about to take off? Covid: Tourism needs 'four nations approach' to lockdowns It said if schools were open, it should be able to as well. Centre director Gareth Davies said: ""For the sector, we've lost 6,000 jobs already. Thirty centres have shut since the start of the pandemic and there's 20 more under serious threat across the UK. ""The sector's been decimated and there's not going to be anything left for future generations without an Easter re-start, or alternatively sector-specific funding to help us survive, if the government don't change their guidance."" Arete Outdoor Learning Centre's Gareth Davies said 98% of the its income was from residential stays The Welsh Government said: ""Our package of support is the most generous in the UK and more than Â£1.7bn of Welsh Government financial assistance has reached businesses since March."" It said money had already reached tourism, hospitality and leisure businesses from a Â£180m fund opened in January. ""Wales will remain in alert level four until infection rates are under control,"" it added. ""We review the Wales-wide measure in place at least every three weeks.""

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is visiting Scotland despite the country's first minister questioning whether the trip is necessary during lockdown The EU and the UK-based Covid vaccine maker AstraZeneca have vowed to work together to resolve a bitter row over supply shortages to the 27-member bloc Germany is likely to face a vaccine shortage until at least April, its health minister warns - and it may limit the AstraZeneca jab to under-65s It would be ""premature to imagine"" lockdown restrictions in England will be lifted before 8 March, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove says Black MPs from across the UK political spectrum join together in a video encouraging people to get the coronavirus vaccine Imperial College London scientists tracking coronavirus in England say there are signs of a ""shallow decline"" in infection levels but they remain high And a World Health Organization team is out of quarantine and set for face-to-face meetings as part of their probe into the origins of the virus in the Chinese city of Wuhan Edited by Hamish Mackay Our live coronavirus coverage has come to an end for the day. Thanks for joining us. Here are some of the main news stories from the day: Today's live page was brought to you by James Clarke, Hamish Mackay, Jennifer Meierhans, Alex Therrien, Lauren Turner and Ella Wills. BBC World Service The Africa Centre for Disease Control says the African Union (AU) has secured an additional 400 million doses of coronavirus vaccines for its members. This comes on top of another 270 million announced earlier. It is estimated Africa will need 1.5 billion vaccine doses to vaccinate 60% of its inhabitants. Most countries on the continent have not started vaccinating people, lacking the funds to purchase the drugs. South Africa's leading coronavirus expertSalim Abdool Karim recently urged the world's wealthier nations not to hoard vaccine supplies, describing the behaviour as ""unconscionable"" and warning ""no-one is safe until everyone is safe"". The AU said earlier this month 50 million vaccines would be available between April and June. The others will come later this year and next year. Read more: A further 1,239 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test were reported in the UK earlier. The daily totals can fluctuate due to delays in reporting. However, the seven-day average for deaths is at a similar level. Cases, meanwhile, continue to fall. The current seven-day average stands at 28,584. Despite the ongoing fall in cases, the number of people in hospital with Covid-19 remains high (36,931). Radio 4 PM Earlier, we heard that Germany's vaccine committee said AstraZeneca's Covid jab should only be given to people aged under 65 due to ""insufficient evidence"" about is efficacy in older people. But vacine expert Prof Adam Finn - a member of the UK's joint committee on vaccination and immunisation - told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that the decision ""just reflects different levels of caution"". Prof Finn, of the University of Bristol, told the programme: ""What they are basically doing is saying 'we'd like to wait a big longer and know a bit more before we move.' ""We have no concerns about the safety of the vaccine in any age group."" You can read more about the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine here. People may soon be offered a 'spit in a pot' coronavirus test, after promising trial results. The LampORE test checks for the virus in saliva samples and work carried out with the help of more than 1,000 NHS volunteers shows it is good at finding cases, even if someone has no symptoms. Pop-up labs that can process up to 2,000 tests a day have been set up in trucks that could travel the country. Four have already been deployed, says the government. These mobile units are located in Aberdeen, Telford, Brent and Newbury. They will continue testing people in the coming weeks and the results will be evaluated to see how helpful the service is. You can read the full story here. BBC Asian Network's breakfast show presenter Harpz Kaur has been back on the airwaves this week after more than three weeks off with Covid-19. ""I couldn't move for 10 days,"" she says. ""It's been rough - probably one of the hardest experiences of my life."" She's a fit 31-year-old but says she was ""shocked at how much it beat my body"" and even her friends were scared. ""I didn't even get mild symptoms - I feel like it can happen to anyone, it's such a serious thing."" You can read the full story from Harpz here. This video can not be played 'We both had tears in our eyes' A man with coronavirus has described how a young nurse cried with him when the doctor told him he might die. Small business owner Mike Hemming, 53, from Melksham in Wiltshire, had pneumonia and blood clots on his lungs. Despite not having any underlying health conditions, Mr Hemming got steadily worse and was rushed to the Royal United Hospital in Bath on 11 January. ""For her to sit there and give me a hug was amazing. She didn't know me from Adam. It was very special and absolutely needed,"" Mr Hemming said. A pharmacist hasgiven a coronavirus jab to his 85-year-old fatherin an Islamic community centre - saying he wanted to boost vaccination rates and debunk myths about the virus. Aftab Rehman, from Pear Tree Pharmacy in Derby, began vaccinations at Ikhlas Islamic Education Centre on Thursday. Administering the vaccine to his father, Rehmat Khan, a former stroke patient who has diabetes, he said he hoped doing so would ""give confidence"" to the community. Mr Rehman said it was ""extremely important"" for pharmacists to go to community centres to carry out vaccinations and counter fake news. ""The problem is, via social media, we have misinformation and we have people who want to share conspiracy theories,"" he said. ""A lot of the vaccinators here will be nurses and pharmacists from the community so people will know them."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst CCTV shows Ma Yaqing and her colleagues at one venue Chinaâs official broadcaster, CCTV, has shown a liveâcloud weddingâ,externalbetween two essential workers in the country's north-eastern
Hebei province. The bride, Ma Yaqing, is a doctor from Shijiazhuang, and her now husband, Yu Yang, is a firefighter from nearby Xingtang County. Since the start of the year, both have become front-line workers,
after an outbreak of Covid-19 led to hundreds of peoplecontracting the virus in the region. Yu Yang with his colleagues as witnesses Parts of Shijiazhuang are currently under full lockdown, meaning peopleâs movements are restricted and all public events are banned. However, the couple were given authorisation to exchange their vows remotely. CCTV showed the groom at one venue, with his colleagues as witnesses, and the doctor and her colleagues at another. There are currently more than 600 people being treated in hospital for Covid-19 in Hebei province, but cases are falling. Gary Matthews was found dead the day after he tested positive for Covid-19 A man whose cousin died after a positive Covid test says coronavirus deniers are ""complicit"" in the death. Gary Matthews, 46, was found dead in his flat in Shrewsbury, Shropshire the day after he tested positive. He had been part of a Facebook group that, according to Tristan Copeland, spread false conspiracy theories about Covid-19. ""I think they were complicit in Gary's death for sure,"" Mr Copeland says. ""They encouraged him not to wear a mask and I think if he had been wearing a mask, if he had been locking down, if he had not been going to work, I think he would have had a greater protection - I think he would be alive today."" Mr Copeland says his cousin had been sick for about a week. ""He tested positive and he was told to go home and isolate, which he did, and I think he died the next morning."" Read the full story here. BBC Radio 5 Live Almost one in three police officers  - around 32% in England and Wales - have saidtheyâve had coronavirus used as a weaponagainst them, according to a Police Federation survey. BBC Radio 5 Live has heard from other members of the emergency services about their experiences. Mike Jones, a paramedic and violence reduction lead for the South Western ambulance service, said he has been directly targeted. âBack in September, in Cornwall, a patient decided that it was appropriate to hit my colleague and spit in my face,"" he told 5 Live. âI donât think he did [have coronavirus] but unfortunately what weâre seeing is incidents throughout the trust where people are weaponising coronavirus. ""Weâve had increases in spitting and coughing incidents on all members of staff unfortunately due to the pandemic."" He said his trust has a ""zero tolerance"" approach to such incidents and that staff wore protection like glasses and face masks. But he said for any ambulance or police staff spat at, the worry isn't just catching Covid - it's that if any spit gets in their eyes or mouth, they need six months of blood tests to check for pathogens. As he described it: ""Six months living in fear that actually you might have something from a member of the public."" Pupils in Northern Ireland will not return to school until Monday 8 March at the earliest, the Stormont Executive has agreed. First Minister Arlene Foster said the ongoing public health situation meant remote learning must continue. If a return is possible on 8 March, it might be that only some year groups go back. Mrs Foster said she recognised it would come as a ""disappointment"" for many parents and pupils. ""The kitchen table is no substitute for the school desk,"" she said. Read more. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has tweeted to confirm that the UAE, Burundi and Rwanda will all be added to the UK's ""red list"" from 13:00 GMT tomorrow. That means people arriving from those countries or transiting through will be denied entry - except for British, Irish and third country nationals with residence rights, who must self-isolate for 10 days at home. Those passengers must still have proof of a negative test and complete a passenger location form before arrival. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Gary Matthews was found dead the day after he tested positive for Covid-19 A man whose cousin died after a positive Covid test says coronavirus deniers are ""complicit"" in the death. Gary Matthews, 46, was found dead in his flat in Shrewsbury, Shropshire the day after he tested positive. He had been part of a Facebook group that, according to Tristan Copeland, spread false conspiracy theories about Covid-19. ""I think they were complicit in Gary's death for sure,"" Mr Copeland says. ""They encouraged him not to wear a mask and I think if he had been wearing a mask, if he had been locking down, if he had not been going to work, I think he would have had a greater protection - I think he would be alive today."" Mr Copeland says his cousin had been sick for about a week. ""He tested positive and he was told to go home and isolate, which he did, and I think he died the next morning."" Read the full story here. BBC Radio 5 Live Almost one in three police officers  - around 32% in England and Wales - have saidtheyâve had coronavirus used as a weaponagainst them, according to a Police Federation survey. BBC Radio 5 Live has heard from other members of the emergency services about their experiences. Mike Jones, a paramedic and violence reduction lead for the South Western ambulance service, said he has been directly targeted. âBack in September, in Cornwall, a patient decided that it was appropriate to hit my colleague and spit in my face,"" he told 5 Live. âI donât think he did [have coronavirus] but unfortunately what weâre seeing is incidents throughout the trust where people are weaponising coronavirus. ""Weâve had increases in spitting and coughing incidents on all members of staff unfortunately due to the pandemic."" He said his trust has a ""zero tolerance"" approach to such incidents and that staff wore protection like glasses and face masks. But he said for any ambulance or police staff spat at, the worry isn't just catching Covid - it's that if any spit gets in their eyes or mouth, they need six months of blood tests to check for pathogens. As he described it: ""Six months living in fear that actually you might have something from a member of the public."" Pupils in Northern Ireland will not return to school until Monday 8 March at the earliest, the Stormont Executive has agreed. First Minister Arlene Foster said the ongoing public health situation meant remote learning must continue. If a return is possible on 8 March, it might be that only some year groups go back. Mrs Foster said she recognised it would come as a ""disappointment"" for many parents and pupils. ""The kitchen table is no substitute for the school desk,"" she said. Read more. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has tweeted to confirm that the UAE, Burundi and Rwanda will all be added to the UK's ""red list"" from 13:00 GMT tomorrow. That means people arriving from those countries or transiting through will be denied entry - except for British, Irish and third country nationals with residence rights, who must self-isolate for 10 days at home. Those passengers must still have proof of a negative test and complete a passenger location form before arrival. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Stella Kyriakides: ""AstraZeneca needs to deliver on its commitments"" The EU and the UK-based Covid vaccine maker AstraZeneca have vowed to work together to resolve a bitter row over supply shortages to the bloc. AstraZeneca had agreed to deliver millions of doses in January-March but then said significantly fewer jabs would arrive on time. It blamed production problems at European plants. The EU is demanding the firm divert jabs from the UK. The UK government has said there ""will be no interruption"" to UK supply. Cabinet Minister Michael Gove said it was ""critical"" to make sure that the ""schedule that has been agreed and on which our vaccine has been based goes ahead"". The EU signed a deal with AstraZeneca in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more, but the UK-Swedish company has reported production delays at plants in the Netherlands and Belgium. AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said production was ""basically two months behind where we wanted to be"". UK factories have not experienced problems. On Thursday, scientific adviser to the UK government Sir Jeremy Farrar urged against vaccine nationalism, saying ""it doesn't serve anybody to have these fights over vaccine supply"". What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? Vaccine plant evacuated over suspicious package The global plan to share Covid-19 vaccines fairly The contract between the EU and AstraZeneca contains a confidentiality clause - but the EU has asked the company to release the details nevertheless. The EU says the shortfall is greater than previous reports suggested. Instead of receiving around 100 million doses before the end of March, they are now expecting 25 million, one official said on Wednesday. The AstraZeneca vaccine, developed with Oxford University, has not yet been approved by the EU, although this is expected on Friday. The EU has been criticised for the slow rollout of inoculations for its population of around 450 million. It has a much bigger vaccine deal with US-German vaccine-maker Pfizer-BioNTech but it is also facing delays in supplies. The dispute comes as countries globally race to get their hands on vaccines to protect populations against Covid-19 and deal with the fallout of the pandemic. After crisis talks on Wednesday between the EU and AstraZeneca, EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides expressed regret over the ""continued lack of clarity on the delivery schedule"". ""We will work with the company to find solutions and deliver vaccines rapidly for EU citizens,"",externalshe tweeted. An AstraZeneca spokesman said the company had ""committed to even closer co-ordination to jointly chart a path for the delivery of our vaccine over the coming months"". Before the talks, Ms Kyriakides insisted that UK factories were part of the EU's deal with the company. Covid map: Where have the 100m cases been? Some symptoms 'more common' with new variant In an interview on Tuesday with Italian newspaper La Repubblica, AstraZenecaCEO Pascal Soriot said the contract compelled it to make its ""best effort"", rather than obliging it to meet a set deadline for delivery of the vaccines,external. Ms Kyriakides said this characterisation of the deal was ""not correct or acceptable"". She added that the EU rejected ""the logic of first-come first-serve"". ""That may work at the neighbourhood butcher's but not in contracts, and not in our advanced purchase agreements."" Ms Kyriakides appeared to be responding to Mr Soriot, who said that the UK had signed its contract with AstraZeneca three months before the EU and that this extra time had been used to ""fix all the glitches we experienced"" regarding the UK. The EU had hoped that, as soon as approval was given, delivery would start straight away, with some 80 million doses arriving in the 27 nations by March. However the delays reported by AstraZeneca have dented that hope. Italy was among the countries threatening to sue over the delays.  448mEU population 8.4mPeople received vaccine so far (1.9%) 2.3bnDoses ordered overall 400mDoses ordered from AstraZeneca (Not yet EMA approved) - 17% of total Officials have not confirmed publicly how big the shortfall will be, but Reuters news agency reported that deliveries would be reduced to 31 million in the first quarter of this year. The EU has also ordered 2.3 billion doses of vaccines from four other companies, of which only those of Pfizer/BioNTech (600 million) and Moderna (160 million) have been approved. Pfizer has not been able to supply the 12.5 million vaccines it promised the EU by the end of 2020, saying last week it was delaying shipments for the next few weeks because of work to increase capacity at its Belgian processing plant. As a result of delays, Spanish officials said the Madrid region was halting almost all vaccinations for two weeks and supplies in Catalonia were also threatened. The EU has threatened to restrict the exports of vaccines made within the bloc to deal with the shortfall. What is happening with the EU vaccine rollout?

"Social workers say they are braced for a ""tsunami of needs"" as the UK recovers from the pandemic. The British Association of Social Workers (BASW) expects workloads to increase as restrictions are lifted. One worker described a ""big surge"" in referrals after the first lockdown and the fears of missing something wrong. Officials in all four nations praised the efforts of social workers and highlighted schemes to help vulnerable children set up in the pandemic. Asurvey conducted by the BASW,externalat the end of last year, seen by the BBC, suggests the majority of members had seen an increase in referrals since schools returned in the autumn. Minny Jackson, not her real name, works as a social worker with children in Greater London. ""When lockdown started it was quiet for a little bit, but definitely when the schools came back there was a big surge in referrals coming through. ""In March my case load was 18, now it's 26. Our biggest challenge is that every week we're getting new referrals on duty."" Ms Jackson said that trend was repeated after the short lockdown in England in November and the BASW believes there may be another surge after the current restrictions across the UK are eased. ""It feels like we're kind of just cementing over the cracks but not actually getting to the foundation of what's going on. Every team meeting everyone is talking about the concerns they feel, the pressures of the workload,"" Ms Jackson said. ""I think there's that constant worry that, 'Am I missing something, is there something here that I'm not seeing, that something untoward is happening?' and, 'How can I actually do the meaningful work through a computer screen?' When I think about it, it just makes me feel stressed."" SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries Between November and December last year the BASW conducted a survey to investigate the impact of the pandemic on the industry. More than two thirds of the 1,119 BASW members from across the four nations who responded said they had seen an increase in referrals or in their case load since the return of schools in the autumn. And more than three quarters were concerned about their capacity to safeguard and protect adults and children as a result of lockdown restrictions. Another social worker who works with children described a case where contact with a family was done via Zoom, always against the backdrop of their blank living room wall. On one occasion the computer was accidentally knocked into a different position and the case worker saw a child sleeping on a mattress on the floor. Upon seeing this the social worker made an emergency house call and the home was revealed to have extensive damp, broken windows, barely any furniture and the floor that the child was sleeping on was covered in animal excrement. ""How many young children have we missed, awful cases that might come to light when this pandemic is over? Are these children just collateral damage?"" the social worker said. ""How do we even begin to repair the damage that is being done to these children while the rest of the country's head is turned? We were in absolute crisis in children's care before the pandemic, now it's complete meltdown."" Another said: ""I just feel like we need to think about those who have worked outside the NHS, but on the frontline during this pandemic. It's almost like social work is the forgotten profession of key workers."" The situation is the same across the devolved nations, according to Allison Hulmes, the national director of BASW Cymru, but there is a fear that things will continue to get worse before they improve. ""It's the tip of the iceberg at the moment, we're really fearful about what's lying underneath... there are so many children who wouldn't have been vulnerable prior to the pandemic but have become vulnerable as the pandemic has unfolded,"" she said. ""Our fear is that there will be an absolute tsunami of need which will translate into increased referral and increased demand on the profession. ""Short term we'd like to see a clear roadmap for return of schools across the devolved nations, we need to increase the number of social workers that we have, so that would mean an investment in professionals and some acknowledgment from Westminster and devolved governments that social workers are essential workers, that they've been doing an incredibly difficult job, and we want the blame game to stop."" The UK government and the devolved administrations of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales praised the ""fantastic job"" social workers had done in ""very challenging circumstances"" adding that they had provided extra funds for social care and taken steps to ease workloads. The Scottish Government also said it was giving frontline workers - including social workers - a one-off pro-rata payment of Â£500 in recognition of their work in the pandemic. The UK government said it had started a review of children's social care in England, while Northern Ireland's Department of Health said it was carrying out a social service workforce review to help meet ""current and anticipated demand"". The Welsh Government also said it was working with local authorities to tackle any future impact from the pandemic.

"Tourists usually flock to Tenby when the sun is out It is ""crucial"" tourism is allowed to reopen by Easter after a ""catastrophic"" year, an industry insider has said. North Wales Tourism chief executive Jim Jones said firms had spent ""extremely heavily"" to make them Covid-secure. He warned of job losses in an industry that employed 43,000 people in north Wales. The Welsh Government said it was ""committed to doing all we can to protect businesses during this very challenging time"". In normal times, Llandudno would be a draw for tourists Many businesses had already ""gone under,"" and others were ""teetering on the edge of failure,"" Mr Jones said. ""If we don't get the opportunity to open by Easter it means a lot more loss of jobs, loss of business and also the economy is going to be so hard hit it's going to take a long, long time to recover. ""So, it's crucial we get the opportunity to open this Easter."" The Cottage Company has seen a 13% increase in bookings on the same time last year - pre-pandemic For one holiday cottage agent, bookings have increased by 13% on the same time last year, which was before the pandemic struck. Ruaridh MacDonald, who owns The Cottage Company with his wife Caroline, said it was unsurprising given the restrictions on foreign travel. ""Rightly or wrongly, people feel they may be able to go on holiday in the UK rather than abroad,"" Mr MacDonald said. ""We can feel confidence levels rising and you can see it day by day."" But businesses have had to nurture that confidence, including offering ""no-quibble"" refund or reschedule options. Vale Holiday Parks owns 14 parks across Wales and south-west England, including in New Quay, Ceredigion Thomas Scarrott is the director of Vale Holiday Parks, which is based near Aberystwyth, in Ceredigion, but has 14 sites across Wales and south-west England. Despite a ""difficult"" 2020, Mr Scarrott said the company had received about 1,500 bookings from the start of the Easter holiday period until the end of summer. But while bookings are ""looking good"", they are nowhere near where they would usually be - and can be cancelled by the customer if restrictions are not lifted. Despite an encouraging number of bookings, caravan parks director Thomas Scarrott says they will only benefit if they are allowed to open ""Because of the way in which the law and consumer rights works, there's no risk to booking a domestic holiday - you are not going to lose out financially,"" Mr Scarrott explained. ""So as good as the bookings are, that income will only be realised once the holiday is realised."" When the restrictions are lifted, Mr Scarrott knows his staff will be busy taking bookings - but has called for certainty as early as possible. He added: ""We strongly believe we can open and offer a service without shared facilities - people would come to the caravan, go to the beach and enjoy the coast path."" Hide Wales would have usually taken 40% of bookings in the first two weeks of January - but did not take any this year Paula Warren, owner of Hide Wales cabins, shepherd's hut and lodge in St Donats, Vale of Glamorgan, said they had seen some bookings for later in the summer, but spring and early summer is still ""very, very quiet"". ""We would usually take 40% of our bookings in the first two weeks of January, but this year we didn't take any,"" she said. But Ms Warren said she is ""not panicked"" and remained ""hopeful"", adding customers had been ""so kind"" in choosing to defer bookings rather than cancel them. Hide Wales owner Paula Warren says they want to ease customer booking concerns Customer confidence is fragile, Ms Warren suggested, which means making them feel comfortable enough to book with them is all the more important. ""The first question they will ask is 'what are the terms and conditions',"" she said. ""Our previous Ts and Cs were slightly more looking after our business, but we have changed that - we have tried to put ourselves in their shoes."" Cottage lets in north Wales are starting to pick up, according to one agent Despite a ""tricky time"" for the domestic tourism sector, Luke Edwards, of cottage lettings agent Menai Holidays, in Anglesey, said ""we are starting to see signs of bookings picking up"". ""It's still too early to say whether there will be a boom, but confidence in the UK holiday market seems to be on the up,"" he said. ""Hopefully, once we have a clear idea of when we will be allowed to welcome people to north Wales again, we are hopeful of seeing the tourism industry in Wales and the UK blossom."" North Wales Tourism boss Jim Jones added businesses ""totally"" understood the need for safety, and for Covid-19 case numbers to drop, but the ""uncertainty, and not knowing, is adding to the anxiety that our businesses are suffering"". He said the industry was down Â£2.17bn on revenues of Â£3.6bn in 2019. He called on the Welsh Government to support the industry with measures including business funds and rates relief. Jim Jones said it was crucial tourism businesses be allowed to reopen in time for Easter ""We're not seeing any sign of any road map to recovery,"" said Mr Jones. ""We're still waiting to see what that entails so I think it's really, really important that the Welsh Government starts to share with us what their plans are for recovery into 2021."" Businesses outside of tourism are also calling for an Easter start-up.

Centre director Gareth Davies said: ""For the sector, we've lost 6,000 jobs already. Thirty centres have shut since the start of the pandemic and there's 20 more under serious threat across the UK. ""The sector's been decimated and there's not going to be anything left for future generations without an Easter re-start, or alternatively sector-specific funding to help us survive, if the government don't change their guidance."" Arete Outdoor Learning Centre's Gareth Davies said 98% of the its income was from residential stays The Welsh Government said: ""Our package of support is the most generous in the UK and more than Â£1.7bn of Welsh Government financial assistance has reached businesses since March."" It said money had already reached tourism, hospitality and leisure businesses from a Â£180m fund opened in January. ""Wales will remain in alert level four until infection rates are under control,"" it added. ""We review the Wales-wide measure in place at least every three weeks.""

"Covid-19 was first detected in Wuhan in late 2019 A World Health Organization (WHO) team has come out of quarantine and will start on-the-ground investigations into the origins of the coronavirus in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The scientists will begin interviewing people from research institutes, hospitals and the seafood market linked to the initial outbreak. Their research will rely upon evidence provided by Chinese officials. This comes after months of negotiations between the WHO and Beijing. Some relatives of Covid-19 victims in China are hoping to meet with the investigators.  Zhang Hai, a Wuhan native whose father died in February, told the BBC he hopes speaking to the WHO can ""aid their investigation"". The group of 13 experts arrived in Wuhan on 14 January, and spent two weeks in quarantine that ended on Thursday. While in isolation, the team had been in video calls with each other and Chinese scientists. On Thursday afternoon they exited their hotel and boarded a bus without speaking to journalists. Earlier in the day members of the team tweeted about the end of their quarantine, including pictures of themselves receiving letters certifying they had completed medical isolation. ""New phase, new priorities,"" tweeted Dutch virologist Marion Koopmans. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Thea Fischer, a Danish member of the investigation team, told Reuters news agency that going outside after quarantining ""is just as if one has landed from the moon"". ""I lived opposite two of the others in the team, so it was my hope that every time they knocked on the door, that the other two also went out and had their temperature measured, so you could at least exchange a few words and see a human being,"" she said on Thursday. The WHOhad said its investigators were denied entry into Chinaafter one member of the team was turned back and another got stuck in transit. Beijing later said it was a misunderstanding. Covid-19 was first detected in Wuhan in late 2019, but China has been saying for months that it is not necessarily the place where the virus originated from. State media have recently suggested the pandemic might have begun outside of China - Spain, Italy or even the US - and have also carried claims that the virus has been entering the country through frozen food imports, though experts have cast doubt on this. Searching for answers in Wuhan China's painful year of fighting the virus Wuhan marks its anniversary with triumph and denial On Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki raised concern about ""misinformation"" from ""some sources in China"" and said it was ""imperative we get to the bottom"" of where the virus originated and how it was able to spread worldwide. Her comments sparked outrage in China with Zhao Lijian, the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, calling on the US to ""respect facts and science, respect the hard work"" of the WHO experts. In an earlier interview with the BBC, Professor Dale Fisher, chair of the global outbreak and response unit at the WHO, said he hoped the world would consider the investigation in Wuhan a scientific visit. ""It's not about politics or blame but getting to the bottom of a scientific question,"" he said. Prof Fisher added that most scientists believed that the virus was a ""natural event"". It was initially believed the virus originated in a market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat. It was suggested that this was where the virus made the leap from animals to humans. Meanwhilea year on since the outbreak began in Wuhanseveral families of Covid-19 victims are still looking for answers. ""I think it's necessary that the experts meet me and other people who have lost family members to the virus, and hear from our experiences,"" said Mr Zhang. ""I hope the WHO will not be used as a tool to spread lies,"" the 51-year-old told the BBC. Zhang Hai (right) and his late father Mr Zhang said he believes delayed reporting about the virus by Wuhan city officials in the initial days of the outbreak had cost his father his life. His family had travelled to the city in January last year from the city of Shenzhen, where they currently live, so that Mr Zhang's father could receive subsidised surgery for a leg fracture.

"Covid-19 was first detected in Wuhan in late 2019 A World Health Organization (WHO) team has come out of quarantine and will start on-the-ground investigations into the origins of the coronavirus in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The scientists will begin interviewing people from research institutes, hospitals and the seafood market linked to the initial outbreak. Their research will rely upon evidence provided by Chinese officials. This comes after months of negotiations between the WHO and Beijing. Some relatives of Covid-19 victims in China are hoping to meet with the investigators.  Zhang Hai, a Wuhan native whose father died in February, told the BBC he hopes speaking to the WHO can ""aid their investigation"". The group of 13 experts arrived in Wuhan on 14 January, and spent two weeks in quarantine that ended on Thursday. While in isolation, the team had been in video calls with each other and Chinese scientists. On Thursday afternoon they exited their hotel and boarded a bus without speaking to journalists. Earlier in the day members of the team tweeted about the end of their quarantine, including pictures of themselves receiving letters certifying they had completed medical isolation. ""New phase, new priorities,"" tweeted Dutch virologist Marion Koopmans. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Thea Fischer, a Danish member of the investigation team, told Reuters news agency that going outside after quarantining ""is just as if one has landed from the moon"". ""I lived opposite two of the others in the team, so it was my hope that every time they knocked on the door, that the other two also went out and had their temperature measured, so you could at least exchange a few words and see a human being,"" she said on Thursday. The WHOhad said its investigators were denied entry into Chinaafter one member of the team was turned back and another got stuck in transit. Beijing later said it was a misunderstanding. Covid-19 was first detected in Wuhan in late 2019, but China has been saying for months that it is not necessarily the place where the virus originated from. State media have recently suggested the pandemic might have begun outside of China - Spain, Italy or even the US - and have also carried claims that the virus has been entering the country through frozen food imports, though experts have cast doubt on this. Searching for answers in Wuhan China's painful year of fighting the virus Wuhan marks its anniversary with triumph and denial On Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki raised concern about ""misinformation"" from ""some sources in China"" and said it was ""imperative we get to the bottom"" of where the virus originated and how it was able to spread worldwide. Her comments sparked outrage in China with Zhao Lijian, the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, calling on the US to ""respect facts and science, respect the hard work"" of the WHO experts. In an earlier interview with the BBC, Professor Dale Fisher, chair of the global outbreak and response unit at the WHO, said he hoped the world would consider the investigation in Wuhan a scientific visit. ""It's not about politics or blame but getting to the bottom of a scientific question,"" he said. Prof Fisher added that most scientists believed that the virus was a ""natural event"". It was initially believed the virus originated in a market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat. It was suggested that this was where the virus made the leap from animals to humans. Meanwhilea year on since the outbreak began in Wuhanseveral families of Covid-19 victims are still looking for answers. ""I think it's necessary that the experts meet me and other people who have lost family members to the virus, and hear from our experiences,"" said Mr Zhang. ""I hope the WHO will not be used as a tool to spread lies,"" the 51-year-old told the BBC. Zhang Hai (right) and his late father Mr Zhang said he believes delayed reporting about the virus by Wuhan city officials in the initial days of the outbreak had cost his father his life. His family had travelled to the city in January last year from the city of Shenzhen, where they currently live, so that Mr Zhang's father could receive subsidised surgery for a leg fracture. The surgery was successful, but Mr Zhang's father then contracted Covid-19 and subsequently died. ""If it was made known that there was a virus outbreak in the city, we wouldn't have gone there,"" he said. ""By covering up that fact at the time, many lives were lost, so the Wuhan government has knowingly committed murder. They need to be held accountable for that.

"One in six households is struggling to afford broadband during the current UK lockdowns, according to a survey by Citizens Advice. The charity warned that the poorest people were effectively being âlocked outâ of access to key services. Only three of the 13 largest broadband providers offer affordable tariffs for those on low-income benefits, it said. It is calling on the government to force providers to offer cheaper plans to people struggling financially. Citizens Advice also wants the telecoms regulator Ofcom to take action. ""Broadband allows people to be part of society,"" said Ned Dukes, community advice worker at Citizens Advice Haringey. Applying for support, as well as job applications and job interviews, are largely all carried out online. ""Without access to the internet, people are effectively locked out of key services and everything they need to live a full and proper life,"" he added. ""But for people on welfare benefits, every single decision about how they spend Â£1 can make a difference. Broadband can be incredibly expensive."" Firms asked to rethink home-schooling data fees Mobile networks to make Oak lessons site data-free In December, Ofcom said that households were paying an average of Â£37 a month for a landline and broadband -with more than 4.7 million struggling to afford their bills.,external Out of 1,646 surveyed by Citizens Advice who said they have broadband, 275 said they struggled to pay their broadband bills between March last year - when the first lockdown began - and January 2021. Citizens Advice estimated that 2.3 million people had fallen behind on their broadband bill towards the end of last year. A government spokesperson told the BBC: ""We brokered a deal with the major telecoms providers who have committed to support those finding it difficult to pay their bills. This includes ensuring customers are fairly treated and to offer generous mobile and landline packages to vulnerable customers. However we do encourage providers to go further on fixed broadband and offer a social tariff to those on low incomes during these challenging times."" Maxine, who lives alone, claimed universal credit in March when she lost work in the hospitality industry. âThroughout the lockdown the only way I've been able to see my elderly parents, and most of my grandkids is on video calls,â she said. Maxine said it could be weeks until she saw someone once her mobile data ran out âI don't have broadband as I can't afford it, so when my data has gone I can't see them any more. âDo you know how heartbreaking it is to not be able to see them?

Alistair Cromwell, acting chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ""The pandemic has cemented the fact that broadband is an essential utility. It is not a luxury for those who can afford it. ""Without broadband we struggle to teach our children, order food and medicines, work or search for a job.

"Families are entitled to nursery places for pre-school children Councils are being warned to ensure free nursery places are genuinely free after a large chain was found to wrongly charge parents top-up fees. The local government watchdog found the Kiddi Caru nursery chain had broken the rules on government-funded places. Some two- and all three- and four-year-olds are entitled to fully funded early years places, but nurseries have long argued funding levels are too low. Local government ombudsman Michael King said: ""Free must mean free."" ""While I acknowledge local authorities - and the early years sector - are struggling financially, the government's intentions have always been that these places are provided free of charge to parents, and it is up to local authorities to administer them accordingly,"" he said. Covid: Early years staff safety 'cause for concern' Ministers told to come clean over nursery funding Nurseries 'teetering on the edge' during pandemic ""We are concerned that local authorities may not be delivering on the government's pledge to parents."" His comments come after he upheld the complaint of a father from Leicestershire who was charged top-up fees by Kiddi Caru nursery in Market Harborough for his daughter. Damian Roache was charged an extra Â£1.08 per hour on top of the council grant of Â£3.50 for care for his daughter. This prompted the finding that they did not receive their entitlement free of charge. This amounted to nearly Â£1,000 in extra fees. The ruling said the county council had audited the nursery and considered the complaint but failed to identify the problems with the nursery's invoices or charges. As a result, the ""council has failed to comply with government guidance. This is fault,"" it said. Mr Roache first raised the issue with the nursery in March 2019, to be told the charging policy was correct. Leicestershire County Council turned down two complaints from the Roache family before finally accepting the Ombudsman's ruling. Mr Roache told the BBC: ""Everyone was telling me I was wrong, but I knew I was right.  The government guidelines were very clear. ""I am sympathetic with the fact that educational establishments are underfunded by the government, but they need to take their fight to the government, don't have your fight with me. ""It doesn't give them the right to overcharge me."" The ombudsman said that ""free must mean free"" In his report, Mr King told the council to make sure the complainant, and any other families who were wrongly charged top-fees by the nursery, be reimbursed.  A clear statement dating back to 2018 should set out what was overpaid. Councillor Deborah Taylor, Leicestershire County Council cabinet member for children and families, said, they had reviewed the charging arrangements for the nursery involved and found they were ""unnecessarily complex."" ""Due to the variable hourly charge, it was hard for the concerned parents to understand precisely what they were being charged for each hour of private nursery care.  Improvements have since been made at this nursery."" Mr King urged all other councils across England to check that the early years providers in their areas offering places through the Free Early Years Entitlement were ""not making the same errors."" The Childcare Act 2006 places a duty on councils to secure early years provision free of charge for local families, so it is down to local authorities to ensure schemes are within the law. Providers can charge for meals and snacks, and consumables such as nappies or sun cream, as part of a free entitlement place, but these charges must be voluntary. A spokesman for Kiddi Caru, which runs nurseries in central and southern England, said it had taken over the nursery in question in 2017, changed the way it offered free education entitlement and improved invoicing. ""We will continue to work with local authorities, including Leicestershire County Council, as they monitor early years' providers around the delivery of the free early education entitlement to families."" Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said: ""Parents rightly do not expect to pay for something they have been told is free. ""But equally, it cannot be right that nurseries, pre-schools and childminders are expected to deliver these places at an often substantial loss, simply because government refuses to fund its flagship childcare policy adequately."" Purnima Tanuku of the National Day Nurseries Association said it always advised providers to be very clear with parents about any additional costs. But she added that the rates nurseries receive through the government grant were inadequate. She added: ""The places aren't 'free' because the hourly rate provided by government does not cover the full cost of the delivery. In the end it is parents and providers who pay the price of chronic underfunding to the sector.""

"Apple sales have hit another record, as families loaded up on the firm's latest phones, laptops and gadgets during the Christmas period. Sales in the last three months of 2020 hit more than $111bn (Â£81bn) - up 21% from the prior year. The gains come as the pandemic pushes more activity online, fuelling demand for new technology. Apple now counts more than 1.65 billion active devices globally, including more than 1 billion iPhones. Apple's gains follow the release of its new iPhone 12 suite of phones, which executives said had convinced a record number of people to switch to the company or upgrade from older models. The firm said growth in China - where the pandemic has already loosened its grip on the economy - was particularly strong,helped in part by demand for phones compatible with new 5G networks. Sales in the firm's greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, jumped 57%. In Europe, sales roles 17%, and they rose 11% in the Americas. ""The products are doing very well all around the world,"" said Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer. ""As we look ahead into the March quarter, we're very optimistic."" Analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said he thought the firm was just at the beginning of a ""super-cycle"" as Apple devotees finally trade in old phones, coinciding with upgrades to telecommunications networks. ""With 5G now in the cards and roughly 40% of its 'golden jewel' iPhone installed base not upgrading their phones in the last 3.5 years, [Apple chief Tim] Cook & Co have the stage set for a renaissance of growth,"" he wrote. Big Tech is having an exceptionally lucrative pandemic. It's hard not to be wowed by some of these figures. That Apple recorded more than $100bn in sales in just three months is simply astonishing. Facebook figures are also well up on where they were last year. As other companies have struggled to survive, Big Tech has flourished. There are other reasons for some of these incredible figures. Certainly it seems iPhone enthusiasts were holding out for the new 5G enabled iPhone12. But it's not just Apple and Facebook, all of the massive tech companies are having a bumper year. Covid-19 means people are spending more time indoors - buying things online, watching things online and chatting online. Perhaps then it's no surprise that these companies are posting record breaking figures. But others point to these figures as yet more evidence that Big Tech has become too big to fail. These figures are impressive. But they also attract the attention of politicians who are increasingly asking difficult questions - like are these tech mega companies operating in a market that is fair and with enough competition? Apple said profits in the quarter reached nearly $28.8bn, up 29% compared with the same quarter last year. The gains seen by technology firms like Apple contrast with losses hitting many other economic sectors, as the virus restricts activity and keeps shoppers at home. Other tech firms, such as Microsoft and Facebook, have also enjoyed strong growth. Facebook on Wednesday said increased online shopping during the pandemic helped lift ad revenue in the quarter by 30%. The number of people active on its apps - which also include WhatsApp and Instagram - also rose to 2.6 billion daily, up 15% compared to 2019. It said ad spending could slow as the Covid crisis relaxes and shopper appetite returns for services like travel rather than products. It also warned that plans by Apple to change how it shares user data could weigh on growth.

It's really isolating just being alone. âThere were times where if I ran out of data it would be weeks until I saw another person.â Not being able to access the internet for food shopping, job applications, checking benefits and bills, means you âlose outâ, she added. Alistair Cromwell, acting chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ""The pandemic has cemented the fact that broadband is an essential utility. It is not a luxury for those who can afford it. ""Without broadband we struggle to teach our children, order food and medicines, work or search for a job. ""While the government has provided free laptops and mobile data to help children study at home, these are ultimately just a sticking plaster. ""To tackle the digital divide, it must take urgent action to ensure everyone can afford their broadband, no matter which provider they are with."" Ofcom said it agrees that afforable broadband is ""vital"". ""Some companies already offer low cost tariffs for certain customers, but we're pushing all providers to do more to support those in financial difficulty,"" a spokesman said. ""Although we can't make social tariffs mandatory without a formal direction from government, we're continuing to collect data on affordability and we're ready to act if more measures are needed.""

"Families are entitled to nursery places for pre-school children Councils are being warned to ensure free nursery places are genuinely free after a large chain was found to wrongly charge parents top-up fees. The local government watchdog found the Kiddi Caru nursery chain had broken the rules on government-funded places. Some two- and all three- and four-year-olds are entitled to fully funded early years places, but nurseries have long argued funding levels are too low. Local government ombudsman Michael King said: ""Free must mean free."" ""While I acknowledge local authorities - and the early years sector - are struggling financially, the government's intentions have always been that these places are provided free of charge to parents, and it is up to local authorities to administer them accordingly,"" he said. Covid: Early years staff safety 'cause for concern' Ministers told to come clean over nursery funding Nurseries 'teetering on the edge' during pandemic ""We are concerned that local authorities may not be delivering on the government's pledge to parents."" His comments come after he upheld the complaint of a father from Leicestershire who was charged top-up fees by Kiddi Caru nursery in Market Harborough for his daughter. Damian Roache was charged an extra Â£1.08 per hour on top of the council grant of Â£3.50 for care for his daughter. This prompted the finding that they did not receive their entitlement free of charge. This amounted to nearly Â£1,000 in extra fees. The ruling said the county council had audited the nursery and considered the complaint but failed to identify the problems with the nursery's invoices or charges. As a result, the ""council has failed to comply with government guidance. This is fault,"" it said. Mr Roache first raised the issue with the nursery in March 2019, to be told the charging policy was correct. Leicestershire County Council turned down two complaints from the Roache family before finally accepting the Ombudsman's ruling. Mr Roache told the BBC: ""Everyone was telling me I was wrong, but I knew I was right.  The government guidelines were very clear. ""I am sympathetic with the fact that educational establishments are underfunded by the government, but they need to take their fight to the government, don't have your fight with me. ""It doesn't give them the right to overcharge me."" The ombudsman said that ""free must mean free"" In his report, Mr King told the council to make sure the complainant, and any other families who were wrongly charged top-fees by the nursery, be reimbursed.  A clear statement dating back to 2018 should set out what was overpaid. Councillor Deborah Taylor, Leicestershire County Council cabinet member for children and families, said, they had reviewed the charging arrangements for the nursery involved and found they were ""unnecessarily complex."" ""Due to the variable hourly charge, it was hard for the concerned parents to understand precisely what they were being charged for each hour of private nursery care.  Improvements have since been made at this nursery."" Mr King urged all other councils across England to check that the early years providers in their areas offering places through the Free Early Years Entitlement were ""not making the same errors."" The Childcare Act 2006 places a duty on councils to secure early years provision free of charge for local families, so it is down to local authorities to ensure schemes are within the law. Providers can charge for meals and snacks, and consumables such as nappies or sun cream, as part of a free entitlement place, but these charges must be voluntary. A spokesman for Kiddi Caru, which runs nurseries in central and southern England, said it had taken over the nursery in question in 2017, changed the way it offered free education entitlement and improved invoicing. ""We will continue to work with local authorities, including Leicestershire County Council, as they monitor early years' providers around the delivery of the free early education entitlement to families."" Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said: ""Parents rightly do not expect to pay for something they have been told is free. ""But equally, it cannot be right that nurseries, pre-schools and childminders are expected to deliver these places at an often substantial loss, simply because government refuses to fund its flagship childcare policy adequately."" Purnima Tanuku of the National Day Nurseries Association said it always advised providers to be very clear with parents about any additional costs. But she added that the rates nurseries receive through the government grant were inadequate. She added: ""The places aren't 'free' because the hourly rate provided by government does not cover the full cost of the delivery. In the end it is parents and providers who pay the price of chronic underfunding to the sector.""
