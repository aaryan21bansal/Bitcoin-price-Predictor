"James Blake wants people to stop referring to him as a ""sad boy"" - calling the expression ""unhealthy and problematic"". The musician says the phrase has been used in reaction to his latest single, Don't Miss It, as well as older music. ""It is only ever a good thing to talk about what is on your mind,"" he says. Artists including Anne-Marie and Years & Years' Olly Alexander have backed his comments. ""Shame on whoever is calling him 'sad boy' and putting him in that box, it's embarrassing for them,"" Olly told Radio 1 Newsbeat. Allow Twitter content?

""We are already in an epidemic of male depression and suicide,"" James wrote on Twitter, referencing the fact that suicideis the biggest killer of men under 45in the UK. ""I've seen enough friends drown in this, and almost drowned in it myself because I bottled everything up, afraid of being seen as weak or soft. ""I now see the great strength, and benefit for those around you in actually opening up."" Olly Alexander was speaking at the Biggest Weekend in Swansea Acts including Olly Alexander from Years & Years have backed his comments: ""We're very pro James Blake, lots of love and support to him,"" he told Newsbeat. ""It's hard for everybody, but with men especially there's a stigma around talking about how you feel."" Ollyhas had his own struggles with bottling things up, revealing recently that he was advised to keep his sexuality hidden at the beginning of Years & Years' career. But labels are something he has had to deal with since winning the BBC's Sound of 2015. ""I'm always going to be boxed in as a gay singer,"" he says. ""It's something I just have to negotiate and it's interesting to see who does label you and who doesn't - because it tells you more about the person labelling you than it does about yourself."" Mabel says speaking about mental health shouldn't be 'taboo' ""Sad boy"" is a term Mabel definitely thinks is unhelpful. The 22-year-old says she's struggled with anxiety and depression growing up, and believes being open about it helps. ""I'm hoping if I talk about it then other people talk about it and we can have this discussion and it's not taboo,"" she says. The singer says it's not always possible to do all the things she needs to do. ""Obviously when you're not feeling well it can be really hard to play a show or do an interview or a photo shoot. ""You have to tell people how you're feeling - write a song about it."" Anne-Marie played to more than 25,000 people in Swansea Anne-Marie says that ""it's good to hear it from a man"". ""I feel there's a lot of girls and women trying to get men to talk - I do anyway,"" she explains. ""Artists should take a lot of responsibility because they have a large audience. ""The more they speak about issues like mental health, the better it is. ""I find we forgot about the men and how they feel. Now is the time. It's good."" Isaac Gracie believes the phrase ""sad boy music"" is discouraging Singer-songwriter Isaac Gracie says James Blake's message ""really is something that resonated with me"". The former choir boy says that ""sad boy music"" is ""one of these damaging terminologies we've become too comfortable with glossing over"". ""I've felt my music being perhaps kind of - not disregarded, but almost being put down, to a certain extent, as 'sad boy music' - and actually that's a discouraging thing.

"Ed Sheeran says his ""strong"" approach on secondary tickets for his gigs will benefit fans in the long run. People who turned up to the first dates of his UK tour in Manchester with resold tickets were told they were invalid and had to buy new ones. ""The only people it is going to harm in the end is the touts,"" Ed told Newsbeat at the Biggest Weekend in Swansea. ""I hate the idea of people paying more than face value for tickets when you can get them at face value."" Ed spoke to Newsbeat at the Biggest Weekend in Swansea Ed Sheeran 'warms up' Biggest Weekend Some fans were angryat their tickets not being valid, including one woman who said she was ""fuming"" after apparently paying Â£400 for two tickets. Secondary ticketing is when people buy tickets for a gig and resell them - usually using sites like Viagogo, StubHub, GetMeIn and Seatwave. Consumer rights group the Fan Fair Alliance says these sites are used by ticket touts, resulting in something which is ""hugely damaging"" to the music business. Allow Twitter content?

"David Baddiel Comic and writer David Baddiel has said he talks about ""sad and difficult"" topics including his father's dementia, as a way of ""processing"" life. He told BBC Radio 4'sDesert Island Discs: ""As you get older your life gets darker. You're faced with mortality."" Speaking about his ""truth urge"", he said: ""Let's find the funny in those things. I don't think it's a denial, it's a bulwark."" Baddiel went on to speak about his father suffering from Pick's disease. ""It's a form of dementia, and is a ridiculous and cartoonish version of what he was like,"" he said. ""It involves people being sweary and obscene and impatient and apathetic - and my dad was always like that."" David Baddiel on impact of dad's dementia Baddiel with his partner Morwenna Banks and children Dolly and Ezra The comic also said he didn't want to seem ""arrogant"" by saying how truthful he is, adding it was ""because of my own limitations as a performer"", saying he was the ""opposite"" to his partner Morwenna Banks ""in terms of versatility and range"". Baddiel also revealed his love of musicals, saying he was ""obsessed"" with Jesus Christ Superstar and Godspell when he was younger. This was reflected in his musical choice on the show of one of the songs from The Book of Mormon. He also spoke about his mother having a ""very public affair"" with a golfing memorabilia salesman, and ""turning our house into a shrine for golf"". ""It's quite hard to forget about the affair when there's a statue of Lee Trevino in your eyeline,"" he added. ""She was a good mother in lots of ways, very devoted to us three brothers."" But he added that he thought he became a comedian because he suspected her favourite child was his brother, Dan. In her defence, he added: ""But there's something very beautiful about a person whose life is nearly taken away."" He said his mother was three months old when the war broke out in Nazi Germany, and that she ""just got out with her parents to London but the rest of her family was murdered"". One of Baddiel's choices was Three Lions - his song with Frank Skinner and The Lightning Seeds for the European Championships in 1996, which were held in England. He said the singing of it at Wembley was ""an extraordinary moment in my life"". ""As I'm speaking now the goose pimples are rising on my flesh,"" he added. ""I still can't believe it happened."" The song came at the height of his success alongside Frank Skinner and the duo also had a TV show - Fantasy Football League - which tied into the rise of ""laddism"". However, Baddiel says his past behaviour was never misogynistic despite him being a leading figure in the lad culture of the 1990s. He said: ""I'm comfortable if you actually go and look at the work, because truth is always in the detail.""

"This video can not be played Returning Officer Barry Ryan delivered the results in Irish and English The Republic of Ireland has voted overwhelmingly to overturn the abortion ban by 66.4% to 33.6%. A referendum held on Friday resulted in a landslide win for the repeal side. Currently, abortion is only allowedwhen a woman's life is at risk, but not in cases of rape, incest or fatal foetal abnormality. The Eighth Amendment, which grants an equal right to life to the mother and unborn, will be replaced. The declaration was made at Dublin Castle at 18:13 local time. The only constituency to vote against repealing the Eighth amendment was Donegal, with 51.9% voting against the change. Crowds celebrate outside Dublin Castle after the result was announced A vote in favour of repeal paves the way for the DÃ¡il (Irish Parliament) to legislate for change which would see the introduction of a much more liberal regime. In 2015 the country voted overwhelmingly tolegalise same-sex marriage in a historic referendum. Ireland's time of reckoning The people travelling #HomeToVote Timeline: Ireland and abortion Referendum results Reacting to the result, the taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar, who campaigned in favour of liberalisation, said it was ""a historic day for Ireland,"" and that a ""quiet revolution"" had taken place. Mr Varadkar told crowds at Dublin Castle the result showed the Irish public ""trust and respect women to make their own decision and choices."" He added: ""It's also a day when we say no more. No more to doctors telling their patients there's nothing can be done for them in their own country, no more lonely journeys across the Irish Sea, no more stigma as the veil of secrecy is lifted and no more isolation as the burden of shame is gone."" This video can not be played Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar: ""Today we say no more"" He said that some had voted yes with ""pride"", but many had voted yes with ""sorrowful acceptance and heavy hearts"". Mr Varadkar said he understood that those who had voted against repeal would be unhappy. He said he had a message for them: ""I know today is not welcome and you may feel this country has taken the wrong turn, that this country is one you no longer recognise. ""I want to reassure you that Ireland today is the same as it was last week, but more tolerant, open and respectful."" He said by and large it had been a respectful campaign. He added: ""We voted to look reality in the eye and we did not blink. ""We choose to provide companionship where there was once a cold shoulder and medical care where we once turned a blind eye"". This video can not be played Ireland votes in abortion referendum Mr Varadkar said he hoped to have a new abortion law enacted by the end of this year. By Shane Harrison, BBC News NI Dublin Correspondent In three months time, Pope Francis will travel to Ireland and find a country undoing part of the legacy of a previous papal visit. In 1983, four years after the triumphal visit of Pope John Paul II, the Irish people put the Eighth Amendment into their constitution. The amendment gave equal rights to life to both the mother and the unborn. Friday's vote, which paves the way for parliamentarians to liberalise abortion law, represents a seismic shift. It also represents another sign of the societal change that has taken place in the Republic, coming just three years after the country officially passed the same sex marriage referendum with 62% in favour. Read more here. Counting began at 09:00. After the polls were published, one of the main anti-abortion campaigns conceded it had lost the vote. Repeal campaigners celebrate at Dublin Castle, where the result was announced The Save The 8th campaign described the result as a ""tragedy of historic proportions"". ""The unborn child no longer has a right to life recognised by the Irish state,"" said its spokesman John McGuirk. However, he vowed that No campaigners would continue to protest, ""if and when abortion clinics are opened in Ireland"". The leader of the main Irish opposition party, MicheÃ¡l Martin of Fianna FÃ¡il, said the vote was the ""dawn of a new era"". He said he had wrestled with the issue, but added the people had made the right decision and it would mean better care for women in Irish hospitals. Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald, whose party campaigned in favour of a Yes vote, said: ""We have without doubt done right by Irish women for this generation and many to come."" Amnesty International hailed the result as a ""momentous win for women's rights"" that ""marks the beginning of a new Ireland"". The vote will have repercussions for women north of the border, as Northern Irelandhas the strictest abortion laws in the UK. Cases of rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormality are not considered grounds for a legal termination. The UK's Women and Equalities Minister Penny Mordaunt said thepredicted landslide vote gave ""hope"" to Northern Ireland. It has been an emotive campaign with harrowing stories on both sides Grainne Teggart of Amnesty International UK said the people of Ireland have ""given hope to women around the world"". But she added Northern Ireland is still subject to restrictive abortion laws. ""It's hypocritical, degrading and insulting to Northern Irish women that we are forced to travel for vital healthcare services but cannot access them at home,"" Ms Teggart said. ""We cannot be left behind in a corner of the UK and on the island of Ireland as second-class citizens."" Former Northern Ireland health minister Jim Wells said the expected result was a ""grave threat"" to the unborn child in Northern Ireland. Mr Wells, a Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politician,  claimed it was ""inevitable"" that abortion clinics would be set up in border towns to ""promote their services to Northern Ireland women"". ""It will be much easier to terminate a child's life if this can be done at a clinic in Dundalk or Letterkenny rather than flying to London or Manchester,"" he added.

Landslide vote overturns Irish abortion ban What welcome will Ireland give the Pope? Memories of when the Pope came to Ireland It also represents another sign of the societal change that has taken place in the Republic, coming just three years after the country officially passed the same sex marriage referendum with 62% in favour. The Republic of Ireland, in the words of Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar, will no longer export its abortion problem to Britain or import its solution. It is estimated that nine women travel to Great Britain every day for terminations, while four women buy abortion pills over the internet without medical supervision, risking a jail term of up to 14 years. The hopes of 1983 that Ireland could become a beacon light in the fight against abortion were never realised. In the intervening years, more than 170,000 Irish women have left the state to end their pregnancies. While hard cases may make for bad law, over the years they certainly changed public opinion on this most controversial and sensitive of issues. A young woman leaves flowers at the Savita Halappanavar mural in Dublin Controversial cases have included rape and incest, in which victims were told they were not entitled to a legal termination. There was also the case of a brain-dead pregnant woman who was briefly kept alive against the wishes of her family until a court decided the foetus or unborn would not survive after a caesarean section. And many women who were given a diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality, where doctors believe the unborn will not survive outside the womb, have shared their stories of travelling to Britain to end their pregnancies. The2012 case of the Indian dentist Savita Halappanavarbrought world attention to the country's laws. She pleaded for an abortion in a Galway hospital as her health deteriorated because of sepsis, but was denied it because her life was not in danger at the time and there was still a foetal heartbeat. By the time Mrs Halappanavar's life was in danger, it was too late. Pope John Paul II was the first pontiff to visit Ireland in 1979 Opinion polls had suggested that those seeking the repeal of the Eighth amendment would win - but by nowhere near the overwhelming margin it turned out to be. Just one constituency - Donegal - voted against repeal. It was carried across the class divide and in every age group, apart from the over 65s. But the biggest support was from young urban women. Sinn FÃ©in, the republican party has a well-known slogan - Tiocfaidh Ã¡r lÃ¡ - which, in Irish, means 'Our Day Will Come'. Now, there is a new Irish political slogan - Tiocfaidh Ã¡r mnÃ¡ - which translates as 'Here Come our Women'. Sinn FÃ©in leader, Mary Lou McDonald, and pro-choice abortion groups in Northern Ireland have said they would like to see both parts of the island allow pregnancy termination. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that does not allow for unrestricted abortion. Make no mistake this is a major setback for those, including the Catholic Church, who urged the people to save the Eighth Amendment. The people voted knowing that if the there was a Yes vote, the government planned to introduce legislation later this year to allow for unrestricted access to abortion during the first 12 weeks of a pregnancy. Despite the reservations of many about this proposal, they still voted for it unpersuaded by arguments that human life began at the moment of conception and that the right to life of the unborn took precedence over the health of the woman. In 1983, the Catholic hierarchy played no little role in the passing of the Eighth Amendment. However, in the intervening years, it has seen its standing greatly diminished withrevelations about bishops not reporting paedophile priests to the civil authorities. There have also been revelations about what happened in mother-and-baby homes run by nuns for unmarried pregnant women. In one notorious case in Tuam, County Galway, the bodies of infants were discovered in an unmarked mass grave last year. A state-appointed inquiry said investigators recovered ""significant quantities"" of human remains at the site, many of which dated back to the 1950s. There have also been allegations of forced adoptions, in some cases in exchange for money from rich Catholic Irish-Americans. So, it was little surprise then the bishops played a less prominent role in a referendum about what they see as being about life and children' rights.

"A landslide vote in favour of overturning Ireland's abortion ban gives ""hope"" to Northern Ireland, UK minister Penny Mordaunt has said. The referendum result has sparked calls for the issue to be reassessed in Northern Ireland, where laws are much stricter than the rest of the UK. But Democratic Unionist MP Ian Paisley said it ""should not be bullied into accepting abortion on demand"". Voters in the Irish referendum backed a law change by 66.4% to 33.6%. Following that result, Northern Ireland will soon become the only part of Britain and Ireland where terminations are all but outlawed. Irish PM hails abortion vote 'revolution' Landslide vote overturns Irish abortion ban Live coverage: Referendum results Those taking part in Ireland's referendum were asked whether they wanted to repeal or retain a part of the constitution known as the Eighth Amendment, which says an unborn child has the same right to life as a pregnant woman. The vote in favour of repeal paves the way for the DÃ¡il (Irish Parliament) to legislate for change which would see the introduction of a much more liberal regime. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the referendum result was ""a fantastic victory for women's rights"". Afterearly results suggested a landslide,women and equalities minister Ms Mordaunt tweeted that it was a ""historic"" day for Ireland and a ""hopeful"" day for Northern Ireland, adding ""that hope must be met"".

Abortions are only allowed in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or there is a permanent or serious risk to her physical or mental health. Rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities are not circumstances in which they can be performed legally. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the UK government should take advantage of the current lack of a devolved administration in Northern Ireland.

"Donald Trump called off the upcoming US-North Korea summit on Thursday morning, catching much of official Washington, and the world, by surprise. How he did it - in a personal letter to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un - offers revealing insight at Trump-style diplomacy and what might happen next. The missive from Donald Trump - addressed to ""his excellency"", an unusual title for Mr Kim - begins a bit like a corporate form letter, thanking the North Korean leader for his ""time, patience and effort"". There's a bit of a passive-aggressive dig at Mr Kim - pointing out that he was the one who wanted the meeting, even if that's ""totally irrelevant"" - and an emphasis that this was a ""long-planned meeting"" (the idea was first suggested in March and a date and time set just weeks ago). The real meat of the letter comes at the end of the paragraph, however, as the president's pen turns poison. The North Koreans announced Thursday morning that they had collapsed the tunnels at their nuclear test site, but they accompanied it with threats of nuclear war and a demeaning dig at Vice-President Mike Pence (called ""a political dummy""). Mr Trump has shown time and time again that he won't abide verbal swipes from the North Koreans. He responds to their nuclear sabre-rattling with another round of ""fire and fury"" style language, boasting about the massive and powerful US nuclear arsenal that Donald Trump prays to God will never be used. It's a return to the rhetoric of last summer, when it appeared the US and North Korea were headed toward a military confrontation. The start of the letter may be diplomat-speak, but this is Mr Trump's voice coming through. The letter in full By the second paragraph, the diplomatic gloves are back on. There's an emphasis on the recent thaw between the two nations (a ""wonderful dialogue"") and a hint that the door has not been fully slammed shut."" The president writes that he is still looking forward to meeting the North Korean strongman (nuclear apocalypse notwithstanding). And releasing three American prisoners, one of whom had been sentenced to forced labour in a sham trial, was a much-appreciated ""beautiful gesture"". There will certainly be some critics who question whether this is an appropriate place to turn on the charm. The business letter template kicks in again in the closing paragraph, albeit with somewhat tortured prose. ""If you change your mind having to do with this most important summit, please do not hesitate to call me or write"". We have operators standing by! It finishes on a wistful note. In his tweet announcing the time and place of the now-cancelled summit, the president had said the meeting could be a ""very special moment for World Peace"". His supporters broached the idea that he should win a Nobel Prize, which he acknowledged by saying ""everyone thinks so"", adding ""the prize I want is victory for the world"". Instead, it's a ""sad moment in history"".

"Theresa May has been urged to stick to the government's timetable for having a vote on Heathrow expansion. A number of business lobby groups have signed a letter saying the government needs to ""get on with expanding the UK's airport capacity"". The BBC understands that the idea for the letter came from Heathrow itself. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has also been asking business groups to support the expansion plans, the BBC has learned. The business organisations that signed the letter have all come out in favour of Heathrow expansion in the past. The letter sent to Number 10 said: ""As Brexit approaches, Heathrow expansion is crucial to making sure the UK remains an outward-looking trading nation and is well-equipped to compete on the world stage. ""For British businesses, the benefits of expansion have always been clear: connections to new markets and trading opportunities, with better links with regional airports across the UK a boost to British exports, and a skills legacy for future generations."" The letter adds that the UK is losing ground to competition from European airports. ""There are many unknowns for businesses surrounding Britain's future trading arrangements, but what is absolutely certain is that our economic success depends on securing Heathrow's future as a leading international airport,"" it adds. The groups that put their name to the letter were the Confederation of British Industry, the British Chambers of Commerce, the Institute of Directors, the Federation of Small Businesses, the EEF - The Manufacturers' Organisation, the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and airport expansion lobby group London First. The BBC understands that these organisations were asked by Heathrow to lobby the government collectively via the letter. The timing of the letter, which has been published by Heathrow, is particularly important. The government is due to timetable a vote on the Airports National Policy Statement, which is going to set out its airport infrastructure policy - including Heathrow expansion - in the first half of the year. Heathrow regularly has meetings with the business lobby groups, and its position is that the groups sent the letter out of a mutual desire to get the vote tabled, the BBC understands. It was expected that the vote would happen before the summer recess, which runs from 24 July to 4 September. The business lobby groups and Heathrow want the vote to go ahead as planned before September because then MPs will be more pre-occupied with Brexit. The terms for Britain to leave the EU need to be concluded by 30 September 2018 under a timetable set by the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier. The UK vote on the Airports National Policy Statement will be tabled after a process is set in motion by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling. He in turn has been lobbying business groups for support for the government's Heathrow expansion plans to try to get MPs to vote in favour. Conservative MPs are likely to vote with the government. Unions and many Labour MPs also support expansion, but the Labour leadership in the past has come out against Heathrow expansion on environmental grounds.

"When a Syrian stonemason and his family were granted asylum in Greece last year they immediately made their way to the island of Crete - completing a journey begun by their great-grandparents 130 years ago. Entering a small shop in Chania, on Crete's north-west coast, Ahmed began to introduce himself. The owner looked at him open-mouthed. He understood what Ahmed was saying, but some of the words he was using were unfamiliar and old-fashioned, and others he didn't understand at all. It was as though Ahmed had arrived not just from Syria, but from another age. ""He could not believe that someone was still speaking the old language today,"" says Ahmed. Ahmed, 42, was speaking in a version of the Cretan dialect he had learned from his parents, growing up in a village in northern Syria in the 1970s and 80s. His parents had spent all their lives in Syria - but some members of the previous generation had been born in Crete and, living together as exiles, they had kept Cretan culture alive. ""We learned Arabic at school but always spoke Greek at home,"" says Ahmed. Children learned Greek dances and recited short Cretan poems known as mantiades. The parents passed on traditional Cretan recipes, such as fried snails, and intermarriage with the Syrian population was rare. Ahmed's wife, Yasmine, is also from a Cretan family. Ahmed's father's parents were forced to leave Crete in the 1890s as the Ottoman Empire weakened. The island had been part of the empire for two centuries and roughly a quarter of the population, including Ahmed's ancestors, had converted to Islam. But uprisings in the late 19th Century resulted in the expulsion of the Muslim population. Some went to Turkey, Libya, Lebanon or Palestine, but Ahmed's family travelled to al-Hamidiyah, a village in Syria established for the refugees by Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II. In later years its 10,000 inhabitants would keep in contact with modern Crete by watching Greek television via satellite and occasionally villagers would travel back to the island to work. An old postcard showing Muslims near Chania on a Friday, the traditional day of rest ""There was always a fragment of Crete in our hearts,"" says Ahmed. ""Everyone knew exactly which village everyone else's family came from. Our grandparents would say how beautiful Crete was and how they had everything they needed there. ""We always wanted to visit, but never had the chance."" Then Syria's civil war came, and left them little choice. Ahmed's sisters, Amina, Faten and Latifa, and their families were the first to leave. Ahmed himself struggled to find work after suffering from a slipped disk and had difficulty scraping together the money to pay a people smuggler. But finally he, Yasmine and their four children - Bilal, 14, Reem, 12, Mustafa, nine, and four-year-old Fatima - set off for Greece in the spring of 2017. View from the port of Chania, where Ahmed Tarzalakis and his family now live The journey took three months and included a perilous boat trip from Turkey to the Greek island of Lesbos, on a dinghy that almost sank. When the family attended their first asylum application interview, Ahmed purposely placed his finger next to his distinctively Cretan surname - Tarzalakis - when asked to show his passport. ""He started shouting to his colleagues, 'Look, look, there's a Cretan here! Come and see!'"" Ahmed says. ""Everyone started crowding round out of curiosity."" Ahmed (right) tries to see all his family members once a day - including brother-in-law, Mahmoud Razak, and nephews Khaled and Sultan Although many Greeks were aware that Cretan enclaves existed overseas, they were still intrigued by the Tarzalakis family dialect. Their accents are typically Cretan, but a lot of the vocabulary they learned in Syria is no longer used either in Crete or mainland Greece. ""But with a bit of patience, we can understand each other,"" says Ahmed. And although they speak the language they have never learned to read or write it, so they still needed assistance to fill out forms. Ahmed's youngest child, Fatima, plays with a balloon at their new home - while the television is tuned to a Syrian channel After a month on Lesbos, Ahmed and his family were granted asylum in August 2017. They immediately caught a boat to Crete, where Ahmed's sisters, two cousins and their families, already living in the town of Chania, were waiting for them. On arrival, Ahmed was immediately hospitalised, because of problems stemming from chronic epilepsy. Medical staff, amazed to hear the old dialect being spoken, called a reporter from the local paper. ""When I left hospital everyone in the town already knew me,"" says Ahmed, whose family was settled in an apartment near Chania's historic Venetian port. One of three former mosques in Chania is right on the seafront - it is now used as an exhibition space ""People would stop me in the street to ask questions about Syria and the war. ""They view us as Cretans that have returned."" Ahmed then made a pilgrimage to his grandparents' native village, Skalani, just outside the capital, Heraklion. Walking down its streets, gazing at the shady tavernas and small stone houses, he felt goosebumps all over his body. Although it was his first time visiting the village, he'd been hearing about it all his life. ""I couldn't find their exact houses, but the locals showed me the fields that the Muslim community would have worked on,"" he says. Ahmed and his siblings have to tread carefully when looking into their family history. ""I don't want the people living there to think I'm trying to claim the land back,"" says Ahmed's brother-in-law, Mustafa. Ahmed's sister Faten (right) and his wife Yasmine, go on a walk with Yasmine's younger sisters, and daughter Reem (aged 11), passing the Giali Tzamisi mosque The family is learning to read and write modern Greek and the children are enrolled in school. ""We're learning new phrases but we'll still hold our own language close, because it's part of who we are,"" says Ahmed. Although Chania had no Muslim community for more than a century, things are now changing. As well as the 25 members of Ahmed's family, several hundred refugees from the Middle East have settled in the town over the past few years. The long-closed Ottoman mosque on the seafront is now used as an art gallery, so Muslims pray in rented rooms. A recently-opened Arab supermarket sells imported goods, and Ahmed and his family enjoy eating a fusion of local and Syrian food, such as Greek salad, pitta bread, and hummus. Reem, 11, walks to school So far, Crete is not quite the land of milk and honey described by Ahmed's grandparents. He's grateful for financial assistance from the EU-funded Estia (Home) programme, run by the UNHCR, but says it's not enough to bring up four children. The men in the family would like to set up a stonemasonry business and the women talk about doing bridal hairdressing, but that remains a goal for the future. And although Ahmed appreciates the chance to experience life in his ancestors' homeland, the circumstances that led him here make the experience bittersweet. ""When you are forced to leave the place you were born, you lose a part of yourself,"" he says. ""If it was safe for us to return to al-Hamidiyah, then I would. But I would like to keep ties with Crete and visit regularly."" Photographs by Louiza Vradi Alberto Camastra had never lived anywhere but Damascus. But as Syria's war closed in around his family, Alberto's long-dead grandfather - a man he had never met - offered a way out.

"Joshua Holt went straight to the White House to be welcomed by President Trump US Vice-President Mike Pence says sanctions will remain on Venezuela despite the release of a US prisoner and his wife on Saturday. Joshua Holt and his Venezuelan wife Thamy arrived in the US accompanied by Senator Bob Corker, who helped negotiate their release. Mr Holt later met President Donald Trump at the White House. Mr Holt and his wife had been imprisoned in Venezuela for two years on charges of concealing weapons. ""Very glad that Josh Holt is now back home with his family - where he has always belonged,"" Mr Pence wrote in a tweet. ""Sanctions continue until democracy returns to Venezuela."" The couple were detained in 2016 at her family's house in the capital Caracas while waiting for US visas, and accused of hiding weapons. Both were jailed for two years. Mr Corker had held talks on Friday with Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro. The US senator shared a picture of himself with the couple after their release, adding: ""We are on our way home.""

Joshua Holt's parents, his wife Thamy and her daughter Marian Leal were also guests at the White House A spokesman for Mr Maduro said the couple's release was a ""gesture"" aimed at improving dialogue between Venezuela and the US. Mr Maduro was re-elected to a six-year term last week, but Washington has refused to recognise the outcome. The election was marred by an opposition boycott and allegations of vote-rigging. The US had previously accused Venezuela of using Mr Holt as a bargaining chip towards changing Washington's sanctions policy on the country.

"The bunker was partially flooded and had to be cleared of water A hidden World War Two bunker has been discovered under the back garden of a house in Middlesbrough. Chris Scott was having his Marton Avenue home renovated when he decided to investigate what he thought was a drain cover. But it turned out to be the entrance to a concrete-lined, two-room bunker, big enough for more than 50 people. The married father-of-one, 40, said he plans to turn the bunker into a wine cellar or an office. ""Our neighbours had mentioned something about a bunker, but to be honest we didn't think any more about it,"" Mr Scott said. ""When my builder suggested having a look at what was under the cover, we opened it up and saw a 10ft metal ladder leading down into the darkness. ""We initially used our mobile phones to look round and couldn't believe what we saw."" Mr Scott thought he had a drain cover in his garden Mr Scott says the bunker is big enough for at least 50 people A wooden door separated the bunker's two rooms A makeshift wooden table was found in one of the rooms The bunker was partially filled with water, but after it was drained two rooms measuring about 4m x 4m were revealed, which were separated by a wooden door. A homemade wooden table had also survived. Mr Scott added: ""We expected it to be quite small, but once we got through the metal blast door were were very surprised. ""There were still a lot of electrics in place and some snorkel-type devices which must have there to help people breathe."" It is thought the bunker was used to hold people during bombing raids.

"The billboard features images of local Olympic heroes the Brownlee brothers A bride-to-be says her wedding photos will be ruined by a huge advert across the front of the venue. Sarah Dooley is due to marry fiancÃ©, Andy Dodds, at Leeds Town Hall - outside which couples traditionally pose for photos - at the weekend. But they were unaware they would be sharing the stage with the advert for next month's World Triathlon. Leeds City Council said the Town Hall was ""important for promoting major events"" and the banner would remain. The sandstone facade of the picturesque Victorian building is currently hidden behind the endurance event billboard. More Yorkshire stories Ms Dooley, who met her partner while at university in Leeds, said the couple would have chosen another venue if they had known. ""We looked at tipis, castles, tree-houses, but picked Leeds Town Hall because it's iconic and we wanted our photos taken outside,"" she said. ""Leeds is really important to us, we brought our children up here and we wanted something that represented our relationship."" Sarah Dooley said she is ""disappointed"" to not have their wedding photos outside the Town Hall Ms Dooley said she did not want compensation but was ""disappointed"" that the couple were not told in advance about the banner. Instead of photos outside the town hall, the wedding party will walk to nearby Park Square. A spokesperson for Leeds City Council, which owns the town hall, said it ""understands Miss Dooley's disappointment"" but the banners would not be removed. ""Leeds Town Hall is the venue for hundreds of weddings each year and we always do our absolute best to make sure every couple's day is as special as possible"", he said. ""Banners promoting next month's World Triathlon Leeds are scheduled to be in place for several weeks and unfortunately, it isn't possible to remove them for a day.""

"Yes, you are definitely stuck... A man had to be rescued by police and the fire service after getting stuck in a child's swing in a play park. The 20-year-old had been firmly wedged in the child-sized seat for three hours before police were called to Landseer Park in Ipswich at 07:50 BST. When a ""shove and pull"" method of swing-release failed, the fire service arrived with a trusty screwdriver. The swing was taken apart and the ""grateful but embarrassed"" grown-up was freed unharmed. A Suffolk police community support officer quickly realised the man - who complained he had been in there for three hours - was definitely stuck. If a shove does not work, there's always the trusty screwdriver There was no shifting him as the girth of his rear was clearly too wide for the child-sized swing. After taking the swing to pieces and releasing the man, crews from Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service put it back together so it could be safely used by someone of the right size.

"Olympic diver Tom Daley wears the swimwear when competing Tight swimming trunks, including those made by Speedo, have been rated as the UK's most hated piece of clothing. The male swimwear - often simply referred to as Speedos or budgie-smugglers - is essentially a waterproof pair of briefs which are very fitted. In a YouGov survey, more than two thirds of Britons said they disliked the trunks, while 74% of women shared an unfavourable view of them. Only 13% of the 3,277 people asked said they liked them. Out of the 25 pieces listed, leather trousers were voted the second worst item while Crocs - the popular rubber shoe - came third. Although the trunks are worn by many athletes across the world, it seems the average Briton is not quite ready to champion the style yet. Speedo's tight fitting brief was originally designed in the 1960s to reduce drag, give support and provide freedom of movement for competitive swimmers. But Speedo admits it is no longer the most popular style of swimwear for men in the UK, with many opting for looser fitting shorts. Some of those competing in this year's Commonwealth Games braved the smaller style of swimwear Meanwhile, in parts of Europe, including in France,it is compulsory for men to wear the tight trunks in most public pools,external Matthew Smith, of YouGov, said: ""Our results show that some things really are better left to the imagination. ""No matter how ready men's beach bodies are this summer, they might not make too many friends if they stride across the sand in a pair of Speedos."" But the founder of Thorsun swimwear, George Sotelo, thinks it is ""awesome"" if men feel comfortable to wear Speedos. Last year,he told Esquire magazine,external: ""If you're wearing a Speedo, you have to have some level of confidence because it's such a statement. ""So if you look good and you can fill it out, why not? Go for it."" Mysterious sea creature found on beach How many Â£1m-plus homes are sold near you? Why this face tattoo has got NZ talking Those who took part in the survey were also asked to share their opinions on other fashions including socks and sandals and the dreaded VPL (visible panty line).

"Fulham lift the Championship play-off final trophy after beating Aston Villa 1-0 at Wembley Fulham have been promoted to the Premier League after beating Aston Villa in the Championship play-off final at Wembley. Captain Tom Cairney was their goalscorer, finishing neatly underneath Villa goalkeeper Sam Johnstone after latching onto Ryan Sessegnon's pass midway through the first half. A fractious game ended with Fulham down to 10 men after centre-back Denis Odoi was sent off for two bookable offences - both for fouls on Jack Grealish. Villa were furious that Ryan Fredericks escaped a card during a first-half tangle with Grealish, the Fulham right-back landing studs first on Grealish's leg, while the Villa man was later booked for a lunging tackle on Cairney. Several Villa penalty appeals were also waved away by referee Anthony Taylor, including one in second-half stoppage time when Grealish fell under a challenge from Matt Targett. Relive Fulham's play-off final win over Aston Villa. The game opened up after the interval, with Villa much more incisive and Grealish looking most likely to find a reply. However, the midfielder headed over the bar under pressure from Marcus Bettinelli and then saw his mazy run thwarted by a combination of the Fulham goalkeeper and Kevin McDonald. Odoi's red card invited further pressure, but Fulham held firm during a late Villa onslaught to clinch a win that is worth an estimated Â£160m - a figure which financial experts Deloitte say could rise to as much as Â£280m if the Whites survive for more than one season in the top flight. It was perhaps fitting that Sessegnon and Cairney, the two shining lights in an impressive Fulham team this season, combined to score the goal that sent them back to the top flight after a four-year absence. The pair were two of the three nominees for the EFL's Championship Player of the Season award, which was won by teenager Sessegnon. The 18-year-old winger had been largely anonymous early on, but he found space in the centre of the Villa half and picked his pass perfectly to find the onrushing Cairney, who slotted coolly into the net. Ryan Sessegnon and Tom Cairney celebrate after combining for Fulham's winning goal Sessegnon could have doubled Fulham's lead before half-time but his back-post header was directed straight at Johnstone, while he almost set up Stefan Johansen for a second goal midway through the second period. ""We've suffered for three years, not just in the second half,"" said Fulham head coach Slavisa Jokanovic, who won promotion as Watford boss in 2015 but left the Hornets before he got the chance to take charge of them in the Premier League. ""It's not been easy since I've been at this place. We've shown with our style that we can be one of the best Championship teams, and we've shown we can be solid, organised and fighting altogether for a clean sheet."" Fulham's transformation from mid-table underperformers to promotion winners has been one of the feature points of the Championship season. Defeat at struggling Sunderland on 16 December left them 12th in the table, 18 points behind the top two. Twenty-three unbeaten matches later, they were on the brink of automatic promotion and, had they won their final game at Birmingham, they would have finished second behind champions Wolves. There was to be no repeat of last season's play-off disappointment, though. The Whites saw off Derby over two legs in their semi-final before beating Villa at Wembley. Tom Cairney wheels away in delight after putting Fulham ahead midway through the first half While many have played their part, two January loan additions have been critical to their success. Newcastle striker Aleksandar Mitrovic has netted 12 goals in 20 appearances and given the team a physical presence up front, while the arrival of Southampton left-back Targett has allowed Sessegnon to push further forward and excel in a more advanced position. Fulham spent 13 successive seasons in the top flight before their relegation in 2014 and the hope is that the nucleus of this team, helped by the financial backing of owner Shahid Khan, can see them become an established Premier League club again. Their possession-based style has been as eye-catching as anything on show in the second tier and that brand of football should transfer well to the higher level, although there is very little top-flight experience in Fulham's ranks and that is likely to be an area that Jokanovic will look to address in the next couple of months. On another day, Villa could have been awarded at least one penalty and had a man advantage for more than an hour. In particular it was the Fredericks incident, which occurred right in front of the two dugouts immediately after Cairney's winning goal, that most angered Villa boss Steve Bruce. ""There were big decisions that went against us,"" said the former Manchester United captain, who failed to win a record fifth promotion from the second tier. ""For me, the boy should have had a red card very early. It was right in front of the referee and the fourth official, and for me he stamps on him. ""Nobody wants to see people sent off, but when it's as deliberate as that, he deserved a red card. ""There might have been a penalty in the second half, but what we can't disguise is that we didn't do enough in the first half. ""You just need a break and unfortunately we didn't get it."" Many Villa fans will look back at this season and wonder what might have been. What if talismanic midfielder Grealish had not sustained a freakish kidney injury that caused him to miss the first three months of the campaign? What if striker Jonathan Kodjia had not suffered another long-term injury that wrecked his second season with the club? And what if a possible season-defining 4-1 win over leaders Wolves in March, which left them four points off second place with 10 matches remaining and looked to have kick-started an automatic promotion push, had not been followed by miserable defeats by lowly QPR and Bolton? Villa have spent heavily in the past two seasons in their bid to return to the top flight, but they will have to cut their cloth accordingly as they prepare for a third successive season in the second tier. John Terry consoles Aston Villa team-mate Jack Grealish after the final whistle Grealish was their stand-out performer at Wembley. He was outstanding, almost scored one of the best goals ever in a play-off final and did not deserve to be on the losing side. His consistent form in the second half of the campaign has been a huge positive for Villa and he is sure to be a target for Premier League clubs this summer, so keeping the 22-year-old at Villa Park will be paramount to Bruce's side mounting another challenge for promotion next season. ""The discussions have got to be had above me to say what we've got and what we haven't got,"" said Bruce, who added it is up to veteran captain John Terry to decide whether he will play on at Villa Park next season. ""Of course there will be speculation about Jack. Personally, I would like him to stay. Another year with us would do him the world of good. ""We'd love to have given him the platform of the Premier League and we haven't, but he's playing regular football week in and week out. We'll see what happens.""

"Alan Bean's paintings reflected his lifelong fascination with space Former US astronaut Alan Bean, who was the fourth man to walk on the Moon, has died in Texas aged 86, his family has said. In later life he became an accomplished artist, producing paintings that were inspired by space. His family said he had fallen ill two weeks ago in Indiana,externaland died peacefully at a hospital in Houston. Astronaut Mike Massimino described Bean as ""the most extraordinary person I ever met"". ""He was a one-of-a-kind combination of technical achievement as an astronaut and artistic achievement as a painter,"" said Massimino, who flew on two space shuttle missions. Allow Twitter content?

Alan Bean, a former US Navy test pilot, was selected by Nasa as a trainee in 1963. He went into space twice, the first time in November 1969 as the lunar module pilot on the Apollo 12 Moon-landing mission. What it's like to walk on the Moon He later described how complex and risky the mission had been: ""It was more science fiction to us, I think, than it was to the average public. ""We knew how difficult it was. We knew how many things had to go right. This is like going half way across the Sahara Desert and stopping your car and getting out and camping out for a couple of days and then hoping when you start it up the battery works because if doesn't you're up creek."" Alan Bean commanded the lunar module for Apollo 12 In 1973 he was commander of the second crewed flight to Skylab - America's first space station. He retired from Nasa in 1981 and carved a successful career as an artist. His paintings, inspired by space travel, featured lunar boot prints as well as small pieces of his mission patches which were stained by Moon dust. ""While he captured these great scenes from history, and scenes that never could be captured by a camera, and only in painting, he would also basically sprinkle them with moon dust,"" space history specialist Robert Z Pearlman told the BBC. ""And so they are a tremendous legacy for not just him but the Apollo programme in general."" The three astronauts who preceded Alan Bean to the moon's surface were Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on Apollo 11 in July 1969, and Charles Conrad who was also on the Apollo 12 mission. Of the four men, only Aldrin is still alive, now aged 88. In all, 24 people have flown to the Moon and 12 have set foot on it,external.

"This video can not be played Highlights: England rally to hold slender lead First Test, Lord's (day three) England 184 & 235-6:Root 68, Buttler 66*, Bess 55* Pakistan 363:Babar 68 retired hurt England lead by 56 runs Scorecard Jos Buttler and Dom Bess both made fifties to give England a lead of 56 in the first Test against Pakistan. The recalled Buttler and debutant Bess came together when England still needed 69 to make Pakistan bat again and shared an unbroken stand of 125. Buttler reached 66 not out and Bess an unbeaten 55 to take England to 235-6. Despite 68 from captain Joe Root, a collapse of four wickets for 19 runs had earlier left England in danger of losing by an innings inside three days. Pakistan remain strong favourites, but further occupation by England's seventh-wicket pair and healthy contributions from the tail could give the hosts an outside chance of pulling off a remarkable victory. Poor weather is forecast at Lord's on Sunday, when Pakistan are due to have the second new ball available. The tourists have dominated the majority of the match, showing superiority with bat, ball and in the field until late on day three. However, for as long as Buttler and Bess remain together, England's slim hopes will continue to grow. Relive video clips and text coverage of the day's play Podcast: Listen to Michael Vaughan's analysis This video can not be played Watch: Pakistan's Amir bowls Bairstow as England toil Buttler, who played his last Test at the end of 2016, was given a surprise recall to bat at number seven on the strength of his form in the Indian Premier League. Off-spinner Bess was handed a first cap after Somerset team-mate Jack Leach suffered a broken thumb. The 20-year-old made his maiden first-class hundred for the MCC against county champions Essex in March. When they came together, England were in disarray and Pakistan were rampant. However, in glorious sunshine and on a pitch suited to batting, they absorbed the pressure before cashing in as the shadows lengthened. Buttler, so destructive in limited-overs cricket, showed restraint to nudge and work the ball into gaps. He played occasional drives or hooks on the way to only his second first-class half-century in three years. Bess showed the maturity of a player far beyond his years and experience, playing some classical cover drives when the bowlers over-pitched. Between them, they showed the patience, discipline and control that had been beyond the majority of England's batsmen during the rest of the Test. By the end batting was being made to look easy. This video can not be played Watch: Abbas traps opener Cook for one Though Pakistan enjoyed helpful conditions after England opted to bat on day one, the home side gifted wickets away to be bowled out for 184. In the second innings England's top-order were again found wanting on a surface that held no demons bar the occasional uneven bounce. Root, who played an awful drive in the first innings, looked to have learned from his mistake to compile a half-century of deft touches and flicks. The rest crumbled. Alastair Cook was lbw to a Mohammad Abbas inswinger. His opening partner Mark Stoneman somehow scratched to nine before going back to leg-spinner Shadab Khan to be bowled. His place is under serious threat. The collapse came after Root and Dawid Malan added 60 for the third wicket. Malan and Jonny Bairstow fell in the same Mohammad Amir over. Malan poked at the ball to be well caught by wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed and Bairstow loosely pushed at a good ball that took his off stump. Ben Stokes chipped Shadab to mid-wicket and, when Root was trapped in front by Abbas, England had lost four wickets in 37 balls. The game looked gone, but then came Buttler and Bess. Until Buttler and Bess dominated the final session on day three, Pakistan had been in firm control of this match. They have reaped the benefits of an extended period of preparation and, for so long, have played the English conditions better than England. Without injured batsman Babar Azam, the tourists took their overnight 350-8 to 363 when the ninth and final wicket of Abbas fell. Then, they set about the England batting. Abbas and Amir were excellent, leading an attack that not only carried a constant threat but also starved England of any early opportunities to score. Leg-spinner Shadab twirled away from the Pavilion End, turning the ball down the slope and playing tricks out of the rough - the delivery that bowled Stoneman scuttled through without bouncing. Late in the day they were forced to retreat and the body language of some of the fielders began to look a little despondent. Still, the bowling remained wholehearted and the prospect of the second new ball on Sunday means that Pakistan could still wrap up victory very quickly. Root made his highest first-class score of the season Test Match Special summariser Michael Vaughan England's top order always seem to find ways of getting out and there is always a little collapse around the corner with this England team. Your top six has to be consistent and Joe Root is too good a player to keep getting out for fifty. He was really fighting today because he was in no sort of rhythm. Malan is a concern for me, he does seem to hang back and there were too many dot balls, and Stoneman went back to a ball he should have been forward to. England always seem to find themselves 100-5 and that's always a concern for the Test team. I look at the top order, in white ball cricket they all know their roles. The Test top-order I don't see any partnerships I look at with any confidence. Bess and Buttler timed the ball nicely and ran hard, I haven't seen that from the top order in a long time. If they get out of this with anything it will be a miracle.

The musician says the phrase has been used in reaction to his latest single, Don't Miss It, as well as older music. ""It is only ever a good thing to talk about what is on your mind,"" he says. Artists including Anne-Marie and Years & Years' Olly Alexander have backed his comments. ""Shame on whoever is calling him 'sad boy' and putting him in that box, it's embarrassing for them,"" Olly told Radio 1 Newsbeat. Allow Twitter content?

""We are already in an epidemic of male depression and suicide,"" James wrote on Twitter, referencing the fact that suicideis the biggest killer of men under 45in the UK. ""I've seen enough friends drown in this, and almost drowned in it myself because I bottled everything up, afraid of being seen as weak or soft. ""I now see the great strength, and benefit for those around you in actually opening up."" Olly Alexander was speaking at the Biggest Weekend in Swansea Acts including Olly Alexander from Years & Years have backed his comments: ""We're very pro James Blake, lots of love and support to him,"" he told Newsbeat. ""It's hard for everybody, but with men especially there's a stigma around talking about how you feel."" Ollyhas had his own struggles with bottling things up, revealing recently that he was advised to keep his sexuality hidden at the beginning of Years & Years' career. But labels are something he has had to deal with since winning the BBC's Sound of 2015. ""I'm always going to be boxed in as a gay singer,"" he says. ""It's something I just have to negotiate and it's interesting to see who does label you and who doesn't - because it tells you more about the person labelling you than it does about yourself."" Mabel says speaking about mental health shouldn't be 'taboo' ""Sad boy"" is a term Mabel definitely thinks is unhelpful. The 22-year-old says she's struggled with anxiety and depression growing up, and believes being open about it helps. ""I'm hoping if I talk about it then other people talk about it and we can have this discussion and it's not taboo,"" she says. The singer says it's not always possible to do all the things she needs to do. ""Obviously when you're not feeling well it can be really hard to play a show or do an interview or a photo shoot. ""You have to tell people how you're feeling - write a song about it."" Anne-Marie played to more than 25,000 people in Swansea Anne-Marie says that ""it's good to hear it from a man"". ""I feel there's a lot of girls and women trying to get men to talk - I do anyway,"" she explains. ""Artists should take a lot of responsibility because they have a large audience. ""The more they speak about issues like mental health, the better it is. ""I find we forgot about the men and how they feel. Now is the time. It's good."" Isaac Gracie believes the phrase ""sad boy music"" is discouraging Singer-songwriter Isaac Gracie says James Blake's message ""really is something that resonated with me"". The former choir boy says that ""sad boy music"" is ""one of these damaging terminologies we've become too comfortable with glossing over"". ""I've felt my music being perhaps kind of - not disregarded, but almost being put down, to a certain extent, as 'sad boy music' - and actually that's a discouraging thing. ""There are matters of anxiety, depression and real mental health issues that I think are worth talking about and that 'sad boy' situation is just the tip of the iceberg.""

"The owner of Boots has rejected claims it overcharged the NHS for a mouthwash used by cancer patients. Aninvestigation by the Times,externalnewspaper said the high street chemist charged the NHS Â£3,220 for the medicinal mouthwash, which can cost Â£93. Walgreens Boots Alliance said its businesses complied with the law. NHS England said pharmacies should seek to secure best value, while ministers have asked the Competition and Markets Authority to consider investigating. The mouthwash - used by patients with sores caused by chemotherapy - is among a group of drugs known as specials. Specials are unlicensed medicines for non-standard treatments. The Times claims Boots has benefitted from a legal loophole that allows suppliers to set their own prices for these drugs. The paper says the mouthwash was ordered from Alliance Healthcare - a supplier owned by Boots' parent company. From 2013-2017, the paper says Boots charged Â£3,219 to supply three 200ml bottles, then Â£3,220 for the same amount,  Â£1,843 for an 800ml treatment, Â£1,989.12 for 800ml and Â£6,374.25 for 2,600ml. Meanwhile in 2016, a pharmacy in West Sussex charged Â£31.14 for one 200ml bottle, the equivalent of Â£93.42 for 600ml. Specials are unlicensed medicines that do not have central marketing authorisation either in the UK or Europe. They have not been assessed by the regulatory authority for safety, or efficacy in the same way as licensed medicines. They are manufactured, imported or distributed to meet the needs of an individual patient. They are only supposed to be prescribed when there is no alternative licensed medicine available. More than 75,000 different formulations of specials are prescribed each year. They make up about 1% of all prescriptions. Walgreens Boots Alliance has not disputed the figures, but says it has not over-charged the health service. The company said the bespoke nature of specials - often ordered at short notice - results in the final cost. ""We firmly reject accusations of overcharging the NHS,"" a Walgreens Boots Alliance spokesperson said. ""Our senior company leaders have already recently met with officials from the Department of Health to discuss the specials products."" The statement added that specials make up ""an extremely small proportion of the total items dispensed in the UK"". The Times reports that specials cost the health service about Â£75m a year. The NHS in England spends around Â£16bn a year on drugs. NHS 'overcharged by millions for key drug' Are some prescription drugs overpriced? Millions of prescription drugs on black market Health minister Steve Brine said the public would take ""an extremely dim view of any company found to be exploiting our NHS and patients"". ""Where there is evidence of collusion between pharmacies and suppliers, swift action will be taken to claw back funds and penalise offenders,"" he added. The newspaper also reported that the NHS had paid various pharmacies Â£2,645 for basic sleeping pills that can cost Â£1 and Â£3,200 for arthritis painkillers that have been charged at less than Â£1 per pack. An NHS England spokesperson said: ""Local GP groups are right to clamp down on situations where a company is attempting to rip off patients and taxpayers. Any company that does so should get the full force of civil and where appropriate criminal enforcement.""

"This video can not be played Highlights: England rally to hold slender lead First Test, Lord's (day three) England 184 & 235-6:Root 68, Buttler 66*, Bess 55* Pakistan 363:Babar 68 retired hurt England lead by 56 runs Scorecard Jos Buttler and Dom Bess both made fifties to give England a lead of 56 in the first Test against Pakistan. The recalled Buttler and debutant Bess came together when England still needed 69 to make Pakistan bat again and shared an unbroken stand of 125. Buttler reached 66 not out and Bess an unbeaten 55 to take England to 235-6. Despite 68 from captain Joe Root, a collapse of four wickets for 19 runs had earlier left England in danger of losing by an innings inside three days. Pakistan remain strong favourites, but further occupation by England's seventh-wicket pair and healthy contributions from the tail could give the hosts an outside chance of pulling off a remarkable victory. Poor weather is forecast at Lord's on Sunday, when Pakistan are due to have the second new ball available. The tourists have dominated the majority of the match, showing superiority with bat, ball and in the field until late on day three. However, for as long as Buttler and Bess remain together, England's slim hopes will continue to grow. Relive video clips and text coverage of the day's play Podcast: Listen to Michael Vaughan's analysis This video can not be played Watch: Pakistan's Amir bowls Bairstow as England toil Buttler, who played his last Test at the end of 2016, was given a surprise recall to bat at number seven on the strength of his form in the Indian Premier League. Off-spinner Bess was handed a first cap after Somerset team-mate Jack Leach suffered a broken thumb. The 20-year-old made his maiden first-class hundred for the MCC against county champions Essex in March. When they came together, England were in disarray and Pakistan were rampant. However, in glorious sunshine and on a pitch suited to batting, they absorbed the pressure before cashing in as the shadows lengthened. Buttler, so destructive in limited-overs cricket, showed restraint to nudge and work the ball into gaps. He played occasional drives or hooks on the way to only his second first-class half-century in three years. Bess showed the maturity of a player far beyond his years and experience, playing some classical cover drives when the bowlers over-pitched. Between them, they showed the patience, discipline and control that had been beyond the majority of England's batsmen during the rest of the Test. By the end batting was being made to look easy. This video can not be played Watch: Abbas traps opener Cook for one Though Pakistan enjoyed helpful conditions after England opted to bat on day one, the home side gifted wickets away to be bowled out for 184. In the second innings England's top-order were again found wanting on a surface that held no demons bar the occasional uneven bounce. Root, who played an awful drive in the first innings, looked to have learned from his mistake to compile a half-century of deft touches and flicks. The rest crumbled. Alastair Cook was lbw to a Mohammad Abbas inswinger. His opening partner Mark Stoneman somehow scratched to nine before going back to leg-spinner Shadab Khan to be bowled. His place is under serious threat. The collapse came after Root and Dawid Malan added 60 for the third wicket. Malan and Jonny Bairstow fell in the same Mohammad Amir over. Malan poked at the ball to be well caught by wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed and Bairstow loosely pushed at a good ball that took his off stump. Ben Stokes chipped Shadab to mid-wicket and, when Root was trapped in front by Abbas, England had lost four wickets in 37 balls. The game looked gone, but then came Buttler and Bess. Until Buttler and Bess dominated the final session on day three, Pakistan had been in firm control of this match. They have reaped the benefits of an extended period of preparation and, for so long, have played the English conditions better than England. Without injured batsman Babar Azam, the tourists took their overnight 350-8 to 363 when the ninth and final wicket of Abbas fell. Then, they set about the England batting. Abbas and Amir were excellent, leading an attack that not only carried a constant threat but also starved England of any early opportunities to score. Leg-spinner Shadab twirled away from the Pavilion End, turning the ball down the slope and playing tricks out of the rough - the delivery that bowled Stoneman scuttled through without bouncing. Late in the day they were forced to retreat and the body language of some of the fielders began to look a little despondent. Still, the bowling remained wholehearted and the prospect of the second new ball on Sunday means that Pakistan could still wrap up victory very quickly. Root made his highest first-class score of the season Test Match Special summariser Michael Vaughan England's top order always seem to find ways of getting out and there is always a little collapse around the corner with this England team. Your top six has to be consistent and Joe Root is too good a player to keep getting out for fifty. He was really fighting today because he was in no sort of rhythm. Malan is a concern for me, he does seem to hang back and there were too many dot balls, and Stoneman went back to a ball he should have been forward to. England always seem to find themselves 100-5 and that's always a concern for the Test team. I look at the top order, in white ball cricket they all know their roles. The Test top-order I don't see any partnerships I look at with any confidence. Bess and Buttler timed the ball nicely and ran hard, I haven't seen that from the top order in a long time. If they get out of this with anything it will be a miracle. Mohammad Abbas took the key wickets of Alastair Cook and Joe Root Bess - aged 20 and 308 days - is the third youngest to score fifty on debut for England, after Denis Compton and Haseeb Hameed Pakistan have gone three Test series unbeaten against England; winning twice in the United Arab Emirates before holding the hosts to a 2-2 draw in England in 2016 England haven't suffered a Test series defeat to Pakistan on home soil since 1996; they have recorded two victories and two draws since then England last lost a home Test series in June 2014 (v Sri Lanka); claiming five wins and two draws since Listen as Aggers meets award-winning chef Tommy Banks England fight back after collapse - watch video clips from day three at Lord's England need coaching, says Vaughan Patient Pakistan punish sloppy England Test Match Special: Clips and Podcast England and Wales Cricket Board Pakistan Cricket Board TMS Facebook Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser 'Bergvall is headline act as young Spurs show incredible maturity' West Ham to appoint Potter after sacking Lopetegui Tottenham's Bentancur taken off on stretcher after injury against Liverpool Paddyâs loaf-changing experience inside the bread factory Paddy McGuinness visits the factory he used to work in to find out how they bake 1.4 million loaves a week Dara Ã  Briain and Isy Suttie discover strange-but-true tales The pair are joined by astronaut Helen Sharman to learn about how humans learned to survive in space A round-up of 2024's top sports stories.

"Joshua Holt went straight to the White House to be welcomed by President Trump US Vice-President Mike Pence says sanctions will remain on Venezuela despite the release of a US prisoner and his wife on Saturday. Joshua Holt and his Venezuelan wife Thamy arrived in the US accompanied by Senator Bob Corker, who helped negotiate their release. Mr Holt later met President Donald Trump at the White House. Mr Holt and his wife had been imprisoned in Venezuela for two years on charges of concealing weapons. ""Very glad that Josh Holt is now back home with his family - where he has always belonged,"" Mr Pence wrote in a tweet. ""Sanctions continue until democracy returns to Venezuela."" The couple were detained in 2016 at her family's house in the capital Caracas while waiting for US visas, and accused of hiding weapons. Both were jailed for two years. Mr Corker had held talks on Friday with Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro. The US senator shared a picture of himself with the couple after their release, adding: ""We are on our way home.""

""I'm just so grateful for what you guys have done, and for thinking about me, and caring about me, just a normal person,"" he added. ""It really touches me."" Joshua Holt's parents, his wife Thamy and her daughter Marian Leal were also guests at the White House A spokesman for Mr Maduro said the couple's release was a ""gesture"" aimed at improving dialogue between Venezuela and the US. Mr Maduro was re-elected to a six-year term last week, but Washington has refused to recognise the outcome. The election was marred by an opposition boycott and allegations of vote-rigging. The US had previously accused Venezuela of using Mr Holt as a bargaining chip towards changing Washington's sanctions policy on the country. Venezuela has not discussed the nature of the talks with Mr Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but said they were ""good news for the Venezuelan people"".

She is also a Mormon and the couple intended that Ms Caleno and her children would move with Mr Holt to the US following the marriage, but they were arrested instead.

"Fulham lift the Championship play-off final trophy after beating Aston Villa 1-0 at Wembley Fulham have been promoted to the Premier League after beating Aston Villa in the Championship play-off final at Wembley. Captain Tom Cairney was their goalscorer, finishing neatly underneath Villa goalkeeper Sam Johnstone after latching onto Ryan Sessegnon's pass midway through the first half. A fractious game ended with Fulham down to 10 men after centre-back Denis Odoi was sent off for two bookable offences - both for fouls on Jack Grealish. Villa were furious that Ryan Fredericks escaped a card during a first-half tangle with Grealish, the Fulham right-back landing studs first on Grealish's leg, while the Villa man was later booked for a lunging tackle on Cairney. Several Villa penalty appeals were also waved away by referee Anthony Taylor, including one in second-half stoppage time when Grealish fell under a challenge from Matt Targett. Relive Fulham's play-off final win over Aston Villa. The game opened up after the interval, with Villa much more incisive and Grealish looking most likely to find a reply. However, the midfielder headed over the bar under pressure from Marcus Bettinelli and then saw his mazy run thwarted by a combination of the Fulham goalkeeper and Kevin McDonald. Odoi's red card invited further pressure, but Fulham held firm during a late Villa onslaught to clinch a win that is worth an estimated Â£160m - a figure which financial experts Deloitte say could rise to as much as Â£280m if the Whites survive for more than one season in the top flight. It was perhaps fitting that Sessegnon and Cairney, the two shining lights in an impressive Fulham team this season, combined to score the goal that sent them back to the top flight after a four-year absence. The pair were two of the three nominees for the EFL's Championship Player of the Season award, which was won by teenager Sessegnon. The 18-year-old winger had been largely anonymous early on, but he found space in the centre of the Villa half and picked his pass perfectly to find the onrushing Cairney, who slotted coolly into the net. Ryan Sessegnon and Tom Cairney celebrate after combining for Fulham's winning goal Sessegnon could have doubled Fulham's lead before half-time but his back-post header was directed straight at Johnstone, while he almost set up Stefan Johansen for a second goal midway through the second period. ""We've suffered for three years, not just in the second half,"" said Fulham head coach Slavisa Jokanovic, who won promotion as Watford boss in 2015 but left the Hornets before he got the chance to take charge of them in the Premier League. ""It's not been easy since I've been at this place. We've shown with our style that we can be one of the best Championship teams, and we've shown we can be solid, organised and fighting altogether for a clean sheet."" Fulham's transformation from mid-table underperformers to promotion winners has been one of the feature points of the Championship season. Defeat at struggling Sunderland on 16 December left them 12th in the table, 18 points behind the top two. Twenty-three unbeaten matches later, they were on the brink of automatic promotion and, had they won their final game at Birmingham, they would have finished second behind champions Wolves. There was to be no repeat of last season's play-off disappointment, though. The Whites saw off Derby over two legs in their semi-final before beating Villa at Wembley. Tom Cairney wheels away in delight after putting Fulham ahead midway through the first half While many have played their part, two January loan additions have been critical to their success. Newcastle striker Aleksandar Mitrovic has netted 12 goals in 20 appearances and given the team a physical presence up front, while the arrival of Southampton left-back Targett has allowed Sessegnon to push further forward and excel in a more advanced position. Fulham spent 13 successive seasons in the top flight before their relegation in 2014 and the hope is that the nucleus of this team, helped by the financial backing of owner Shahid Khan, can see them become an established Premier League club again. Their possession-based style has been as eye-catching as anything on show in the second tier and that brand of football should transfer well to the higher level, although there is very little top-flight experience in Fulham's ranks and that is likely to be an area that Jokanovic will look to address in the next couple of months. On another day, Villa could have been awarded at least one penalty and had a man advantage for more than an hour. In particular it was the Fredericks incident, which occurred right in front of the two dugouts immediately after Cairney's winning goal, that most angered Villa boss Steve Bruce. ""There were big decisions that went against us,"" said the former Manchester United captain, who failed to win a record fifth promotion from the second tier. ""For me, the boy should have had a red card very early. It was right in front of the referee and the fourth official, and for me he stamps on him. ""Nobody wants to see people sent off, but when it's as deliberate as that, he deserved a red card. ""There might have been a penalty in the second half, but what we can't disguise is that we didn't do enough in the first half. ""You just need a break and unfortunately we didn't get it."" Many Villa fans will look back at this season and wonder what might have been. What if talismanic midfielder Grealish had not sustained a freakish kidney injury that caused him to miss the first three months of the campaign? What if striker Jonathan Kodjia had not suffered another long-term injury that wrecked his second season with the club? And what if a possible season-defining 4-1 win over leaders Wolves in March, which left them four points off second place with 10 matches remaining and looked to have kick-started an automatic promotion push, had not been followed by miserable defeats by lowly QPR and Bolton? Villa have spent heavily in the past two seasons in their bid to return to the top flight, but they will have to cut their cloth accordingly as they prepare for a third successive season in the second tier. John Terry consoles Aston Villa team-mate Jack Grealish after the final whistle Grealish was their stand-out performer at Wembley. He was outstanding, almost scored one of the best goals ever in a play-off final and did not deserve to be on the losing side. His consistent form in the second half of the campaign has been a huge positive for Villa and he is sure to be a target for Premier League clubs this summer, so keeping the 22-year-old at Villa Park will be paramount to Bruce's side mounting another challenge for promotion next season. ""The discussions have got to be had above me to say what we've got and what we haven't got,"" said Bruce, who added it is up to veteran captain John Terry to decide whether he will play on at Villa Park next season. ""Of course there will be speculation about Jack. Personally, I would like him to stay. Another year with us would do him the world of good. ""We'd love to have given him the platform of the Premier League and we haven't, but he's playing regular football week in and week out. We'll see what happens.""

"When a Syrian stonemason and his family were granted asylum in Greece last year they immediately made their way to the island of Crete - completing a journey begun by their great-grandparents 130 years ago. Entering a small shop in Chania, on Crete's north-west coast, Ahmed began to introduce himself. The owner looked at him open-mouthed. He understood what Ahmed was saying, but some of the words he was using were unfamiliar and old-fashioned, and others he didn't understand at all. It was as though Ahmed had arrived not just from Syria, but from another age. ""He could not believe that someone was still speaking the old language today,"" says Ahmed. Ahmed, 42, was speaking in a version of the Cretan dialect he had learned from his parents, growing up in a village in northern Syria in the 1970s and 80s. His parents had spent all their lives in Syria - but some members of the previous generation had been born in Crete and, living together as exiles, they had kept Cretan culture alive. ""We learned Arabic at school but always spoke Greek at home,"" says Ahmed. Children learned Greek dances and recited short Cretan poems known as mantiades. The parents passed on traditional Cretan recipes, such as fried snails, and intermarriage with the Syrian population was rare. Ahmed's wife, Yasmine, is also from a Cretan family. Ahmed's father's parents were forced to leave Crete in the 1890s as the Ottoman Empire weakened. The island had been part of the empire for two centuries and roughly a quarter of the population, including Ahmed's ancestors, had converted to Islam. But uprisings in the late 19th Century resulted in the expulsion of the Muslim population. Some went to Turkey, Libya, Lebanon or Palestine, but Ahmed's family travelled to al-Hamidiyah, a village in Syria established for the refugees by Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II. In later years its 10,000 inhabitants would keep in contact with modern Crete by watching Greek television via satellite and occasionally villagers would travel back to the island to work. An old postcard showing Muslims near Chania on a Friday, the traditional day of rest ""There was always a fragment of Crete in our hearts,"" says Ahmed. ""Everyone knew exactly which village everyone else's family came from. Our grandparents would say how beautiful Crete was and how they had everything they needed there. ""We always wanted to visit, but never had the chance."" Then Syria's civil war came, and left them little choice. Ahmed's sisters, Amina, Faten and Latifa, and their families were the first to leave. Ahmed himself struggled to find work after suffering from a slipped disk and had difficulty scraping together the money to pay a people smuggler. But finally he, Yasmine and their four children - Bilal, 14, Reem, 12, Mustafa, nine, and four-year-old Fatima - set off for Greece in the spring of 2017. View from the port of Chania, where Ahmed Tarzalakis and his family now live The journey took three months and included a perilous boat trip from Turkey to the Greek island of Lesbos, on a dinghy that almost sank. When the family attended their first asylum application interview, Ahmed purposely placed his finger next to his distinctively Cretan surname - Tarzalakis - when asked to show his passport. ""He started shouting to his colleagues, 'Look, look, there's a Cretan here! Come and see!'"" Ahmed says. ""Everyone started crowding round out of curiosity."" Ahmed (right) tries to see all his family members once a day - including brother-in-law, Mahmoud Razak, and nephews Khaled and Sultan Although many Greeks were aware that Cretan enclaves existed overseas, they were still intrigued by the Tarzalakis family dialect. Their accents are typically Cretan, but a lot of the vocabulary they learned in Syria is no longer used either in Crete or mainland Greece. ""But with a bit of patience, we can understand each other,"" says Ahmed. And although they speak the language they have never learned to read or write it, so they still needed assistance to fill out forms. Ahmed's youngest child, Fatima, plays with a balloon at their new home - while the television is tuned to a Syrian channel After a month on Lesbos, Ahmed and his family were granted asylum in August 2017. They immediately caught a boat to Crete, where Ahmed's sisters, two cousins and their families, already living in the town of Chania, were waiting for them. On arrival, Ahmed was immediately hospitalised, because of problems stemming from chronic epilepsy. Medical staff, amazed to hear the old dialect being spoken, called a reporter from the local paper. ""When I left hospital everyone in the town already knew me,"" says Ahmed, whose family was settled in an apartment near Chania's historic Venetian port. One of three former mosques in Chania is right on the seafront - it is now used as an exhibition space ""People would stop me in the street to ask questions about Syria and the war. ""They view us as Cretans that have returned."" Ahmed then made a pilgrimage to his grandparents' native village, Skalani, just outside the capital, Heraklion. Walking down its streets, gazing at the shady tavernas and small stone houses, he felt goosebumps all over his body. Although it was his first time visiting the village, he'd been hearing about it all his life. ""I couldn't find their exact houses, but the locals showed me the fields that the Muslim community would have worked on,"" he says. Ahmed and his siblings have to tread carefully when looking into their family history. ""I don't want the people living there to think I'm trying to claim the land back,"" says Ahmed's brother-in-law, Mustafa. Ahmed's sister Faten (right) and his wife Yasmine, go on a walk with Yasmine's younger sisters, and daughter Reem (aged 11), passing the Giali Tzamisi mosque The family is learning to read and write modern Greek and the children are enrolled in school. ""We're learning new phrases but we'll still hold our own language close, because it's part of who we are,"" says Ahmed. Although Chania had no Muslim community for more than a century, things are now changing. As well as the 25 members of Ahmed's family, several hundred refugees from the Middle East have settled in the town over the past few years. The long-closed Ottoman mosque on the seafront is now used as an art gallery, so Muslims pray in rented rooms. A recently-opened Arab supermarket sells imported goods, and Ahmed and his family enjoy eating a fusion of local and Syrian food, such as Greek salad, pitta bread, and hummus. Reem, 11, walks to school So far, Crete is not quite the land of milk and honey described by Ahmed's grandparents. He's grateful for financial assistance from the EU-funded Estia (Home) programme, run by the UNHCR, but says it's not enough to bring up four children. The men in the family would like to set up a stonemasonry business and the women talk about doing bridal hairdressing, but that remains a goal for the future. And although Ahmed appreciates the chance to experience life in his ancestors' homeland, the circumstances that led him here make the experience bittersweet. ""When you are forced to leave the place you were born, you lose a part of yourself,"" he says. ""If it was safe for us to return to al-Hamidiyah, then I would. But I would like to keep ties with Crete and visit regularly."" Photographs by Louiza Vradi Alberto Camastra had never lived anywhere but Damascus. But as Syria's war closed in around his family, Alberto's long-dead grandfather - a man he had never met - offered a way out.

People who turned up to the first dates of his UK tour in Manchester with resold tickets were told they were invalid and had to buy new ones. ""The only people it is going to harm in the end is the touts,"" Ed told Newsbeat at the Biggest Weekend in Swansea. ""I hate the idea of people paying more than face value for tickets when you can get them at face value."" Ed spoke to Newsbeat at the Biggest Weekend in Swansea Ed Sheeran 'warms up' Biggest Weekend Some fans were angryat their tickets not being valid, including one woman who said she was ""fuming"" after apparently paying Â£400 for two tickets. Secondary ticketing is when people buy tickets for a gig and resell them - usually using sites like Viagogo, StubHub, GetMeIn and Seatwave. Consumer rights group the Fan Fair Alliance says these sites are used by ticket touts, resulting in something which is ""hugely damaging"" to the music business. Allow Twitter content?

"Fulham lift the Championship play-off final trophy after beating Aston Villa 1-0 at Wembley Fulham have been promoted to the Premier League after beating Aston Villa in the Championship play-off final at Wembley. Captain Tom Cairney was their goalscorer, finishing neatly underneath Villa goalkeeper Sam Johnstone after latching onto Ryan Sessegnon's pass midway through the first half. A fractious game ended with Fulham down to 10 men after centre-back Denis Odoi was sent off for two bookable offences - both for fouls on Jack Grealish. Villa were furious that Ryan Fredericks escaped a card during a first-half tangle with Grealish, the Fulham right-back landing studs first on Grealish's leg, while the Villa man was later booked for a lunging tackle on Cairney. Several Villa penalty appeals were also waved away by referee Anthony Taylor, including one in second-half stoppage time when Grealish fell under a challenge from Matt Targett. Relive Fulham's play-off final win over Aston Villa. The game opened up after the interval, with Villa much more incisive and Grealish looking most likely to find a reply. However, the midfielder headed over the bar under pressure from Marcus Bettinelli and then saw his mazy run thwarted by a combination of the Fulham goalkeeper and Kevin McDonald. Odoi's red card invited further pressure, but Fulham held firm during a late Villa onslaught to clinch a win that is worth an estimated Â£160m - a figure which financial experts Deloitte say could rise to as much as Â£280m if the Whites survive for more than one season in the top flight. It was perhaps fitting that Sessegnon and Cairney, the two shining lights in an impressive Fulham team this season, combined to score the goal that sent them back to the top flight after a four-year absence. The pair were two of the three nominees for the EFL's Championship Player of the Season award, which was won by teenager Sessegnon. The 18-year-old winger had been largely anonymous early on, but he found space in the centre of the Villa half and picked his pass perfectly to find the onrushing Cairney, who slotted coolly into the net. Ryan Sessegnon and Tom Cairney celebrate after combining for Fulham's winning goal Sessegnon could have doubled Fulham's lead before half-time but his back-post header was directed straight at Johnstone, while he almost set up Stefan Johansen for a second goal midway through the second period. ""We've suffered for three years, not just in the second half,"" said Fulham head coach Slavisa Jokanovic, who won promotion as Watford boss in 2015 but left the Hornets before he got the chance to take charge of them in the Premier League. ""It's not been easy since I've been at this place. We've shown with our style that we can be one of the best Championship teams, and we've shown we can be solid, organised and fighting altogether for a clean sheet."" Fulham's transformation from mid-table underperformers to promotion winners has been one of the feature points of the Championship season. Defeat at struggling Sunderland on 16 December left them 12th in the table, 18 points behind the top two. Twenty-three unbeaten matches later, they were on the brink of automatic promotion and, had they won their final game at Birmingham, they would have finished second behind champions Wolves. There was to be no repeat of last season's play-off disappointment, though. The Whites saw off Derby over two legs in their semi-final before beating Villa at Wembley. Tom Cairney wheels away in delight after putting Fulham ahead midway through the first half While many have played their part, two January loan additions have been critical to their success. Newcastle striker Aleksandar Mitrovic has netted 12 goals in 20 appearances and given the team a physical presence up front, while the arrival of Southampton left-back Targett has allowed Sessegnon to push further forward and excel in a more advanced position. Fulham spent 13 successive seasons in the top flight before their relegation in 2014 and the hope is that the nucleus of this team, helped by the financial backing of owner Shahid Khan, can see them become an established Premier League club again. Their possession-based style has been as eye-catching as anything on show in the second tier and that brand of football should transfer well to the higher level, although there is very little top-flight experience in Fulham's ranks and that is likely to be an area that Jokanovic will look to address in the next couple of months. On another day, Villa could have been awarded at least one penalty and had a man advantage for more than an hour. In particular it was the Fredericks incident, which occurred right in front of the two dugouts immediately after Cairney's winning goal, that most angered Villa boss Steve Bruce. ""There were big decisions that went against us,"" said the former Manchester United captain, who failed to win a record fifth promotion from the second tier. ""For me, the boy should have had a red card very early. It was right in front of the referee and the fourth official, and for me he stamps on him. ""Nobody wants to see people sent off, but when it's as deliberate as that, he deserved a red card. ""There might have been a penalty in the second half, but what we can't disguise is that we didn't do enough in the first half. ""You just need a break and unfortunately we didn't get it."" Many Villa fans will look back at this season and wonder what might have been. What if talismanic midfielder Grealish had not sustained a freakish kidney injury that caused him to miss the first three months of the campaign? What if striker Jonathan Kodjia had not suffered another long-term injury that wrecked his second season with the club? And what if a possible season-defining 4-1 win over leaders Wolves in March, which left them four points off second place with 10 matches remaining and looked to have kick-started an automatic promotion push, had not been followed by miserable defeats by lowly QPR and Bolton? Villa have spent heavily in the past two seasons in their bid to return to the top flight, but they will have to cut their cloth accordingly as they prepare for a third successive season in the second tier.

"Melissa McCarthy has a puppet partner in the cop-buddy film The creators of the famous children's TV show Sesame Street have launched a lawsuit against an upcoming sex, drugs and violence-laden puppet-based movie called the Happytime Murders. The movie uses the tagline ""No Sesame. All Street"" on promotional material. The lawsuit says this tarnishes the Sesame Street brand and confuses people into thinking the two are linked. Melissa McCarthy stars in the film, slated for August release, where humans and puppets co-exist. She is given a new puppet partner in the R-rated film to try to solve a string of murders.

Sesame Workshop, the educational organisation behind the TV show, filed the lawsuit against the film's producers,STX Productions,external, in New York. The lawsuit calls for punitive damages and a jury trial. Sesame Workshop says that although the trailer for the movie is ""indescribably crude"", it is not seeking to block the film's promotion. ""It is only [the] defendants' deliberate choice to invoke and commercially misappropriate 'Sesame's' name and goodwill in marketing the movie - and thereby cause consumers to conclude that 'Sesame' is somehow associated with the movie - that has infringed on and tarnished the 'Sesame Street' mark and goodwill."" Just what Bert and Ernie would make of the new flick is anybody's guess It says the '""No Sesame. All Street' tagline has confused and appalled viewers"". The film is directed by Brian Henson, son of the late Jim Henson, who helped develop Sesame Street characters for its launch in 1969 and later went on to create the Muppet Show. STX issued a response via a character from the film, a lawyer called Fred, saying the movie was ""the untold story of the active lives of Henson puppets when they're not performing in front of children"". It continued: ""While we're disappointed that Sesame Street does not share in the fun, we are confident in our legal position."" Kermit star loses role Sesame Street's first autistic puppet.

"This video can not be played Returning Officer Barry Ryan delivered the results in Irish and English The Republic of Ireland has voted overwhelmingly to overturn the abortion ban by 66.4% to 33.6%. A referendum held on Friday resulted in a landslide win for the repeal side. Currently, abortion is only allowedwhen a woman's life is at risk, but not in cases of rape, incest or fatal foetal abnormality. The Eighth Amendment, which grants an equal right to life to the mother and unborn, will be replaced. The declaration was made at Dublin Castle at 18:13 local time. The only constituency to vote against repealing the Eighth amendment was Donegal, with 51.9% voting against the change. Crowds celebrate outside Dublin Castle after the result was announced A vote in favour of repeal paves the way for the DÃ¡il (Irish Parliament) to legislate for change which would see the introduction of a much more liberal regime. In 2015 the country voted overwhelmingly tolegalise same-sex marriage in a historic referendum. Ireland's time of reckoning The people travelling #HomeToVote Timeline: Ireland and abortion Referendum results Reacting to the result, the taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar, who campaigned in favour of liberalisation, said it was ""a historic day for Ireland,"" and that a ""quiet revolution"" had taken place. Mr Varadkar told crowds at Dublin Castle the result showed the Irish public ""trust and respect women to make their own decision and choices."" He added: ""It's also a day when we say no more. No more to doctors telling their patients there's nothing can be done for them in their own country, no more lonely journeys across the Irish Sea, no more stigma as the veil of secrecy is lifted and no more isolation as the burden of shame is gone."" This video can not be played Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar: ""Today we say no more"" He said that some had voted yes with ""pride"", but many had voted yes with ""sorrowful acceptance and heavy hearts"". Mr Varadkar said he understood that those who had voted against repeal would be unhappy. He said he had a message for them: ""I know today is not welcome and you may feel this country has taken the wrong turn, that this country is one you no longer recognise. ""I want to reassure you that Ireland today is the same as it was last week, but more tolerant, open and respectful."" He said by and large it had been a respectful campaign. He added: ""We voted to look reality in the eye and we did not blink. ""We choose to provide companionship where there was once a cold shoulder and medical care where we once turned a blind eye"". This video can not be played Ireland votes in abortion referendum Mr Varadkar said he hoped to have a new abortion law enacted by the end of this year. By Shane Harrison, BBC News NI Dublin Correspondent In three months time, Pope Francis will travel to Ireland and find a country undoing part of the legacy of a previous papal visit. In 1983, four years after the triumphal visit of Pope John Paul II, the Irish people put the Eighth Amendment into their constitution. The amendment gave equal rights to life to both the mother and the unborn. Friday's vote, which paves the way for parliamentarians to liberalise abortion law, represents a seismic shift. It also represents another sign of the societal change that has taken place in the Republic, coming just three years after the country officially passed the same sex marriage referendum with 62% in favour. Read more here. Counting began at 09:00. After the polls were published, one of the main anti-abortion campaigns conceded it had lost the vote. Repeal campaigners celebrate at Dublin Castle, where the result was announced The Save The 8th campaign described the result as a ""tragedy of historic proportions"". ""The unborn child no longer has a right to life recognised by the Irish state,"" said its spokesman John McGuirk. However, he vowed that No campaigners would continue to protest, ""if and when abortion clinics are opened in Ireland"". The leader of the main Irish opposition party, MicheÃ¡l Martin of Fianna FÃ¡il, said the vote was the ""dawn of a new era"". He said he had wrestled with the issue, but added the people had made the right decision and it would mean better care for women in Irish hospitals. Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald, whose party campaigned in favour of a Yes vote, said: ""We have without doubt done right by Irish women for this generation and many to come."" Amnesty International hailed the result as a ""momentous win for women's rights"" that ""marks the beginning of a new Ireland"". The vote will have repercussions for women north of the border, as Northern Irelandhas the strictest abortion laws in the UK. Cases of rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormality are not considered grounds for a legal termination. The UK's Women and Equalities Minister Penny Mordaunt said thepredicted landslide vote gave ""hope"" to Northern Ireland. It has been an emotive campaign with harrowing stories on both sides Grainne Teggart of Amnesty International UK said the people of Ireland have ""given hope to women around the world"". But she added Northern Ireland is still subject to restrictive abortion laws. ""It's hypocritical, degrading and insulting to Northern Irish women that we are forced to travel for vital healthcare services but cannot access them at home,"" Ms Teggart said. ""We cannot be left behind in a corner of the UK and on the island of Ireland as second-class citizens."" Former Northern Ireland health minister Jim Wells said the expected result was a ""grave threat"" to the unborn child in Northern Ireland. Mr Wells, a Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politician,  claimed it was ""inevitable"" that abortion clinics would be set up in border towns to ""promote their services to Northern Ireland women"". ""It will be much easier to terminate a child's life if this can be done at a clinic in Dundalk or Letterkenny rather than flying to London or Manchester,"" he added.

"This video can not be played 'Quiet revolution ' - Irish PM Leo Varadkar The Irish prime minister has hailed his country's ""quiet revolution"" as early results point to a ""resounding"" vote for overturning the abortion ban. Leo Varadkar was speaking afterexit polls suggested a landslide vote in favour of reforming the law. ""The people have spoken. They have said we need a modern constitution for a modern country,"" he said. Exit polls suggest about 69% voted to repeal a part of the constitution that effectively bans terminations. Live coverage: Referendum results Ireland's time of reckoning The people travelling #HomeToVote Timeline: Ireland and abortion Mr Varadkar, who campaigned in favour of liberalisation, said: ""What we've seen is the culmination of a quiet revolution that's been taking place in Ireland over the past 20 years."" The taoiseach (prime minister) added that Irish voters ""trust and respect women to make the right choices and decisions about their own healthcare"". This video can not be played Ireland votes in abortion referendum Those taking part in Friday's referendum were asked whether they wanted to repeal or retain a part of the constitution known as the Eighth Amendment, which says an unborn child has the same right to life as a pregnant woman. A vote in favour of repeal paves the way for the DÃ¡il (Irish Parliament) to legislate for change which would see the introduction of a much more liberal regime. Currently, abortion is only allowed when a woman's life is at risk, but not in cases of rape, incest or fatal foetal abnormality. Mr Varadkar said he hoped to have a new abortion law enacted by the end of this year. Counting began at 09:00 local time and the confirmed result is expected by Saturday evening. However, the exit poll run by Irish broadcaster RTÃ suggested 69.4% in favour of the Yes side and 30.6% for No. In Dublin, 79% of people voted for repeal, according to the RTÃ poll. An exit poll released by The Irish Times points to 68% Yes to 32% for No. Hours after the polls were published, one of the main anti-abortion campaigns conceded it had lost the vote. The Save The 8th campaign described the result as a ""tragedy of historic proportions"".

"Melissa McCarthy has a puppet partner in the cop-buddy film The creators of the famous children's TV show Sesame Street have launched a lawsuit against an upcoming sex, drugs and violence-laden puppet-based movie called the Happytime Murders. The movie uses the tagline ""No Sesame. All Street"" on promotional material. The lawsuit says this tarnishes the Sesame Street brand and confuses people into thinking the two are linked. Melissa McCarthy stars in the film, slated for August release, where humans and puppets co-exist. She is given a new puppet partner in the R-rated film to try to solve a string of murders.

Sesame Workshop, the educational organisation behind the TV show, filed the lawsuit against the film's producers,STX Productions,external, in New York. The lawsuit calls for punitive damages and a jury trial. Sesame Workshop says that although the trailer for the movie is ""indescribably crude"", it is not seeking to block the film's promotion. ""It is only [the] defendants' deliberate choice to invoke and commercially misappropriate 'Sesame's' name and goodwill in marketing the movie - and thereby cause consumers to conclude that 'Sesame' is somehow associated with the movie - that has infringed on and tarnished the 'Sesame Street' mark and goodwill."" Just what Bert and Ernie would make of the new flick is anybody's guess It says the '""No Sesame. All Street' tagline has confused and appalled viewers"". The film is directed by Brian Henson, son of the late Jim Henson, who helped develop Sesame Street characters for its launch in 1969 and later went on to create the Muppet Show. STX issued a response via a character from the film, a lawyer called Fred, saying the movie was ""the untold story of the active lives of Henson puppets when they're not performing in front of children"". It continued: ""While we're disappointed that Sesame Street does not share in the fun, we are confident in our legal position."" Kermit star loses role Sesame Street's first autistic puppet.

"The crab has a square-shaped shell and is covered in tiny bristles A colony of exploding ants, a shrimp that's been named after prog rockers Pink Floyd, four types of miniature night frog and a coconut-cracking giant rat - these are just some of the new species discovered in the past year. While all of these exotic creatures were found many thousands of miles away from Britain, such discoveries aren't the preserve of scientists in the remotest part of some far-flung wilderness. In fact, it's estimated there are thousands of species yet to be identified in the UK alone - and many millions globally. The hairy crab that's potentially the latest new-to-science domestic discovery was collected by naturalist and photographer Steve Trewhella on Chesil Beach, near Weymouth, in Dorset. The 2cm-wide creature was found living inside a polystyrene buoy that washed ashore following a storm and is suspected to have travelled across the Atlantic from the Caribbean. Mr Trewhella, who has sent the crab to the Natural History Museum for identification, hopes the tiny crustacean could prove to be his greatest success story. Steve Trewhella keeps many of the live creatures he finds in tanks at home in order to study them ""I was ungraded in every single subject I took at school - I failed miserably,"" says Mr Trewhella, who runs a cleaning business to help fund his passion for nature. ""I was that geeky kid by the pond or with my head in a rock pool."" He's been waiting patiently to discover if his fascination with nature might cause his name to be recorded in posterity. ""They're now looking for samples of DNA from other Caribbean hairy crab species to try and eliminate or compare, but it's a long process,"" Mr Trewhella says. ""It'd be nice to have an elephant named after you but elephants are easy to find and hairy crabs aren't, so the more obscure the better."" In 2016, Mr Trewhella found a springtail that hadn't been recorded in the UK for 34 years Scientists estimatethere are about 8.7 million specieson Earth, yet only a surprisingly small number - 1.2 million - have been formally identified. In the UK, more than 70,000 species of animals, plants, fungi and single-celled organisms have been recorded. Dr Peter Shaw, the UK's official recorder for springtail bugs, says some domestic habitats remain ""remarkably unexplored"". ""There are many microscopic creatures that haven't yet been recorded, not because they're not there but simply because people aren't looking for them,"" he says. ""Humans are more interested in the bigger, more conventionally attractive animals."" This newly discovered worm has provisionally been given the snappy title ""Emits Yellow Muscus A"" British nature lovers who like the idea of making their mark on taxonomy might be missing a trick as, according to the Natural History Museum, ""small, less easy to identify organisms will no doubt turn out to be new species to Britain and even to science"". For example, a new species of beetle is discovered in the UK about once a decade, says Max Barclay, senior curator at the museum. Quedius lyszkowskii LottandMirosternomorphus heali Bercedo & Arnaizwere the last two to be found, in 2010, in Kent and parts of Scotland. You might also like: Fishing nets and false teeth: Meet the beach debris hunters Searching for the sublime: The man who paints in the ocean Ocean plastic could triple in decade Dr David Agassiz wrote the original paper on a pale grey moth with brown speckles,Prays peregrina, first discovered in London in 2003. It has since been spotted in Cambridge, Kent and Sussex, but there are no records of it anywhere else in the world, he says. ""Either they must be breeding locally or else emerging from imported plant material or foodstuffs,"" he adds. But he says the lack of records from any other country is ""surprising"" and the fact they were not found prior to 2003 is ""puzzling"". Goose barnacles are among the crustaceans from US waters that Mr Trewhella has found on the Dorset coast This pale grey moth with brown speckles was first discovered in London in 2003 In 2014, Dr Andrew Polaszek published the description of a new species of parasitoid wasp. These delightful creatures lay their eggs on or in other insects, which are then eaten alive by their larvae. The wasp, Encarsia harrisoni,was found in a school playground in suburban Sevenoaks, Kent. It was one of the first new UK species to be confirmed using DNA sequencing technology, Dr Polaszek says. Mirosternomorphus heali Bercedo & Arnaiz (left) and Quedius lyszkowskii Lott are the most recently discovered species of beetle in the UK David Fenwick, who produces photographic wildlife identification guides of marine life, recently unearthed a worm in Penzance, which he provisionally gave the snappy title ""Emits Yellow Muscus A"". It's related toEulalia clavigera- the common green leaf worm - which is found on rocky shores but emits a clear, rather than yellow mucus, he says. He argues we could be discovering many more new-to-science species, but they're not deemed ""commercially important"". ""If a species was important for cod, for example, it might get supported but, sadly, small microscopic, obscure species are largely being left in obscurity."" New plant life is also being identified - this seaweed was collected in Devon last month by National History Museum researcher Prof Juliet Brodie As well as those species that were previously unknown to science, others are new introductions to Britain or haven't been seen for a while, the Natural History Museum's identification team says. Mr Trewhella is a dab hand at finding creatures such as tropical worms, crustaceans and molluscs that have made it to our shores from overseas on plastic - which he describes as an ""artificial conveyor"". ""Some objects can be a real treasure trove. I found six new species to northern Europe on one little polystyrene buoy the size of a football,"" the 54-year-old says. He's also found bugs that haven't been seen in the UK for a long time, including a 2mm springtail he collected on the seaweed-strewn strandline at Chesil Fleet in 2016 that hadn't been recorded in the UK for 34 years. Goggles with microscope lenses are ""a must"" when bug hunting Mr Trewhella keeps many of the creatures he finds in tanks at home so he can study them - luckily for him his wife is a marine biologist. It's particularly important that we learn more about species coming to the UK from abroad, Mr Trewhella believes. ""It's speculative at the moment but as our seas potentially warm due to climate change, then there's a possibility that these animals could break the barrier of being able to survive in our waters, which would potentially be catastrophic. ""Invasive species always have a detrimental effect, no matter what size they are. ""Just look at the effect grey squirrels have had on our reds and the introduction of the rhododendron that has strangled our native trees and plants."" Encarsia harrisoni larvae inside a whitefly (above) and an emerged adult He says his main aim is ""to inspire others to get out and engage with the natural world"". ""We are in danger of assuming we know everything and have found all the animals that occupy the planet, but of course this is not the case. ""New species are found quite often and genetic work is rewriting many classifications of ones we are familiar with,"" he says. ""It doesn't have to be new or rare, it's just about understanding why things are there, the role they play and what would happen if they did not exist.

"Junk food is often promoted to kids on social media Social media stars might be encouraging children to eat more unhealthy snacks, a new study suggests. It found children who saw popular vloggers consuming sugary and fatty snacks went on to eat 26% more calories than those who did not. The study, presented at the European Congress on Obesity, examined the responses of children to images from social media. The findings come amid calls for tougher rules on junk food advertising. The social media stars used in the study were Zoella, who has 10.9 million followers on Instagram, and Alfie Deyes, who has 4.6 million. Children consuming online time 'like junk food' Children 'bombarded by junk food' ads on family shows Stop junk food ads on kids' apps - WHO Allow Twitter content?

The 176 children were split into three groups and shown either pictures of the personalities promoting unhealthy snacks, healthy foods or non-food products. The children were then offered a range of healthy and unhealthy snacks to choose from, including grapes, carrot sticks, chocolate buttons or jelly sweets. The children who had seen the unhealthy images consumed an average of 448 calories, while the others ate just 357. Alfie Deyes was one of the social media stars used in the study Dr Emma Boyland, one of the researchers from the University of Liverpool, said that children consider vloggers to be ""everyday people"" just like their peers. ""They've earned a position of trust among young people and there has to be some responsibility along the line,"" she said. The researchers called for more protection for children online, particularly on social media channels where it is unclear whether they understand the difference between an advert and genuine content. Dr Boyland said: ""On TV there are more cues as to when it's advertising - there's an advert break, there's a jingle - whereas digitally it's a lot more embedded in the rest of the content."" Anna Coates, the lead researcher on the study, said: ""We know that if you show children a traditional drink advert, then their preference for that drink rises. We wanted to test their reactions to this new type of celebrity, the social media star. ""Now that we've shown that children are influenced by online stars, our next study will look at whether they understand that, in many cases, celebrities are being paid to promote products."" Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, called on the government to consider more regulation to protect children in its forthcoming childhood obesity strategy. ""It's vital that children are protected from the marketing of junk food, not only on TV but also online where they are increasingly spending time. ""Companies are able to target their adverts on social media, which does provide the opportunity for regulators to put restrictions in place.""

"Afghan interpreters worked with the Army on the front line in Helmand Province A scheme aimed at protecting Afghan civilians who worked as interpreters for the Army has not resettled a single person in the UK and has proved an ""utter failure"", MPs have said. The Commons Defence Committee said the Intimidation Scheme had instead gone to lengths to stop relocations. The Ministry of Defence says Britain is the only nation that has a team in Kabul, investigating intimidation. But Col Simon Diggins said interpreters were being attacked in Afghanistan. ""We have credible evidence of individuals being murdered, others have been chased out of their homes,"" the former defence attachÃ© to Kabul told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. About 2,000 former interpreters are ""stuck"" in Afghanistan ""under continual daily threat"", he said. In Afghanistan, ""if you worked for any coalition countries including the British, your neighbours will know"", BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale added. Afghan interpreters' immigration fee waived Army interpreter fears death if deported Afghan interpreters 'should stay in UK' Tory MP and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Tom Tugendhat, who served in Afghanistan, said the government had a ""duty of care"" for locally employed civilians. Mr Tugendhat told the BBC an interpreter he had served alongside ""earned his place in the UK many times over"". ""But there are others and that is why I gave evidence to the committee,"" he added. The cross-party report said the Intimidation Scheme's shortcomings were in contrast to another initiative, known as the Redundancy Scheme, which has seen 1,150 Afghans re-homed in Britain. It called for a more ""sympathetic approach"" to those who risked their lives to support British forces during their 13-year combat mission in Afghanistan, which ended in 2014. Tory MP Julian Lewis, who chairs the defence committee, said if the UK earns a reputation ""for leaving those people who put their lives at risk to help our soldiers, at the mercy of our enemies"",  it would be difficult to find local people prepared to help in future conflicts. Mohammed Hares, an Afghan interpreter for the British Army from 2009 to 2014 Mohammed Hares was relocated to the UK in 2016 and now chairs the Sulha Network - which represents Afghan interpreters When you leave home in the morning, you don't know whether you are going to come back home alive. And that is not just the interpreters themselves, but also the families. They can't tell anybody even nowadays that they were interpreters. If people find out even now, they will just kill them. They will kill their families, they will kill them, they will torture them, they will put the videos on social media as a lesson for everybody else. I think when we were working with the British Army in Afghanistan, we helped them to achieve their aims. We helped them in the worst situations. We saved their lives. Now it is their duty to do their job and to help those people who are still in Afghanistan. The Redundancy Scheme is open to Afghan civilians who had been working in front-line roles for at least 12 months when the UK began to reduce its troop presence in late 2012. The committee noted that despite previous criticism of its criteria, that scheme had been ""generous and proportionate"". While the Intimidation Scheme was ""in theory"" open to all civilians working for the British, the report found that it had focused ""overwhelmingly"" on ways of keeping them in Afghanistan, through internal relocation or the offer of security advice, and that resettlement to the UK was seen as a last resort. The report also criticised the Afghan government, which was involved in creating the schemes, saying its claim that relocation might lead to a ""brain drain"" was ""disingenuous"". ""It is impossible to reconcile the generosity of the Redundancy Scheme with the utter failure of the Intimidation Scheme to relocate even a single locally employed citizen to the United Kingdom,"" it concluded. Campaigners welcomed the report and urged the government to reconsider its approach. ""Many of our brother interpreters found themselves in significant danger after the British campaign in Helmand,"" said a spokesman for the Sulha Network - which represents Afghan interpreters. ""The eligibility criteria for the resettlement scheme was arbitrary and narrow and the intimidation scheme has only served to give false hope to those who fear for their safety."" The Ministry of Defence said it would take note of the criticism. ""Our intimidation policy is designed to ensure that former Afghan local staff are safe to live their lives in the country and we provide tailored security advice and support to individuals,"" a spokesman said. Earlier this month, it was announced that Afghan interpreters who were relocated to Britain wouldnot have to paythe Home Office to stay. More than 150 translators given a five-year visa to seek sanctuary in Britain wrote to new Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson to highlight their concerns. The interpreters who worked on the battlefield in Helmand Province had said they faced deportation if they could not find the Â£2,398 per person to apply for indefinite leave to remain once their visas expired.

"This video can not be played Korean leaders' surprise ""Hollywood"" meeting The leaders of North and South Korea have met in the demilitarised border area between the two countries. The meeting is only the second between South Korea's Moon Jae-in and the North's Kim Jong-un. It comes as the two sides continue efforts to put a historic US-North Korea summit back on track. US President Donald Trump cancelled the summit, scheduled to be held in Singapore on  12 June, but later suggested it might still go ahead. The latest talks were held on the northern side of the Panmunjom truce village, between 15:00 and 17:00 local time (06:00 and 08:00 GMT), Mr Moon's office said. ""Both leaders exchanged opinions... for the successful holding of the North Korea-US summit,"" it added, saying that Mr Moon would announce the outcome of the talks on Sunday morning. In Washington, Trump administration spokeswoman Sarah Sanders confirmed that an advance team of White House and Department of State officials would leave for Singapore this weekend, as originally scheduled, to prepare for a possible summit there. Moon Jae-in (second left) and Kim Jong-un (far right) hold talks at the border Trump hints at reinstating N Korea summit Rush to buy Trump-Kim coin after summit cancellation The talks between Mr Trump and Mr Kim, if they were to go ahead, would be focused on ways of denuclearising the Korean peninsula and reducing tensions. After cancelling the scheduled summit last Thursday, blaming North Korea's ""tremendous anger and open hostility"", Mr Trump tweeted on Friday that ""very productive talks"" had taken place with the North on reinstating the summit with Mr Kim. ""We're gonna see what happens. We're talking to them [North Korea] now. It was a very nice statement they put out,"" Mr Trump told reporters at the White House in Washington. He was referring to comments from the North's Vice-Foreign Minister, Kim Kye-gwan, who said that Mr Trump's decision was ""unexpected"" and ""extremely regrettable"", adding that Pyongyang was willing ""to sit face to face at any time"". Analysis: Decoding Trump's letter to Kim 'My country was trying to test Trump' While Mr Trump said in a letter addressed to Mr Kim that he had cancelled the ""long-planned"" meeting ""for the good of both parties"", he also said that ""wonderful dialogue"" had recently taken place and that he was still looking forward to meeting the North Korean leader. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. While the goal of both sides is said to be denuclearisation, what this actually means to Pyongyang and Washington appears to differ. US officials have said they would like to see the complete and irreversible dismantling of the North's nuclear programme and weapons, allowing international inspectors to check every step of that process, before any talk of sanctions being lifted. For North Korea, denuclearisation means a much more reciprocal agreement. If Pyongyang were to give up its nuclear assets, it would like to see a comparable gesture from Washington. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme explained North Korea crisis in 300 words The US has a large military presence in South Korea and in Japan - both of which North Korea would expect to be scaled down. It also wants assurances that its survival as a state would never be in question. This video can not be played The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on Doubt was cast over the scheduled summit when North became angered by comments from senior US officials, who made comparisons with Libya. There, former leader Colonel Gaddafi gave up his nascent nuclear programme only for him to be killed by Western-backed rebels a few years later. In April, the leaders of both Koreas held a historic meeting at the border, promising to end hostilities and work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. The rare dialogue - the first time the Korean leaders met to hold talks since 2007 - came after months of improving relations between the two countries. Five key moments from the Kim-Moon meeting At the carefully choreographed meeting, Mr Kim said that he wanted to ""write a new chapter"" for the region's troubled history. ""New history starts from now, at the historic starting point of an era of peace,"" he said. Future economic co-operation between the Koreas was also discussed, and Mr Kim admitted to Mr Moon that the North's critical infrastructure was in need of improvement. Such projects are likely to have suffered under international and US sanctions, imposed on the North as a reaction against its nuclear programme and missile tests.

"Sir Richard will be one of the first to ride on his company's SpaceShipTwo vehicle Sir Richard Branson says he's training to be an astronaut and will take his first trip into space soon. He toldBBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme: ""We're talking about months away, not years away - so it's close. There are exciting times ahead. ""I'm going for astronaut training; I'm going for fitness training, centrifuge and other training, so that my body will hopefully cope well when I go to space."" The 67-year-old multi-millionaire has been investing in commercial space travel since 2004, when he founded space tourism company Virgin Galactic. This video can not be played Sir Richard: ""We're talking about months away, not years away"" Sir Richard, tech entrepreneur Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos are now in a race to get fare-paying passengers into space. The British entrepreneur said: ""Elon is doing fantastically well getting cargo into space, and he's building bigger and bigger rockets."" But the commercial travel space race is between Branson and Bezos, the UK businessman believes. ""I think we're both neck and neck as to who will put people into space first,"" Sir Richard said. ""Ultimately, we have to do it safely. It's more a race with ourselves to make sure we have the craft that are safe to put people up there."" Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin company has developed the New Shepard rocket and capsule Sir Richard hopes to be one of those first space tourists. He said his astronaut training was going well so far, and he has increased his fitness by playing tennis four times a day. ""Instead of doing one set of tennis every morning and every evening, I'm doing two sets. I'm going kiting and biking - doing whatever it takes to make me as fit as possible."" The Virgin founder is also taking part in gruelling centrifuge training which recreates the pressures the human body experiences during spaceflight. All astronauts endure G-force training, which simulates the experience of lift-off and travel through the Earth's atmosphere. He added: ""If you're going to really enjoy the experience, the fitter you can be the better."" Earlier this year, Virgin Galactic completed a supersonic test flight of its SpaceShipTwo passenger rocket ship. It was the first powered flight for the company's new vehicle following the break-up of the previous craft high over the Californian desert. The incident, in 2014, resulted in the death of one pilot and left the other seriously injured. Monday'sYou and Yours programmeis about future transport technology.

"Britain's first-ever Dota 2 major tournament wants to ""offer inspiration"" to UK fans, organisers say. The event, being held in Birmingham this weekend, see teams from across the world compete for a $1m (Â£750,000) prize pool. There are only a few top level British players of the game, but tickets for the event sold out in 24 hours. James Dean, from event organiser ESL, says: ""We're hoping the major will offer inspiration to the UK community."" He hopes that seeing the world's best players up close and personal will help drive more UK-based players to compete at the top level. He told Newsbeat: ""If there was a full UK team on the roster, the event would have more of a significant impact and that is an exciting prospect. ""On the international scene there are very few PC teams in e-sports that are British, but that is slowly changing. ""We're finding that UK-based players are getting there, but not a full British team yet."" Gamers compete for a $1m (Â£750,000) prize pool Console-based games like Call of Duty, FIFA and Halo have more British representation at top tier esports events. British team Splyce reached the final of theCall of Duty World League in 2016for example. James says that ESL is working to grow the UK's esports scene for console and PC gamers.

He says the event will have a ""significant impact around the world"" because it's a major tournament backed by Valve - the makers of the game. ""We also put it up in the midlands rather than the usual location, which is London."" This major is a qualifying tournament for Dota 2's biggest event called The International. That is often calledthe biggest e-sports event in the worldwith a prize pool of $24m (around Â£18.5m). The online battle arena game is one of the most popular in the world with millions of players worldwide. It is considered one of the big three esports alongside League of Legends and CS:GO.

"Sir Richard will be one of the first to ride on his company's SpaceShipTwo vehicle Sir Richard Branson says he's training to be an astronaut and will take his first trip into space soon. He toldBBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme: ""We're talking about months away, not years away - so it's close. There are exciting times ahead. ""I'm going for astronaut training; I'm going for fitness training, centrifuge and other training, so that my body will hopefully cope well when I go to space."" The 67-year-old multi-millionaire has been investing in commercial space travel since 2004, when he founded space tourism company Virgin Galactic. This video can not be played Sir Richard: ""We're talking about months away, not years away"" Sir Richard, tech entrepreneur Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos are now in a race to get fare-paying passengers into space. The British entrepreneur said: ""Elon is doing fantastically well getting cargo into space, and he's building bigger and bigger rockets."" But the commercial travel space race is between Branson and Bezos, the UK businessman believes. ""I think we're both neck and neck as to who will put people into space first,"" Sir Richard said. ""Ultimately, we have to do it safely. It's more a race with ourselves to make sure we have the craft that are safe to put people up there."" Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin company has developed the New Shepard rocket and capsule Sir Richard hopes to be one of those first space tourists. He said his astronaut training was going well so far, and he has increased his fitness by playing tennis four times a day. ""Instead of doing one set of tennis every morning and every evening, I'm doing two sets. I'm going kiting and biking - doing whatever it takes to make me as fit as possible."" The Virgin founder is also taking part in gruelling centrifuge training which recreates the pressures the human body experiences during spaceflight. All astronauts endure G-force training, which simulates the experience of lift-off and travel through the Earth's atmosphere. He added: ""If you're going to really enjoy the experience, the fitter you can be the better."" Earlier this year, Virgin Galactic completed a supersonic test flight of its SpaceShipTwo passenger rocket ship. It was the first powered flight for the company's new vehicle following the break-up of the previous craft high over the Californian desert. The incident, in 2014, resulted in the death of one pilot and left the other seriously injured. Monday'sYou and Yours programmeis about future transport technology.

"This video can not be played As Harvey Weinstein turns himself in, an accuser, Rose McGowan, reacts Former Hollywood film mogul Harvey Weinstein has been released on $1m (Â£751,000) bail after being charged in New York with rape and sexual abuse. Mr Weinstein, 66, also agreed to wear a GPS tracker and to surrender his passport after turning himself in to police on Friday. He denies non-consensual sex and his lawyer said he would plead not guilty. The actress Rose McGowan, who accused Mr Weinstein of rape, told the BBC it was an ""amazing day for his survivors"". ""It's a very significant moment, it's a concrete slap in the face of abusive power,"" she said. ""It's just the beginning of that process and if we can see this through to the end, I hope we emerge victorious."" The allegations against the disgraced film producer triggered the #MeToo movement, which sought to demonstrate and draw attention to the widespread prevalence of sexual abuse and harassment. Harvey Weinstein did not speak during his brief appearance at Manhattan Criminal Court More than 70 women have accused Mr Weinstein of sexual misconduct although the charges relate to only two of them. Some allegations date back decades. New York City police said on Friday that Mr Weinstein had been charged with rape, sex abuse, sexual misconduct and a criminal sex act. The charges related to incidents involving two women, who were not identified. He had arrived at a police station in lower Manhattan during the morning, carrying three books. After having his mugshot and fingerprints taken, he was led out in handcuffs and taken to court. In the brief court appearance, prosecutor Joan Illuzzi said the former studio boss had ""used his position, money and power to lure young women into situations where he was able to violate them sexually"". Where the Weinstein case goes from here Who has accused Weinstein of what? What has #MeToo actually changed? Witnesses say Mr Weinstein appeared pale and stared into space while prosecutors outlined the bail agreement. The case was then adjourned until 30 July. Outside the court, Mr Weinstein's lawyer, Ben Brafman, told reporters his client would enter a not guilty plea. ""We intend to move very quickly to dismiss these charges,"" Mr Brafman said. ""We believe that they are constitutionally flawed. We believe that they are not factually supported by the evidence."" The New York Police Department issued a statement thanking ""these brave survivors for their courage to come forward and seek justice"". The identity of one of the women whose accusations prompted the charges was confirmed by her lawyer on Friday. Former actress Lucia Evans had already publicly accused Mr Weinstein of forcing her into oral sex in 2004. Lucia Evans is thought to be one of the accusers who prompted Friday's charges ""This is an emotional moment,"" her lawyer, Carrie Golberg, said in a statement. ""Today is big. But sexual violence is still happening. A victim or offender's fame should not matter. These cases must be prosecuted."" These are the first criminal charges against Mr Weinstein, who already faces a raft of civil lawsuits. Mr Weinstein was fired last year from his production firm, the Weinstein Company, which later filed for bankruptcy. He has been condemned by top industry figures, and the organisation behind the Oscars expelled him from its membership. Where does the Weinstein case go from here?

"Afghan interpreters worked with the Army on the front line in Helmand Province A scheme aimed at protecting Afghan civilians who worked as interpreters for the Army has not resettled a single person in the UK and has proved an ""utter failure"", MPs have said. The Commons Defence Committee said the Intimidation Scheme had instead gone to lengths to stop relocations. The Ministry of Defence says Britain is the only nation that has a team in Kabul, investigating intimidation. But Col Simon Diggins said interpreters were being attacked in Afghanistan. ""We have credible evidence of individuals being murdered, others have been chased out of their homes,"" the former defence attachÃ© to Kabul told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. About 2,000 former interpreters are ""stuck"" in Afghanistan ""under continual daily threat"", he said. In Afghanistan, ""if you worked for any coalition countries including the British, your neighbours will know"", BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale added. Afghan interpreters' immigration fee waived Army interpreter fears death if deported Afghan interpreters 'should stay in UK' Tory MP and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Tom Tugendhat, who served in Afghanistan, said the government had a ""duty of care"" for locally employed civilians. Mr Tugendhat told the BBC an interpreter he had served alongside ""earned his place in the UK many times over"". ""But there are others and that is why I gave evidence to the committee,"" he added. The cross-party report said the Intimidation Scheme's shortcomings were in contrast to another initiative, known as the Redundancy Scheme, which has seen 1,150 Afghans re-homed in Britain. It called for a more ""sympathetic approach"" to those who risked their lives to support British forces during their 13-year combat mission in Afghanistan, which ended in 2014. Tory MP Julian Lewis, who chairs the defence committee, said if the UK earns a reputation ""for leaving those people who put their lives at risk to help our soldiers, at the mercy of our enemies"",  it would be difficult to find local people prepared to help in future conflicts. Mohammed Hares, an Afghan interpreter for the British Army from 2009 to 2014 Mohammed Hares was relocated to the UK in 2016 and now chairs the Sulha Network - which represents Afghan interpreters When you leave home in the morning, you don't know whether you are going to come back home alive. And that is not just the interpreters themselves, but also the families. They can't tell anybody even nowadays that they were interpreters. If people find out even now, they will just kill them. They will kill their families, they will kill them, they will torture them, they will put the videos on social media as a lesson for everybody else. I think when we were working with the British Army in Afghanistan, we helped them to achieve their aims. We helped them in the worst situations. We saved their lives. Now it is their duty to do their job and to help those people who are still in Afghanistan. The Redundancy Scheme is open to Afghan civilians who had been working in front-line roles for at least 12 months when the UK began to reduce its troop presence in late 2012. The committee noted that despite previous criticism of its criteria, that scheme had been ""generous and proportionate"". While the Intimidation Scheme was ""in theory"" open to all civilians working for the British, the report found that it had focused ""overwhelmingly"" on ways of keeping them in Afghanistan, through internal relocation or the offer of security advice, and that resettlement to the UK was seen as a last resort. The report also criticised the Afghan government, which was involved in creating the schemes, saying its claim that relocation might lead to a ""brain drain"" was ""disingenuous"". ""It is impossible to reconcile the generosity of the Redundancy Scheme with the utter failure of the Intimidation Scheme to relocate even a single locally employed citizen to the United Kingdom,"" it concluded. Campaigners welcomed the report and urged the government to reconsider its approach. ""Many of our brother interpreters found themselves in significant danger after the British campaign in Helmand,"" said a spokesman for the Sulha Network - which represents Afghan interpreters. ""The eligibility criteria for the resettlement scheme was arbitrary and narrow and the intimidation scheme has only served to give false hope to those who fear for their safety."" The Ministry of Defence said it would take note of the criticism. ""Our intimidation policy is designed to ensure that former Afghan local staff are safe to live their lives in the country and we provide tailored security advice and support to individuals,"" a spokesman said. Earlier this month, it was announced that Afghan interpreters who were relocated to Britain wouldnot have to paythe Home Office to stay. More than 150 translators given a five-year visa to seek sanctuary in Britain wrote to new Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson to highlight their concerns. The interpreters who worked on the battlefield in Helmand Province had said they faced deportation if they could not find the Â£2,398 per person to apply for indefinite leave to remain once their visas expired.

"On Friday 25 May, people in the Republic of Ireland voted on whether they want to make changes to the country's strict abortion laws, upheld in the Eighth Amendment of the Irish constitution. So where does the law currently stand? Since 2013, terminations have been allowed in Ireland but only when the life of the mother is at risk, including from suicide. The maximum penalty for accessing an illegal abortion is 14 years in prison. In 2016, the Irish Department of Health said there were 25 legal abortions carried out in Ireland. In the same year, 3,265 women travelled from Ireland to the UK for a termination. After independence, Ireland retained many UK laws, one of which was the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 which criminalised abortion. However, in the early 1980s, following legal cases in other jurisdictions allowing the introduction of less restrictive abortion laws, some people became concerned that something similar could happen in Ireland. This video can not be played The background and potential outcomes to the Republic of Ireland's abortion referendum In 1983, after a referendum, an eighth amendment was added to the country's constitution known as Article 40.3.3. In it, the state acknowledged ""the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right"". After a further referendum in 1992, two other changes were made to the constitution in relation to women seeking to access terminations. The Thirteenth Amendment said women were free to travel to other countries to access abortion services. The Fourteenth Amendment stated that the constitution would not prevent people accessing information relating to ""services lawfully available in another state"". In 2013, the law was changed when the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) voted to allow abortions under limited circumstances. TheProtection of Life During Pregnancy Actallowed terminations to be carried out where there is a threat to the life of the mother. They would also be allowed where there is medical consensus that the expectant mother will take her own life over her pregnancy. In 2017, the Citizens' Assembly, a body set up advise the Irish government on constitutional change,voted to replace or amend the part of Ireland's Constitutionwhich strictly limits the availability of abortion. So on 25 May, 2018, the Irish people were asked if they wanted to remove the Eighth Amendment and allow politicians to set the country's abortion laws in the future. The wording on the ballot paper read: ""Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancies. In March, Health Minister Simon Harris outlined what would be in thegovernment legislation,externalif the people voted to repeal the Eighth Amendment. If passed, women could access a termination within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. However, beyond 12 weeks, abortions would only be permitted where there is a risk to a woman's life or of serious harm to the physical or mental health of a woman, up until the 24th week of pregnancy. Terminations would also be permitted in cases of fatal foetal abnormality.

"Britain's first-ever Dota 2 major tournament wants to ""offer inspiration"" to UK fans, organisers say. The event, being held in Birmingham this weekend, see teams from across the world compete for a $1m (Â£750,000) prize pool. There are only a few top level British players of the game, but tickets for the event sold out in 24 hours. James Dean, from event organiser ESL, says: ""We're hoping the major will offer inspiration to the UK community."" He hopes that seeing the world's best players up close and personal will help drive more UK-based players to compete at the top level. He told Newsbeat: ""If there was a full UK team on the roster, the event would have more of a significant impact and that is an exciting prospect. ""On the international scene there are very few PC teams in e-sports that are British, but that is slowly changing. ""We're finding that UK-based players are getting there, but not a full British team yet."" Gamers compete for a $1m (Â£750,000) prize pool Console-based games like Call of Duty, FIFA and Halo have more British representation at top tier esports events. British team Splyce reached the final of theCall of Duty World League in 2016for example. James says that ESL is working to grow the UK's esports scene for console and PC gamers. Hosting major events like this is a key part of their strategy. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Afghan interpreters worked with the Army on the front line in Helmand Province A scheme aimed at protecting Afghan civilians who worked as interpreters for the Army has not resettled a single person in the UK and has proved an ""utter failure"", MPs have said. The Commons Defence Committee said the Intimidation Scheme had instead gone to lengths to stop relocations. The Ministry of Defence says Britain is the only nation that has a team in Kabul, investigating intimidation. But Col Simon Diggins said interpreters were being attacked in Afghanistan. ""We have credible evidence of individuals being murdered, others have been chased out of their homes,"" the former defence attachÃ© to Kabul told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. About 2,000 former interpreters are ""stuck"" in Afghanistan ""under continual daily threat"", he said. In Afghanistan, ""if you worked for any coalition countries including the British, your neighbours will know"", BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale added. Afghan interpreters' immigration fee waived Army interpreter fears death if deported Afghan interpreters 'should stay in UK' Tory MP and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Tom Tugendhat, who served in Afghanistan, said the government had a ""duty of care"" for locally employed civilians. Mr Tugendhat told the BBC an interpreter he had served alongside ""earned his place in the UK many times over"". ""But there are others and that is why I gave evidence to the committee,"" he added. The cross-party report said the Intimidation Scheme's shortcomings were in contrast to another initiative, known as the Redundancy Scheme, which has seen 1,150 Afghans re-homed in Britain. It called for a more ""sympathetic approach"" to those who risked their lives to support British forces during their 13-year combat mission in Afghanistan, which ended in 2014. Tory MP Julian Lewis, who chairs the defence committee, said if the UK earns a reputation ""for leaving those people who put their lives at risk to help our soldiers, at the mercy of our enemies"",  it would be difficult to find local people prepared to help in future conflicts. Mohammed Hares, an Afghan interpreter for the British Army from 2009 to 2014 Mohammed Hares was relocated to the UK in 2016 and now chairs the Sulha Network - which represents Afghan interpreters When you leave home in the morning, you don't know whether you are going to come back home alive. And that is not just the interpreters themselves, but also the families. They can't tell anybody even nowadays that they were interpreters. If people find out even now, they will just kill them. They will kill their families, they will kill them, they will torture them, they will put the videos on social media as a lesson for everybody else. I think when we were working with the British Army in Afghanistan, we helped them to achieve their aims. We helped them in the worst situations. We saved their lives. Now it is their duty to do their job and to help those people who are still in Afghanistan. The Redundancy Scheme is open to Afghan civilians who had been working in front-line roles for at least 12 months when the UK began to reduce its troop presence in late 2012. The committee noted that despite previous criticism of its criteria, that scheme had been ""generous and proportionate"". While the Intimidation Scheme was ""in theory"" open to all civilians working for the British, the report found that it had focused ""overwhelmingly"" on ways of keeping them in Afghanistan, through internal relocation or the offer of security advice, and that resettlement to the UK was seen as a last resort. The report also criticised the Afghan government, which was involved in creating the schemes, saying its claim that relocation might lead to a ""brain drain"" was ""disingenuous"". ""It is impossible to reconcile the generosity of the Redundancy Scheme with the utter failure of the Intimidation Scheme to relocate even a single locally employed citizen to the United Kingdom,"" it concluded. Campaigners welcomed the report and urged the government to reconsider its approach. ""Many of our brother interpreters found themselves in significant danger after the British campaign in Helmand,"" said a spokesman for the Sulha Network - which represents Afghan interpreters. ""The eligibility criteria for the resettlement scheme was arbitrary and narrow and the intimidation scheme has only served to give false hope to those who fear for their safety."" The Ministry of Defence said it would take note of the criticism. ""Our intimidation policy is designed to ensure that former Afghan local staff are safe to live their lives in the country and we provide tailored security advice and support to individuals,"" a spokesman said. Earlier this month, it was announced that Afghan interpreters who were relocated to Britain wouldnot have to paythe Home Office to stay. More than 150 translators given a five-year visa to seek sanctuary in Britain wrote to new Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson to highlight their concerns. The interpreters who worked on the battlefield in Helmand Province had said they faced deportation if they could not find the Â£2,398 per person to apply for indefinite leave to remain once their visas expired.

"Police have begun a murder investigation A 95-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a female carer died in north London. The victim, 61, was taken to hospital with head injuries at 07:10 BST on 24 May. She died the following day. A murder investigation has been launched by the Metropolitan Police following the incident in Holloway. The man, who is believed to suffer from dementia, was taken to hospital pending a ""transfer to a location where his complex needs can be managed"". Detectives say the woman's next-of-kin have been informed, and they are not looking for anyone else in connection with their investigation. The woman who died was an employee of a care agency commissioned by Islington Council. Two ambulance crews arrived at his first-floor flat in Islington, north London, on Thursday morning after a neighbour heard a scream at around 04:00 BST. Colleagues said they were left ""devastated"" after the woman, 61, died in hospital on Friday morning. Max Wurr, senior spokesman for the woman's employer, said: ""We were devastated that a member of our care team in Islington has died in hospital after paramedics were called to the home of one of our customers overnight.""

Emmanuel Elliott, 81, and partner Hilda Farmer, 79, left itsomewhere near Cheltenham General Hospital on Friday, but could not remember where. It was found on Tuesday in a car park about 900m from the hospital and had been ticketed three times by wardens. Mr Elliott said it was ""marvellous"" to have the vehicle back. Ms Farmer thought she had left it on a street  ""within a mile and half"" of the hospital with ""nice houses on one side"" and ""greenery on the other"". But after it was discovered in St George's Road car park, she said she must have ""dreamt it when I realised I couldn't find the car"". ""It's been quite a five days,"" Mr Elliott added. ""I hope I can remember how to drive."" The car, which had been missing for five days, was ticketed three times by wardens He said Ms Farmer's granddaughter had located the car with help from her social media followers after the story was featured online. Several people contacted the BBC to say they had also seen it. Cheltenham Borough Council said the car had been given a number of tickets ""as any vehicle without a valid ticket would"". A spokesman said they would not immediately cancel the charges but pointed the couple to the authority's appeals process.

"A stag was photographed with rope and buoy tangled in its antlers Images have been released showing red deer stags on a Scottish island with marine pollution tangled in their antlers. Two of the animals on the Isle of Rum died after becoming snarled up together in discarded fishing rope. Another of the deer was photographed with rope and an orange buoy in its antlers. The images have been published by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), which manages Rum National Nature Reserve. The photographs were taken a year ago, but only released now following rising concerns about marine pollution. Scotland signs up to global 'ghost gear' pledge Two of the deer died after becoming snarled up in rope Lesley Watt, reserve manager on Rum for SNH, said: ""Marine litter is a huge international problem. But small actions can make a big difference, and everyone has a part to play. ""Along with many organisations, SNH recently joined the campaign to bin plastic straws; and we're cutting down on disposable plastics by providing our staff with re-useable travel cups. ""If you use your own bag for life when shopping, or take litter home after a day at the beach, you could help save an animal's life."" The island's population of red deer have been the subject of scientific research since the 1950s. Researchers study the animals to better understand their behaviour and the effects of climate change on deer. Marine pollution on Rum Dr Richard Dixon, of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said the photographs of the red deer were a ""strong Scottish symbol of a wasteful attitude"" to the world's resources. He said: ""We are used to some of the images of seabirds and some marine mammals and turtles being affected by plastic waste, but this is very much closer to home. ""These are big mammals being affected by stuff that people have just discarded in the marine environment."" Concerns about the level of pollution in the sea off Scotland, and along its coast are increasingly being raised. This week, a group of volunteers gathered more than 600kgs of rubbish from the shore at Red Point, Gairloch, in Wester Ross. Last summer, scientists said some of the world's deepest living sea creatures had been found to have eaten microscopic pieces of plastic waste. Researchers at the Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS) in Obansampled starfish and snails from the Rockall Trough off the Western Isles. Tiny pieces of plastic were found in 48% of the sample animals that live more than 2,000m (6,561.8ft) down. Gannet chick with plastic in its nest Also last year, researchers saidmost of the seabirds examined for a study into the effects of marine plastic pollution had swallowed plastic. Researchers, including scientists from North Highland College UHI's Environmental Research Institute in Thurso, investigated 34 species. They found 74% of them had ingested plastic. The research involved seabird colonies in northern Europe, Russia, Scandinavia, Greenland, Svalbard, the Faroes and Iceland.

"From the pew to the... speaker? The Church of England is offering worshippers the chance to use voice-activated virtual assistants to pray. People can ask Amazon's Alexa device to reada prayer of the day, the Ten Commandments or the Lord's Prayer or to recite grace before a meal,external. But the smart speakers will also have a ""church near you"" function to encourage people to visit their local church. The move is part of an online campaign by the Church after figures showed fewer people were attending services. The Church of England also hopes to offer the service through Google Play in the future. Church figures for last year showedthe Church was reaching 1.2 million people online every monthbut that those attending Sunday services had dropped by 14% since 2006. The Church of England's new voice-activation feature allows a worshipper to ask their Amazon Alexa to perform more than 30 actions or questions, including: Read today's prayer Find churches in or near a specified town Who is God? What it means to believe in God Read the 10 Commandments The Church of England said it wanted to use all of the technologies available to grow people's faith and had noticed the popularity of the speakers. There are also plans to mark key events in the Christian calendar including Christmas and Easter using the technology. In March the Church announced it was to begin takingcontactless paymentsfor services such as weddings and christenings at more than over 16,000 churches - a move it said should appeal to young people who often did not carry cash.

"The crab has a square-shaped shell and is covered in tiny bristles A colony of exploding ants, a shrimp that's been named after prog rockers Pink Floyd, four types of miniature night frog and a coconut-cracking giant rat - these are just some of the new species discovered in the past year. While all of these exotic creatures were found many thousands of miles away from Britain, such discoveries aren't the preserve of scientists in the remotest part of some far-flung wilderness. In fact, it's estimated there are thousands of species yet to be identified in the UK alone - and many millions globally. The hairy crab that's potentially the latest new-to-science domestic discovery was collected by naturalist and photographer Steve Trewhella on Chesil Beach, near Weymouth, in Dorset. The 2cm-wide creature was found living inside a polystyrene buoy that washed ashore following a storm and is suspected to have travelled across the Atlantic from the Caribbean. Mr Trewhella, who has sent the crab to the Natural History Museum for identification, hopes the tiny crustacean could prove to be his greatest success story. Steve Trewhella keeps many of the live creatures he finds in tanks at home in order to study them ""I was ungraded in every single subject I took at school - I failed miserably,"" says Mr Trewhella, who runs a cleaning business to help fund his passion for nature. ""I was that geeky kid by the pond or with my head in a rock pool."" He's been waiting patiently to discover if his fascination with nature might cause his name to be recorded in posterity. ""They're now looking for samples of DNA from other Caribbean hairy crab species to try and eliminate or compare, but it's a long process,"" Mr Trewhella says. ""It'd be nice to have an elephant named after you but elephants are easy to find and hairy crabs aren't, so the more obscure the better."" In 2016, Mr Trewhella found a springtail that hadn't been recorded in the UK for 34 years Scientists estimatethere are about 8.7 million specieson Earth, yet only a surprisingly small number - 1.2 million - have been formally identified. In the UK, more than 70,000 species of animals, plants, fungi and single-celled organisms have been recorded. Dr Peter Shaw, the UK's official recorder for springtail bugs, says some domestic habitats remain ""remarkably unexplored"". ""There are many microscopic creatures that haven't yet been recorded, not because they're not there but simply because people aren't looking for them,"" he says. ""Humans are more interested in the bigger, more conventionally attractive animals."" This newly discovered worm has provisionally been given the snappy title ""Emits Yellow Muscus A"" British nature lovers who like the idea of making their mark on taxonomy might be missing a trick as, according to the Natural History Museum, ""small, less easy to identify organisms will no doubt turn out to be new species to Britain and even to science"". For example, a new species of beetle is discovered in the UK about once a decade, says Max Barclay, senior curator at the museum. Quedius lyszkowskii LottandMirosternomorphus heali Bercedo & Arnaizwere the last two to be found, in 2010, in Kent and parts of Scotland.

It has since been spotted in Cambridge, Kent and Sussex, but there are no records of it anywhere else in the world, he says. ""Either they must be breeding locally or else emerging from imported plant material or foodstuffs,"" he adds. But he says the lack of records from any other country is ""surprising"" and the fact they were not found prior to 2003 is ""puzzling"". Goose barnacles are among the crustaceans from US waters that Mr Trewhella has found on the Dorset coast This pale grey moth with brown speckles was first discovered in London in 2003 In 2014, Dr Andrew Polaszek published the description of a new species of parasitoid wasp. These delightful creatures lay their eggs on or in other insects, which are then eaten alive by their larvae. The wasp, Encarsia harrisoni,was found in a school playground in suburban Sevenoaks, Kent. It was one of the first new UK species to be confirmed using DNA sequencing technology, Dr Polaszek says. Mirosternomorphus heali Bercedo & Arnaiz (left) and Quedius lyszkowskii Lott are the most recently discovered species of beetle in the UK David Fenwick, who produces photographic wildlife identification guides of marine life, recently unearthed a worm in Penzance, which he provisionally gave the snappy title ""Emits Yellow Muscus A"". It's related toEulalia clavigera- the common green leaf worm - which is found on rocky shores but emits a clear, rather than yellow mucus, he says. He argues we could be discovering many more new-to-science species, but they're not deemed ""commercially important"". ""If a species was important for cod, for example, it might get supported but, sadly, small microscopic, obscure species are largely being left in obscurity."" New plant life is also being identified - this seaweed was collected in Devon last month by National History Museum researcher Prof Juliet Brodie As well as those species that were previously unknown to science, others are new introductions to Britain or haven't been seen for a while, the Natural History Museum's identification team says. Mr Trewhella is a dab hand at finding creatures such as tropical worms, crustaceans and molluscs that have made it to our shores from overseas on plastic - which he describes as an ""artificial conveyor"". ""Some objects can be a real treasure trove. I found six new species to northern Europe on one little polystyrene buoy the size of a football,"" the 54-year-old says. He's also found bugs that haven't been seen in the UK for a long time, including a 2mm springtail he collected on the seaweed-strewn strandline at Chesil Fleet in 2016 that hadn't been recorded in the UK for 34 years. Goggles with microscope lenses are ""a must"" when bug hunting Mr Trewhella keeps many of the creatures he finds in tanks at home so he can study them - luckily for him his wife is a marine biologist. It's particularly important that we learn more about species coming to the UK from abroad, Mr Trewhella believes. ""It's speculative at the moment but as our seas potentially warm due to climate change, then there's a possibility that these animals could break the barrier of being able to survive in our waters, which would potentially be catastrophic. ""Invasive species always have a detrimental effect, no matter what size they are. ""Just look at the effect grey squirrels have had on our reds and the introduction of the rhododendron that has strangled our native trees and plants."" Encarsia harrisoni larvae inside a whitefly (above) and an emerged adult He says his main aim is ""to inspire others to get out and engage with the natural world"". ""We are in danger of assuming we know everything and have found all the animals that occupy the planet, but of course this is not the case. ""New species are found quite often and genetic work is rewriting many classifications of ones we are familiar with,"" he says. ""It doesn't have to be new or rare, it's just about understanding why things are there, the role they play and what would happen if they did not exist. ""Once you sit back and just observe, it all starts to make sense.""
