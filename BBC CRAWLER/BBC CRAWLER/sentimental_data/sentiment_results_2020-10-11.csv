"Liverpool won the Premier League for the first time last season Radical proposals for the reform of English football could have a ""damaging impact"" on the game, says the Premier League. Under the proposals, led by Liverpool and Manchester United, the English top flight would be cut to 18 teams. The plans would see thePremier League hand over the Â£250m bailoutrequired by the Football League to stave off a financial disaster among its 72 clubs. The Premier League would also hand over 25% of its annual income to the EFL. EFL chief Parry: 'Reforms will benefit game as a whole' The proposals, dubbed Project Big Picture, would see: The Premier League cut from 20 to 18 clubs, with the Championship, League One and League Two each retaining 24 teams. The bottom two teams in the Premier League relegated automatically with the 16th-placed team joining the Championship play-offs. The League Cup and Community Shield abolished. Parachute payments scrapped. A Â£250m rescue fund made immediately available to the EFL Â£100m paid to the FA to make up for lost revenue. Nine clubs given 'special voting rights' on certain issues, based on their extended runs in the Premier League. But the plans have been criticised by the Premier League, the government and supporters' groups. ""English football is the world's most watched, and has a vibrant, dynamic and competitive league structure that drives interest around the globe,"" a Premier League statement said. ""To maintain this position, it is important that we all work together. Both the Premier League and the FA support a wide-ranging discussion on the future of the game, including its competition structures, calendar and overall financing particularly in light of the effects of Covid-19. ""Football has many stakeholders, therefore this work should be carried out through the proper channels enabling all clubs and stakeholders the opportunity to contribute."" Under the proposals, the EFL Cup in its present form would be abolished and the Community Shield scrapped. In addition, the top flight's 14-club majority voting system would change. The Premier League statement added: ""In the Premier League's view, a number of the individual proposals in the plan published today could have a damaging impact on the whole game and we are disappointed to see that Rick Parry, chair of the EFL, has given his on-the-record support. ""The Premier League has been working in good faith with its clubs and the EFL to seek a resolution to the requirement for Covid-19 rescue funding. This work will continue."" The Department for Culture, Media and Sport condemned what it called a ""backroom deal"". ""We are surprised and disappointed that at a time of crisis when we have urged the top tiers of professional football to come together and finalise a deal to help lower league clubs, there appear to be backroom deals being cooked up that would create a closed shop at the very top of the game,"" a DCMS spokesperson said. ""Sustainability, integrity and fair competition are absolutely paramount and anything that may undermine them is deeply troubling. Fans must be front of all our minds, and this shows why our fan led review of football governance will be so critical."" BBC sports editor Dan Roan This is a hugely divisive and potentially seismic proposal, threatening the biggest shake-up of the English game in a generation. Angered by the way the story broke without their blessing, the Premier League has already given it short shrift, viewing this as a regrettable power-grab. In fact one well-placed Premier League source has described it as a ""takeover attempt, rather than a rescue package"". Many will see this as an anti-competitive plot to concentrate power in the hands of the biggest clubs, opening the door to them controlling broadcast contracts, financial rules and even takeovers bids in a way top-flight bosses have always been desperate to avoid - a step towards a European Super League, and a means of freeing up space in the calendar to play more lucrative pre-season friendlies. For years the bigger clubs have wanted more money and more sway. This is the most dramatic manifestation of that to date. But will it get off the ground? There will be huge doubts given 14 clubs would need to approve a plan that would mean fewer Premier League places. But the involvement of the two biggest clubs in the country means this surprising development has to be taken seriously. At a time when the EFL is facing an unprecedented financial crisis however, it is easy to see why they would support a plan that would hand them the Â£250m they need to cover the loss of match-day revenue this season. And many in football will welcome the idea of a more redistributive financial model, with 25% of Premier League income shared at a time when the gulf between the divisions has been identified as a major problem. Indeed, if the threat of this plan helps break the impasse between the Premier League and the government over a rescue package for the EFL, and a more redistributive financial 'reset', perhaps it can emerge as a positive development. The English Football League confirmed it had been in talks over 'Project Big Picture' and that its chairman Rick Parry was in favour of the plans,first reported in the Daily Telegraph.,external ""The need for a complete rethinking regarding the funding of English professional football predates the Covid-19 crisis,"" he said in a statement. ""Discussion and planning around 'Project Big Picture' has been ongoing for quite some time, unrelated to the current pandemic but now has an urgency that simply cannot be denied. ""The revenues flowing from the investment and work of our top clubs has been largely limited to the top division creating a sort of lottery, while Championship clubs struggle to behave prudently and Leagues One and Two are financially stretched despite enormous revenues English football generates. ""This plan devised by our top clubs and the English Football League puts an end to all of that."" Parry says, in 2018-19, Championship clubs received Â£146m in EFL distributions and Premier League solidarity payments, compared with Â£1.56bn received by the bottom 14 Premier League clubs. He added parachute payments made to eight recently relegated clubs totalled Â£246m and represented one-third of the total Championship turnover. Parry said it created ""a major distortion that impacts the league annually"". ""The gap between the Premier League and the English Football League has become a chasm which has become unbridgeable for clubs transitioning between the EFL and Premier League,"" he said. Manchester United are among the clubs driving the change It is understood Liverpool's owners, the Fenway Sports Group, came forward with the initial plan, which has been worked on by United co-chairman Joel Glazer. It is anticipated it will receive the backing of Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur - the other members of England's 'big six'. The idea is to address longstanding EFL concerns about the huge gap in funding between its divisions and the Premier League by handing over 25% of the annual income, although the current parachute payment system would be scrapped. There would be a Â£250m up-front payment to address the existing crisis created by the coronavirus pandemic, seen by some as a bid to garner support for the proposals. In addition, the Football Association would receive what is being described as a Â£100m ""gift"". The Football Supporters' Association said it noted ""with grave concern"" the proposals, adding they had ""far-reaching consequences for the whole of domestic football"". ""Once again it appears that big decisions in football are apparently being stitched up behind our backs by billionaire club owners who continue to treat football as their personal fiefdom,"" it said in a statement. ""Football is far more than a business to be carved up; it is part of our communities and our heritage, and football fans are its lifeblood. As football's most important stakeholders, it is crucial that fans are consulted and involved in the game's decision-making. ""We have welcomed the government's commitment to a 'fan-led review of the governance of football'; we would argue that today's revelations have made that process even more relevant and urgent."" The organisation said it remained ""open-minded to any suggestions for the improvement of the governance and organisation of the game"". It added: ""We would however emphasise that in our discussions so far, very few of our members have ever expressed the view that what football really needs is a greater concentration of power in the hands of the big six billionaire-owned clubs."" No date has been set for the proposed new-style league to be in operation but sources have suggested 2022-23 is not out of the question. In order to get down from 20 to 18, it is anticipated four clubs would be relegated directly, with two promoted from the Championship. In addition, there would be play-offs involving the team to finish 16th in the Premier League and those in third, fourth and fifth in the second tier. It is also planned that, as well as the 'big six', ever-present league member Everton, West Ham United and Southampton - ninth and 11th respectively in the list of clubs who have featured in the most Premier League seasons - would be granted special status. If six of those nine clubs vote in favour of a proposal, it would be enough to get it passed. There is no mention of Aston Villa and Newcastle United, both of whom have featured in more Premier League campaigns than Manchester City.

"This video can not be played Alistair Wilson murder: âMy only memory of my dad was when he was shotâ The son of bank worker Alistair Wilson, who was shot dead on the doorstep of his home in 2004, has appealed for help in catching his father's killer. Andrew Wilson was aged just four at the time of the murder in Nairn in the Highlands. He said the only memory he has left of his father is seeing him lying on the ground moments after being shot. It is the first time Mr Wilson has spoken publicly about the murder and how it has devastated his family. He said: ""I still cannot believe how someone could shoot my dad dead on our doorstep while my brother and I were upstairs. ""Photographs are all I have and no family should suffer the way we have all these years. ""I am appealing on behalf of my family to anyone who may have any information, no matter how big or small, toplease come forward,external. Someone out there could have the missing piece of information."" The doorstep murder of Alistair Wilson Alistair Wilson, 30, was shot at his home at about 19:00 on 28 November 2004. He later died in hospital. Mr Wilson's wife Veronica had answered the door to his killer - a stocky man wearing a baseball cap - who asked for Alistair Wilson. Mr Wilson spoke to the man and was handed an empty blue envelope with the word Paul written on it. He was then shot with a German-made handgun. A massive police inquiry was launched at the time, but no-one has been apprehended and detectives continue to investigate the case. A young Andrew Wilson with his father Alistair, mother Veronica and younger brother Andrew, now 20, recalled the moment he saw his father lying on the doorstep. He said: ""Someone came to our family home on a Sunday evening while my dad was reading my brother and me bedtime stories after our bath. ""The next thing I know I am looking at my dad lying in our doorway covered in blood."" Mr Wilson's family, along with detectives, are using the approaching 16th anniversary to make a renewed appeal for information in the hope of finally bringing someone to justice. Andrew says all he has left of his father are photographs Andrew Wilson and his brother at his father's graveside Andrew Wilson added: ""I was four years old when this happened and my dad was only 30. ""There would be no more bedtime stories, no more playing football or helping him in the garden. ""My dad and I missed out on so many things together, showing me how to tie a tie, driving lessons and taking me for my first pint. ""I am now a 20-year-old with little answers regarding my dad's death. For the last 16 years I have been left wondering why I didn't have a dad like all my friends. ""Nothing can bring my dad back, but knowing who did this and why could give us the closure we need. Any information could be crucial to our case."" This video can not be played Alistair Wilson's widow: 'A who and a why would let us move on' Det Insp Gary Winter, of the Major Investigation Team, has outlined the specific areas being focused on in the latest appeal. He said: ""The murderer was described in 2004 as a man aged 30-40 years old, stocky build and approximately 5ft 4in to 5ft 7in tall. ""Alistair's killer would now be approaching his 50s or 60s and has enjoyed a life denied to his victim and his family. ""The handgun used was a Haenel Suhl pocket pistol from the 1930s, which has distinctive H and S letters superimposed on the grip. ""We believe this weapon is likely to have been taken to the UK after World War Two as some form of souvenir, however the ammunition used in the murder is from the 1980s or 90s. ""Do you know of anyone who had a similar pocket pistol?  Do you know of anyone who mentioned having firearm souvenirs from the World War Two or from any family who were World War Two veterans?"" This is a murder which people, not just in the Highlands but across the world, are determined will be solved. All murders are shocking but this was so beyond the imagination that it has had people bewildered and frustrated for 16 years, including the police. Three years ago I interviewed Veronica Wilson, Alistair Wilson's husband. It was the first time she had been interviewed for a dozen years and it formed the spine of The Doorstep Murder podcast series. She revealed then that her older son, aged just four at the time, saw her father's body on the doorstep. It was hoped then that her pleas for new information would help find the killer. It generated many calls to both the BBC and Police Scotland but the murder remained unsolved. The fact that Alistair Wilson had been reading his young sons a bedtime story moments before he was shot so brutally has generated enormous sympathy and anger that his two boys have grown up without their father. So to hear from Andrew Wilson will reunite people with the details of the murder and, it's hoped, persuade someone with information to step forward after all these years. Listen toThe Doorstep Murder podcast on BBC Sounds. The doorstep murder shocked the residents of Nairn Police believe the murder weapon may have been brought to the UK after World War Two Det Insp Winter also highlighted the envelope given to Mr Wilson before the shooting - and the possibility that the murder was a case of mistaken identity. He said: ""The blue envelope handed to Alistair by the killer had the name Paul on it, which may or may not be relevant. Does this mean anything to you in the context of this investigation? ""Lastly, do you know any other person by the name Alistair Wilson, who may have been the intended target of violence or retribution to any extent?"" Mr Winter said the force remained committed to ensuring the person responsible for the murder was brought to justice. He added: ""Someone out there knows what happened to Alistair and I hope this appeal serves as a vital reminder that it is never too late to come forward with information. Do not assume that the police already know the information you possess.""

"The UK economy may have grown by as much as 17% in the three months to the end of September, says the EY Item Club, but slower growth may follow. Shoppers splurged during the period as coronavirus lockdown restrictions were lifted, it said. It is a rosier vision than the one offered by Item Club economists in the summer, but they warned that growth for the rest of 2020 would be far slower. Growth for the final three months will be 1% or less, they predicted. ""The UK economy has done well to recover faster than expected so far,"" said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. ""Consumer spending has bounced back strongly, while housing sector activity has also seen a pick-up, in part thanks to the stamp duty holiday."" The economy probably grew 16-17% in the third quarter of the year compared with the second quarter, it said. It had been expecting growth of 12%. While government help such as the furlough programme has provided ""much-needed support"", growth will now begin to fade, said Mr Archer. The end of the furlough scheme, under which workers had part of their salary paid by the government, will mean higher unemployment and sluggish growth, said the forecasters, who use a similar economic model to the Treasury. That said, the UK economy is now predicted to regain its pre-pandemic size in the second half of 2023. Back in July, the EY Item Club did not expect that to happen until late 2024. Official figures from the Office for National Statistics showed last week that The UK economy continued its recovery in August, growing by 2.1% in the month, as the Eat Out to Help Out scheme boosted restaurants. It was, however, smaller than economists had estimated and helped drag down the estimated pace of recovery for the year. As with any economic forecast, there are factors which could speed up or slow down the recovery, the economists said. A vaccine is likely to help the economy, but there are more likely threats to growth than there are surprise boosts. Factors that could weigh down growth include a drop in consumer spending, more lockdown measures, slow Brexit negotiations between the UK and the EU and a spike in unemployment. ""The latest forecast also notes that, even if further virus outbreaks are contained and major restrictions on economic activity are avoided, consumers and businesses could remain cautious in their behaviour for an extended period,"" the report said. The Club's estimates assume a simple free trade agreement with the EU by the end of the year. Without an agreement, growth of 4.8% is forecast in 2021, down from 6%, while growth in 2022 would be cut to 2.6% from 2.9%.

"Bryanboy (right) said he found being in the restaurant with the posters (left) awkward As coronavirus has spread around the world, people of Asian heritage have reported facing greater hostility. But fashion influencer Bryanboy said he was shocked to find ""racist"" images on the walls of a Stockholm restaurant. ""It wasn't until we placed our order that we noticed all the huge posters on the wall â an illustrated portrait of a very yellow Xi Jinping with bat ears and the term 'BAT MAN',"" he said. The restaurant has since removed the posters. Restaurant Riche, in the Swedish capital, said many people had found the exhibition ""disturbing and racist,external, which was of course not the intention"", adding that it ""sincerely apologise[s] to anyone that was offended"". The artist behind the poster, who publishes work under the name Iron Art Works, said they apologised for any offence caused, but not for the image itself. ""I would not have done it in the first place If I did not stand behind it. I still do,"" they told the BBC via email. ""I don't want to hurt people of course, that is not my intention at all."" How a virus reveals the many ways China is feared British Chinese people reveal prejudice amid outbreak Coronavirus: What attacks on Asians reveal Bryanboy, whose real name is Bryan Yambao, was dining at the restaurant in the Swedish capital with a friend from Hong Kong on Saturday.He wrote on Instagram that he was ""mortified"",externalwhen he saw the posters. ""Ever since Covid happened, me and pretty much a lot of the Asian people I know have gone through so much racist and xenophobic abuse on the internet,"" Mr Yambao, who is Filipino, told the BBC. ""So to see it in real life was kind of surreal."" He added that he had already ordered food but ""couldn't wait to get out of the restaurant"". The artwork features the Chinese president as ""Bat Man"" - in an apparent reference to the theory that the coronavirus may have originated in bats - in front of a Japanese-style rising sun. It was installed in the restaurant several weeks ago. The first cases of coronavirus were recorded in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, but the virus has since spread around the world. The pandemic has led to a wave of racism, xenophobia and even violence directed towards people of Chinese ethnicity, as well as people of East Asian appearance. In one case in London,a student from Singapore was beaten by a group of menwho allegedly said: ""I don't want your coronavirus in my country."" ""Almost every day I get comments, just because I'm Asian, linking me with Covid,"" said Mr Yambao. ""And it's not just online - these images have real-life repercussions, because they create a hostile environment for Asians and it normalises racism and xenophobia against them."" The artist said on Instagram that their work was not intended to be racist, and their previous art included satirical depictions of a number of world leaders. ""My intention was only to make a fool of Xi [Jinping]/CCP [Chinese Communist Party] NOT to make a racist comment that hurt a lot of people, but I accidentally did, and I again apologise to you who feel that way,"" they wrote in an Instagram post.

In comments to the BBC, the artist said the incident was a ""schoolbook example"" of cancel culture, and argued that there had been no complaints of racism about the art - which they said had been displayed in parts of Stockholm for several months and in Restaurant Riche for a month - until this weekend. They added that they thought cancel culture was ""a greater danger to society than any artwork"". But Mr Yambao said the artist's response was a ""non-apology"". ""It comes from a place of ignorance - that he wasn't expecting it to be racist or considered racistâ¦ I'm all for freedom of expression by artists, but I just wish that he knew what the repercussions of his work are."" ""In these crazy times, when millions of people are affected by this disease and hundreds of thousands of people have already died, and the world is already in such a bad state, do we really need to create divisive artwork out there, that could be misconstrued by anyone?"" Mr Yambao asked. The World Health Organization has warned against attaching locations or ethnicities to the pandemic. ""This is not a 'Wuhan Virus', 'Chinese Virus' or 'Asian Virus',"" the body said in guidance issued earlier this year, adding that the ""official name for the disease was deliberately chosen to avoid stigmatisation"".

"Protests have convulsed Belarus every weekend since the disputed presidential election in August Belarusian riot police have used water cannon and stun grenades to break up the latest mass protests against President Alexander Lukashenko. Protests have swept the eastern European country since Mr Lukashenko claimed victory in an August election widely viewed as rigged. Dozens of protesters were detained during the latest rallies on Sunday. In the capital Minsk, police blasted protesters with coloured water to mark them out for arrest. Critics of Mr Lukashenko said Sunday saw police use some of the most brutal tactics against protesters since the immediate aftermath of August's disputed presidential election. Many opposition activists have been beaten up by police and thousands have been arrested during months of unrest. They are demanding the release of all political prisoners and a free and fair re-run of the election. Europe's longest-serving ruler under fire What's happening in Belarus? EU rejects Belarus leader's inauguration The EU, the UK and the US have refused to recognise Mr Lukashenko's new term. Mr Lukashenko denies fixing the poll and has received support from Russia, his country's closest ally. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya emerged as the main opposition leader after standing against Mr Lukashenko in August's election, arguing she would have won had it not been rigged. Ms Tikhanovskaya was forced to go into exile in Lithuania after receiving threats following the disputed vote. She has repeatedly appealed to the international community to put pressure on Mr Lukashenko so that a democratic transition can be launched by negotiation. Opposition protesters clashed with masked riot police in Minsk at the latest rally on Sunday Opposition hopes of a peaceful resolution were raised on Saturday after Mr Lukashenko held an unexpected meeting with political opponents in the jail where they are currently detained. State media reported that the president called the meeting to discuss constitutional reform with his imprisoned opponents. In now-familiar scenes, thousands of pro-opposition protesters gathered in Minsk and other major cities for the ninth successive Sunday of demonstrations against Mr Lukashenko. Wearing coats and carrying umbrellas on a rainy afternoon, protesters called for the resignation of 66-year-old Mr Lukashenko, Belarus's leader since 1994. Footage shows the security forces, dressed in black and armed with batons, rounding up peaceful protestors congregating in Minsk city centre and taking them to waiting vehicles.Â Several thousand people were reported to have attended Sunday's march in Minsk Police used stun grenades and water cannon against demonstrators in Minsk, a spokeswoman for Belarus's interior ministry told AFP news agency. They sprayed plain and coloured water at demonstrators, covering them in what appeared to be orange dye. Some defiant protesters remained unmoved, using their umbrellas to shield themselves from the blast. Police deployed water-cannon trucks in Minsk, spraying protesters with brightly coloured dye A local news website described police using tear gas on crowds and said police were herding people into courtyards.Â In videos posted online, police can be seen beating protesters with batons and snatching their white-and-red flags - a symbol of nationalist opposition to Mr Lukashenko. Some protesters fought back and pelted police with bottles and other objects. This video can not be played Mass arrests as crowds chant 'go away' to Belarus president The Viasna rights group, which monitors detentions at political protests, said at least 140 people had been detained in Minsk and other cities. Journalists covering the demonstrations were among those detained, including those from Russia's Tass agency and the state Belarusian news agency BELTA. Jonah Fisher, BBC Ukraine correspondent Sunday's demonstrations in Belarus's capital Minsk now follow a familiar course. Tens of thousands of people march through the streets demanding President Lukashenko step down. Then, he responds by sending his security forces to arrest as many of them as possible. What makes this weekend different, however, is that on Saturday President Lukashenko held a long meeting with a group of political prisoners in jail. It's the first indication - after more than two months of protests - that he just might be willing to negotiate with the opposition. The president's press office said participants had agreed to keep the four-and-a-half-hour conversation ""secret"". However, a photo posted by the press service shows Mr Lukashenko sitting at a table with 11 political figures, all of whom look pale and unsmiling. Among them is Viktor Babaryko, a banker who was initially seen as Mr Lukashenko's strongest rival in the election, but was barred from running and jailed in July. Liliya Vlasova, a lawyer and member of the opposition's Coordination Council, is also in the photo, as is Vitali Shkliarov, a Belarusian-American strategist who worked on US Senator Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign. A photo of the meeting was shared by Mr Lukashenko's office A short video clip shared by the press service also shows Mr Lukashenko saying to the group: ""I am trying to convince not only your supporters but the whole of society that we need to look at things more broadly."" Apparently referring to the ongoing protests, he added: ""You can't rewrite the constitution on the streets."" Opposition figures suggested meeting was a sign of Mr Lukashenko's weakness, perhaps signalling a newfound eagerness to compromise with the protest movement. But in a social media post, Ms Tikhanovskaya said ""you can't have dialogue in a prison cell"".

"Liverpool is expected to be placed under the most severe set of restrictions in a new, three-tier system Another national coronavirus lockdown is a possibility and we have to do what we can to avoid that at all costs, a leading UK scientist has said. Prof Peter Horby said the UK was at a ""precarious point"" as Covid cases and hospital admissions continue to rise. His comments echo those of England's deputy chief medical officer, who said more deaths would follow and urged people to limit social contact. Ministers say their local approach to restrictions is the right way forward. The prime minister is expected to announce tougher local restrictions on Monday. In a statement to MPs, Boris Johnson will outline plans for a three-tier system, where each region in England is placed into a tier based on the severity of cases in the area. He has spent Sunday afternoon updating cabinet ministers on the next steps. The plans have already sparked opposition, with Labour MPs in Greater Manchester telling Mr Johnsonthey would not support being placed under the harshest level of restrictions. Across the UK, the R number - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus on to - is now estimated to be between 1.2 and 1.5.Anything above 1.0 means cases are increasing. On Sunday, 12,872 people in the UK were reported to have tested positive for coronavirus - some 2,294 fewer than on Saturday - according to the latest figures on thegovernment's dashboard,external. There were a further 65 deaths - down from 81 on Saturday. What are the Covid restrictions where I live? PM to detail stricter Covid restrictions on Monday Concern mounts at Covid shutdown 'ripple effect' Prof Horby, chair of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) and a government adviser, said the ""critical mission"" now was to protect the NHS to avoid non-essential hospital services being cancelled, as many were when the UK went into its first nationwide lockdown in March. ""We really need to provide care to everybody - those with Covid and those without,"" he said. ""The way to do that is to keep the numbers down."" He warned that some hospitals in the north of England were already coming under pressure and it might not be long before intensive care beds fill up. ""I am afraid we are going to have to make some very difficult choices and act very quickly,"" he added. Prof Horby said a surge in cases in the North was partly because people were coming into contact with more people than in other parts of the country. He also told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that in the months before the increase in cases, numbers had not dropped to as low a level in the North as in other parts of England. Prof Horby said the country must accept more stringent measures to drive down transmission of the virus. This video can not be played Videos on social media showed Saturday night street scenes in some cities, including an impromptu game of cricket In an earlier statement, England's deputy chief medical officerProf Jonathan Van-Tam said the UK has reached a ""tipping point"" in its epidemic, similar to that last seen in March. The seasons were ""against us"" and the country was running into a ""headwind"" ahead of the winter months, he warned. It is expected that parts of the north of England and the Midlands will be placed under tougher measures as part of the prime minister's announcement. Liverpool, where there are currently 600 cases per 100,000 people, is expected to be placed under the most severe set of restrictions, with all the city's pubs forced to close. Pubs and restaurants across the central belt of Scotlandclosed their doors for at least two weekson Friday, to try to tackle a rise in cases. There is growing concern about the pressure on hospitals. But just how busy are they? There are more than 600 new admissions for Covid each day in the UK with close to 4,000 patients in hospital. That means about 3% of beds are occupied by Covid patients overall. At the peak, the numbers topped 20,000. That may not seem too worrying, but the national picture masks the real pinch being felt in particular areas. Hospitals in north-west England are caring for more than a quarter of those patients, including 132 in intensive care. On current trajectories they could hit the numbers seen during the spring peak within three weeks. But what none of this tells us is what free capacity the NHS actually has, because neither the government nor the NHS is publishing this on a regular basis. There were 30,000 beds free in the middle of summer - three times more than is normally the case, due to the slowdown in non-Covid care. More detail about the current situation would allow us to properly judge the comments being made by ministers and their advisers. Political leaders in the north of England fear harsher measures in their regions could damage local economies and leave some people struggling to survive. They say Chancellor Rishi Sunak's announcement -to pay two-thirds of workers' wages for UK firms forced to close by law by coronavirus restrictions- is ""insufficient"". David Greenhalgh, Conservative leader of Bolton Council, said: ""The North feels like they are being treated differently. ""We know our rates are high, we are not underestimating that, but we cannot throw our local economy to the wall. I urge government to respect that."" Five Labour MPs in Greater Manchester have written to the prime minister, arguing pre-emptively against being placed in tier three, which will have the harshest restrictions. They said in their constituencies, the virus was spreading among students and in private homes, and less so in the hospitality sector. Closing all restaurants and pubs would therefore not have a ""sizeable effect"" on transmission rates yet would devastate businesses and livelihoods, they added. This video can not be played Lisa Nandy: ""It's very clear that we do need further restrictions"" Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy, who is MP for Wigan, agreed further restrictions were needed in many areas, but accused the government of treating people with contempt. ""I haven't felt anger like this since I was growing up in the 1980s. People feel that they haven't just been abandoned, they now feel that the government is actively working against us."" She said Labour would try to force a House of Commons vote on Mr Sunak's plans ""so there is an opportunity to put forward an alternative support package"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said the chancellor's proposals provided a ""fair safety net"" for people, but he accepted there were ""hard choices"" to be made. ""We can't do everything, there is a limit to what the state can do here but we are trying to support these communities,"" he added. Responding to a question about anger in the North, Mr Jenrick told Andrew Marr the new measures would apply to the whole of the UK - and ministers would never bring in a change ""that penalises one part of the country over another"". The huge variation in case numbers across the country meant a localised approach was right, he said, adding: ""None of us want to see a return to blanket national measures.""

"Crowds gathered in Liverpool on Monday to watch filming for a new Batman film in the city Boris Johnson is due to announce a new ""three-tier"" Covid system for England. The PM will address Parliament at 15:30 BST, setting out different rules for regions classified as being on ""medium"", ""high"" or ""very high"" alert. The Liverpool City Region - home to 1.5 million - is expected to face the tightest restrictions with pubs and gyms closed, and further rules on households mixing indoors. Newcastle council's leader has said the North East could avoid tighter rules. Mr Johnson will address MPs before holding a Downing Street news conference. Other areas awaiting news of further restrictions include Greater Manchester, Nottingham and Leeds. Liverpool recorded 600Â cases per 100,000 people inthe week ending 6 October. The average for England was 74. The Liverpool City Region includes the local authority districts of Halton, Knowsley, Sefton, St Helens and Wirral, as well as Liverpool. Local MPs were told during a call with Health Secretary Matt Hancock all bars, pubs, gyms and betting shops will be closed while restaurants will remain open for the moment. What are the Covid restrictions where I live? Live updates: PM to address MPs on new three-tier system Concern mounts at Covid shutdown 'ripple effect' Legal restrictions will also be placed on indoor household mixing and there will be guidance on travel restrictions. The new curbs are to be reviewed after a month. Mr Johnson chaired a meeting of the emergency Cobra committee ""to determine the final interventions"" on Wednesday morning. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said experts told Cobra even tier three restrictions would be unlikely to bring the UK's R number - the rate at which an infected person passes on the virus - below 1. The PM will announce changes in Parliament, before speaking at a Downing Street news conference at 19:00. He is expected to be joined at No 10 by Chancellor Rishi Sunak and England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty. This video can not be played Videos on social media showed Saturday night street scenes in some cities, including an impromptu game of cricket During a data briefing earlier, NHS England medical director Stephen Powis saidmore people were now in hospital with Covid than before restrictions were introduced in March. He confirmed Nightingale hospitals in Manchester, Sunderland and Harrogatewere being prepared to take patients. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, said infection rates had never dropped as low in the northern England as in the South but warned ""things are heating up"" across the country. Tougher measures were introducedin Scotland on Friday, including the closure of pubs and restaurants across the central belt, while the Welsh government has said the next few days could determineif ""national measures"" are implemented. Under the new system for England, tier three is expected to involve the tightest restrictions. We know the broad outline of what the government is going to announce today. Ministers have been working on a tier system for local restrictions in England for weeks - and today they'll confirm how it will work and the basic principles. The Liverpool region is set to be the first put into the ""very high"" top tier - which will mean significant restrictions on hospitality within days. But there are still details of a support package being worked out. The metro mayor in Liverpool Steve Rotheram is adamant there needs to be more support for workers and businesses that will be told to close. He doesn't think the chancellor's current plans go far enough - and I'm told conversations on economic support are likely to continue into this afternoon. There have been questions about definitions - when is a pub a pub, which could be told to close, rather than restaurant which might not? It's worth highlighting that if other areas are added to the highest tier in the next few weeks, restrictions may look different. Sources say there is room for flexibility based on local factors. Liverpool City Region mayor Steve Rotheram said he wanted ""some surety from national government that if we hit some milestones we can come out of tier three very quickly"". He said the government had been clear the Liverpool City Region would be placed in the highest category, with ""no ifs, no buts"", and he added it had already been agreed there would be more local control over the tracing of close contacts and enforcement of restrictions. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the government was ""not panicking"" but taking ""reasonable and proportionate measures"", adding that ""we know there are challenges around hospitality"". Calum Semple, professor of outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool and advisor to the government, said: ""Most of the outbreaks are happening within and between households and then after that, it's in the retail and hospitality sector. ""So, the major issue here is to focus on the cities and areas with the largest outbreaks and sadly my home city of Liverpool is being hammered at the moment. These restrictions are necessary."" The problem with introducing the sort of restrictions that are being suggested to control the spread of the virus is that no-one is really sure whether they will really work. Firstly, while the government's advisers can track patterns in where infected individuals have been prior to being diagnosed, they cannot prove that they were actually infected in those places. Secondly, there will be unintended consequences. Close pubs and you may make the situation worse by driving people to mix more in private homes which are less ""Covid-secure"". It is a point that has been made in recent days by Manchester City Council leader Sir Richard Leese as well as others as ministers weigh up their options. Then there is the economic, social and emotional toll of closing down parts of a community. These are decisions that will divide opinion and, what is more, it will be nigh on impossible to judge exactly what impact they will have had on the virus. Oldham West and Royton MP Jim McMahon said Greater Manchester would be placed in tier two - ""with household restrictions on meeting indoors in any setting, but not outdoors"" - and pubs that serve food staying open. It came after Sacha Lord, Greater Manchester's night-time economy adviser,started legal proceedingsto challenge any restrictions on hospitality and entertainment venues in the North of England. SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? People in17 parts of Wales now face local lockdown rules- and cannot leave these areas without a good reason, such as going to work. Wales' health minister Vaughan Gething said he was disappointed that the prime minister was not issuing guidance on whether people should travel out of highly infected areas. Ministers andhealth officials in Northern Ireland spent Sunday discussingwhat to do about the rapidly increasing rates of the virus. One MP said he believed lockdowns would be examined by the Northern Ireland Executive on Monday. On Sunday, 12,872 people in the UK were reported to have tested positive for coronavirus - some 2,294 fewer than on Saturday. There were a further 65 deaths - down from 81 on Saturday.

"Liverpool won the Premier League for the first time last season Radical proposals for the reform of English football could have a ""damaging impact"" on the game, says the Premier League. Under the proposals, led by Liverpool and Manchester United, the English top flight would be cut to 18 teams. The plans would see thePremier League hand over the Â£250m bailoutrequired by the Football League to stave off a financial disaster among its 72 clubs. The Premier League would also hand over 25% of its annual income to the EFL. EFL chief Parry: 'Reforms will benefit game as a whole' The proposals, dubbed Project Big Picture, would see: The Premier League cut from 20 to 18 clubs, with the Championship, League One and League Two each retaining 24 teams. The bottom two teams in the Premier League relegated automatically with the 16th-placed team joining the Championship play-offs. The League Cup and Community Shield abolished. Parachute payments scrapped. A Â£250m rescue fund made immediately available to the EFL Â£100m paid to the FA to make up for lost revenue. Nine clubs given 'special voting rights' on certain issues, based on their extended runs in the Premier League. But the plans have been criticised by the Premier League, the government and supporters' groups. ""English football is the world's most watched, and has a vibrant, dynamic and competitive league structure that drives interest around the globe,"" a Premier League statement said. ""To maintain this position, it is important that we all work together. Both the Premier League and the FA support a wide-ranging discussion on the future of the game, including its competition structures, calendar and overall financing particularly in light of the effects of Covid-19. ""Football has many stakeholders, therefore this work should be carried out through the proper channels enabling all clubs and stakeholders the opportunity to contribute."" Under the proposals, the EFL Cup in its present form would be abolished and the Community Shield scrapped. In addition, the top flight's 14-club majority voting system would change. The Premier League statement added: ""In the Premier League's view, a number of the individual proposals in the plan published today could have a damaging impact on the whole game and we are disappointed to see that Rick Parry, chair of the EFL, has given his on-the-record support. ""The Premier League has been working in good faith with its clubs and the EFL to seek a resolution to the requirement for Covid-19 rescue funding. This work will continue."" The Department for Culture, Media and Sport condemned what it called a ""backroom deal"". ""We are surprised and disappointed that at a time of crisis when we have urged the top tiers of professional football to come together and finalise a deal to help lower league clubs, there appear to be backroom deals being cooked up that would create a closed shop at the very top of the game,"" a DCMS spokesperson said. ""Sustainability, integrity and fair competition are absolutely paramount and anything that may undermine them is deeply troubling. Fans must be front of all our minds, and this shows why our fan led review of football governance will be so critical."" BBC sports editor Dan Roan This is a hugely divisive and potentially seismic proposal, threatening the biggest shake-up of the English game in a generation. Angered by the way the story broke without their blessing, the Premier League has already given it short shrift, viewing this as a regrettable power-grab. In fact one well-placed Premier League source has described it as a ""takeover attempt, rather than a rescue package"". Many will see this as an anti-competitive plot to concentrate power in the hands of the biggest clubs, opening the door to them controlling broadcast contracts, financial rules and even takeovers bids in a way top-flight bosses have always been desperate to avoid - a step towards a European Super League, and a means of freeing up space in the calendar to play more lucrative pre-season friendlies. For years the bigger clubs have wanted more money and more sway. This is the most dramatic manifestation of that to date. But will it get off the ground? There will be huge doubts given 14 clubs would need to approve a plan that would mean fewer Premier League places. But the involvement of the two biggest clubs in the country means this surprising development has to be taken seriously. At a time when the EFL is facing an unprecedented financial crisis however, it is easy to see why they would support a plan that would hand them the Â£250m they need to cover the loss of match-day revenue this season. And many in football will welcome the idea of a more redistributive financial model, with 25% of Premier League income shared at a time when the gulf between the divisions has been identified as a major problem. Indeed, if the threat of this plan helps break the impasse between the Premier League and the government over a rescue package for the EFL, and a more redistributive financial 'reset', perhaps it can emerge as a positive development. The English Football League confirmed it had been in talks over 'Project Big Picture' and that its chairman Rick Parry was in favour of the plans,first reported in the Daily Telegraph.,external ""The need for a complete rethinking regarding the funding of English professional football predates the Covid-19 crisis,"" he said in a statement. ""Discussion and planning around 'Project Big Picture' has been ongoing for quite some time, unrelated to the current pandemic but now has an urgency that simply cannot be denied. ""The revenues flowing from the investment and work of our top clubs has been largely limited to the top division creating a sort of lottery, while Championship clubs struggle to behave prudently and Leagues One and Two are financially stretched despite enormous revenues English football generates. ""This plan devised by our top clubs and the English Football League puts an end to all of that."" Parry says, in 2018-19, Championship clubs received Â£146m in EFL distributions and Premier League solidarity payments, compared with Â£1.56bn received by the bottom 14 Premier League clubs. He added parachute payments made to eight recently relegated clubs totalled Â£246m and represented one-third of the total Championship turnover. Parry said it created ""a major distortion that impacts the league annually"". ""The gap between the Premier League and the English Football League has become a chasm which has become unbridgeable for clubs transitioning between the EFL and Premier League,"" he said. Manchester United are among the clubs driving the change It is understood Liverpool's owners, the Fenway Sports Group, came forward with the initial plan, which has been worked on by United co-chairman Joel Glazer. It is anticipated it will receive the backing of Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur - the other members of England's 'big six'. The idea is to address longstanding EFL concerns about the huge gap in funding between its divisions and the Premier League by handing over 25% of the annual income, although the current parachute payment system would be scrapped. There would be a Â£250m up-front payment to address the existing crisis created by the coronavirus pandemic, seen by some as a bid to garner support for the proposals. In addition, the Football Association would receive what is being described as a Â£100m ""gift"". The Football Supporters' Association said it noted ""with grave concern"" the proposals, adding they had ""far-reaching consequences for the whole of domestic football"". ""Once again it appears that big decisions in football are apparently being stitched up behind our backs by billionaire club owners who continue to treat football as their personal fiefdom,"" it said in a statement. ""Football is far more than a business to be carved up; it is part of our communities and our heritage, and football fans are its lifeblood. As football's most important stakeholders, it is crucial that fans are consulted and involved in the game's decision-making. ""We have welcomed the government's commitment to a 'fan-led review of the governance of football'; we would argue that today's revelations have made that process even more relevant and urgent."" The organisation said it remained ""open-minded to any suggestions for the improvement of the governance and organisation of the game"". It added: ""We would however emphasise that in our discussions so far, very few of our members have ever expressed the view that what football really needs is a greater concentration of power in the hands of the big six billionaire-owned clubs."" No date has been set for the proposed new-style league to be in operation but sources have suggested 2022-23 is not out of the question. In order to get down from 20 to 18, it is anticipated four clubs would be relegated directly, with two promoted from the Championship. In addition, there would be play-offs involving the team to finish 16th in the Premier League and those in third, fourth and fifth in the second tier. It is also planned that, as well as the 'big six', ever-present league member Everton, West Ham United and Southampton - ninth and 11th respectively in the list of clubs who have featured in the most Premier League seasons - would be granted special status. If six of those nine clubs vote in favour of a proposal, it would be enough to get it passed. There is no mention of Aston Villa and Newcastle United, both of whom have featured in more Premier League campaigns than Manchester City.

"Bryanboy (right) said he found being in the restaurant with the posters (left) awkward As coronavirus has spread around the world, people of Asian heritage have reported facing greater hostility. But fashion influencer Bryanboy said he was shocked to find ""racist"" images on the walls of a Stockholm restaurant. ""It wasn't until we placed our order that we noticed all the huge posters on the wall â an illustrated portrait of a very yellow Xi Jinping with bat ears and the term 'BAT MAN',"" he said. The restaurant has since removed the posters. Restaurant Riche, in the Swedish capital, said many people had found the exhibition ""disturbing and racist,external, which was of course not the intention"", adding that it ""sincerely apologise[s] to anyone that was offended"". The artist behind the poster, who publishes work under the name Iron Art Works, said they apologised for any offence caused, but not for the image itself. ""I would not have done it in the first place If I did not stand behind it. I still do,"" they told the BBC via email. ""I don't want to hurt people of course, that is not my intention at all."" How a virus reveals the many ways China is feared British Chinese people reveal prejudice amid outbreak Coronavirus: What attacks on Asians reveal Bryanboy, whose real name is Bryan Yambao, was dining at the restaurant in the Swedish capital with a friend from Hong Kong on Saturday.He wrote on Instagram that he was ""mortified"",externalwhen he saw the posters. ""Ever since Covid happened, me and pretty much a lot of the Asian people I know have gone through so much racist and xenophobic abuse on the internet,"" Mr Yambao, who is Filipino, told the BBC. ""So to see it in real life was kind of surreal."" He added that he had already ordered food but ""couldn't wait to get out of the restaurant"". The artwork features the Chinese president as ""Bat Man"" - in an apparent reference to the theory that the coronavirus may have originated in bats - in front of a Japanese-style rising sun. It was installed in the restaurant several weeks ago. The first cases of coronavirus were recorded in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, but the virus has since spread around the world. The pandemic has led to a wave of racism, xenophobia and even violence directed towards people of Chinese ethnicity, as well as people of East Asian appearance. In one case in London,a student from Singapore was beaten by a group of menwho allegedly said: ""I don't want your coronavirus in my country."" ""Almost every day I get comments, just because I'm Asian, linking me with Covid,"" said Mr Yambao. ""And it's not just online - these images have real-life repercussions, because they create a hostile environment for Asians and it normalises racism and xenophobia against them."" The artist said on Instagram that their work was not intended to be racist, and their previous art included satirical depictions of a number of world leaders. ""My intention was only to make a fool of Xi [Jinping]/CCP [Chinese Communist Party] NOT to make a racist comment that hurt a lot of people, but I accidentally did, and I again apologise to you who feel that way,"" they wrote in an Instagram post.

In comments to the BBC, the artist said the incident was a ""schoolbook example"" of cancel culture, and argued that there had been no complaints of racism about the art - which they said had been displayed in parts of Stockholm for several months and in Restaurant Riche for a month - until this weekend. They added that they thought cancel culture was ""a greater danger to society than any artwork"". But Mr Yambao said the artist's response was a ""non-apology"". ""It comes from a place of ignorance - that he wasn't expecting it to be racist or considered racistâ¦ I'm all for freedom of expression by artists, but I just wish that he knew what the repercussions of his work are."" ""In these crazy times, when millions of people are affected by this disease and hundreds of thousands of people have already died, and the world is already in such a bad state, do we really need to create divisive artwork out there, that could be misconstrued by anyone?"" Mr Yambao asked. The World Health Organization has warned against attaching locations or ethnicities to the pandemic. ""This is not a 'Wuhan Virus', 'Chinese Virus' or 'Asian Virus',"" the body said in guidance issued earlier this year, adding that the ""official name for the disease was deliberately chosen to avoid stigmatisation"".

"This video can not be played Robert Jenrick: ""Ministers do not get involved in making decisions for their own constituencies"" Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has dismissed Labour's call for an investigation into the award of a Â£25m regeneration grant to his constituency. He told BBC One's Andrew Marr show the decision to give the money to Newark, Nottinghamshire, had been taken by fellow minister Jake Berry. Mr Jenrick said he had himself decided to grant funds to a town in Mr Berry's constituency under the same scheme. He called this ""perfectly normal"" and accused Labour of ""distraction"". But Labour described the allocation of the money ""murky"" and urged Mr Jenrick to submit himself to a ""full"" investigation.

""The secretary of state has questions to answer and an investigation is the right way forwards."" But Mr Jenrick said the government had a ""robust"" system in place for choosing which places would benefit from the Towns Fund and that the rules had been created before he became communities secretary. He added that Mr Berry, who oversees local growth in England as a minister within Mr Jenrick's department, had made the decision following advice from civil servants. Darwen, a town in Mr Berry's Rossendale and Darwen constituency, was also allocated money from the Towns Fund. The decision, Mr Jenrick said, had been ""made by myself"". He added: ""This is perfectly normal. Ministers don't get involved in making decisions for their own constituency. ""But neither should their constituencies be victims of the fact that their MP is a minister."" Mr Jenrick also said: ""The Labour Party front bench need to get beyond the M25 and see what's happening in our constituencies.""

"Restaurant and bar workers held a ""funeral' for their trade in Paris Just as Europe was hoping it could put Covid to rest, the virus has risen again, with renewed venom. Case numbers have been rising and in their wake, hospital admissions too. Each country is trying to find the right combination of measures - local lockdowns, test-and-trace initiatives, economic support and public communication - to drive down numbers as winter approaches. As the UK government prepares to unveil a range of new lockdown rules, BBC reporters from France, Germany and other European capitals explain how their countries are managing. At the bottom of the article, we show how two key nations in Asia have seen a different trajectory. Deaths 32,521|Death rate 50 per 100,000 people|Total cases 671,638 Warning lights are flashing in French cities as the long-anticipated autumn surge starts to make itself felt, writesHugh Schofield, in Paris. All key indicators give cause for concern. Roughly 18,000 new cases are being detected each day. The number of cases is 116 per 100,000 people and also rising. According to doctors, the main vector is young people resuming social lives post-lockdown and then passing the virus on. However, there is a change from the first wave in March/April because this time, thanks to testing, the big regional and city/countryside variations are clear to see. Increasingly the epidemic is seen as an urban phenomenon. This means that the government's response is not - and is unlikely ever to be - another national lockdown. Instead the health authorities have devised a complex system of regional alert levels. About two-thirds of the country are now in a red zone, meaning the virus there is spreading. With each level new restrictions kick in. For example in Paris, on maximum alert along with five other cities, bars are now shut. At the lowest alert level, gatherings are limited to 30; at the higher levels the limit is 10. In addition, government representatives in the regions have discretionary powers to order other measures - such as the compulsory wearing of masks in Paris. Like in other countries, France's mantra is test, trace, isolate. The number of daily tests is now about 175,000. There is already a nationwide network of independent laboratories which have become testing sites, though others have been set up by town halls. When I got tested after developing symptoms in September, it took just a day to arrange the test and another day for the result (negative). However, by general admission, the contact tracing system it is not functioning as it should be. Simply put, there are too many cases and the government is recruiting an extra 2,000 extra staff. In keeping with its reputation, France claims to have the most generous state help in Europe to individuals and businesses that are suffering from Covid. People who are isolating can claim sick benefit in the normal way. If a child needs home care because of an outbreak at school, a parent can stay at home and go on furlough. Furlough has been offered to 1.3 million workers so far. The scheme, under which companies can be reimbursed 85% of a person's salary, has now been extended into the new year. If it is all very French, it is what people expect - not that they show huge confidence in the way the epidemic is being handled. A poll by Elabe this week suggested only 35% of people trusted the government to ""fight effectively against Covid"". Some 73% said they were ""personally worried"" about the virus - an increase of four points in a week. Deaths 906|Death rate 8.5 per 100,000 people|Total cases 109,374 If seven days is a long time in politics, how long is seven months in a pandemic? To most here, it feels like an age, writesRob Cameron, in Prague. Back in March, the Czech Republic was feted for its rapid response to Covid, shutting its borders and swiftly locking down most of the economy. People were told to stay at home where possible. Masks were made compulsory indoors and out. Most respected the measures with good grace and humour. By the end of June, an infamous dinner party was held on Prague's Charles Bridge to celebrate the end of ""this difficult period of the coronavirus crisis"" (although not to declare the virus itself vanquished, as is sometimes wrongly claimed). At that time, the country of 10.7 million was seeing 150 cases a day and had recorded 347 deaths in just over three months. The sun shone. Holidays were booked. Masks and other restrictions were gleefully abandoned. Today, the Czech Republic has both the highest and the fastest-growing daily number of new cases in Europe, with figures almost double those in the UK. The ratio of positive cases to tests stands at 30% - a number that terrifies epidemiologists. The total death toll now stands at more than 800, but will almost certainly pass 1,000 by next week. Officials warn the country's hospitals could soon become overwhelmed. The track-and-trace system has struggled to keep up. Authorities are taking days - sometimes 14 - to contact people who might have come into contact with an infected person. Its helplines are permanently engaged. ""A difficult period lies ahead of us. We will need all hands on deck,"" Health Minister Roman Prymula, himself an epidemiologist, told a televised news briefing. Standing next to him on the podium was Prime Minister Andrej Babis, the man whom many Czechs blame for the current crisis. It was Mr Babis - it is widely believed - who vetoed a plan to re-introduce regulations on masks. In the end, the numbers began their inexorable climb to their current peak, and new measures are being introduced anyway. They were too little, too late. The PM has warned that a new lockdown cannot be ruled out and urged people to stay at home for the weekend. Czechs, meanwhile, are trying to grapple with the myriad new rules and regulations coming into force on Monday. Pubs, restaurants and bars will only be able to seat a maximum of four people at one table, and must close at 20:00. Wi-fi will be switched off in shopping centres to put off young people from gathering. Only groups of two will be able to enter shops or shopping centres together, and children aged 12-15 will take turns doing online teaching on a class-by-class basis, to keep classes from mixing in schools. Some scientists say the Czech numbers in March were so low it was wrong even to call it an epidemic. That, sadly, is no longer the case. GLOBAL VIEW:Tracking the outbreak's spread EUROPE RULES:Country by country TESTING:How much do other countries do? Deaths 9,609|Death rate 11.6 per 100,000 people|Total cases 320,899 Germany is widely held up as a model of how to manage Covid in Europe, but there is a nervousness in the air as the weather gets colder, writesDamian McGuinnessin Berlin. So far it has fared comparatively well. Total deaths are below 10,000 - less than a quarter the UK total, in a population significantly larger. But infections, which had remained low over the summer, have started to surge. The latest daily rate is almost 5,000 - a high not seen since April. This is still low compared with other big European countries. And so far, Germany's track-and-trace system has held up well, but it has its limits. As infections rise, the system will start to struggle. This has already happened in Berlin, Frankfurt and Bremen. Other urban centres are also seeing a sudden rise in infection rates. And while it's mostly young people now, the fear is that the virus will find its way into the older, more vulnerable population. Which is why on Friday afternoon Chancellor Angela Merkel had a video conference with the mayors of Germany's 11 biggest cities to decide new stricter measures. ""Now is the time that we will determine in what shape Germany will get through the pandemic this winter,"" Mrs Merkel said. This weekend some cities, including Berlin, are introducing a 23:00 closing times for bars, cafes and restaurants. Limits on numbers of people allowed to meet are also being brought back. Mrs Merkel will meet mayors again in two weeks, and if infection rates haven't fallen, tougher measures will be introduced. The lockdown in Germany was milder than in other European countries â there were never restrictions on going outside, for example. It was also shorter, meaning that businesses suffered less of a hit. Mask-wearing has become ubiquitous, so there have been few outbreaks on transport, in shops, or at other services such as hairdressers. Polling shows that most people support the government's measures. It's rare to see anyone flouting the rules about wearing face-coverings in shops or on public transport. Mrs Merkel's personal ratings are the highest of any politician. Unemployment rates have only increased by one percentage point since March. In September, the jobless figure even went down slightly. But Germany would struggle to afford another lockdown â particularly with such generous state support. And unlike the UK, where furlough payments have tapered off in recent months, in Germany they increase the longer someone can't work, or is forced to take a salary cut, because of Covid. The 67% of salary paid to workers with kids for the first three months rises to 87% after six months, and the scheme is set to run until the end of 2021. Deaths 6,546|Death rate 38.4 per 100,000 people|Total cases 161,929 ""Very bad"" was Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte's assessment on Friday of how his country is faring. An understatement perhaps, given the Netherlands has one of the worst infection rates in Europe - almost 6,000 new cases recorded on Thursday, writesAnna Holligan, in The Hague. Like the UK, the second wave came sooner than many expected. Rules had been relaxed over the summer. There was an impression the Netherlands had beaten the virus. Tests are in short supply, as are the staff to do them. The country can handle 17,500 a day but that means not everyone with symptoms can be tested. There is a joke that the government is adopting Dutch GP's usual advice: ""Take a paracetamol."" This weekend a long-awaited contact tracing app was due to go live. Most bars and restaurants already have registers for customers to leave their details, but few do. Where health authorities do have people's details, they have often been unable to cope and so contacts have gone untraced. In March, the Netherlands implemented a self-titled ""intelligent lockdown"", so life could continue while limiting the spread of the virus. More recently, people have been advised to wear masks in all enclosed public spaces. But introducing mask rules in two stages appears to have affected compliance. Mask-wearers remain in the minority. Looking in shops as I cycled down my local high street in The Hague, no-one was wearing a mask. There has been a huge economic support package, covering up to 90% of wages. Business owners can apply for a ""gift"" of 1,000 euros (Â£906) a month. But the government focus now is on encouraging people to adapt to ""the new economic reality"". Chaotic and shambolic are words not often used to describe the Dutch, but increasingly they are how critics have characterised Mr Rutte's handling of the outbreak. Public approval has crumbled. According to the latest polls, support for the government's approach has dipped from 75% to 65%. Some 66% said ministers should be introducing tougher measures. If there's no downturn in new cases over this weekend, the prime minister has warned tougher measures are unavoidable. Deaths 32,929|Death rate 70.5 per 100,000 people|Total cases 861,112 Spain started to see infections rise again almost as soon as its strict national lockdown was lifted at the end of June. There have been constant new outbreaks since then, and the government now accepts that a second wave is hitting the country, writesGuy Hedgecoein Madrid. There are currently more than 10,000 patients in hospital with the virus. Spain has had the highest number of cases in Europe so far and last week registered another 57,247. Testing capacity has increased since the peak of the first wave, to about 50,000 tests a day. But the numbers of tests available can vary a great deal from one region to another and there are concerns that this has contributed to Spain's difficulties in managing the pandemic. There are no figures showing the total number of tracers at work in Spain. The health ministry has a tracing app, Radar Covid, but fewer than 10% of Spaniards have it on their phones. The government recently extended a furlough scheme for businesses until the end of January. It allows companies to send workers home or reduce their hours, maintaining unemployment benefits at 70% for those not working. Although infections have been rising in almost all areas of the country since the summer, some regions have been particularly hard hit. In July and August, the north-eastern regions of Catalonia, the Basque Country and AragÃ³n saw a sharp spike in cases and, more recently, the Madrid region has become the biggest source of new infections. The authorities have been introducing local restrictions to tackle outbreaks. In some cases, rules are introduced across a whole region, such as the closure of nightclubs in Catalonia. In other cases, movements are restricted in a town or village and locals are urged to stay at home. Face masks are obligatory in all public places for anyone over the age of six, with some exceptions, and it is unusual to see people flouting that rule on the streets of a city, for example. But while Spaniards have generally obeyed these restrictions, there have been growing clashes between the national and regional governments, reflecting Spain's deeply polarised politics. The national government has forced through restrictions in Madrid and several surrounding cities, despite strong opposition from the regional administration. People's views on the government's handling of the pandemic tends to reflect this divide and be fairly evenly split - a recent study by the National Statistics Institute (INE) showed that 57% of Spaniards had little or no confidence in the government's response to the crisis. *Deaths per 100,000 people Please update your browser to see full interactive This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals for each country. ** The past data for new cases is a three day rolling average.

South Korea was one of the first countries to be hit by the coronavirus. At one point it had the worst outbreak of Covid-19 outside mainland China. But within weeks, doctors and health officials managed to get the rate of infections under control from a peak of 1,000 cases a day in late February to no reported cases by the end of April. They did this through mass testing and strict contact tracing. The country had test kits ready within two weeks of the first reported case on 20 January. Covid-19 tests have always been easily available at clinics and hospitals, and South Korea was the first to pilot drive-through testing. They even came up with space-age telephone-box test booths where the physician was behind clear screens to keep them safe from infected patients. Contact tracing is done through surveillance. Once a case is reported, phone and bank records are pored over by tracing teams to try to find out where the infected person has been and crucially who've they've been near. Text messages are sent to everyone who may have come into contact with the virus, urging them to get a test. This has been one of the most controversial measures, but the majority of people have accepted it and prioritised controlling the pandemic over their own privacy. There are also strict quarantine measures. Everyone in isolation must use a phone app to record their temperature and symptoms, daily. Everyone coming into the country must serve two weeks quarantine and take a test. Going anywhere without a mask is unthinkable here. You would be the odd one out. It is mandatory on public transport and taxis. But all these measures combined have kept this country out of lockdown and the economy largely open. When infections rise, stricter measures are put in place. Schools opened in May but some were closed again after a surge in local cases. Nightclubs and karaoke bars were shut after outbreaks and have remained closed until this week. They are only allowed to reopen if they adhere to strict disinfection guidelines. At one point there was a 21:00 curfew on restaurants in the capital, Seoul. But now, social distancing guidelines are back to their lowest level. There have also been a number of  financial support programmes in place. There has been broad support for South Korea's coronavirus measures. The current administration won a landslide election in April for the first time, which most believe was due to the effective handling of the pandemic. There are still cases reported every day, but life is almost as back to as normal as it can be. We can see friends, eat out, have drinks and travel within the country. Pupils are back at school. Whatever concerns there have been over privacy, most have seen it as a price worth paying. Deaths 27|Death rate 0.5 per 100,000 people|Total cases 57,866 Singapore has so far avoided the second spikes seen in Europe, writesKarishma Vaswani. As well as the test, trace and isolate doctrine of other countries, Singapore's mandatory mask wearing, strict penalties for rule breaking, and technological tools like a ""trace together"" token, have helped control the virus. The token, which can be worn on a lanyard, uses Bluetooth to look for other users' devices. It tells you if you've been in contact with someone who has been infected - so you can isolate yourself. Singapore was the first country in the world to have a contact-tracing phone app, but the token is seen as more reliable. Initially, it was targeted at the elderly - who may not have smartphones - and young. But now everyone's being encouraged to get one. The city-state, with a population of 5.6 million, was quick to react at the start of the pandemic, after a first round of infections sparked by tourists from Wuhan in China.  Through a meticulous contact tracing and quarantine programme, numbers were kept low. As early as March, it was seen to have beaten the virus, and earned the ""gold standard"" moniker for its efforts. Lockdown had been avoided. But a mass outbreak in the dormitories of low-paid migrant workers dashed those hopes. In April, Singapore went into lockdown for almost two months, costing the economy US$10bn per month in losses, according to some analysts. Six months on, things appear to have been brought under control. But officials are more modest now about their success. The majority of those with Covid are being housed in community isolation facilities - rather than hospitals. These are dedicated to people who aren't severely ill so don't need to be in hospital. Key to this strategy is the opening up the economy - and ensuring that trade dependent, open-bordered Singapore can bounce back when international travel starts again. The economy is slowly restarting, and the plan is to move into the next phase of its recovery programme, by allowing more people to meet in conferences, and weddings. Still, businesses have suffered. To help them Singapore has doled out almost $70bn in wage subsidies, loans to small- and medium-sized companies, and cash handouts to Singaporeans to supplement their living expenses. But the government is extremely concerned about how the economy will fare as Singapore depends on external trade, tourism and travel to keep growth here strong. Officials say the economy could contract by 7% this year - the worst performance since independence. Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat has warned the country is at a ""critical juncture"" in its economic development. Independent economists say Singapore's contraction could be much worse, if a vaccine isn't developed soon.

"Coronavirus could see councils in England overspend their budget by Â£1.7bn Nine in 10 major local authorities in England do not have enough money to cover their spending plans this year, official documents have shown. Analysis by BBC News has found the coronavirus could see councils this year overspend their budgets by Â£1.7bn. The Local Government Association (LGA) warned authorities faced ""spiralling demands"" on their finances. The government said councils had received Â£4.8bn in emergency support since the start of the pandemic. Since March local authorities across the country have provided emergency pandemic support to some of the most vulnerable people in society. But the cost of providing this support has left many councils struggling financially. BBC News has analysed the most recent financial monitoring documents published by 144 out of 149 unitary and county councils in England. After taking account of emergency grant funding from central government, the documents revealed nine in every 10 of these councils was forecasting they would overspend their budget this year. The forecasts were largely calculated on the basis of the authorities' spending in the first quarter of the 2020-21 financial year. By law councils are not allowed to spend more money than they have in their day-to-day spending budget nor can they borrow money to fund public services. The documents show thatHampshire County Council,externalhas a net budget gap of more than Â£80m. Council officers warned the authority needed ""at least Â£52.4m of additional government support"" before it could be considered to be ""financially sustainable in the medium term"". Leeds City Council,externalforecast it needed to find Â£52.6m by March, saying more than400 jobs could be lost as a result. Leeds City Council said it could be forced to declare itself technically ""bankrupt"" in November Amanda Burley leads a team of Leeds City Council support workers helping people to recover from covid-19. Ms Burley said her team's work was vulnerable to future budget cuts being considered by the council. ""I watched my partner lose his job at the beginning of lockdown, which put huge financial and emotional stress on us,"" she said. ""It's a scary place to be, fearing for your livelihood. I love my job but there's a great amount of fear, because we don't know what the budget cuts are going to be in March 2021."" The council said it was working to avoid making any employees compulsorily redundant. Amanda Burley, a social care worker at Leeds City Council, said her role could be closed in future budget cuts Leeds council's deputy leader James Lewis said the authority had requested an emergency Â£50m loan from the government. He said if ministers did not provide the loan, and the council could not pass an emergency budget, then the authority would have to issue a Section 114 notice in November, a technical form of bankruptcy for public authorities in England. ""Our financial problems are keeping me awake at night,"" said Mr Lewis. The budget monitoring reports published by councils in England showed they have been needing to find money to fund new costs caused by the pandemic. The 32 borough councils in London,externalhave collectively set aside Â£16.1m to provide extra mortuary space to cope with an increase in deaths expected during the second wave of the pandemic. England's geographically-largest authority,North Yorkshire County Council,external, estimated it could have to spend Â£5.6m this year on personal protective equipment. Councils have had to spend millions of pounds on purchasing PPE Figures published by theMinistry for Housing, Communities and Local Government,externalshowed in the first three months of 2020-21 spending by all councils in England was Â£1.7bn higher than it had been in the first three months of 2019-20. ""Securing the immediate and long-term sustainability of local services must now be the top priority for the (government's) spending review"" said Councillor Richard Watts, from the Local Government Association. ""This includes the government meeting in full the financial challenges councils face as a result of Covid-19 - including all lost income - and providing long-term investment to allow councils to plug funding gaps, meet demand pressures and improve local services for communities."" There would be three main options. Councils could stop providing or cut funding for discretionary services such as art galleries and leisure centres. This could result in job losses and a loss of some services. But local authorities would not be allowed to completely stop providing key services such as bin collections or basic social care. Councils could look to use money they held in reserve, a kind of savings account, to top up their current spending budgets. Nottingham City Council,externalsaid it was planning to use half of its cash reserves to deal with its current financial pressures. Last year the authority held Â£140m in reserve but it expects to use Â£70m this year to address its budget shortfall. And finally the government in Westminster could provide more financial assistance to struggling councils. It hasalready provided Â£3.7bn in grant funding.. A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said the government had provided a package of measures worth Â£28bn to help local communities through the coronavirus pandemic. ""We will continue to work closely with councils as they support their communities through the pandemic and if any are concerned about their future financial position, they should contact MHCLG,"" the spokeswoman added.

"The UK has reached a ""tipping point"" in its coronavirus epidemic similar to that last seen in March, one of the country's top scientists has warned. England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said the seasons were ""against us"" and the country was running into a ""headwind"". More deaths would follow a rise in cases over coming weeks, he said, and urged people to limit social contact. On Monday, Boris Johnson is expected to announce tougher restrictions. In a statement to MPs, the prime minister is expected to set out plans for a three-tier local lockdown system which would see every region in England placed in one of three tiers, depending on the severity of cases. Across the UK, the R number - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus onto - is now estimated between 1.2 and 1.5.Anything above 1.0 means cases are increasing. On Saturday, 15,166 people in the UK were reported to have tested positive for coronavirus - up 1,302 on Friday's figure, according to thegovernment's dashboard,external. There were a further 81 deaths - a decrease of six on Friday. However, the Office for National Statistics estimates 224,000 people in homes in England had the virus, up to 1 October - roughly double the figure reported by the ONS for each of the preceding two weeks. What are the Covid restrictions where I live? PM to detail stricter Covid restrictions on Monday Concern mounts at Covid shutdown 'ripple effect' In his statement published on Sunday, Prof Van-Tam said that while the epidemic ""re-started"" again among younger people over the past few weeks, there is ""clear evidence of a gradual spread into older age groups"" in the worst-hit areas. ""Sadly, just as night follows day, increases in deaths will now follow on in the next few weeks,"" Prof Van-Tam said. He warned that the UK was in a different position than during the first wave because ""we are now are going into the colder, darker winter months"". ""We are in the middle of a severe pandemic and the seasons are against us. Basically, we are running into a headwind,"" he said. But he also said the UK has ""much improved testing capabilities"" and ""better treatments"" available, meaning that ""we know where it is and how to tackle it"". He stressed the importance of following public health guidance and minimising contact with others, adding: ""I know this is very hard, but it is an unfortunate scientific fact that the virus thrives on humans making social contact with one another.""

Labour claims that close to one million workers will be at risk because the chancellor's plan to pay staff at UK companies that are told to close 67% of their wages does not extend to those who may be indirectly affected, such as those in supply chains. The Treasury denied firms that are not fully closed would not receive help. A spokesperson said: ""We do not recognise these figures,"" adding that Labour had ""incorrectly"" listed some sectors as not benefitting from the scheme. What are the Covid restrictions where I live? How many cases are there in my area? What is changing after furlough? Will I be paid under the Job Support Scheme? Prime Minister Boris Johnson will set out the new rules for hotspots in the House of Commons on Monday. Every region of England is expected to be placed in one of three tiers, with the Liverpool City Region thought to be in the category with the strictest rules. Plans are not yet finalised, BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said, but that is likely to mean pubs will close, restaurants could face restrictions, people may even be told not to travel in and out of the area. Schools and universities would remain open. Pubs and restaurants across the central belt of Scotland have closed for the last time in at least two weeks More talks are expected on Sunday between the government and leaders in parts of England that are expecting new restrictions. Council leaders and mayors have expressed their anger at what they see as inadequate help for those who will no longer be able to work. Many regions are demanding more local control over contact tracing, while others have raised the possibility of legal action if they do not get the support they demand. The government says it is committed to involving local leaders in decision-making. Discussions with Downing Street on Friday were described on Merseyside as ""frosty,"" but ""cordial and giving on both sides"". Leaders in Greater Manchester do not yet have another meeting with the government arranged, Chris Mason added - but one is expected before the prime minister's statement on Monday. In Nottingham, Newcastle, Sunderland, Leeds and elsewhere, leaders and residents await the announcement of the template for the next phase of the pandemic.

"A photo of the meeting was shared by Mr Lukashenko's office Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has held an unexpected meeting with political opponents in the jail where they are currently detained. State media reported that the president called the meeting to discuss constitutional reform with his imprisoned opponents. Opposition figures said the meeting was a sign of weakness on his part. Mr Lukashenko claimed a landslide win in August elections widely seen as fraudulent, sparking mass protests. A violent crackdown on unrest in the days following the disputed poll saw thousands of people detained, and hundreds beaten by police. The EU and the US have refused to recognise Mr Lukashenko's new term. The president's press office said participants had agreed to keep the four-and-a-half-hour conversation ""secret"". However, a photo posted by the press service shows Mr Lukashenko sitting at a table with 11 political figures, all of whom look pale and unsmiling. Among them is Viktor Babaryko, a banker who was initially seen as Mr Lukashenko's strongest rival in the election, but was barred from running and jailed in July. Liliya Vlasova, a lawyer and member of the opposition's Coordination Council, is also in the photo, as is Vitali Shkliarov, a Belarusian-American strategist who worked on US Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign. What's happening in Belarus? How many people does it take to oust a political leader? Kremlin looks to keep Belarus in Moscow's orbit Ashort video clip shared by the press service,externalalso shows Mr Lukashenko saying to the group: ""I am trying to convince not only your supporters but the whole of society that we need to look at things more broadly."" Apparently referring to the ongoing protests, he added: ""You can't rewrite the constitution on the streets."" At the end of the clip the opponents are seen laughing at something, but the sound is muted. The president's main rival Svetlana Tikhanovskaya - who is currently in exile in Lithuania - later wrote on social media that Mr Lukashenko had ""acknowledged the existence of political prisoners whom he used to call criminals"". But she then added: ""You can't have dialogue in a prison cell."" Svetlana Tikhanovskaya is currently in exile in Lithuania Pavel Latushko, a former ambassador to France who joined the Coordination Council and was pressured to leave the country, also posted about the meeting on social media. He said that by entering a dialogue with those he had put behind bars, Mr Lukashenko had shown weakness. Weeks of anti-government demonstrations since the disputed election have seen tens of thousands of protesters on the streets in cities across the country. Many opposition activists have been beaten up by police and thousands have been arrested during months of unrest. They are demanding the release of all political prisoners and a free and fair re-run of the election. Many of Ms Tikhanovskaya's supporters and allies have been detained, on the charge of making public calls to harm the country's security, or forced to leave the country after receiving threats from the authorities. This video can not be played Mass arrests as crowds chant 'go away' to Belarus president Meanwhile eight European nations,including the UKand Germany, are recalling their ambassadors to Belarus in solidarity with Lithuania and Poland. Belarus says Lithuania and Poland are interfering in its internal affairs by hosting Ms Tikhanovskaya and other opposition figures and refusing to accept the election result. Belarus recalled its ambassadors to Poland and Lithuania last Friday and told both countries to reduce the number of staff at their embassies in Minsk. They refused and recalled their own ambassadors. What's happening in Belarus? How many people does it take to oust a political leader?
