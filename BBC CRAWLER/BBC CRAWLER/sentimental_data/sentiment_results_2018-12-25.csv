"Children from around the US called to speak to the president and his wife on Christmas Eve There are some questions no-one should ever ask. ""What does this red button do?"" ""What do people say about me?"" ""Do you believe in Santa Claus?"" Now weallknow Santa Claus exists. But for some reason, the US president threw doubt on this when speaking to one child on Christmas Eve. The scene was the State Dining Room in the White House. Donald Trump and his wife Melania were taking calls from American children as the couple sat under two gargantuan Christmas trees. All the children who called in had done so in the hope of getting through to Norad,the government agency that tracks Santa's movements around the world at Christmas,external(that is still operating despite a partial government shutdown). Some of those calls were patched through to Mr Trump and his wife, and thanks to pool reporter Kevin Diaz, we know some of what the president said. This is how Diaz reported the exchange: Trump (in booming voice) to a kid named Collman:""Hello, is this Collman? Merry Christmas. How are you? How old are you?.... Are you doing well in school? Are you still a believer in Santa?"" Footage of the incident circulating on social media shows Mr Trump then telling the child: ""Because at seven, it's marginal, right?"" ""Collman"", it now emerges, is a seven-year-old girl from South Carolina,externalnamed Collman Lloyd, who told the Post and Courier newspaper she didn't know what ""marginal"" meant. It is not clear why Mr Trump asked this particular question, because, of course, Santa's existence is beyond dispute. These photos taken around the world over the past few hours provide overwhelming evidence he exists: Here he is in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico... ...and here he is in Disneyland... ...and here he is in Espoo, Finland The rest of the calls passed without incident, with warm wishes from both Trumps to those who called in.

"The rescued woman (second left) and her son (second right) are escorted by police officers An Argentine woman seized in the 1980s by people traffickers has been reunited with her family in a joint operation by Argentine and Bolivian police. The whereabouts of the woman, who is now 45, had been unknown until earlier this year when police received a tip-off she was in Bermejo, south Bolivia. The police then located the house in which she was being held and freed her and her nine-year-old son. The names of the rescued mother and son have not been revealed.

"The Archbishop of Canterbury has urged the UK to forget the ""languages of hatred, tribalism [and] rivalry"" in his Christmas Day sermon. The Most Reverend Justin Welby told his congregation to aim for peace and unity at a time of challenge and discord. While he did not specifically mention the UK's political future, he stressed the importance of the language of love replacing the language of conflict. ""God's language of love is exclusive,"" he said at Canterbury Cathedral. Goodwill theme to Queen's Christmas address The Pope calls for peace in conflict zones Other church leaders used their Christmas messages to highlight social action fighting homelessness and poverty. Bishop of London the Right Reverend Dame Sarah Mullally said 33,000 Church of England ""social action"" projects included food banks, night shelters and dementia cafes. Right Rev Dame Sarah Mullally highlighted the Church of England's social projects The leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, used his homily to thank volunteers working to help the needy. Both leaders acknowledged that many people faced challenging times and that society had become more divided. May and Corbyn deliver Christmas messages Danny Dyer to deliver C4 Christmas message Speaking before delivering her first Christmas midnight service since becoming the first woman Bishop of London, Bishop Mullally told the BBC the UK was facing ""a lot of turbulence"". ""Debates in politics around the EU referendum have created division,"" she said. ""My belief is that diversity creates strong community; division weakens it."" But she said the Church had been working across generations and social groups and that churches working together could help in ""breaking down barriers... so we create stable communities"". ""The Church needs to speak confidently about faith in Jesus Christ but it also needs to reflect the compassion we see in God and Jesus which is why, not just in London but right across the country, churches are involved in social action projects,"" said Bishop Mullally. ""[There are] something like 33,000 social action projects across the Church of England; people setting up food banks, credit unions, dementia cafes and night shelters demonstrating the love of God."" Cardinal Nichols, pictured conducting Mass in April 2017, said volunteers would be ready if hardship increased Inhis homily, the Archbishop of Westminster,external, Cardinal Nichols, pointed to ""difficult times, times of uncertainty and an absence of consensus"". But he also spoke of ""countless acts of kindness"", saying: ""Our society is full of generosity and compassion, although we do not shout about it."" ""In our parishes, for example, there are over 130 projects responding to food poverty and homelessness,"" he told worshippers at Westminster Cathedral. ""So many of our schools provide breakfasts and vouchers for the most needy. Volunteers constantly come forward... If, in the coming year, hardship increases, then we are ready to help in every way we can."" Around the country, bishops used Christmas messages to urge people to come together. Graham Usher, the Bishop of Dudley, said: ""Our current political debates... put up barriers between those who voted in different ways. ""Our country needs, more than ever, to seek grace and generosity in our political conversation so that there are not winners and losers, just the flourishing of all."" Bishop of Bath and Wells Peter Hancock pointed out that Christmas is ""a joyful time but for many people it's a tough time and lonely time too"". Meanwhile, Bishop of Taunton Ruth Worsley wondered ""if this Christmas we might think about how we can offer some hope to other families who might be struggling?""

"More than 300 people were laid off from the Kaiam factory just before Christmas A crowdfunding appeal has raised thousands of pounds for workers who lost their jobs at a computer factory in West Lothian just before Christmas. The initiative was organised as part of community efforts to support more than 300 people who were laid off from the Kaiam plant in Livingston. They were made redundant without being paid wages expected before Christmas. By 09:00 on Boxing Day, more than Â£17,000 had been raised on the crowdfunding site JustGiving. The initial target had been set at Â£10,000. Livingston computer factory lays off 310 workers Administrators appointed at computer firm Uncertain future as workers' wages go unpaid The appeal was set up by Mhairi Duff, who works in a community centre in Livingston. She told BBC Scotland: ""It started after a group of women from all walks of life and backgrounds, who had never met each other, decided to get together and help those who lost their jobs get through the next few weeks, not just Christmas. ""We have been overwhelmed with the support that has been shown from the community."" Mhairi Duff said the support shown from the community had been overwhelming The crowdfunding appeal read: ""The community have come together amazingly to help ease Christmas a little but these employees still have bills to pay and families to feed. Every penny is hugely appreciated."" Ms Duff said Â£4,000 had already been passed on to former Kaiam workers thanks to the support of a local bowling club, which provided a loan until cash from the appeal can be accessed. The crowdfunding appeal will remain open for the time being, she added. Meanwhile, local people and businesses made thousands of pounds worth of donations to help employees who missed out on their Christmas pay. The community response was led by Emma Black, whose step-father is employed by Kaiam. She set up aFacebook group,externalappealing for help for those affected, and over the weekend thousands of donations, including toys and vouchers, were left a community centre in Livingston. It is understood that any toys remaining will be offered to local community organisations, including charities. Thousands of pounds worth of toys and vouchers have been donated by local people and businesses Meanwhile, administrators from KPMG have said they were still hoping to find a buyer for the plant. In a statement, the administrators said they had no option but to make 310 of the 338 employees redundant with immediate effect. The remaining 28 employees have been kept on to help the administrators ""explore a sale of the business."" They are also working alongside Scottish Enterprise, Skills Development Scotland and West Lothian Council to ensure that ""a full range of support is available"" to affected workers. The administrators are also liaising with the UK government ""in relation to the timing of redundancy payments via the Insolvency Service"".

"Abbas Edalat was reportedly detained on 15 April A British-Iranian academic who was arrested and detained in Iran on security charges has returned to the UK, the Foreign Office has confirmed. Prof Abbas Edalat, who works at Imperial College London, was detained in Tehran in April. The Campaign Against Sanctions and Military Intervention in Iran said he was released last week. British-Iranian charity worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe remains in prison in Iran, where she has been since 2016. Prof Edalat - whospecialises in computer science and mathematics,external- was reportedly attending an academic workshop in Iran on 15 April when he was detained. At the time of his arrest, an Iranian news agency reported that Prof Edalat was part of a ""network"" of British spies whose members had been identified and arrested. Prof Edalat foundedanti-war protest group CASMII,external, which opposes sanctions in Iran. The group said: ""It increasingly appears, as we had suspected, that his detention in spring in Iran was a case of misinformation and misunderstanding by the Iranian security apparatus."" Iran confirms arrest of British professor Mayor calls for jailed Briton's release In April, there were at least 30 dual nationals in jail in Iran - among them several dual British-Iranian nationals. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ""We continue to take action on all our consular cases in Iran in line with what we believe will produce the best outcomes in their cases."" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year jail sentence after being convicted of spying charges, which she denies. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt met Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband, Richard Ratcliffe, on 21 December to assure him the Foreign Office was continuing to work towards her release. With regards to her case, a Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We have repeatedly lobbied the Iranians to release Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe on humanitarian grounds and we raise all our cases at every level and every opportunity."" The spokesman added that Iran did not recognise dual nationality, which made the case more difficult. Prime Minister Theresa May met Iranian President Hassan Rouhani for talksat the United Nations in New York in September, when she told him she had ""serious concerns"" about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's imprisonment.

"Japan's main stock market index has plunged, reflecting traders' worries following a slide on Wall Street. The Nikkei closed down 5% on Tuesday, its worst finish since April 2017. Indexes in Shanghai, Bangkok and Taiwan also fell. Investors have been concerned about President Trump's dispute with the US central bank chief and another government shutdown. US stocks had their worst Christmas Eve on record. The Dow Jones index of 30 leading companies fell more than 650 points on Monday, and is on track for its worst December since 1931, during the Great Depression. Many financial markets in Asia, Europe and North America are closed on Tuesday for Christmas. In China, the Shanghai composite index fell more than 2% on Tuesday morning. The Asian markets are believed to be largely reacting to movement in the US and an ensuing shares sell-off by concerned investors. US-China trade tensions are a factor, as well as reports that President Donald Trump has discussed firing the chairman of the US central bank, Jerome Powell. The US government has also entered partial shutdown, after Congress refused to fund President Trump's planned US-Mexico border wall. The president reportedly wanted to fire Fed chairman Jerome Powell, but it is unclear whether he has the authority to do so On Monday, President Trump lashed out at the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, as the stock market plunged. The president said the Fed was ""the only problem"" of the US economy. Five big things from Trumpâs head-spinning week US shutdown could stretch into new year Mr Trump continually boasted about Wall Street's steep climb during the first year of his presidency, but has sought to deflect blame since markets hit a rough patch in 2018. On Sunday US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin took the unusual step of calling the chief executives of America's six largest banks in a bid to soothe market jitters. Afterwards, the Treasury shared a statement about Mr Mnuchin's phone call, confirming that the banks' chief executives had ""ample liquidity available for lending to consumer, business markets, and all other market operations"". ""The markets continue to function properly,"" it added. Analysts warned the unexpected statement could make investors nervous. On Monday, Mr Mnuchin called top market regulators and officials from the US central bank to allay fears. US stocks suffer worst week in a decade Analysis by Samira Hussain, business reporter, BBC News, New York It is rare for a US treasury secretary to make public his discussions with American financial institutions. But that is exactly what Mr Mnuchin did. He was attempting to ease financial markets but Monday's swoon showed he did the opposite. So then President Trump weighed in by tweet and renewed his criticism of the Federal Reserve. That did not have the desired effect either. Instead of the typical Santa Rally, we saw US investors flee stocks for safety. Not exactly the Christmas cheer the White House was hoping for. What does this mean for 2019? A lot will depend on what happens in Washington: government shutdown, simmering trade tensions and the president's tweets. One thing has been made very clear: if the White House wants to calm nervous investors, it's going to need to get much better at its messaging.

"Migrants arriving at the US-Mexico border say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence An eight-year-old boy from Guatemala has died in US government custody, officials say, the second migrant child to die in US detention this month. The border agency says the boy died on Monday night hours after showing signs of illness. A Texas congressman named him as Felipe AlÃ³nzo-Gomez. The child was detained with his father on 18 December after illegally crossing the US-Mexico border. A seven-year-old girl died earlier this month just hours after being detained. Jakelin Caal, also from Guatemala, developed a high fever and died of liver failure.Her funeral was held in her village on Tuesday. What is the migrant caravan heading to US? The agony over an American dream Thousands of migrants have travelled from Central America - mainly from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador - to the US border. Many say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries and plan to seek asylum in the US. In a new, lengthy statement, the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) saidthe boy, whose identity has not been officially confirmed, died at 23:48 local time,external(06:48 GMT) on 24 December. The cause of death is still unknown. After being detained in El Paso, Texas, he and his father were taken to a local processing centre, where they spent two days. They were then sent to El Paso Border Patrol Station, where they were held for another two days. On 22 December, they were transferred to Alamogordo Border Patrol Station, in neighbouring New Mexico. On Monday morning, an agent noticed that the boy ""was coughing and appeared to have glossy eyes"". He was taken with his father to a hospital where he was diagnosed with a common cold and given Tylenol (paracetamol). A river of people: The migrant caravan in pictures The boy had been taken to this hospital but later died While being evaluated for release, he was found to have a fever of 103F (39.4C) and held for more observation. He was released shortly afterwards with a prescription for an antibiotic and ibuprofen. The boy and his father were taken to a temporary site at the Highway 70 checkpoint, where the child received the medication. Two hours later, he vomited. His father declined further medical assistance, the CBP said, as the child had been feeling better. The child appeared lethargic at around 22:00, when he was sent back to the hospital. While being transported, the boy vomited and lost consciousness, and doctors at the hospital were unable to revive him. The CBP earlier said the boy died just after midnight. It did not explain why they were held for so long. His father remains in custody. The Associated Press news agency reportedthey had plans to go to Johnson City, Tennessee.,external Read more about the Jakelin Caal's death CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said the death was ""tragic"" and announced that the agency would conduct further medical checks on all children in custody, with a focus on those under the age of 10. He also said the CBP would review its policies and work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to improve custody conditions. Human rights groups criticised the CBP and Guatemala's foreign ministry called for an investigation. Texas Congressman Joaquin Castro called for a congressional investigation, saying the administration's policy of turning people away at the border ""is putting families and children in great danger"". The Trump administration has tried to deter asylum seekers from crossing the border irregularly between ports of entry, warning that they could face arrest, prosecution and deportation. But, at the same time, it is restricting access to those trying to cross through official ports of entry, creating a long wait for applicants.

"Campaigners had held protests demanding medicinal cannabis be allowed Thailand's parliament has voted to approve cannabis for medical use, with a key lawmaker calling it a ""New Year's gift"" to the Thai people. Recreational use will remain illegal. Marijuana was used in Thailand as a traditional medicine, until it was banned in the 1930s. South East Asia has some of the world's toughest penalties for drug usage or possession, and Thailand is the first in the region to allow medicinal marijuana. Why are so many countries now saying cannabis is OK? âItâs either cannabis or dieâ Thailand's junta-appointed parliament voted to amend the Narcotic Act of 1979 on Tuesday. It happened after an extra parliamentary session was arranged to push bills through before the New Year's holidays, according to Reuters news agency. The amendment will become law when it is published in the government gazette, The Bangkok Post reported. ""This is a New Year's gift from the National Legislative Assembly to the government and the Thai people,"" said Somchai Sawangkarn, chairman of the drafting committee, during the televised session. Consumers will be able to carry specified amounts necessary for medicinal purposes, if they have a prescription or recognised certificate, the Bangkok Post said. Licences for production and sale of the product will be strictly controlled. The paper said the law also applies to kratom, a South East Asian plant that acts as a stimulant. Across the world, countries have been revisiting their marijuana laws. Canada and Uruguay are among those to have legalised it, including for recreational use.  However South East Asia is known for having very harsh punishments for drugs-related charges. Earlier this year,a man in Malaysia was given a death sentencefor selling cannabis oil. Meanwhile, on the Indonesian island of Bali,a British man is facing up to 15 years in prisonafter being found with cannabis oil which he says he needed for medical reasons. The 45-year-old Pip Holmes, from Cornwall, says he asked a friend to send it to him while he was living in Bali to help his arthritis.

"Competitors in this year's edition of the Peter Pan Cup prepare to take the plunge Just short of 100 people braved near-freezing water to compete in the 155th Peter Pan Cup at London's Serpentine. The race, which began in 1864, sees members of the Serpentine Swimming Club swim a 100-yard course in Hyde Park. This year's race was won by Sakura Adams, 36, from London, who described her victory as ""absolutely amazing"". The competition acquired its name in 1903 when JM Barrie, who wrote Peter Pan, was a member of the swimming club and competed in the Christmas event. Robin Hunter-Coddington, the president of the club, says between 80 and 90 members competed this year, up from around a dozen in the early 1990s. Ms Adams, a 13-year member of the club, told the BBC it was a ""dream"" to win the cup - one that she is ""over the moon"" to have fulfilled. The temperature of the water was around 5C (41F)- with the temperature outside around 8C. The start of the race is staggered, depending on each competitor's handicap But while some take pleasure from the competitive side of the event, all at the club stress it is the community of swimmers that keeps them coming back. ""It's not only about the swim,"" says Ms Adams. ""It's seeing the hundreds of people on the Serp-side cheering us on. ""This is more than a club, it's a family and seeing everyone on Christmas morning is part of the family spirit, that's why we come out."" It is a family that requires commitment, however, with members having to compete in seven of the nine winter races to be eligible for the event on Christmas Day. This video can not be played Close to 100 swimmers brave the cold of Christmas morning to race in London's Serpentine Johanna Allberg, who swam for the Swedish national team in her youth, came over to London to watch the race. She had been hoping to be allowed to compete but was not allowed. Her husband, Jhnar, says: ""She swam in Sweden, I filmed her and sent the film to the club here and hoped she will get in but she didn't. ""She wanted to come and do this anyway so she came and swam in the lake before the race."" Sakura Adams, 36, won the 2018 race John Tierney, 54, from Kensington has been taking part in the race since 2007. ""You make friends,"" he says. ""Gradually you become more involved in the club, more involved in the people - it's a social scene. ""We have a race every Saturday so in some ways it's just another race for us - but it's a very special one."" After the race, each competitor is given a glass of port, while family members wander through the crowd handing out home-made biscuits. Then, after the crowds have dispersed, members head indoors to exchange gifts. ""It's very much a family club,"" says Mr Tierney. Elsewhere around the UK, people have also been braving chilly waters. In Porthcawl, more than 1,300 swimmers sported superhero costumes and swam in icy sea water for theChristmas morning swim,now in its 54th year. And in Bournemouth, bathers dressed up as Santa and his elves to take part in the annual white Christmas dip at Boscombe Pier to raise money for Macmillan Caring Locally. Meanwhile, in the West Midlands, people took part in the Christmas tradition of jumping into Blackroot Pool, in Sutton Coldfield. Ready... Steady... Argh!

"This video can not be played Yuni was forced to run from the water Indonesia says it will build a new warning system capable of detecting tsunamis caused by undersea landslides, days after giant waves triggered by a volcano killed at least 429 people. Installation of the new structure of buoys would start next year, a government agency told the BBC. It is thought that activity by the Anak Krakatau volcano set off undersea landslides, causing Saturday's tsunami. Officials say some 150 people are still missing and 16,000 have been displaced. A volcanologist explains eruption images The rock band swept away by deadly waves Rescue workers, helped by heavy lifting equipment, are going from village to village, sifting through the debris looking for survivors in badly hit areas on the islands of Sumatra and Java. The new mechanism would work by detecting the size of waves, Iyan Turyana, a spokesman for the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology, told the BBC's Indonesian service. The existing technology failed to predict the tsunami that devastated coastal towns around the Sunda Strait, between the islands of Sumatra and Java. The system has been set up to monitor earthquakes, but not undersea landslides and volcanic eruptions, which can also generate deadly waves. How reliable are tsunami warning systems? How volcanoes can trigger tsunamis Due to lack of funds, vandalism to the buoys and technical faults,there have been no operational tsunami warning buoys since 2012. But experts say that even if there had been buoys near the volcano, the warning time would have been minimal, given how close Anak Krakatau is to the shoreline. Coastal residents near the volcano have been warned to keep away from beaches amid fears continued volcanic eruptions of Anak Krakatau could trigger a new tsunami. Rescue efforts have been hampered by blocked roads and heavy rain, the BBC's Sameer Hashmi in Banten reports. There are concerns that contaminated water could spread diseases, our correspondent adds. Food, water, blankets and medical aid are slowly reaching remote areas, and thousands of people are in tents and temporary shelters like mosques or schools. ""Everybody is still in a state of panic,"" Atmadja Suhar, official in the city of Labuan, told Reuters news agency. ""We often have disasters, but not as bad as this... God willing we will rebuild."" The tsunami struck at 21:30 local time (14:30 GMT) during a local holiday, with few of the warning signals that might have come had it been generated by an earthquake. The waves destroyed hundreds of buildings, sweeping away cars and uprooting trees in several popular tourist destinations, including the Tanjung Lesung beach resort in west Java. Survivors' stories The child who came back from the dead after tsunami One of the most shocking and heart-rending stories to have emerged is that of rock band Seventeen, who were performing in the resort when waves came crashing through the stage and swept them away. Some residents in the Pandeglang region ran to a local mosque after the tsunami hit Indonesia is prone to tsunamis because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific Rim. In September, more than 2,000 people died when a powerful earthquake struck just off the central Indonesian island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu. On 26 December 2004, a series of huge waves triggered by a powerful earthquake in the Indian Ocean killed about 228,000 people in 13 countries, mostly in Indonesia. However, tsunamis caused by volcanic activity like this are less frequent. A town smashed to pulp in minutes Indian Ocean tsunami: Then and now In August 1883, Krakatoa underwent one of the most violent volcanic eruptions in recorded history: Massive tsunamis with waves of up to 41m killed more than 30,000 people Thousands more were killed by hot ash The eruptions were equivalent to 200 megatons of TNT - about 13,000 times the nuclear yield of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 The eruptions were heard thousands of kilometres away World temperatures dropped by more than 1C the following year The volcanic island virtually disappeared Anak Krakatau emerged in 1927 from the caldera that was formed during the eruption of Krakatoa How reliable are tsunami warning systems?

"Seven men and a woman are rescued from a dinghy Forty migrants, including two children, have been rescued from boats in five separate incidents on Christmas Day in the English Channel. Lifeboats and a coastguard helicopter intercepted a boat carrying 12 people and a child off the coast of Deal, Kent, at about 04:30 GMT. And a girl was one of eight who arrived in Folkestone at about 02:40 GMT. The Home Office said some of the migrants identified as Iraqis, Iranians and Afghans. The children will come under the care of social services, officials said. In other incidents, a Border Force cutter was deployed at 05:50 GMT to the Channel to help a dinghy travelling towards the UK with seven men and a woman onboard. Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? All of them have undergone a medical assessment and the adults have been transferred to immigration officials to be interviewed. French maritime officials tweeted two images of the rescue, which appeared to show at least some of the eight people were wearing life jackets. Allow Twitter content?

In French waters within the English Channel, nine migrants were also rescued and are now in the UK after their vessel's engine failed. And a lifeboat later spotted a rowing boat with two people on board about eight miles from Dover. It was heading for the UK. Criminal gangs The 13 people on board the boat off Deal were not thought to be wearing life jackets. A Home Office spokesman said: ""The evidence shows there is organised criminal gang activity behind illegal migration attempts by small boats across the Channel. ""We are working closely with the French and law enforcement partners to target these gangs, who exploit vulnerable people and put lives at risk."" HM Coastguard said in a statement: ""[We are] committed to safeguarding life around the seas and coastal areas of this country. ""We are only concerned with preservation of life, rescuing those in trouble and bringing them safely back to shore, where they will be handed over to the relevant partner emergency services or authorities."" As recently as Saturday, a boat containing 16 migrants, including two children, was intercepted by the French authorities as it travelled towards the UK. It follows numerous attempts through November and December in which people on boats, many of them claiming to be Iranian, were stopped crossing the Channel. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

"The National Archives building in Washington has been shut down by the dispute A partial US government shutdown over budget spending could continue right up to the opening of the next Congress on 3 January, a Trump aide has said. The shutdown began at midnight Friday after opposition Democrats resisted President Donald Trump's demand for $5bn (Â£4bn) for his Mexico border wall. Mr Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, suggested Democrats were ""beholden"" to their left wing. A Democratic senator said his party opposed any funding for the wall. Five big things from Trumpâs head-spinning week ""That's correct,"" Sen Jeff Merkley told an ABC news interviewer when asked if his party was not going to approve any money for the Trump administration's project. ""None."" Earlier, the party offered a sum of $1.3bn for border security. Mr Trump himself took to Twitter on Sunday to defend his plans for the border with Mexico. Allow Twitter content?

""This is what Washington looks like when you have a president who refuses to sort of go along to get along."" This video can not be played Testy exchanges between Trump, Pelosi and Schumer in the Oval Office In a separate interview for Fox News, he said he was waiting to hear from Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer about a new Republican offer, without specifying the sum. Speaking to ABC's This Week programme, Sen Merkley said a ""30-foot concrete wall"" and ""30-foot steel spikes"" were ""not the smart way"". His Republican Party controls both chambers of the outgoing Congress and the budget was indeed passed by the House on Thursday by 217 votes to 185. However, he needs to find 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate, where the Republicans currently have 51, so he needs to enlist the support of Democrats there. Nine of 15 federal departments, including State, Homeland Security, Transportation, Agriculture and Justice began partially shutting down after funding for them lapsed at midnight (05:00 GMT Saturday). Hundreds of thousands of federal employees will have to work unpaid or are furloughed, a kind of temporary leave. In practice, this means that: Customs and border staffwill keep working, although their pay will be delayed.Airportswill continue operating. About 80% ofNational Parksemployees will be sent home, and parks could close - although some may stay open with limited staff and facilities. About 90% ofhousing departmentworkers will take unpaid leave, which could delay loan processing and approvals. Most of theInternal Revenue Service(IRS) will be sent on unpaid leave, including those who assist taxpayers with queries. The Food and Drug Administration will pause routine inspections but ""continue vital activities"". The remaining 75% of the federal government is fully funded until September 2019 - so the defence, veterans affairs, labour and education departments are not affected. The current Congress reassembles on Thursday after the Christmas holiday. On 3 January, new members of Congress will be sworn in, having been elected in November's mid-term elections.

"This video can not be played A migrant rescue off the coast of Dover in November 2018 More than 100 migrants, claiming to be Iranian, have attempted the dangerous journey by small boat to the UK in the past three weeks. Why? On 23 November, shortly before sunrise, eight migrants were foundclinging to a dinghy in choppy watersoff the coast of Kent. They told their rescuers they had spent 12 hours at sea. It was a similar story the day before, when seven more were found in a boat just off the Dover coast - the same number of people had been pulled from an inflatable boat just a few hours earlier. Since 3 November, 101 migrants - including four children - have attempted the 21-mile journey across the Channel, one whichpolice have likenedto ""trying to cross the M25 at rush-hour on foot"". Border Force was called to Dover's marina on 22 November to deal with seven suspected migrants The Home Office has refused to publish official figures, but the BBC has established that at least that number have entered British shores since the start of the month. Without fail, the migrants have told officials they are Iranian. British and French authorities, under pressure to stem the rise in boat trips before a life is lost, face several questions. Why have so many boats set off for the coast of Kent? What can be done to stop it? And why are all the occupants apparently from the Middle Eastern country? The answer to the last question could lie 1,200 miles away in the Serbian capital of Belgrade. A French helicopter joined the rescue effort on 22 November Miodrag ÄakiÄ, chief executive of Refugee Aid Serbia, which monitors migration through the Balkans, believes migrants arriving in the UK are among the thousands who flew into Serbia after the country began offering visa-free access to Iranians in August last year. The move was ostensibly intended to increase tourism and trade between Iran, the world's 25th largest economy, and Serbia, the 90th. The visa scheme - which attracted allegations it was being abused by migrants seeking access to western Europe - ended on 17 October, by which time some 40,000 Iranians were said to have flown to the Balkan nation. It is unknown how many returned home, but according to the Associated Press, local media reported that direct flights from Tehran to Belgrade had been arriving full and returning empty. BBC reporter Simon Jones tweeted a picture of this boat after one rescue near Dover According to Info Park, a refugee support centre in Belgrade, Serbian police estimate the number of Iranians who failed to return at 12,000. Mr ÄakiÄ said it was believed within the refugee community that Iranians were using ""false passports and more complex methods"" to enter western Europe. They arrived better prepared for the journey ahead and would stay in hostels or hotels. Most refugees in Serbia slept in squats, while Iranians reportedly stayed in hotels Meanwhile, refugees from countries such as Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, travelled thousands of kilometres on foot and ended up living on the streets or in derelict buildings across Belgrade. Compared to fellow migrants, the Iranians looked ""more like tourists... they were kids in hoodies and jeans, with backpacks"", said Gordan Paunovic, of Info Park. ""Many of [the Iranians] were travelling with fake passports, which were costing between 3,000 to 6,000 euros in Istanbul. ""They didn't share the normal fate of refugees and migrants who have a very hard time in the Balkans. They would not be forced to sleep rough or go to refugee centres like the other people. ""They were here for a month, staying in hotels, and would find a smuggler to make other arrangements."" Iranians were said not to have shared ""the normal fate"" of migrants in the Balkans Iranians may be set apart from fellow migrants by their economic prosperity, yet for many living under the repressive regime, life is far from easy. Kaveh Kalantri, of the Iranian Association, which supports refugees in the UK, said a lack of freedom and human rights violations were driving some Iranians out. ""People get arrested if they have liberal or left-wing views, or if they are from religious minorities. A lot of people experience violence on a daily basis."" Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, it has been estimated that between 150,000 and 200,000 Iranians have left the country every year. In the past two years, Iranian citizens have made more UK asylum applications than any other nationality, according to Home Office figures. In 2017, they accounted for 9% of the 26,350 applications. ""Iranians coming to the UK is not unusual, but the way they are coming is,"" Mr Kalantri said. Tens of thousands of Iranians are said to have flown into Belgrade One theory as to why Iranians are choosing to risk their lives on boats stems from their comparative wealth - simply put, they can afford to pay smuggling gangs to get them onboard a vessel. Maya Konforti, of L'Auberge des Migrants, a refugee support group in Calais, described the attempted crossings as ""the speciality of Iranians"". ""Crossing by boat can only be done by people who have some money. Africans don't have any left by the time they arrive in Calais,"" she said. ""There is a new influx of Iranians arriving in Calais. They seem to be the only ones who both dare to do it and find the means to do so."" The Calais Jungle was dismantled in 2016, but migrants from across Africa and the Middle East continue to live in camps Mr ÄakiÄ suggested Iranians heading for Kent had entered the EU via Serbia. ""I don't see any other explanation. Serbia was the only country on the Balkan Route that had a significant number of Iranians."" Not everyone believes all the migrants are Iranian. Prof Adib-Moghaddam, from the Centre for Iranian Studies at SOAS University of London, suspects most of them are of Afghan origin. However, immigration specialist Emma Nawaz said she ""could not see what benefit they would achieve by falsely saying that they are Iranian"". Life and death on Mediterranean rescue boat Which industries employ European workers? How has EU migration changed the UK? Regardless, the ""surge"" in attempts is being fuelled by ""organised criminal and mafia networks"" in France, according to Ingrid Parrot, who works for the Maritime prefecture - the Border Force equivalent based in Cherbourg. She said there had been 30 attempted crossings in 2018, 12 in 2017, and 23 the year before. The majority failed because the vessels were too small - mostly canoes, dinghies and ""makeshift"" boats - but several attempts in 2018 have been made in pleasure crafts and speedboats, which have seen a spike in thefts. Ingrid Parrot says ""our fear is having bodies on the beaches"" Border Force officers have reported that ""access to small craft was getting easier and cheaper, creating more opportunities for criminals to involve themselves in the facilitation of clandestine entry and smuggling,"" according to an inspection of the South Coast ports,published this month. But understanding the true scale of the issue is complicated by the department's insistence that revealing the number of so-called ""clandestine entries"" made by boat would ""prejudice the operation of immigration controls"". Dover and Deal MP Charlie Elphicke, who described the rise in boat crossings as ""unprecedented"", said Border Force needed more resources, including investment in additional patrol boats to act as a deterrent. He said the number of migrants detected in lorries in Dover had ""plummeted"" by more than a third since the Calais Jungle was dismantled. But Bridget Chapman, of Kent Refugee Action Network, said the increase in boat crossings was a ""natural consequence of the hostile environment and tightening up the borders"". ""People are having to find ways that are more and more dangerous,"" she added. In the past 21 days, 12 groups of migrants have attempted the crossing from France to England Ashford MP and former immigration minister Damian Green said emphasis should be placed on ""actually knowing where people are coming from [and] breaking up the international criminal gangs that are actually behind this"". ""If we do need more resources, that's where they should go,"" he added. The Home Office said officials were focusing on ""identifying and dismantling the organised crime groups that facilitate illegal immigration"". Ms Parrot said the French were already ""strengthening measures"" to prevent attempted crossings, rather than focusing only on launching rescue operations. ""Our greatest fear is, on the one hand, a collision that leads to a loss of human life and, what's more, an accident at sea that we need to assist with,"" she said. ""On the other hand, our other fear is having injured people at sea and bodies on the beaches. We do not want it to come to that."" A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

"Mr Powell says gradual rate increases are the best way to balance risks The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates again, in spite of warnings from Donald Trump against the move. Officials at the US central bank voted to lift the Fed's key interest rate by 0.25%, to a target range of 2.25%-2.5%. But they also said future increases could come at a slower pace amid concerns about global growth. It comes after the US president on Tuesday warned the Fed against making ""yet another mistake"" in raising rates, urging it instead to ""feel the market"". He also urged the bank not to wind down a multi-billion dollar stimulus programme brought in after the financial crisis. Mr Trump - who appointed the Fed's chairman, Jerome Powell - has repeatedly blamed the central bank for unsettled markets and dismissed analysts who cite other factors, such as rising trade tariffs. But his remarks have put pressure on the Fed, as presidents generally avoid criticising the bank publicly, for fear of politicising the institution. Allow Twitter content?

At a press conference on Wednesday, Mr Powell defended the Fed's independence, saying that political pressure played ""no role whatsoever"" in its discussions or decisions. He added that the Fed had no plans to change its ongoing reduction of its portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. The bank has been gradually raising the benchmark rate since 2015, moving the US away from the ultra-low rates put in place during the financial crisis to spur economic activity. Wednesday's decision, which was widely expected, marked the ninth increase since 2015 and the fourth this year. However, the moves have made borrowing more expensive, contributing to slowdowns in some sectors, such as housing. And with economic growth expected to slow, some worry that further increases risk stifling economic activity. On Wednesday, officials did cut their forecasts for economic growth in 2019 to 2.3%, down from the 2.5% they anticipated in September. And estimates released by the bank showed most Fed members expect two rate increases in 2019 - not three, as previously forecast. It follows a downturn in US financial markets and concerns about slowing growth in the US and abroad. However, Mr Powell said the strength of the US economy - which is expected to grow about 3% this year - justified another rate rise, despite recent ""cross currents"" that have weakened the outlook. ""We think this move was appropriate for what is a very healthy economy,"" he said. ""Policy at this point does not need to be accommodative."" In its official statement, the Fed also said increases to its benchmark rate would help the US economy sustain its expansion, keeping the unemployment rate low and inflation near 2%. Shares sank after the announcement, reversing earlier gains. The Dow and S&P 500 closed about 1.5% lower, while the Nasdaq fell than 2%. In Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 was down 2.5% in early afternoon trade on Thursday, following Wall Street's lead. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index and South Korea's KOSPI index were both down more than 1%, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was down 0.85% in very late afternoon trade there. Analysts said investors might have been hoping for stronger signs from the Fed that it would raise rates more slowly in the future. ""Given the stock market declines and negative international economic news - recognised in the statement - this still points to quite a bit of confidence at the Fed in the ability of the US economy to withstand a few more rate hikes,"" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.

"Ken Munro demonstrated the hack to the BBC on a recent episode of Click Thousands of hot tubs can be hacked and controlled remotely because of a hole in their online security, BBC Click has revealed. Researchers showed the TV programme how an attacker could make the tubs hotter or colder, or control the pumps and lights via a laptop or smartphone. Vulnerable tubs are designed to let their owners control them with an app. But third-party wi-fi databases mean hackers can home in on specific tubs by using their GPS location data. Balboa Water Group (BWG), which runs the affected system, has now pledged to introduce a more robust security system for owners and said the problem would be fixed by the end of February. Pen Test Partners - the UK security company that carried out the research - warned that hot tubs were not the only household items at risk. Founder Ken Munro said that many Christmas gifts people would receive this year would connect to the internet and offer remote control through apps. ""Manufacturers still are not taking security seriously enough, and until they do consumers have to be very vigilant,"" he said. ""We recommend users reset any default passwords the device has immediately with a unique one of their own."" VTech flags tablet flaw after BBC Watchdog probe Child-tracking smartwatches are 'easy to hack' Security camera sends video to wrong user In the case of the hot tubs, the researchers found that information found on public resources, known as ""wardriving databases"", could be used to hijack the equipment without the need for any other kind of authentication. Public databases contain enough details to carry out the hack (this image has been edited to remove some information) BWG told the BBC that it had been ""surprised"" to learn of the flaw as its app had been available for five years during which users had not reported any problems. It said it was working with more than 1,000 owners in the UK and others globally to set up a system of individual usernames and passwords to secure the online controls. It said it had previously opted not to do so because it had wanted to ""allow for simple and easy use and activation"" by homeowners. Mr Munro said this had been ""irresponsible"". ""It takes away consumer choice and it takes away users' right to privacy and security,"" he explained. The researcher acknowledged that it was not the most serious internet-of-things vulnerability in the world, but said it was still worth bringing to the public's attention. ""Blowers are only turned on when someone is in the tub, so a hacker could figure out if you're in the tub at the time, which is creepy,"" he explained.

"This video can not be played The Pope gave his fifth Christmas message from the Vatican's Saint Peter's Bascilica balcony The Pope has used his annual Christmas message to appeal for peace in conflict zones including Yemen and Syria. The two countries have both been ravaged by civil war for years, pushing their people into humanitarian crises. ""My wish for a happy Christmas is a wish for fraternity. Fraternity among individuals of every nation and culture,"" Pope Francis said on Tuesday. The Pontiff was giving his yearly ""Urbi et Orbi"" (To the City and to the World) address in the Vatican. ""My thoughts turn to Yemen, in the hope that the truce brokered by the international community may finally bring relief to all those children and people exhausted by war and famine,"" he said from the balcony of St Peter's Basilica, addressing the square below. He also said he hoped the international community would ""work decisively for a political solution"" in Syria - a country that is approaching its eighth year of civil war. ""So that the Syrian people, especially all those who were forced to leave their own lands and seek refuge elsewhere, can return to live in peace in their own country,"" he added. The United Nations says more than 6 million civilians have been displaced there since the war there began. His address also alluded to worldwide tensions over migration, saying that God wanted ""love, acceptance, respect"" throughout all humanity. ""Our differences, then, are not a detriment or a danger - they are a source of richness,"" he said. Church Christmas messages highlight poverty Profile: Pope Francis Pope calls for end to Syria 'carnage' Pope Francis revealed his hope for renewed talks between the Israelis and Palestinians to ""undertake a journey of peace that can put an end to a conflict that for over 70 years has lacerated the land chosen by the Lord to show his face of love"". James Reynolds, BBC News in Rome On Christmas Day, a Pope can enjoy the luxury of the world's stage largely to himself. At mid-day, Vatican bands heralded Francis' entrance onto the balcony of St Peter's Basilica. The Pope addressed the pilgrims and tourists in the square below, turning the pages of his speech carefully as he called for the resolution of many of the world's conflicts. He also sent a message to minority Christian communities who are living in what he called hostile situations. In order to reinforce this thought, Francis has sent his Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, to Iraq to hold festive services with that country's small Christian population. The traditional Christmas address is a short breather from some of the problems facing the Pope. This year, he has been criticised for his failure to understand the scope of the clerical sexual abuse crisis. Francis has called bishops from around the world to Rome in February 2019 to discuss how the church might respond. Christians gathered in Damascus on 23 December to watch a Christmas tree lighting The 82-year-old is the first Pope from Latin America - a region he also referenced in his annual address, calling for political reconciliation in Nicaragua and Venezuela. The Pontiff also referenced Ukraine, as well as the millions of people displaced in Africa. The address comes one day after Pope Francis' traditional Christmas Eve message,in which he condemned the huge divide between the world's rich and poor. In his homily, Pope Francis said the birth of Christ pointed to a new way to live ""not by devouring and hoarding, but by sharing and giving"". He continued: ""Let us ask ourselves: Do I really need all these material objects and complicated recipes for living? Can I manage without all these unnecessary extras and live a life of greater simplicity? The Pope has made highlighting the plight of the poor a key theme of his papacy.

"Martha Erika Alonso and Rafael Moreno Valle hold hands during an official ceremony in Puebla in this archive photo A Mexican governor who was sworn in earlier this month and her senator husband have died in a helicopter crash in the central state of Puebla. The aircraft carrying Puebla Gov Martha Erika Alonso and Sen Rafael Moreno Valle came down shortly after it took off. The two pilots were killed. Reports say a third passenger also died. Officials say the helicopter may have suffered an unspecified failure. An investigation has been opened. Ms Alonso, 45, had been sworn in on 14 December as Puebla's first female governor, after hotly contested polls. Mr Moreno, 50, had served as Puebla's governor between 2011 and 2017. The privately-owned Agusta helicopter bound to Mexico City lost contact with air traffic control and crashed 10 minutes after take-off, Security Minister Alfonso Durazo said. The accident happened on Monday at 14:50 local time (20:50 GMT) in the area of Santa MarÃ­a Coronango, near the state capital of Puebla, Mexico's second-largest city. Mexico country profile The aircraft crashed 10 minutes after take-off Officials say they believe the helicopter may have suffered an unspecified failure ""At this point, there's no evidence that could lead us to conclude that the cause was not related to how the [helicopter] was functioning,"" Mr Durazo told journalists. President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador said an investigation would be launched to establish ""the truth"" about what caused the crash. In a tweet (in Spanish), he expressed ""deepest condolences"" to the relatives of the two politicians. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The accident comes after a number of high-profile deaths in helicopter crashes over the years in Mexico,including Interior Minister Francisco Blake Mora in 2011, the BBC's Will Grant reports. Earlier this year, 13 people died when a minister's helicopter crashed into a crowd, although the minister himself survived, our correspondent says. Ms Alonso was a member of the centre-right PAN party. In elections in July, she narrowly beat Manuel Barbosa, President LÃ³pez Obrador's favoured candidate for the governorship of one of Mexico's most populous states. Puebla's parliament will now have to appoint an interim governor until new elections are held. Martha Erika Alonso was sworn in as Puebla's governor 10 days before the crash President LÃ³pez Obrador's leftist Morena party had alleged widespread irregularities and fraud in the poll, and the final results had to be validated by an electoral tribunal. Mr Barbosa said the deaths were a ""tragedy that no-one wishes to anyone"", adding: ""I am shocked and in mourning. My sympathies to their loved ones. This is not the time to make any speculation."" Rafael Moreno Valle was a member of the PAN in the Senate. Some opposition politicians called for an independent investigation into the crash. The pilots have been identified as Capt Roberto Cope and First Officer Marco Antonio Tavera. It is presumed that a fifth passenger was on board, but no details have been released.

"Children from around the US called to speak to the president and his wife on Christmas Eve There are some questions no-one should ever ask. ""What does this red button do?"" ""What do people say about me?"" ""Do you believe in Santa Claus?"" Now weallknow Santa Claus exists. But for some reason, the US president threw doubt on this when speaking to one child on Christmas Eve. The scene was the State Dining Room in the White House. Donald Trump and his wife Melania were taking calls from American children as the couple sat under two gargantuan Christmas trees. All the children who called in had done so in the hope of getting through to Norad,the government agency that tracks Santa's movements around the world at Christmas,external(that is still operating despite a partial government shutdown). Some of those calls were patched through to Mr Trump and his wife, and thanks to pool reporter Kevin Diaz, we know some of what the president said. This is how Diaz reported the exchange: Trump (in booming voice) to a kid named Collman:""Hello, is this Collman? Merry Christmas. How are you? How old are you?.... Are you doing well in school? Are you still a believer in Santa?"" Footage of the incident circulating on social media shows Mr Trump then telling the child: ""Because at seven, it's marginal, right?"" ""Collman"", it now emerges, is a seven-year-old girl from South Carolina,externalnamed Collman Lloyd, who told the Post and Courier newspaper she didn't know what ""marginal"" meant. It is not clear why Mr Trump asked this particular question, because, of course, Santa's existence is beyond dispute.

"Seven men and a woman are rescued from a dinghy Forty migrants, including two children, have been rescued from boats in five separate incidents on Christmas Day in the English Channel. Lifeboats and a coastguard helicopter intercepted a boat carrying 12 people and a child off the coast of Deal, Kent, at about 04:30 GMT. And a girl was one of eight who arrived in Folkestone at about 02:40 GMT. The Home Office said some of the migrants identified as Iraqis, Iranians and Afghans. The children will come under the care of social services, officials said. In other incidents, a Border Force cutter was deployed at 05:50 GMT to the Channel to help a dinghy travelling towards the UK with seven men and a woman onboard. Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? All of them have undergone a medical assessment and the adults have been transferred to immigration officials to be interviewed. French maritime officials tweeted two images of the rescue, which appeared to show at least some of the eight people were wearing life jackets. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Members of the Royal Family greeted well-wishers after attending the Christmas Day church service The Royal Family have greeted hundreds of well-wishers after attending the Christmas Day church service at Sandringham. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were all smiles as they left the service on the Queen's estate in Norfolk. Prince Charles attended but the Duchess of Cornwall missed church due to a heavy cold. The Duke of Edinburgh also stayed home - but is said to be in good health. Meghan and Prince Harry greet the crowds as they leave the church service Speaking to members of the crowd, Catherine revealed her children had woken her up very early The Duchess of Cambridge and the Duchess of Sussex appeared to be on friendly terms Catherine and Meghan, who is pregnant with her and Prince Harry's first child, walked side by side to church, chatting and smiling. The pair have been the subject of media reports of a rift. Many of those gathered had brought bouquets of flowers and called out ""Merry Christmas"" as the royal party went past. By BBC correspondent Charlotte Gallagher There were huge cheers from the crowd when the royal family arrived for the morning's church service - especially for the Queen. The queen was driven there by a chauffeur while the rest of the family walked up and greeted people when they went past. Some well wishers were waving Stars and Stripes flags for the Duchess of Sussex. Despite newspaper reports about rifts and rivalry, the royals looked happy and relaxed with Princes William and Harry and their wives walking into church together. Afterwards the Duchess of Cambridge told one member of the crowd that like many parents her children had woken her very early on Christmas morning. After the service, Meghan hugged one of her former Instagram followers, who she spotted in the crowd. Jessica Daniels, 17, from Peterborough, said it was an ""amazing"" experience to meet the duchess, who she'd been following since watching her on TV's Suits. ""There were a group of us girls on social media she became kind of close with and interacted a lot online. ""This is the first time I've met her, she just said 'it's so lovely to meet you, incredible to finally see you' and she was asking how we all are and if we're still talking and supporting each other.""

"The Archbishop of Canterbury has urged the UK to forget the ""languages of hatred, tribalism [and] rivalry"" in his Christmas Day sermon. The Most Reverend Justin Welby told his congregation to aim for peace and unity at a time of challenge and discord. While he did not specifically mention the UK's political future, he stressed the importance of the language of love replacing the language of conflict. ""God's language of love is exclusive,"" he said at Canterbury Cathedral. Goodwill theme to Queen's Christmas address The Pope calls for peace in conflict zones Other church leaders used their Christmas messages to highlight social action fighting homelessness and poverty. Bishop of London the Right Reverend Dame Sarah Mullally said 33,000 Church of England ""social action"" projects included food banks, night shelters and dementia cafes. Right Rev Dame Sarah Mullally highlighted the Church of England's social projects The leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, used his homily to thank volunteers working to help the needy. Both leaders acknowledged that many people faced challenging times and that society had become more divided. May and Corbyn deliver Christmas messages Danny Dyer to deliver C4 Christmas message Speaking before delivering her first Christmas midnight service since becoming the first woman Bishop of London, Bishop Mullally told the BBC the UK was facing ""a lot of turbulence"". ""Debates in politics around the EU referendum have created division,"" she said. ""My belief is that diversity creates strong community; division weakens it."" But she said the Church had been working across generations and social groups and that churches working together could help in ""breaking down barriers... so we create stable communities"". ""The Church needs to speak confidently about faith in Jesus Christ but it also needs to reflect the compassion we see in God and Jesus which is why, not just in London but right across the country, churches are involved in social action projects,"" said Bishop Mullally. ""[There are] something like 33,000 social action projects across the Church of England; people setting up food banks, credit unions, dementia cafes and night shelters demonstrating the love of God."" Cardinal Nichols, pictured conducting Mass in April 2017, said volunteers would be ready if hardship increased Inhis homily, the Archbishop of Westminster,external, Cardinal Nichols, pointed to ""difficult times, times of uncertainty and an absence of consensus"". But he also spoke of ""countless acts of kindness"", saying: ""Our society is full of generosity and compassion, although we do not shout about it."" ""In our parishes, for example, there are over 130 projects responding to food poverty and homelessness,"" he told worshippers at Westminster Cathedral. ""So many of our schools provide breakfasts and vouchers for the most needy. Volunteers constantly come forward... If, in the coming year, hardship increases, then we are ready to help in every way we can."" Around the country, bishops used Christmas messages to urge people to come together. Graham Usher, the Bishop of Dudley, said: ""Our current political debates... put up barriers between those who voted in different ways. ""Our country needs, more than ever, to seek grace and generosity in our political conversation so that there are not winners and losers, just the flourishing of all."" Bishop of Bath and Wells Peter Hancock pointed out that Christmas is ""a joyful time but for many people it's a tough time and lonely time too"".

"Ken Munro demonstrated the hack to the BBC on a recent episode of Click Thousands of hot tubs can be hacked and controlled remotely because of a hole in their online security, BBC Click has revealed. Researchers showed the TV programme how an attacker could make the tubs hotter or colder, or control the pumps and lights via a laptop or smartphone. Vulnerable tubs are designed to let their owners control them with an app. But third-party wi-fi databases mean hackers can home in on specific tubs by using their GPS location data. Balboa Water Group (BWG), which runs the affected system, has now pledged to introduce a more robust security system for owners and said the problem would be fixed by the end of February. Pen Test Partners - the UK security company that carried out the research - warned that hot tubs were not the only household items at risk. Founder Ken Munro said that many Christmas gifts people would receive this year would connect to the internet and offer remote control through apps. ""Manufacturers still are not taking security seriously enough, and until they do consumers have to be very vigilant,"" he said. ""We recommend users reset any default passwords the device has immediately with a unique one of their own."" VTech flags tablet flaw after BBC Watchdog probe Child-tracking smartwatches are 'easy to hack' Security camera sends video to wrong user In the case of the hot tubs, the researchers found that information found on public resources, known as ""wardriving databases"", could be used to hijack the equipment without the need for any other kind of authentication. Public databases contain enough details to carry out the hack (this image has been edited to remove some information) BWG told the BBC that it had been ""surprised"" to learn of the flaw as its app had been available for five years during which users had not reported any problems. It said it was working with more than 1,000 owners in the UK and others globally to set up a system of individual usernames and passwords to secure the online controls. It said it had previously opted not to do so because it had wanted to ""allow for simple and easy use and activation"" by homeowners. Mr Munro said this had been ""irresponsible"". ""It takes away consumer choice and it takes away users' right to privacy and security,"" he explained. The researcher acknowledged that it was not the most serious internet-of-things vulnerability in the world, but said it was still worth bringing to the public's attention. ""Blowers are only turned on when someone is in the tub, so a hacker could figure out if you're in the tub at the time, which is creepy,"" he explained. ""Consumer IoT security is not in a good place. These findings underline that.""

"Martha Erika Alonso and Rafael Moreno Valle hold hands during an official ceremony in Puebla in this archive photo A Mexican governor who was sworn in earlier this month and her senator husband have died in a helicopter crash in the central state of Puebla. The aircraft carrying Puebla Gov Martha Erika Alonso and Sen Rafael Moreno Valle came down shortly after it took off. The two pilots were killed. Reports say a third passenger also died. Officials say the helicopter may have suffered an unspecified failure. An investigation has been opened. Ms Alonso, 45, had been sworn in on 14 December as Puebla's first female governor, after hotly contested polls. Mr Moreno, 50, had served as Puebla's governor between 2011 and 2017. The privately-owned Agusta helicopter bound to Mexico City lost contact with air traffic control and crashed 10 minutes after take-off, Security Minister Alfonso Durazo said. The accident happened on Monday at 14:50 local time (20:50 GMT) in the area of Santa MarÃ­a Coronango, near the state capital of Puebla, Mexico's second-largest city. Mexico country profile The aircraft crashed 10 minutes after take-off Officials say they believe the helicopter may have suffered an unspecified failure ""At this point, there's no evidence that could lead us to conclude that the cause was not related to how the [helicopter] was functioning,"" Mr Durazo told journalists. President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador said an investigation would be launched to establish ""the truth"" about what caused the crash. In a tweet (in Spanish), he expressed ""deepest condolences"" to the relatives of the two politicians. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The accident comes after a number of high-profile deaths in helicopter crashes over the years in Mexico,including Interior Minister Francisco Blake Mora in 2011, the BBC's Will Grant reports. Earlier this year, 13 people died when a minister's helicopter crashed into a crowd, although the minister himself survived, our correspondent says. Ms Alonso was a member of the centre-right PAN party. In elections in July, she narrowly beat Manuel Barbosa, President LÃ³pez Obrador's favoured candidate for the governorship of one of Mexico's most populous states. Puebla's parliament will now have to appoint an interim governor until new elections are held. Martha Erika Alonso was sworn in as Puebla's governor 10 days before the crash President LÃ³pez Obrador's leftist Morena party had alleged widespread irregularities and fraud in the poll, and the final results had to be validated by an electoral tribunal. Mr Barbosa said the deaths were a ""tragedy that no-one wishes to anyone"", adding: ""I am shocked and in mourning. My sympathies to their loved ones. This is not the time to make any speculation."" Rafael Moreno Valle was a member of the PAN in the Senate. Some opposition politicians called for an independent investigation into the crash. The pilots have been identified as Capt Roberto Cope and First Officer Marco Antonio Tavera. It is presumed that a fifth passenger was on board, but no details have been released.

"Alex Alley already hold records for sailing around the Isle of Wight and the length of Britain A sailor has embarked on a crowd-funded attempt to break a circumnavigation record. Alex Alley, 48, from Hampshire, aims to become the fastest mariner to make the solo trip in a Class40 boat. He raised the money by selling 5cm squares on the side of the yacht Pixel Flyer and corresponding pixels on his website. He expected ""the highest highs and lowest lows"" during five months at sea. Mr Alley has been based at Haslar Marina in Gosport. He sailed out of Gosport on Christmas Eve and is due to cross the official start line in the English Channel on Christmas Day. Alex Alley sailed out of Gosport Harbour on Christmas Eve Speaking before embarking, he said he was ""very excited, nervous and anxious"". ""There is a record to be had - there will be a whole lot of highest highs and lowest lows. ""I love the challenge of seeing what I'm capable of."" The idea of selling pixels dates back to theMillion Dollar Homepagein 2005 which student Alex Tew sold pixels on a webpage to fund his university place. Mr Alley said people had uploaded company logos to fill the ""pixels"" on the side of the yacht, but also personal messages and family photographs. ""One girl has uploaded a picture of her father who passed away - she said 'Dad always wanted to sail around the world, now he can',"" he said. The current record, set by Chinese sailor Guo Chuan, stands at 137 days, 20 hours 1 minute and 57 seconds. Another solo round-the-world sailor Susie Goodall wasrescued earlier this monthafter capsizing 2,000 miles west of Cape Horn.

"The security force operation to free workers took seven hours Afghan officials say 43 people have died in a suicide and gun attack on a government compound in Kabul. They say 25 others were injured during Monday's siege at the Afghan ministry of public works in the capital. Hundreds of employees were trapped inside the building at the time - and some reportedly jumped to safety. It is not immediately clear who carried out the attack. Both the Islamic State group and Taliban have carried similar attacks in the past. The incident reportedly started with a suicide car bomb blast near the building's entrance, before gunmen stormed inside. People in nearby buildings reportedly locked themselves in their offices for safety, a witness told the Reuters news agency. Trump's withdrawal 'ignores dangerous threat' Why Afghanistan is more dangerous than ever Interior ministry spokesman Najib Danish said that more than 350 people were eventually freed from the public works office. He warned the numbers of dead and injured may change, and said an Afghan police officer was among those killed. Three attackers were also shot dead. The violence comes after a tumultuous few days for Afghanistan's political stability. Last week it was reported that the US planned to drastically reduce its military presence in the country, shortly after Mr Trump announced an entire withdrawal from Syria. On Sunday, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani replaced his defence and interior ministers with hard-line opponents of the Taliban who used to work for the country's intelligence agency.

" Told by David Lemke Nguyen Quoc Tuy was born in 1970 or 1971 in Sa Dec, a small town in southern Vietnam’s Mekong Delta. Tuy - pronounced two-ee - was handed over to the local church, which doubled as an orphanage, when he was just seven days old. The protracted and bloody Vietnam War - called the American War by the Vietnamese - was still raging in the swampy delta region to the south of Ho Chi Minh City, or Saigon, as it was called then. Tuy (r) with the nunsbefore he developed polio When he was one, Tuy contracted the polio virus from contaminated water. The virus attacked the muscles in his legs and left his lower limbs under-developed. By the time he was three, he was moved to a better-equipped orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City and, because of his health condition, was soon put on an adoption list. Thousands of miles away, a couple on the west coast of the United States were preparing to give him a new home. Tuy’s future American parents, Kristin and Thomas Buckner, had decided to create a multi-cultural family and give “forgotten” youngsters a chance to thrive. They already had a biological child, Paul, and then began adopting children from around the world. “We wanted a large family,” says Thomas, “but at that time, there was a lot of talk about the planet’s growing population. We decided to bring only one kid into the world ourselves, because there were so many other children needing families.” Kristin - now known by her maiden name, Brockschmidt, after she and Thomas divorced - says the size of their family was created as much by “blind luck” as any firm philosophy or plan. “It’s a little-known fact that, just as you can accidentally become pregnant and have a surprise baby, you can also accidentally find yourself adopting,” she jokes. “In Vietnam, Tuy was listed as abandoned. They said no-one had visited him since he was placed at the orphanage. “He was thought to be about three years old,” she explains, recalling her conversations with a US adoption agency more than 40 years ago. Thomas says Tuy only ended up with his family - in the autumn of 1974 - because their plans to adopt another Vietnamese boy were postponed. “We had wanted to take a child we were going to call Robin, but there were delays due to his mental disability. In the meantime, we agreed to take another boy - that boy was Tuy.” Tuy became the fourth Buckner sibling. Two more children - including Robin - were to follow. Tuy laughs, “We were the Buckner Bunch, mimicking the classic American TV show, The Brady Bunch.” Thomas and Tuy hang a Christmas stocking Tuy’s early days in Berkeley, northern California, were not easy. His anxieties had been well noted by staff at the orphanage, and being in a new environment did little to allay his fears. Instinctively, Tuy would either save or hide every bit of food he was given. Kristin with Tuy “He kept extra food in a bag that a family friend made for him, and he carried that bag wherever he went,” says Kristin. “He also hid the toys he wanted to keep track of in heater vents, so he could find them later. “For the first six months, I carried him everywhere to make him feel secure.” Gradually, Tuy began to open up and trust his new parents and siblings. He also became more confident as he overcame the daily physical challenges he faced because of the lack of muscles in his legs. Kristin recalls a visit to a park in the hills above Berkeley, when Tuy was watching his brothers and sisters having fun in a playground. She observed as he crawled over to the ladder of a slide, climbed up by himself, looked around from the top and then slid down on his own. “It was at that moment I knew he would be OK, and that challenges for Tuy were just things to overcome.” Tuy had to have major corrective surgery because his legs began to grow but the muscles and nerves did not. Tuy's corrective surgery He got around on crutches and leg braces, picked up spoken English quickly, and before turning six had learned how to hike, bike, climb and ski using outriggers (forearm crutches with ski tips mounted to the base). Yet as Tuy entered California’s education system, new obstacles impeded his progress. Teachers assumed he was lazy. “I’d read a sentence in class, and then I’d be done,” says Tuy. Both Kristin and Thomas were perplexed as to why Tuy fell behind in basic reading. “One night my mom had a theory,” says Tuy. “She came into my room and handed me one of my reading books upside down. I could read it fine. “That’s how we went on to discover that I was severely dyslexic.” With affection, his siblings describe their brother as “diabolically intelligent”. “When all the other kids went out to play, I had to do something else,” says Tuy. “I got really good at chess. I started carving and whittling wood. I read almanacs like you wouldn’t believe - just to have conversation material at dinner time.” But Tuy’s interest in building things and problem-solving gradually affected his performance in high school. “He would take wire coat-hangers from home and skip math classes to make bar puzzles - the type you have to physically manipulate to solve,” says Kristin. “Though this impressed his friends, his grades in the missing classes were less impressive. It became clear that a big public high school didn’t give him the support or opportunities to learn that he was going to need.” So, after a spell at a local private school in nearby Oakland, Tuy moved out of the family home. He travelled more than 2,000 miles to Big Island in Hawaii - where he had spent summers with his family - to attend a much smaller private boarding school. There, Tuy felt more independent - and island life suited him. He identified so strongly with Hawaiian culture that he used to pass himself off as an islander. He even set up a shop in the school dormitory selling noodles, sweets and fizzy drinks to make some cash on the side. Tuy readily admits he became aimless and easily distracted as a young adult. But in 1991, he got the chance to travel to Vietnam with Kristin. His parents had always been open about where he had come from and Kristin had taken him on previous trips to Asia, but this was the first time since the war that they - as American civilians - had the opportunity to visit Vietnam. Kristin was helping to organise the first peace walk in Vietnam to protest against America’s trade embargo. The trip mixed US war veterans with peace workers and returning overseas Vietnamese. “In 1991, Vietnam was a totally different place compared to today,” says Tuy. “It’s hard to describe, but there’s something about returning to your country. Up until then, Vietnam wasn’t really a conscious feeling for me. But as we landed, the experience became overwhelming. “The Hanoi airport was really small at the time. You walked from the plane to the terminal. I stopped half-way and kissed the ground. It was just something I felt I had to do.” Planting a peace pole in Ho Chi Minh City Of all the planned marches, perhaps the strangest one was in front of two curious monkey families on Monkey Island - one of the 1,600 islands in Ha Long Bay, a Unesco heritage site. Tuy remembers how they all had dinner that evening on the bay’s main island of Cat Ba. Ha Long Bay, Vietnam “We were all sitting at our tables, and our Vietnamese hosts, including an army general, invited me to join them to eat. “We all ended up drinking quite a lot. I had a cassette of the soundtrack to the Robin Williams’ film - Good Morning Vietnam. I convinced them to play that, sitting with this general and getting drunk off cheap Russian alcohol. “It was bizarre and awesome all at once.” Tuy and Kristin had hoped to head into the Mekong Delta - Tuy’s birthplace - after the peace walks were over, but travel restrictions against foreigners meant that was impossible. The visit had a lasting effect on Tuy. He felt that a whole new world had opened up to him. Back in the US, Tuy dived head first into as much Vietnamese culture as he could - including getting to know the adopted Vietnamese children of some friends of his parents. The DeBolt family - also based in northern California - became widely known in the US for raising a large family of adopted children, seven of whom were disabled and from Vietnam. One of those was among the thousands of babies and children who were airlifted out of Vietnam in the last days of the war. They went on to be adopted by families in the US, Canada, Australia and Europe. Tuy fitted right in. He became close friends with Ly, Tich and David. They spent their time hanging out, playing a Vietnamese card game called Tin Lin, eating Vietnamese food and drinking café sua da (iced coffee with plenty of sweetened milk). So in 1993, when Ly was flying to Vietnam to get married, Tuy agreed to join his friends for a three-month stay. This time, he would be able to travel within Vietnam more freely than he had done with the 1991 peace marchers. He also had unfinished business in the Mekong Delta. “I just wanted to see the town of Sa Dec and the first orphanage I had been put in,” he says. “I hoped to simply thank the nuns there and, in a way, seeing the people of that region would be like seeing my mother and father.” Tuy and his friends stayed at a hotel in Ho Chi Minh City, and the owners - a retired army officer and his wife - offered to help rent a car and drive Tuy, Tich and David into the remote Mekong. Bad roads and washed-out bridges meant the journey was much more difficult than they’d imagined. Travelling through Vietnam was not easy, and for a disabled person it was just that much harder. So it was decided that the hotel owners would venture ahead with Tuy’s papers by boat to Sa Dec, to visit the orphanage. A few hours later, they returned with news. The nun who had signed Tuy’s paperwork - Sister Desiree - was now living in the nearby city of Can Tho. Finding her proved to be relatively easy. While she couldn’t offer any information about his parents, she did offer to be his godmother. David and Tuy meet Sister Desiree (r) “Sister Desiree was awesome,” says Tuy. “I didn’t think I was going to find anyone - so just finding the nun who’d signed the birth certificate was incredible.” For the next two and a half months, Tuy stayed with his friends in Da Nang, a coastal city in central Vietnam. He was having a great time, but felt torn. His desire to see Sa Dec for himself remained strong, and so he decided to make one more attempt to get there before leaving Vietnam, to finally close that chapter of his life. Three days before his flight back to the US, Tuy left Ho Chi Minh City once again with his friends and the same hotel owners. This time, after more than five hours of driving on pothole-riddled roads, they made it. The arrival of this unusual group of disabled Vietnamese-Americans created an immediate buzz. The local market almost stopped trading, as people began to crowd around the front gates of the orphanage. Tuy remembers saying hello to the children, and sitting on the cracked concrete benches looking at the faded orange paint on the walls. The nuns presented Tuy with a ledger of all the orphans who had stayed with them. Turning the pages, Tuy arrived at entry 313 and saw his baby photo with the name Nguyen Quoc Tuy - the same as on his birth certificate. Written underneath was: “mother/father - unknown”. Tuy's entry in the ledger “I thought that was astonishing, that they still had these records and my name in Vietnamese was indeed the correct one,” says Tuy. Outside, the excitement on the street was growing. “Some in the crowd outside had started to come into the church courtyard to get a look. My story was spreading like wildfire through Sa Dec.” At one point, a woman came into the church - the nuns clearly knew her. She was introduced to Tuy as Phien, and was shown the baby photo in the ledger. Tuy was told that in the orphanage, older children were put in charge of the younger ones. Phien, it turned out, had cared for him when she was seven years old. It was pure coincidence that she was in town that day. She’d been heading to hospital to see a sick relative, but had stopped at the orphanage to visit the nuns. Phien began to speak quite animatedly to the nuns - but Tuy didn't speak Vietnamese and had no idea what was being said. David, Tuy’s Vietnamese friend from the DeBolt family, began to interpret. And what he began to reveal, Tuy says, made “my head feel like it was boiling”. Phien, it turned out, had information about Tuy’s mother. She was still alive. I just wanted to see the town of Sa Dec and the first orphanage I had been put in,” he says. “I hoped to simply thank the nuns there and, in a way, seeing the people of that region would be like seeing my mother and father.” Tuy and his friends stayed at a hotel in Ho Chi Minh City, and the owners - a retired army officer and his wife - offered to help rent a car and drive Tuy, Tich and David into the remote Mekong. Bad roads and washed-out bridges meant the journey was much more difficult than they’d imagined. Travelling through Vietnam was not easy, and for a disabled person it was just that much harder. So it was decided that the hotel owners would venture ahead with Tuy’s papers by boat to Sa Dec, to visit the orphanage. A few hours later, they returned with news. The nun who had signed Tuy’s paperwork - Sister Desiree - was now living in the nearby city of Can Tho. Finding her proved to be relatively easy. While she couldn’t offer any information about his parents, she did offer to be his godmother.

And what he began to reveal, Tuy says, made “my head feel like it was boiling”. Phien, it turned out, had information about Tuy’s mother. She was still alive. “She lives quite far away and it may take a while, but she can go and bring her back here to meet you,” David told him. “I was going numb,” says Tuy. “I had no idea how long I had to wait. I was happy, scared and sad. “’Who is she? Why is she? What is she?’ I thought. ‘What will it take to prove to her I am who I am, or vice versa? Is it a scam to take advantage of me? If it is, what do I do? If it isn’t, how will I handle it?’” As they waited, Tuy watched as his friends ate lunch. Afterwards they gathered on the front steps of the church. “Time was slow, and yet also a blur,” Tuy says. “I remember just looking back and forth across the sea of faces in the gathered crowd.” Eventually, a commotion began at the gates. What seemed to be the town’s entire population was parting for a small group of people inching their way forward. When the group reached the front, a small old lady wearing glasses popped out in front of Tuy. In a rush, Tuy blurted out the sentence in Vietnamese that his friends had been trying to teach him. “Con trai của mẹ đã xa nhà 20 năm nhưng bây giờ con ấy đã trở về.” In English it translates as, “Your son has been gone for 20 years, but now he has returned.” There was a moment of silence, before the people at the front of the crowd started gesturing to Tuy. “People began pointing at a second lady who had stepped out from behind the first one,” he says. “The lady I spoke to first wasn’t the right one!” “It was dead quiet, until someone in the crowd yelled out, ‘So which one is your kid?’” says Tuy’s friend Tich. “People laughed, and that broke the tension.” The second woman walked over to Tuy and grabbed him by the back of the head, pulling him down to her level. She parted his hair, which at that time was quite long. “I have this birthmark on my head,” says Tuy. “It’s one of the reasons why I had grown long hair, to hide it.” When the lady saw the mark, she released him and hit him on the arm proclaiming: “This is my son!” “Everybody cheered,” says Tuy. “I still had no idea what was happening or what was being said - so David and Tich translated for me. “It was in that instance, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that this woman proved to me that she was my mom and that I was her son. “It was something only a mother could possibly know.” “She lives quite far away and it may take a while, but she can go and bring her back here to meet you,” David told him. “I was going numb,” says Tuy. “I had no idea how long I had to wait. I was happy, scared and sad. “’Who is she? Why is she? What is she?’ I thought. ‘What will it take to prove to her I am who I am, or vice versa? Is it a scam to take advantage of me?

When I was in Hawaii all the locals used to tell me I looked Filipino and it felt like they were challenging me. “I had identified solely as being Vietnamese, but it turns out they were right all along.” Tuy says he and his birth mother, Nguyen Thi Be, sat for a while and talked - with his friends interpreting. “I was totally just grooving off her speaking. I had so much to say, but wasn’t able to. I actually felt ashamed and shy - I was culturally inept. “She told me how when I was born, she was extremely ill and not able to care for me.  Fearing for her own life, she arranged for me to be taken to the church. “When she recovered she tried to get me back, but she said the nuns had told her that the rules were once a child had been given up, it could not be returned. “When the war was over, my mom lost all hope of ever seeing me again.” Thi Be gave Tuy a name and a place regarding his father - Fantaleon Sanchez and the city of Calamba in the Philippines. Six months after the mother-son reunion, Tuy landed in the capital Manila, joining his adopted father Thomas, to look for his birth father. Thomas, a baritone vocalist, had been booked to perform with the country’s national philharmonic orchestra - it seemed an ideal opportunity to search. It was 1994, the internet was in its infancy, and they had no idea exactly how to start looking in Calamba - which at the time had a population of about 200,000 people. The driver who took them the 30 miles or so from Manila suggested stopping at the local municipal offices. “Right as you enter the building there’s a missing persons bureau,” Thomas recollects. “Although no-one was technically missing, the officer at the desk - named Benito - took the photo that Tuy had brought of his Vietnamese mother and older sister. “Benito informed us he would speak with every neighbourhood barrio, a type of captain who looks after local affairs. And that was it. We left.” “I felt good that we had found that place,” says Tuy, “but honestly, it was like going through all those feelings again. “From cloud nine, to hoping but not knowing. I really wanted to find him, but I honestly didn’t think it would happen.” Thomas honoured his performance commitments and then flew home. Tuy had a few days to himself in Manila, before he also would return to the US. Then there was a phone call from Benito. “He told me that he’d found my father. The guy had been in Vietnam during the war, he was 65 and his name was actually Pantaleon Mance - similar sounding to the Fantaleon Sanchez my mom had recalled. “I was told he would come visit me where I was staying [in Manila] at 8am the next day.” The cold sweats that Tuy had experienced just six months prior in Sa Dec had returned. After a sleepless night, Tuy put on a traditional Filipino shirt which he had bought, and waited patiently. “It was quite different from meeting my Vietnamese mom,” he says. “Because my agenda was that he had to prove to me that he was my father. If his answers were not correct, then the meeting would be over.” As the two men chatted, it became clear that Pantaleon had the same agenda. Questions were asked - and answers given. At some point, it became apparent that they were father and son. “With Dad, it was just us - alone. Two people - two men - who could communicate. With Mom, it was a spectacle, and we could only talk in simple English and gestures. “We rented a car and went to Calamba to meet my half-sisters, Tess and Faye, and then to Pantaleon’s friend’s house to celebrate. “I remember the emotions overwhelming me in the car, which I think was quite hard for him. “Two days later, he and his children saw me off at the airport. My life was in total upheaval - I had huge choices to make…” Tuy with Pantaleon (l) It wasn’t just in the Philippines where Tuy had relatives he never knew existed. In Vietnam, he also had an extended family. In addition to his birth mother, Thi Be, he had one older full biological sister called Phuong and five younger half-siblings. Tuy with some of his Vietnamese family, 1993 Thi Be’s second husband had recently died after being bitten by a snake in the rice fields. The family was in debt and lived in extreme poverty. “They were living in a shack with a dirt floor and no electricity, whereas I was living a lottery life, going to art school in California,” he recalls. Tuy's mother's house in Sa Dec, 1993 Tuy’s emotional ties with Vietnam and his relatives there strengthened. For the next few years, his visits continued, and gradually his life became more focused on Vietnam than the US. He built a small hotel near Ho Chi Minh City’s airport with some new Vietnamese friends. He also bought a house in Da Nang, and threw himself into learning Vietnamese. On his trips to Sa Dec, Tuy says he always helped out - but never spoiled - his siblings.  Slowly but surely, Thi Be and the family began to climb out of poverty. Tuy also worked with his friend David Dang - one of the DeBolt family adoptees who had kept his original surname. David had founded Ablenet - a non-profit organisation - with a mission to bring used desktop PCs from the US to Vietnam. A school was also set up to teach Vietnamese people with disabilities how to use - and programme - computers. Ablenet classes “Back then, if you were disabled you were a drain on the family,” says Tuy. “You only had disabled workshops where the men would fix bicycles and the women were seamstresses or made arts and crafts.” The Ablenet team meet Tuy's mother for lunch Ablenet brokered US partnerships with some of Silicon Valley’s biggest names. But after a few years, partly because of increasing Vietnamese red tape, David closed the company. And then in 1996, Tuy was hurt in a car accident in the US. Until the car accident, because of the lack of muscle strength in his legs, Tuy had been able to get around using crutches and leg braces. But the accident forced him into a wheelchair permanently. Tuy suffered a serious tear to a rotator cuff - the group of four muscles that come together as tendons, to hold the arm and shoulder together. For two years, as the full extent of his shoulder damage became clear, Tuy was unable to travel outside the US. But one afternoon in October 2000, Tuy got a call from David Dang, and was made an offer too good to turn down. Because of their work with Ablenet, they were invited to join an IT delegation shadowing then US President Bill Clinton’s historic trip to Vietnam. President Clinton would become the first serving US president to visit the country since Richard Nixon had travelled to South Vietnam in 1969. IT delegation in Hanoi Tuy’s childhood creative streak had stayed with him and, since the mid-1990s, he’d been welding, building wheelchairs and designing jewellery. Before he travelled, he made a line of commemorative pins which he planned to hand out to some of the presidential delegation. Tuy admired Bill Clinton and it was his dream to meet him - but as the trip neared its end he hadn’t even been able to catch a glimpse of the president, other than on television. On the last day of the visit, Tuy wheeled up to Ho Chi Minh’s City Hall on a whim.  An IT business lunch was scheduled inside, and Tuy managed to blag his way in. There was no lift, so Tuy crawled up the staircase pulling his chair behind him. He mingled at the event for a time and then, because he was in his wheelchair, made his way out through a back room in the hope of finding an easier route to street level. He suddenly found himself in the company of Senators John Kerry and Loretta Sanchez, and Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta. Senator John Kerry with Tuy Tuy being Tuy, he introduced himself and they chatted. He learned that President Clinton was about to give a speech in the lobby downstairs. This was Tuy’s chance. He raced down to the small area beside the main staircase and sure enough, people were setting up a podium. He parked his wheelchair in front and waited. By the time Bill Clinton came out, the lobby was packed. Tuy recalls how the president spoke about his hopes for “normalisation” between Vietnam and the US - and how the internet would help future Vietnamese businesses. He also mentioned, says Tuy, how much he loved pho - a traditional Vietnamese noodle soup. At the end, the president moved towards the front row of the crowd to shake hands. With a big smile, Tuy grabbed the president’s hand with both of his - as is the way in Vietnamese culture when meeting someone important. Bill Clinton, in return, grabbed Tuy’s hands in the same fashion. “I had a speech hastily made up in my mind,” says Tuy. “I said that I had been watching Vietnam change for nine years, and I wanted to thank him for normalising relations. “I told him I was born here, but had gotten polio and been adopted by a family in America and grown up in Berkeley. “I went through my whole history as fast as I could, including the peace walk in ’91, and how I had found my Vietnamese family in ’93. “I said it was due to his decision to normalise relations with Vietnam that so many more overseas Vietnamese could now return and be reunited with their families, their culture and their motherland. “I thought he’d release my hand at this point, but instead he replied that it was people like me who made the whole trip worthwhile and he was glad to have done it.” Tuy says the president then asked if he could have a photo with him - and called his official photographer over. That long handshake made the national evening news that night in Vietnam. Again - just like the day he was reunited with his birth-mother in Sa Dec - Tuy was a mini-celebrity. A hundred photos that tell a hundred stories are dotted along the walls of a large, modern house in Sa Dec. They all revolve around Tuy’s adventures. It’s almost as if Forrest Gump had a real-life Vietnamese counterpart. There are snapshots from when Tuy was first reunited with Thi Be - and the time he took her and his older sister to the Philippines in 2008 to be reunited with his biological father Pantaleon. There are also pictures of the Vietnamese woman Tuy married in 2016. Huong - or Katie as she is also known - was introduced to Tuy by a mutual friend after she had returned from a four-year business course in Japan. She ended up working for Tuy at his custom jewellery business. One thing led to another, and the couple fell in love. Huong and Tuy Now, for the first time in five years, Tuy’s entire extended Vietnamese family have come together for a feast. It's being held in the home of Tuy's older sister Phuong. Tuy built the house for his mother, Thi Be, but she now stays with him and Huong in their apartment in Ho Chi Minh City. As I sit out back with Tuy, sipping steaming-hot Vietnamese green tea from tiny cracked jade-coloured porcelain glasses, he is keen to stress that a story of an adoptee meeting his biological parents is nothing new. But the story that isn’t told, he says, is what comes next. That’s the long process of integration, the challenges that face the adoptee as he or she tries to bond with their new family. And likewise, the family getting to know their long-lost son, daughter, brother or sister. Tuy's biological father and mother - with baby Phuong Tuy cherishes his extended family in Vietnam, the US and the Philippines - and in 2016, at his wedding, he fulfilled one of his life goals by bringing members from all three branches together. Thomas, Thi Be, Huong and Tuy After eating and drinking, the entire family sits together in the living room. Tuy, his siblings, mother and aunts all speak of the trials they have faced together. His younger half-brothers and sister explain how scared they were of Tuy at first - and how hard it was to understand him and his character. Tears flow freely as the whole family talk about their shared history. “Tears of joy or sadness?” I ask. Without hesitation, and in unison, they respond “vui”. Translated into English, it means “happiness”. Built with Shorthand",Positive,1.0
"Pauline Dakin (Photo: Penguin) Pauline Dakin's childhood in Canada in the 1970s was full of secrets, disruption and unpleasant surprises. She wasn't allowed to talk about her family life with anyone - and it wasn't until she was 23 that she was told why. There was always something unusual about Pauline Dakin's family. ""My brother and I would say, 'What do you think is wrong with our family? Why are we so weird?' But that was the mystery that just didn't get answered."" Pauline's parents, Warren and Ruth, had separated when she was five, the summer before she started school. Warren, a successful businessman, was a heavy drinker who could become violent and a point came when Ruth just couldn't take it any more. When Pauline was seven, Ruth took the children on a holiday to Winnipeg, more than 1,000 miles (1,600km) from their home in Vancouver. But when they arrived Ruth told them they were never going back. ""There was no opportunity to say goodbye, it was just this abrupt, severing of relationships,"" Pauline says. Warren, Ruth, Teddy and Pauline, circa 1969 When she asked her mother why she had done this, there was never a good explanation. ""She would only say, 'I'm sorry, I can't tell you, when you're older I will tell you.'"" The same thing happened again four years later - this time the family moved to New Brunswick, on Canada's eastern coast. Apart from this, life was quite normal for Pauline's family - they'd start again and build a new life in a new town. But below the surface Pauline was confused, anxious and falling into depression. ""I knew something bad was happening,"" she says. ""I didn't know what it was, but there was always a sense of something dire that was unspoken."" By the time Pauline was 11 she'd attended six different schools in nearly as many years and had lost touch with her dad. With her mum and brother on her graduation day from the University of New Brunswick in 1987 But another man had come into the family's life, a church minister called Stan Sears. Pauline's mother had met Stan at a support group for the families of alcoholics - Stan was a counsellor there and Ruth had gone to him when she was struggling with Warren's drinking and preparing to leave him. Both times that Pauline's family had disappeared Stan's family had moved in lockstep with them. ""So whatever had been going on they were part of, I knew that,"" Pauline says. Once in New Brunswick, they put down roots. By 1988, at the age of 23, Pauline had graduated from university and was working on a local newspaper in the city of Saint John, when her mother telephoned with an unexpected proposal. ""She said, 'OK, I'm ready to explain all of these strange things that have happened throughout your life.'"" Pauline Dakin spoke to Outlook on the BBC World Service You canlisten again here Pauline was to meet her mother outside a motel halfway between the two cities they were living in. When she arrived, Ruth slipped a note and an empty envelope into Pauline's hands. The note read: ""Don't say anything. Take your jewellery off. Put it in the envelope. I'll explain, just don't talk."" ""It was just the most bizarre thing,"" Pauline remembers. ""I thought, 'Whoareyou? What are youdoing?' But I did what she told me."" Her mother took her to a motel room where Pauline was surprised to find Stan Sears waiting for them. Stan and Ruth told Pauline that for the past 16 years they had been on the run from the mafia and that Pauline's family had been targeted because her father, Warren, had been involved in organised crime. She couldn't wear her jewellery because it needed to be tested for bugs. Warren Dakin was a successful businessman ""It was unbelievable,"" Pauline says. ""But I remember a feeling of terror coming over me that this might be something we could never escape."" Stan explained that it had all started after he had counselled a mafia kingpin who wanted to turn his back on his criminal past. When the mob discovered that the man had broken its code of silence and come to Stan for counselling they had assassinated him - and had then come after Stan thinking he probably knew too much. Later, when Ruth - the embittered ex-wife of a mobster - had started working as a secretary at Stan's church, she too had become a target. ""I was then told that each of us had somebody following us, keeping an eye on us from a distance,"" Pauline says, ""and that there had been many attempts to either kidnap, poison or kill me but that these agents had intervened to keep me safe many times over the years."" As well as this government-sanctioned taskforce, Stan also explained that there were shadowy communities - towns or villages in different parts of the country - where people who'd been targeted by the mafia could go into protective custody. This was known as the ""weird world"". After years on the run, Pauline's mother said that she was going to ""go inside"" for protection. She was going to disappear again. Stan was already living in one of these communities called Place of Hope, he said, but his wife hadn't wanted to go inside with him, so he was now living there alone and working in this weird world with its agents. Pauline aged about 23 Stan and Ruth told Pauline that this was their chance to finally be together, they had been in love for many years, but they had never been able to act on their feelings. Pauline was in shock, it was too much to take in. ""I was sick with fear and sadness and it just felt like life was shattering all around me,"" she says. Pauline spent that weekend listening to Stan and Ruth's stories, which explained many of the odd things that had happened while she was growing up, like the time she had come home to find her mother throwing away all the food from their fridge. ""The story at the time was that the food had gone bad, but I remember thinking, 'Ketchup and mustard don't go bad, there are things in there that don't go bad quickly. Why would you do that?'"" Stan explained that they had received word that somebody was trying to poison them, so everything had to be thrown away. And there was the time her family had gone hiking in the middle of the school week and stayed overnight in a mountain cabin. People had been coming after them, Stan explained, and they had to get away for a day or two. Then there was the day the family had skipped school to go bowling, and the time the children had come home from school and been rushed through the house, told to scrub their feet in the bath and made to wear plastic bags over their socks for the rest of the day. There was a sinister reason for all of these strange episodes. ""As unbelievable as it sounds there were all these explanations that made pieces that had been so troubling fall into some kind of a pattern, a narrative,"" Pauline says. Stan and Ruth camping in the early 1990s When it was time for Pauline to leave Stan asked if he could put a transmitter on her car to make it easier for the ""good guys"" to follow her and make sure she was safe. He also gave her a small transistor radio that he said had a broadcast function, so that Pauline could send a call for help. ""He warned me: 'Only use it if your life is really in danger because people will respond and put their life on the line for you.'"" Pauline returned to the home she was renovating with her boyfriend and to her job in the newsroom, but she was struggling to come to terms with what she'd been told and growing more and more fearful by the day. She was constantly looking over her shoulder for people or cars that might be following her, and became too scared to eat at restaurants in case somebody tried to slip something into her food. She planned escape routes from inside her own home and assumed that her telephone line was bugged. Over time more and more alarming information came from Stan and Ruth about the weird world, including the news that many people they knew weren't really the people they seemed to be. ""The story was that some people who had been around us during my childhood, who were involved with organised crime, had been picked up - arrested, killed or otherwise disappeared - and then replaced by doubles,"" Pauline says. ""Sometimes the double was put in place by the 'good guys' and sometimes the double would be put in place by the 'bad guys', so you were never 100% sure whose double it was. It was espionage."" The doubles, Stan explained, spent months studying home videos to learn how to behave convincingly, and used specialist plastic surgeons and make-up artists to perfect their disguises. I took my wife's name - and then the hassle began The playboy who got away with $242m Lesbian pioneers who fooled Spain's Catholic Church Pauline encountered these doubles from time to time. On the day her brother got married, for example, she met her father and her aunt for the first time in years. Both, she was told, were doubles. ""My mother was so upset at that wedding because her sister was supposed to be a double,"" Pauline recalls. ""She kept saying, 'But look at her toes, those are exactly Penny's toes, how could you make somebody else's toes look like that?'"" Pauline remembers looking at her dad that day. He had a nevus - a little overgrowth of cells just over the iris of his eye - how on Earth could it have been replicated, she wondered. ""But when I said that to Stan he said, 'Oh, it's contact lenses and there's prosthetics, and there's this and there's that.' There was always an answer,"" she says. Pauline and her mother also received dozens of letters from people inside the weird world - from her father and godfather, for example, who were being held in a top secret prison there, Stan said. The handwriting always looked authentic, and the letters talked about things from their shared past. They were convincing. ""Who on Earth would have time to forge them if they weren't real?"" Pauline wondered. An excerpt of a letter to Ruth and Pauline from inside the ""weird world"" Despite being plagued by doubts, Pauline always had to acknowledge that the two people telling her this incredible story were her mother and Stan - the most trustworthy people she knew. ""It was a crazy story and I did have some challenges believing it,"" she says. ""But if I couldn't trust them, who could I trust?"" Pauline began to feel that her work as a reporter covering school board meetings and town council meetings was irrelevant when her own life was in constant danger. And being sworn to secrecy had placed a gulf between her and her boyfriend, and everyone else in her life. ""I just thought, 'I can't live like this,'"" Pauline remembers. She decided that she would go inside with her mother. Stan told Pauline there was work inside that she could do, that there was a community of good people there that she could be part of. He was building a cottage for himself and her mother and said he could arrange for one to be built for her too. He brought her carpet samples and showed her plans and a photo of the horse that she would have. Pauline left her job, sold her house and broke up with her boyfriend. She moved to Halifax in Nova Scotia, where she found work and a new home while she and her mother waited for word that it was safe to go inside. ""We were told there had been threats against family members and that if we were to disappear again all hell would rain down on anybody left behind,"" Pauline says. ""The intelligence gatherers were telling us [through Stan] that the mob had some sense that we might be planning to disappear so they were threatening us. We were always on hold."" Pauline on her wedding day in 1990, with Stan, who gave her away Pauline met Kevin who would later become her husband. Stan gave Pauline away on her big day - of course she couldn't invite her real father - and Kevin was allowed in on the dreadful secret. Kevin agreed that he would go inside too. But the time was never right. By 1993, five years after she had been let into the secret, Pauline's doubts had reached a climax. ""I was at war with myself and I wanted to find some definitive way to prove it right or wrong,"" she says. Pauline decided to set up a sting at a time she knew Stan was visiting her mother. ""I called her and said, 'Somebody's broken into my house. What should I do?'"" Pauline's mother replied: ""I'll ask our friend and call you back."" Stan had made it clear to Pauline and Ruth that they must never go to the police to report any of the threats and strange goings-on in their lives - the police, he said, couldn't be trusted. If there was ever any trouble they should come to him and he would let them know if he got word of any plots that put them in danger. He had a special contraption implanted in his wallet for receiving messages. ""It would do a Morse code dash and dots message and he would then take out a little notepad and decipher it,"" Pauline says. Ruth called Pauline back a few minutes later. ""I was terrified because it was the moment that I was going to get the answer to this horrible quandary that I'd been living with,"" she says Ruth said she couldn't talk on the phone, Pauline must go to her house immediately. Once there Pauline listened, horrified, as Ruth and Stan told her that two people had been picked up just down the street from her house earlier that day, that they had photographs of her, they had been following her and were looking for certain things in her house. ""When she said that I knew the whole thing was a hoax,"" Pauline says. ""Because there had been no break-in - I made it up. ""That was the moment I knew all of those severed relationships, all of the crazy running, all of the strangeness, it was all a lie."" This video can not be played Pauline recalls how her mother and Stan 'explained' all the strange events of her childhood Pauline was so shell-shocked and angry it was a week before she could confront her mother. When she did, Ruth was horrified and upset - but not because she believed Pauline's accusations against Stan. What worried her was that if Pauline no longer believed the story she would be putting herself in danger. When Pauline confronted Stan he told her there must have been a mistake; the report about the men who had been picked up after searching her house must have been incorrect. There would be an investigation, he assured her. ""My memory of that night is how sad he was,"" she says, ""I was no longer one of them."" Pauline spent months trying to convince her mother that Stan had been lying to them, while her mother tried to convince Pauline that she was wrong. They reached a stand-off. ""I was furious and resentful and I thought I hated Stan for a long time,"" Pauline says. ""But I finally decided that my mother was not in on this. Stan was making it up, but I just couldn't think why he would have done it."" In her search for an answer, Pauline went to see a psychiatrist. ""I said, 'What do you think this could be? He's clearly not schizophrenic. He does not appear to be psychotic. He's a professional and well respected. People always talk about what a great guy he is, what could be going on?'"" The psychiatrist suggested that it sounded like a case offolie Ã  deux- a syndrome in which symptoms of a delusional belief are transmitted from a dominant personality (Stan), to a less dominant personality (Ruth). Pauline and her father, Warren, reconnected after many years. But he was by now quite ill with emphysema, and he'd started drinking again. ""I thought about telling him,"" Pauline says. ""But then I thought it would enrage him and that would not be good for him. I just didn't think there was anything to gain from it."" Pauline's relationship with her mother never entirely recovered, though it improved when Pauline started a family. Pauline with her two daughters ""When I had children things changed,"" Pauline says, ""because they became a focus for all our love."" Ruth developed cancer, which eventually killed her in 2010. But she spent the last nine months of her life living with Pauline. ""I hadn't fully forgiven her at that point, but we both knew that we were out of time to sort through this,"" Pauline says. ""We had to find some place of peace, and eventually we did."" Ruth never stopped believing Stan's story, even after his death when the letters from the weird world dried up, there were no more messages about the activities of the mafia, and there couldn't really be any doubt it had all been a figment of his imagination. ""Shortly before she died she tried to warn me to be careful,"" Pauline recalls. ""I said to her, 'I don't need to be any more careful than anybody else.'"" ""And she said, 'Oh, Polly, if you don't believe this how you must've hated me.' And I said, 'No, I didn't hate you. I've been really angry at you, but I do love you.'"" Pauline and her brother Ted Four years ago, still trying to understand why Stan had concocted the elaborate hoax, Pauline came across an article in a medical journal about a condition called delusional disorder. ""As I read this article I thought, 'This completely describes Stan, somebody who is in every respect normal and competent, but has this crazy delusion,'"" she says. Pauline contacted the author of the paper, a psychiatrist at Harvard University. He was very excited to hear her story. Stan had all the hallmarks of a person with delusional disorder, he said. Another academic, the leading expert on the disorder, agreed. Finding a reason for what Stan did to her family may have helped Pauline come to terms with her past, but it can't ever repair the damage that he did to their lives. ""I feel very sad for my mother,"" Pauline says. ""She had such a difficult life and she was vulnerable to Stan, mostly because he was a gentle, caring guy - too bad he had this terrible delusion. ""But I also feel sad for myself and my brother - two little kids whose lives were hijacked.""

" Morag Connelly watched as the bottle was dropped into the River Clyde. The water was quite calm and as the bottle bobbed around on the surface, she wondered if it would make it out to sea. Morag Connelly Inside it she had sealed a copy of the dreadful story that had brought her and 24 others to Victoria Harbour in Greenock that Saturday afternoon in early April - the story of seven young stowaways, all but one of whom had been starved, brutalised and eventually abandoned on floating ice, thousands of miles from home. John Paul - Morag’s great-great-grandfather - was one of them. Unlike two of his young companions, he survived. But the horror of his experiences was passed down through the generations. “If we ever complained about being cold in the winter my father would say, ‘Just think of John Paul, he walked on the ice in his bare feet,’” says Morag, a retired deputy headteacher. “It was always something that was said in bad weather.” As a boy of 12, John Paul had hidden away on a ship called the Arran, which on 7 April 1868 sailed from the quayside where Morag and other descendants, including John Paul’s 90-year-old granddaughter, Ria, were now standing. The ship was carrying a cargo of coal and oakum - a fibre made by painstakingly untwisting old ropes - and was heading across the Atlantic Ocean to the Canadian province of Quebec. Nobody knows why John Paul and the others decided to stow away, but his descendants say it was common in those days for Greenock boys to smuggle themselves on to ships in the harbour, seeking adventure and hoping to escape from the poverty of their childhoods. Ships were routinely checked for stowaways and any found would be sent back ashore on tugs - but John Paul wasn’t found. The Arran sailed down the Firth of Clyde and into the Irish Sea towards the Atlantic. Dry land was by now far behind and the tugs had long since cast the ship loose. As the ship’s carpenter prepared to batten down the hatches John Paul and another boy, 11-year-old Hugh McEwan, were finally discovered. Then five more stowaways emerged. It was too late to send them back. ‘A rarely told story’ These illustrations come from a graphic novel created by pupils of Ardgowan primary school in Greenock, with Magic Torch Comics writer Paul Bristow and artist Mhairi M Robertson. The aim was to bring the story to a new, younger audience.“We look at the folk tales and stranger things that are associated with the area - the stories that have fallen out of the telling,” Paul says. From then on they were only given a few ship’s biscuits to eat each day, so that even with the few scraps slipped to them in kindness by the cook, and the potato and turnip peelings they scavenged here and there, they had barely enough to survive. So they stole whatever they could lay their hands on from the ship’s stores - currants, oatmeal and more biscuits - but were heavily punished when caught. Once, when a grain barrel was found to have been opened, they immediately fell under suspicion. As punishment they were handcuffed together and given nothing to eat for an entire day. Hunger was not the stowaways' only problem. They were also unprepared for the harsh conditions of the North Atlantic. “The boys were thinly clad, and were not able to stand the severe cold,” one of the ship’s crew wrote to his family in Greenock after the ship had reached Quebec, nearly two months later. “The men could hardly stand it, let alone them. Two of the little ones had bare feet.” John Paul was one of the boys without shoes, the other was Hugh McGinnes, also 12 years old. The two of them would disappear below deck together to escape from the bitter cold, but whenever the ship’s mate realised they were missing he would drag them out and beat them. The stowaways - Hugh McEwan, 11- John Paul, 12- Hugh McGinnes, 12- Peter Currie, 12- James Bryson, 16- David Brand, 16- Bernard Reilly, 22 Another of the boys was singled out for particularly brutal treatment, which began when the crew and other stowaways complained that he was dirty. “He made me take off my jacket, waistcoat, and shirt, leaving only my semmit [vest] on. The coil was about half an inch thick. The mate flogged me for about three minutes and the blows were very painful,” 16-year-old James Bryson said later. “I was screaming. The mate made me strip off the rest of my clothing. I was then made to lie down on the deck. “One of the crew was ordered to draw water in a bucket. Several buckets of water were thrown at me.” “The weather was very cold. The captain then scrubbed me with a hair broom all over my body. The mate was standing over me with a rope in his hand, with which he threatened to strike me if I tried to run away. “The mate then took the broom and scrubbed me harder than the captain. After the scrubbing was finished, I was ordered to the forecastle. I was naked at the time. When I had been there for about an hour my semmit was returned. I suffered very much from exposure.” On another occasion, having been caught stealing currants from the ship’s store, James Bryson was lashed with the lead line - a rope with a lead weight at its end used to determine the depth of water - and then made to strip naked and sweep the decks. A sailor called James Harley witnessed the torture. “I saw Bryson's skin after he had been flogged and it resembled tartan,” he told an Edinburgh court months later, when the mate and captain were put on trial. “It was red and white.” Bryson may have been the only one who was punished in this barbaric way, but all except one of the stowaways - 12-year-old Peter Currie, whose father was a friend of the ship’s mate - were regularly beaten.

About a month after setting sail, the Arran ran into floating ice between Cape Breton Island and Newfoundland, and on 9 May the ship drifted into Bay St George, off Newfoundland's west coast, and became trapped. With the ship going nowhere, 22-year-old Bernard Reilly - the eldest of the stowaways, who had dreams of making it to Nova Scotia to work on the railways - persuaded James Bryson that it might be worth trying to cross the ice to escape the misery on board the ship. The younger boys were terrified of the idea, but the captain then ordered that all the stowaways except Peter Currie were to be put overboard. “I heard the three little boys crying when they were asked to go,” seaman George Henry said in court. “The ice was broken and rough-looking. Two of the boys were barefooted when they left the ship. The clothes of two of them were very ragged. The distance between the ship and the land, according to the best judgement I could form, was from 10 to 15 miles. “It appeared to me rather unlikely that those without shoes would ever reach the land.” Between eight and nine o’clock in the morning the stowaways set off across the ice. The ship’s mate threw each a biscuit as they left. The floe was made of slabs of various sizes, some as big as a football pitch, others much smaller. Reaching the end of one, the stowaways had to jump on to the next. Hugh McEwan, who had been poorly since leaving Greenock and had been seen spitting blood during the voyage, soon started to lag behind. He slipped into the freezing water once and was pulled free by James Bryson. When he fell in a second time he managed to crawl out himself. But each time he grew weaker. “I saw him fall in the last time. I was in the water too,” John Paul said in court. “He was kicking and trying to get out. He caught hold of me. I kicked and he let me go, then I got out by scrambling on the edge of the ice. I saw his head as the ice closed over it. I did not hear him cry. The ice covered over him, and I never saw him again.” Some hours later, Hugh McGinnes sat down on the ice, his bare feet sore and swollen. He was overcome by exhaustion. “We urged him to come along with us, and said if he did not he would be frozen,” James Bryson said. “He said he could not come any further. We left him there with nothing to protect him - no greatcoat, nothing but his ragged, frozen clothes.” As the remaining four stowaways neared land, the large slabs of ice became rarer. But they struggled on, each in turn slipping and falling into the water, their clothes freezing solid to their bodies. They reached the end of the ice as the sun was going down. They could see a few houses on the shore, but a channel of water and drift ice up to a mile wide lay between them and dry land. Bernard Reilly, the 22-year-old, and 16-year-old David Brand tried to paddle ashore on pieces of ice, using a batten taken from the ship. John Paul and James Bryson, frozen, famished, exhausted and weak, were stranded. They shouted out for help in the hope that someone would hear them.

It’s May 2018 and spring has finally arrived at Highlands on the southern shore of Bay St George. The days are getting warmer and there’s only a dusting of snow left now on the tops of the hills. The Arran may have expected such conditions when it arrived here 150 years ago, instead of the wintry scene that awaited it. “I have seen the sea covered in ice like that many times - it’s a combination of a cold winter and certain winds that blow ice into the bay,” says Taylor Chaffey, president of the local historical society. “But when the boys were put over the side the ice was already decomposing with the spring temperatures so they didn’t have anything very solid to walk on - it really was a very cruel thing to do.” Highlands was once a busy agricultural and fishing community where fishermen lived in little cabins on the beach. There is no harbour, so they fished with boats that were hauled up on a slipway. One of those living here in 1868 was Catherine Ann MacInnis and it was she who saw the boys in the fading daylight, or heard their cries, and raised the alarm. Her great-great-grandson, Don MacInnis, discovered this when he answered the door one sunny summer’s day about 25 years ago, and found in front of him a man from British Columbia, a descendant of one of the Arran stowaways who was searching for a member of the MacInnis family. “Catherine Ann was my great-great-grandmother,” says Don. “But I didn’t know anything about this horrendous story - that six boys had been thrown off a ship here and that two of them had perished on the ice. The story had been lost to our family. It was quite a shock.” Catherine Ann’s family had emigrated to Newfoundland from Loch Morar in the Scottish Highlands in the 1850s and it is thought that her husband, Alexander, would have been among the local men who set out in a boat to rescue the boys. “It’s not easy to see four little boys from a mile away especially at 7.30pm in the evening,” Don says. “If they’d arrived, say, a half hour later, they probably wouldn’t have been seen at all - they were really, really fortunate to survive.” The four frostbitten stowaways recuperated in the villagers’ homes. Blinded by the glare of the ice, it was almost a week before they were able to see properly. It took almost a month for John Paul’s badly lacerated feet to heal. The bodies of Hugh McGinnes and Hugh McEwan, who had perished on the drift ice, were never found. At some point Don told the story to his old friend, Taylor Chaffey. “Why didn’t I know something about this?” Taylor says. “This is not something that we can allow to be lost. We need to find a way to make sure that this part of our history is saved.” And so, like Morag Connelly in Greenock, Don and Taylor in Highlands, Newfoundland, made plans to commemorate the events that took place here. Don designed a bronze plaque which was placed on his great-great-grandmother’s grave during a day of commemorations organised by the local historical society. A piper led a 100-strong crowd down to the spot from where Catherine Ann is thought to have spotted the boys, and the great-grandson of the stowaway David Brand - who emigrated to Australia and established a successful engineering firm there - gave a speech, before three information kiosks telling the story of the stowaways and their rescue were unveiled. David Brand VII and Taylor Chaffey “What a great day,” says David Brand VII, a retired Presbyterian minister who travelled from New South Wales with his wife and son to take part in the celebrations. “The sun shone into every heart. We are so glad we came from Australia to share in this, the memories will last forever.” When the Arran eventually arrived in Quebec, one of the crew sent a letter home to Greenock describing the campaign of cruelty that the stowaways had been subjected to. The news spread quickly around the town. A telegraph was then sent from Scotland asking for more information and the reply came that four of the six boys who had been put down on the ice had survived -  three of them were still in Newfoundland, but the fourth, Bernard Reilly, had already set off to look for work in Nova Scotia. Almost six months after stowing away, the three remaining boys arrived back in Scotland by boat. “One of the boys believed to be alive was named Hugh McGinnes, whose mother is a widow and resides in Nicholson Street, Greenock,” the Scotsman newspaper reported on 5 October 1868. “The poor woman went down expecting to meet her son, when she received the painful information that he had died on the ice from exhaustion. Another lad, named [John] Paul, who was believed to have perished, has returned.” What happened to the other survivors? -James Bryson emigrated to the US, where he became a tram conductor- David Brand started a ship engineering firm in Queensland, Australia, where he died in 1897- Peter Currie,the stowaway who was not put overboard,died of tuberculosis two years after returning home - Bernard Reilly, who went to Nova Scotia, may have never returned to Scotland The Arran was wrecked on Sand Island in the Gulf of Mexico in 1886  while sailing from Greenock to Mobile, Alabama The boys had arrived home just in time to appear as the main witnesses at the trial of the captain and the mate at the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh. The only known picture of John Paul shows him standing between David Brand and James Bryson, three days after their return On its final day (25 November 1868) the Scotsman newspaper reported that “the courtroom was again crowded, and many persons waited outside for several hours in the hope of gaining admission.” James Kerr, the mate, was found guilty of assault and sentenced to four months in prison. The captain, Robert Watt, was charged with culpable homicide - roughly equivalent to the offence of manslaughter in English law - and sentenced to 18 months. “The verdict was received by the audience with loud hisses,” said the Scotsman’s story the following morning. Both men went back to their jobs and sailed for many years after leaving prison. “I remember how on a winter's night my little granny would tell us John Paul's story,” says Ann McVey Haldane. “It's always been there in our family.” Ann and Morag are second cousins - their grandfathers were brothers. But although they knew one another well years ago they haven’t seen each other for decades. Ann left Greenock 28 years ago when her husband got a new job near Basingstoke. In making the journey south, she was in fact following in the footsteps of her great-great-grandfather, John Paul, roughly a century earlier. Seven years after his dreadful experience at sea, the 19-year-old John Paul married and started a family. He had become a riveter, like his father before him, and rose to the rank of foreman in Greenock's shipyards. But after his wife died, in her 40s, he left for Southampton. At a certain point, Ann McVey's parents also made the journey south, to be near their daughter. “And when Dad came down here he started to bang on about John Paul - it reawakened something in him,” Ann says. “‘He's in Southampton,’ he'd say, ‘you need to find him.’” It was family legend that John Paul was buried somewhere in an unmarked grave - there was an element of shame about it, Ann says, so she wanted to find him, for her father, and to put things right. “I can remember my wee granny tutting and saying, ‘Pauper's grave, unmarked,’” she says. Ann eventually discovered that John Paul had been buried in Southampton’s St Mary Extra cemetery. After several unsuccessful attempts, Ann found her great-great-grandfather’s plot, not far from where two large conifer trees lean in from opposite sides of the path. “Finally, there he was in his unmarked grave,” she says. “I stood at the grave and thought about the terrible ordeal John Paul had suffered as a child. I thought about his missing fingers and toes - he lost a few due to frostbite. I thought about the child who stowed away on a ship just looking for adventure, and I said out loud, ‘You daft wee boy, what were you thinking?’” Like her grandmother, Ann assumed that her great-great-grandfather had died a poor man since no headstone was ever placed on his grave. So when another of John Paul’s descendants in the US uncovered a newspaper article describing a grand funeral, with a polished elm coffin covered in beautiful flowers and wreaths, and the large number of people who had assembled at the cemetery to pay their respects - including more than 100 members of the Boilermaker’s Society in full regalia - Ann was very surprised. No-one knows why a stone was never placed on John Paul’s final resting place, but Ann and some of John Paul’s other descendants thought the 150th anniversary of his ordeal at sea was the right moment to erect a headstone. “When you stand there in that desolate little space, it’s desperate,” Ann says. “We don’t want anything lavish, just something simple that says who John Paul was and maybe refers to the Greenock Stowaways so somebody at some point could research this history that was part of this life.” But even though the plot has been unmarked for more than 100 years, Ann discovered that no stone can be installed without permission from the legal owner of the grave. So who was the owner? Ann made some calls to Southampton City Council. She asked whether the owner of John Paul’s grave was the Boilermakers  Society - but was told it wasn’t. “I called again and ran through all of John Paul's children as possible owners of the grave. No joy,” she says. “Then I sat down at the computer and looked at the entries in my family tree and could see there was one more logical guess I could make. The person who purchased John Paul's grave was his second wife, Blanche Martindale Paul.” Ann knows that Blanche outlived at least two more husbands - but has been unable to find any record of Blanche’s death or any will, so Ann cannot prove to whom, if anyone, she bequeathed her estate. This may well ensure that John Paul’s final resting place remains unmarked forever. “Unfortunately there are no exceptions to the rules regarding transferring burial rights. The correct procedures must be adhered to,” a spokesman from Southampton City Council said. “We are unable to consider that the grave be transferred to descendants of John Paul without following transfer procedures.” Built with Shorthand",Positive,0.52207655

Ever since you left school you've been in and out of all sorts of jobs. Manual labour, mostly - builder, dustman, crane driver, painter and decorator. Hawker Siddeley, the aerospace company - you like it there, until the factory shuts. You split up with your girlfriend so you ask your mum to put you up until you can sort out a flat. Save a few quid. You're very close to your mum and dad. They're your best friends, really. Your dad has lung cancer and needs a bit of looking after. You take him for a drive most days because he doesn't like staying in all the time. He's like you, not a man to sit about. At one time he worked three jobs, all at once. Still does half an hour each morning in the garden. So you're back in the council house in Chingford, north-east London, that you've called home since you were eight years old - even after you left. Your sisters have moved out and had kids of their own but you want to take care of your mum and dad, same as they took care of you. And then you get a big shock. Suddenly, unexpectedly, your mum dies in hospital, two weeks after she has a replacement heart valve fitted. It's the day before she's supposed to get out. Her death is hard for you to accept. You don't know how to process your grief. All through your 43 years on Earth so far you've always tried to be tough. You don't cry at the funeral. You want to be strong for your sisters. You want to just get on with it. But the depression creeps up and up on you. It's just you and your dad in the house now. You've become his full-time carer - there's no-one else left to look after him now mum is gone. Anything he needs, you do it for him. His cancer spreads from his lungs to his other organs until, inevitably, it kills him. Two parents gone within two years. And now you're alone in the house. The council says you have to move to a flat, so you pack up and go. You like it. Decent size, first floor, communal gardens, nice neighbours. It needs doing up but you aren't afraid of putting a bit of work in. You want to go back to work again so you go door-to-door selling Avon products. You start to notice your neck feels stiff. Your back, too. Must be from all that physical labour over the years. Plus a couple of road accidents you had when you were younger. Once a driver did a U-turn in front of you when you were on your motorbike. Your knees hit the car first then you went over the roof and landed on your head. Years ago, this was. There's this bloke you get to know. Friend of a friend. You fetch his paper every morning. Sometimes he cooks for you in return. One day he invites you in for a drink. You go indoors and take a seat. There's another fella there. You accept a drink from the friend of a friend. He's been drinking already. Then he starts getting a bit loud, so you ask him to keep it down. He doesn't like that. Comes over and hits you. You're still in your chair. You get up and have a pop in retaliation, then the other fella separates you. There's an unopened packet of knives in the room. You see it happening in slow motion. The friend of a friend selects a knife from the packet. You don't think he's going to use it, but then he does. He stabs you in the thigh. You try to grab the knife to defend yourself. You get cut again in your arm and around your eye. Right, you say.I'm getting out of here. You turn to leg it. ""Don't tell anyone about this,"" he says, and then he sticks the knife in your shoulder blade. That's the worst one. You thought this bloke was all right. You thought he was your mate. You got that wrong. You go to hospital. They fix you up and send you home but the pain is still bad. Your back and your neck. What's worse, you can't stop thinking about the attack. Reliving it over and over. Lying awake. The friend of a friend is jailed for the stabbing but that doesn't stop your paranoia. You walk down the road looking at every single car that passes, every motorbike. They might be coming for you. You see a pizza delivery bloke. He's looking for an address. You think he might be a hitman coming after you. He stops and looks at you. You think you're going to be attacked again. You don't trust anyone. You used to be really fit. Cycled all the time. Now you can't. And you love your cycling. All your muscles lock up. Every time you wake up in the morning, you're aching. You go to your GP. He examines you and signs you off work for six months. He says you have post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. There's no way you can work. You're also diagnosed with muscular arthritis. That, plus the scars from the knife attack, means it's painful to turn your neck or lift your arms above shoulder height. You're on something called Employment Support Allowance. ESA. Minimum-level state benefits, that means. It's for people who can't work because of ill health or disability. You get housing benefit as well, which goes straight to the council to pay for the flat. Then a few weeks later the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) calls you in. It's a work capability assessment, they say. There's a form to fill in first about what you can and can't do. Can you pick up a Â£1 coin?  Can you raise a hand to your head? Well, just about, though it's painful. You go along and the person assessing you says you're fit for work. You say you're not. Your GP agrees that you're not. But the assessor's opinion outweighs any other. Your benefits are stopped - both the ESA and the housing benefit. You've got no money coming in. Nothing. You're falling in arrears with your rent. Friends are feeding you. You go to your local food bank. It's embarrassing. You don't like it. But the one round the corner isn't too bad. They don't ask any questions. You just go there and get your stuff. You push your bike, the bike you can't ride any more. They give you pasta, potatoes, tins of soup, couscous - you don't like the couscous much but you take it anyway, it's not like you can afford to be choosy. Then you hang the shopping bags on the bike and push it home in the rain. You're losing weight because of the lack of food. You're still in pain. You're still depressed. You used to be really outgoing. You liked talking to people and going out and doing stuff but now you're just not in the mood. The council apply for a possession order of your flat. They go to court and get one, suspended. They won't take the flat off you if you can make payments towards the arrears - Â£300 a month. You keep going back to the Job Centre and asking if they can do anything for you. And finally - after seven months with no money coming in whatsoever, the DWP tells you that you can go on a new benefit called Universal Credit - the part of it that replaces Jobseeker's Allowance. They told you before you weren't eligible, but apparently now you are. You don't understand what's changed. There's no explanation. It seems as though there's been a mistake somewhere. Now you get Â£414.33 for your rent and Â£317.82 for living costs. It's different from the benefits you were on before. Before, the Housing Benefit was paid direct to the council for your rent. Now, you get the housing costs and the living costs paid directly to you in one lump sum - one of the features of Universal Credit introduced by your local MP, Iain Duncan Smith. Except you don't realise this - that the money is no longer going direct to the council and you need to sort it out yourself. No-one explained it to you, not in a way you understood, at least. You end up going even further into arrears with the rent. A new benefit for working-age people that replaces six benefits - including Jobseeker's Allowance and Housing Benefit - and merges them into one payment It was designed to make claiming benefits simpler, and to ensure no-one is better off claiming benefits than working But it has proved controversial from the beginning, with reports of IT issues, massive overspends and administrative problems What is Universal Credit - and what's the problem? Because you've been assessed fit for work, you're supposed to spend 35 hours a week looking for a job. But when the DWP summon you to a jobseeker's meeting to ask what you're doing to find work, you don't get the message. No-one tells you. There's no letter - not one that reaches you, anyway. It could be that they've sent you the message electronically - but you're no good with computers. You don't have one at home and the sole time you tried to use one down the Job Centre you didn't know what half the keys did. So because you don't turn up to the jobseeker's meeting, you get what is called a sanction - that means they stop the Â£317.82 for monthly living costs. You know nothing about this. You don't actually work out that you've been sanctioned for 212 days. You just know there is less money coming in. All you have to live on is the Â£414.33 that's supposed to be for housing costs. But you're still paying the council Â£300 a month for the earlier rent arrears - which means you are left with Â£114.33 a month to subsist on. That's Â£26.38 a week. You can't survive on that. And, once again, you can't pay the rent. You're back to relying on food banks and donations from friends. You take the bracelet you wear around your wrist to the pawnbroker. It's still not enough. It seems that every time you go to the Job Centre, someone gives you a different story about what you should be doing. You try to phone the DWP to sort things out, but no-one seems able to help you there, either. Each phone call costs you something like Â£8 - the claimant helpline is premium rate from mobiles and you haven't got a landline. Your rent arrears are now in excess of Â£10,000. The council seeks a court order for your eviction. You're looking at spending Christmas on the streets. You go to see a legal adviser. You haven't been able to see a lawyer until now, because benefits law isn't covered by legal aid any more, but some housing law is. Your lawyer and a Citizens Advice caseworker can't make head nor tail of what's going on at first. Eventually, they work out that you've been sanctioned. They write to the Universal Credit department repeatedly to ask for an explanation - it takes a long time for them to figure out why you have been sanctioned and what you could do to get the sanction lifted. But first you have to go to court to try and avoid eviction. Your legal adviser is a man called Simon Mullings. He tells you how serious the situation is. He's not going to sugar-coat it for you. The council are trying to be reasonable, he says, but they have a statutory duty to recover the lost rent. If you lose this case you'll be homeless. You sit through three very scary hearings as your legal team argues your case. You have a barrister, Mary-Rachel McCabe. She tells your whole Kafkaesque story to the judge. ""Tony has been failed by a malfunctioning system,"" she says. ""From the moment Tony claimed Universal Credit last year, he suffered the consequences of its arbitrary rules and procedures, and so was immediately plunged into further rent arrears and other debt."" The judge is visibly shocked. The system is ""appalling"", she says. McCabe tells the court that the sanction and the finding that you are fit for work are now being challenged with the help of a benefits adviser from Citizens Advice. If that's successful it will give you an extra Â£317.82 a month and allow you to pay your rent. A new court hearing is set for May. That's a reprieve. If you can show a pattern of payment by then, maybe you won't be evicted. Mullings, your legal advisor, tells you it might not feel like it, but you're one of the lucky ones. At least because this was a housing case you had legal representation. If you hadn't, you would have been steamrollered. The court you've been going to, Edmonton County Court, has seen lots of similar Universal Credit cases, Mullings says. Other courts that he works in nearby - Stratford, Romford - they're not seeing these cases yet, because Universal Credit hasn't been rolled out into those areas. ""But they're coming down the line,"" says Mullings. ""So this is the vanguard of a tsunami of Universal Credit problems. Unless the government radically changes tack."" For you, though, things are looking up. It's still a struggle but it's getting a bit better. You feel like you can't move on while this is hanging over you. You want to get stronger. Like you used to be. Nothing ever used to get you down. ""I've always tried my best, even though my body really hurts,"" you say. ""I just keep going, I'm like that. But the pressure - I can't think straight, I can't concentrate on one thing any more. I think about nothing but my problems."" A friend asks if you've seen a film called I, Daniel Blake. It's about a man caught up in the nightmare bureaucracy of the benefits system. You haven't had time to watch it. But you say you should play the lead in the sequel. Your name is Tony Rice, and you're not going to let this break you.

"This video can not be played Yuni was forced to run from the water The death toll following the tsunami caused by the Anak Krakatau volcano in Indonesia has risen to at least 429, the disaster mitigation agency says. On Saturday giant waves crashed into coastal towns on the islands of Sumatra and Java. It is thought that volcanic activity set off undersea landslides which in turn generated the killer waves. About 150 people are still missing, while more than 16,000 have been displaced, the agency says. Coastal residents near the volcano have been warned to keep away from beaches amid fears it could trigger a new tsunami. Anak Krakatau erupted again on Sunday, spewing ash and smoke. Video shot from a charter plane captured the magnitude of the volcanic event in the Sunda Strait, between Sumatra and Java. A volcanologist explains eruption images The rock band swept away by deadly waves How volcanoes can trigger tsunamis Disaster as it happened Rescue efforts are being hampered by blocked roads but heavy lifting equipment is being transported to badly hit areas to help search for victims. On Monday, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency told a news conference that another tsunami was a possibility because of the continued volcanic eruptions of Anak Krakatau. ""Recommendations from [the] Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysical Agency are that people should not carry out activities on the beach and stay away from the coast for a while,"" said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. A satellite image of Anak Krakatau erupting in August Anak Krakatau, which emerged in 1927 from the caldera that was formed during the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883, has seen increased activity in recent months with people asked to avoid the area around its crater. On Monday Mr Sutopo put out a series of tweets explaining why there was no early warning for this tsunami. He said that Indonesia's early warning system is set up to monitor earthquakes but not undersea landslides and volcanic eruptions, which can also generate deadly waves. But, he added, with 13% of the world's volcanoes in Indonesia alone, it was crucial for the country to develop such system. He confirmed there was no tsunami advance warning system on the night of the disaster, adding that because of lack of funds, vandalism to the buoys and technical faults there had been no operational tsunami warning system since 2012. Geologist RaphaÃ«l Paris,whose 2012 study predicted the collapse of a flank of Anak Krakatau,externaland a subsequent tsunami, said: ""There is a big uncertainty on the stability of the volcanic cone now, and the probability for future collapses and tsunamis is perhaps non-negligible."" The tsunami struck at 21:30 local time (14:30 GMT) during a local holiday, with few of the warning signals that might have come had it been generated by an earthquake. The child who came back from the dead after tsunami How reliable are tsunami warning systems? Survivors' stories Seawater did not recede as it would with an earthquake tsunami. Experts say that even if there had been warning buoys near the volcano, there would have been minimal alert time. Band Seventeen were performing on stage when the tsunami hit The waves destroyed hundreds of buildings, sweeping away cars and uprooting trees in several popular tourist destinations, including the Tanjung Lesung beach resort, west Java. Footage shared on social media showed a large wave crashing into a tent in the resort, in which popular Indonesian rock band Seventeen were performing. Members of the band were seen being swept away as the wave destroyed the stage. By Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent Everyone in the region will have been aware of Anak Krakatau, the volcano that emerged in the sea channel just less than 100 years ago. But its rumblings and eruptions have been described by local experts as relatively low-scale and semi-continuous. In other words, it's been part of the background. And yet it is well known that volcanoes have the capacity to generate big waves. The mechanism, as ever, is the displacement of a large volume of water. The first satellite imagery returned after the event on Saturday points strongly to a collapse in the west-southwest flank of the volcano. This would have sent millions of tonnes of rocky debris into the sea, pushing out waves in all directions. Read more from Jonathan Some residents in the Pandeglang region ran to a local mosque after the tsunami hit Indonesia is prone to tsunamis because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific Rim. In September, more than 2,000 people died when a powerful earthquake struck just off the central Indonesian island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu. A town smashed to pulp in minutes Indian Ocean tsunami: Then and now On 26 December 2004, a series of huge waves triggered by a powerful earthquake in the Indian Ocean killed about 228,000 people in 13 countries, mostly in Indonesia. However, tsunamis caused by volcanic activity like this are less frequent. In August 1883, Krakatoa underwent one of the most violent volcanic eruptions in recorded history: Massive tsunamis with waves of up to 41m killed more than 30,000 people Thousands more were killed by hot ash The eruptions were equivalent to 200 megatons of TNT - about 13,000 times the nuclear yield of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 The eruptions were heard thousands of kilometres away World temperatures dropped by more than 1C the following year The volcanic island virtually disappeared Are you in the affected area?
