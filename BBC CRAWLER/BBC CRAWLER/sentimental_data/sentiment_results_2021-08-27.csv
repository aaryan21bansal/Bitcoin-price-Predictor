"Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater are set to become Scottish government ministers Members of the Scottish Greens have backed a deal that will see its leaders in government for the first time. With some proxy votes still to be counted, 83% of members who took part in an extraordinary general meeting were in favour. The deal, which required a two-thirds majority of the party's National Council, was then formally ratified. Co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater said it promoted ""a sustainable Scotland that works for everyone"". The deal is done - so what lies ahead? What could the SNP-Greens deal mean for Scotland? SNP-Greens deal pledges indyref2 within five years The pair will become government ministers under the power-sharing deal, with the Greens required to back the Scottish government in confidence votes and annual budgets as they work on a raft of agreed policy areas, including tackling the climate emergency, Scottish independence and rent controls. Public disagreement between the parties will only be allowed on a set of agreed topics. These include aviation policy, green ports, direct financial support to businesses involved in the aerospace, defence and security sectors, field sports and the economic principles related to concepts of sustainable growth and inclusive growth. However, speaking during the EGM, Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer insisted that the list of subjects could be changed if further agreements or disagreements emerge. Before this vote, Green leaders were anxious not to take membership support for granted - there are, after all, some radical elements in the party and there is more than a hint of anarchism too. In the end, the lure of power proved highly persuasive. The co-operation agreement was emphatically endorsed by ordinary Greens and by the party's National Council, as it was in a separate ballot of SNP members. That means that Nicola Sturgeon can now formally appoint Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater as ministers in the Scottish government and seek Holyrood's approval when MSPs return from their summer break next week. The outcome of that and most other parliamentary votes is now a foregone conclusion because one of the key features of an SNP-Green government is that it will have a built-in majority for what they've agreed, including an indyref2 bill. There are of course a range of policies including the desirability of economic growth, aviation, field sports and private schools that sit outside their agreement. These topics and the compromises reached over road building and oil and gas extraction could be the source of future tension between the power-sharing partners. The co-leaders insisted the agreement will be good for Scotland, the country's efforts to tackle the climate crisis and contains ""transformational"" policies such as implementing rent controls. Lorna Slater became an MSP in May's Scottish election Ms Slater, the newly-elected Lothian MSP, said the members' overwhelming support would give the party ""the tools we need to tackle the climate crisis and implement transformative politics in Scotland"". She told BBC Scotland: ""With the Scottish Greens at the heart of government, we will see some real changes. Things like rent controls will be transformative for people in Scotland. ""We can also accelerate the development of our renewable energy industry, which will create thousands of jobs as well as tackle the climate crisis."" Green activists James Puchowski, Chas Booth and Rosie Smith James Puchowski, co-convener of the Green Nation Council, believes  the deal offers the chance to have a real influence on government policy. ""They're weighing up some things that I don't think three or four years ago we'd ever had a chance of getting - which is basically getting ministers inside Scottish government and maintaining opposition in the background."" Party member Rosie Smith backs the deal, but is worried it could backfire for the Greens. ""When I first saw it, especially the rent control section, it kind of felt a little bit like Christmas. What worries me about it is just hesitancy to enter coalitions having seen how badly it can go elsewhere in the UK."" Chas Booth, a Green councillor in Edinburgh, voted against the deal. He wasn't against a deal in principle, but felt this agreement didn't do enough to protect local services after years of cuts. ""I didn't see enough in this deal that would protect local councils and local services like leisure services, parks and stuff like - and that's why I voted against it. ""I accept there's an awful lot of stuff in here that is really good policy  - on active travel, on equal rights, on energy efficiency in our hands - but I felt that gap on local authorities and local services is something that Greens shouldn't support."" Ms Slater cited oil and gas extraction policies as an area of disagreement between the Scottish Greens and SNP, but added: ""I am very hopeful and optimistic about the change of travel that we've seen. ""When the first minister wrote to Boris Johnson the other week andasked him to reconsider the Cambo oil field, that was a significant change of direction for the Scottish government whose previous position was maximum economic extraction. ""Having Greens around has even turned the dial of that far, and I know that, by having Greens in government, we can continue to push that dial around and really tackle the climate crisis."" Patrick Harvie said it was the right time for the Greens to be in government Mr Harvie, who has spent 18 years in opposition at Holyrood, said it felt ""incredibly exciting"" to be on the brink of government. He said: ""I am delighted that our party members have given their support to this historic co-operation agreement that will see Greens enter government for the first time in Scotland, or indeed anywhere in the UK. ""With Greens in government we will be able to deliver positive change for the people of Scotland."" TheSNP's ruling body endorsed the power-sharing agreementlast weekend. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""delighted"" that members of both parties had agreed to work together. She said: ""This historic agreement will provide a strong platform for the transformative programme we want to deliver. ""We will work collaboratively to support a fair recovery from Covid, address with urgency the impacts of the climate emergency, and give the people of Scotland a vote on independence."" Scottish Conservative chief whip, Stephen Kerr, said the SNP/Green deal would be ""devastating for workers and our economic recovery"". He said: ""The SNP and Greens will put their obsession with a divisive referendum ahead of what is best for Scotland. ""Nicola Sturgeon failed to win a majority in May's election and now has had to cut a deal with a radical anti-jobs party, solely to ramp up her campaign for independence."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the deal proved the Green party was ""in many ways a branch office of the SNP"". He said: ""The Green party over the course of the last parliament voted through big cuts to local government budgets and voted against a pay rise for care workers. ""This is a deal that is not about the environment, it's about the independence agenda. ""It's not about building transparency and accountability of the government. It's about control for Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP so that they can largely ignore parliament. And I think that is really unfortunate for our democracy.""

"The government has announced plans to ban single-use plastic cutlery, plates and polystyrene cups in England as part of what it calls a ""war on plastic"". Ministers said the move would help to reduce litter and cut the amount of plastic waste in oceans. A consultation on the policy will launch in the autumn - although the government has not ruled out including other items in the ban. But environmental activists said more urgent and wider action was needed. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland already have plans to ban single-use plastic cutlery, and the European Union brought in a similar ban in July - putting ministers in England under pressure to take similar action. 'Staggering' levels of plastic pollution by 2040 20 firms make half of all one-use plastic Plastic straws and cotton buds banned in England On average, each person in England uses 18 single-use plastic plates and 37 single-use plastic items of cutlery every year, according to government figures. Ministers are also hoping to introduce measuresunder its Environment Bill,externalto tackle plastic pollution - such as a deposit return scheme on plastic bottles to encourage recycling and a plastic packaging tax - but this new plan would be an additional tool. The Environment Bill is going through Parliament and is not yet law. A consultation on thedeposit return scheme proposal for England, Wales and Northern Ireland,externalfinished in June. Environment Secretary George Eustice said everyone had ""seen the damage that plastic does to our environment"" and it was right to ""put in place measures that will tackle the plastic carelessly strewn across our parks and green spaces and washed up on beaches"". He added: ""We have made progress to turn the tide on plastic, banning the supply of plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds, while our carrier bag charge has cut sales by 95% in the main supermarkets. ""These plans will help us stamp out the unnecessary use of plastics that wreak havoc with our natural environment."" But the ban may take over a year to become law, with legislation needing to go through Parliament, and it is understood it could be April 2023 before it comes into force. Campaigners have urged the government to move quickly. Jo Morley, from the campaign group City to Sea, told the BBC she welcomed the news but it was ""just the tip of the iceberg"". She added: ""We need the government to go much, much, much further, we are facing a plastics crisis and we need to turn off the tap. ""We are really facing an environmental crisis, our oceans are full of plastic, and they're killing marine life, they are damaging our eco-systems and they are actually threatening human health."" Kierra Box from Friends of the Earth echoed the concerns. She said: ""We need government to take an overall approach to say that what we are going to do is bring an end to all plastic pollution, and what we're going to do is drastically reduce the amount of all single-use products, not just a fork followed by a spoon followed by a cup.""

"A sick child in Houston, Texas, is taken to hospital after testing positive for Covid The US intelligence community has been unable to determine the origins of Covid-19, and is split on whether it leaked from a lab or developed in nature, according to a new report. The report issued by the office that oversees the nation's 18 spy agencies did conclusively determine that it was not developed as a biological weapon. Experts warn that time is running out to gather evidence of its beginnings. China's foreign minister has dismissed the report as ""anti-science"". The report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the intelligence community remains divided on Covid's most likely origin. ""All agencies assess that two hypotheses are plausible: natural exposure to an infected animal and a laboratory-associated incident."" According to the report, several unnamed spy agencies thought Covid emerged from ""natural exposure to an animal infected with it or a close progenitor virus"". But they only had ""low confidence"" in this conclusion. One intelligence agency developed ""moderate confidence"" that the first human infection was likely due a ""laboratory-associated incident"" at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which has studied coronaviruses in bats for more than a decade. President Biden issued a statement after the report's publication, criticising China for not co-operating with the investigation. ""Critical information about the origins of this pandemic exists in the People's Republic of China, yet from the beginning, government officials in China have worked to prevent international investigators and members of the global public health community from accessing it,"" Mr Biden said. ""The world deserves answers, and I will not rest until we get them, ""he added. The pandemic, which has claimed nearly 4.5 million lives around the world, began in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. Why the lab-leak theory is being taken seriously The US base behind China's latest Covid conspiracy A World Health Organization (WHO) team, which visited Wuhan, concluded earlier this year that the disease most likely spilled over from an animal sold at a market. This conclusion has been rejected by some scientists. In May, Mr Biden asked US intelligence agencies to assess the data and produce a report that ""could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion"" on the origins of the virus. This video can not be played Covid-19 and Wuhan: Why don't we know more? China meanwhile has been stoking baseless claims that virus originated from Fort Detrick, a military installation in the US. Earlier this week, the WHO panel warned that it would soon be ""biologically impossible""Â to gather evidence dating back to the virus' origin. ""The window of opportunity for conducting this crucial inquiry is closing fast,""they warned,external, calling on researchers and governments to expedite studies.

"Celebrities including Tinashe, Katy Perry and Hailey Bieber have worked with Shein Chinese fast fashion firm Shein has launched an investigation into ""false"" discriminatory job adverts posted on recruitment sites under its name. Adverts seen by the BBC for factory and warehouse workers said those from certain ethnic minority backgrounds, including Uyghurs, must not apply. Shein said it did not fund or approve the ads, and it was committed to ""upholding high labour standards"". The plight of the Uyghurs in China has sparked international condemnation. Fast-growing Shein competes with the likes of Boohoo in the market for young shoppers and has collaborated with celebrities and influencers to build its online following. Several adverts were posted under Shein's name between April and December of 2020 on Chinese recruitment websites. They offered jobs working in its Guangzhou factories or warehouses earning about 16 yuan (Â£1.81) per hour, as well as saying workers did not need to get tested for Covid - or pass a medical exam to work on-site - at the height of the pandemic. Shein apologises for selling Muslim prayer mats Could ditching 'fast fashion' make us happier? Who are the Uyghurs? A Shein spokesperson said the company was ""surprised and concerned"" to see the adverts using language that ""goes against"" its hiring principles. ""Shein is fully committed to upholding high labour standards across our entire supply chain and to improving the lives of workers in the global supply chain by supporting national and international efforts to end forced labour,"" they said, adding it has strict requirements for its suppliers and does not tolerate discrimination. Its recruitment company, Guangzhou Zhongzhi Human Resources Management, also said it would ""investigate the individuals who fraudulently used our company's name to release false information"" and hold them ""accountable to the fullest extent of the law"". ""We sincerely apologise for the impact this incident had on Shein and related applicants due to our company's negligence,"" it said in a letter. Â£5 tops, Â£10 midi skirts - and even a Â£30 wedding dress. Shein is winning over young shoppers in the US, UK and Europe by producing fast fashion even faster, and often at cheaper prices, than many of its rivals such as Boohoo or Asos. Founded in 2008, Shein reportedly relies on thousands of third-party suppliers in China to produce batches of clothes, which it orders again if they perform well with customers. Georgia Toffolo and other British influencers have collaborated on clothing lines with the fast fashion firm Odds are if you're over the age of 30, you might not have heard of the Chinese company. But on Instagram and TikTok, it's hard to escape videos of Shein ""hauls"", where users try on and review different outfits by the brand. Using an army of influencers, from student ""campus ambassadors"" to reality stars such as Made in Chelsea's Georgia Toffolo or Amber Turner from The Only Way Is Essex, it has amassed more than 24 million followers. ""For a retailer without physical stores and a company that is virtually unknown to anyone but their target audience, Shein has utilised social media to reach consumers directly and become arguably the biggest digital clothing retailer,"" said Juozas KaziukÄnas, founder of research firm Marketplace Pulse. Its meteoric rise has not been without problems, though. The private company has not disclosed financial figures and has been criticised for selling items such as a Muslim prayer mat described as a ""Greek carpet"", which it was forced to withdraw. It has also been accused of copyright infringement and faces lawsuits from the likes of the maker of Dr Martens boots, although the e-retailer denies any wrongdoing and a hearing is scheduled later this year. The prices for Shein's on-trend fashion items have sparked concerns online about sustainability and its labour practices. Its website previously stated that Shein was ""proudly in compliance with strict fair labour standards set by international organisations like SA8000"". The SA8000 certification is issued to companies who have their performance measured in areas such as forced and child labour, health and safety and working hours. But Social Accountability International (SAI), which created the standard, told the BBC in June that Shein was not certified and never had been to its knowledge. ""Companies sometimes reference SA8000 in their advertising if they use SA8000 principles in their internal social compliance programs or if they source from SA8000-certified facilities,"" an SA8000 spokesperson said. ""As long as a company does not claim to be certified and does not mention the SA8000 disingenuously, we do not consider it a violation to refer to the SA8000 Standard principles in this way."" The reference on Shein's website has since been removed. It is alleged that Uyghur people are forced to pick cotton that supplies the global market The discriminatory job adverts described as false by Shein were shared with the BBC by the Coalition to End Uyghur Forced Labour. ""What is really important is to be able to distinguish between those companies that are actually taking meaningful steps to respect the workers in their supply chains and those that are failing to do so,"" said Chloe Cranston, business and human rights manager at Anti-Slavery International, which forms part of the coalition. In recent months, several big brands have come under scrutiny due to their activities in China's Xinjiang region. French prosecutors announced in Julythey were looking into accusations that Zara-owner Inditex, Uniqlo, SMCP and Skechers sourced goods made by forced labour from Uyghur Muslims in China. Skechers declined to comment, while the other three firms denied the claims. The Xinjiang region produces 85% of China's cotton and accounts for about a fifth of global supplies.

"The UK's pig producers are warning that a shortage of workers is causing a surplus of pigs to be stuck at farms. Trade body the National Pig Association (NPA) said some abattoirs were running 25% below usual capacity. ""If the government doesn't do something soon there will be a lot of perfectly healthy pigs on farms that will have to be destroyed,"" said Zoe Davies, chief executive of the NPA. Each week, the number of excess pigs is growing by 15,000, the NPA said. The shortage of workers in processing plants means they are unable to take in as many pigs to process as they normally would - resulting in too many pigs on farms. Having to house the pigs for longer, while they grow at a rate of a kilo each day, is having a severe impact on the profitability of the farms, according to the NPA. Prisoners to plug worker shortage in meat industry Food firm in 'drastic' action amid driver shortage The industry body said extra costs of feed and abattoir charges for overweight pigs means many farms are operating at a loss. The problem is exacerbating an excess of pigs, which had already been causing issues since the UK left the EU at the beginning of 2021, the NPA added. ""We need access to skilled labour now and we need the government to be able to supply us with the means to find these staff,"" Ms Davies said. A spokesperson from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the government understands the ""importance of seasonal labour"" and is ""aware of the challenges"" that the pork industry has faced in recent months because of the pandemic and labour shortages. ""Defra has been working closely with the pig and processing sectors during this time,"" they said. ""We will continue to work closely with the sector and are keeping the market under close review, recognising the pressures industry is currently facing."" The NPA, which represents 80% of the UK's pig producers, said its members had ""tried desperately"" to recruit people. ""They've upped wages but there are a good proportion of people that left after Brexit and you can't just fill those jobs with thin air,"" Ms Davies said. The NPA said that the wasted meat from the surplus of pigs which could have gone into the food supply chain, will result in the UK's food sector having to import more from the EU. ""We have a good supply of willing people in other countries who do want to come and want to work and they should be allowed to do that,"" Ms Davies added. The meat-processing industry is calling on the government for help in facilitating workers from overseas to solve the shortages. The NPA estimate that up to 80% of staff at meat processing plants are non-UK workers. The UK has about five million pigs in total and 40% of the pork eaten in the country is British while 15-20% is exported. Brexit and Covid-19 and have put serious pressures on the food industry, which has already seen ashortage of fruit pickers,lorry driversandfast-food restaurantsunable to provide normal service.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""If Taliban want engagement then safe passage is absolutely paramount."" Boris Johnson says he will ""shift heaven and earth"" to help people leave Kabul after 31 August, as evacuations by the UK enter the final stages. The prime minister said he felt a ""great sense of regret"" about those left behind in Afghanistan. No more people are being called to the airport to leave, with the Ministry of Defence saying it had closed processing facilities in Kabul. American troops will withdraw by the end of the month. The US has been running the airport in Afghanistan's capital, where at least 95 people - includingtwo British nationals and the child of a British national- were killed in a suicide bomb attack on Thursday. Mr Johnson said: ""Of course, as we come down to the final hours of the operation there will sadly be people who haven't got through, people who might qualify. ""What I would say to them is that we will shift heaven and earth to help them get out, we will do whatever we can in the second phase."" He added that ""the timing of this is certainly not the one that this country would have chosen, and I think that everybody understands that"". Kabul airport attack: What do we know? British nationals killed in airport bombing Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has expressed ""deep regret"" that not everyone eligible had been evacuated from Afghanistan, including around 800 to 1,100 Afghans and 100 to 150 Britons. But Mr Wallace said the UK's withdrawal ""wasn't hastened by the attack"" on Thursday. At least 150 people were also wounded in the blast, which the group known as Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) says it was behind. Thirteen of the victims were US military personnel. This video can not be played Defence Secretary Ben Wallace: UK will evacuate final 1,000 people on Friday It had earlier been thought there were two explosions, but the Pentagon said on Friday that there had been no second explosion at, or near, the Baron Hotel, which is close to the airport. On Friday evening, the MoD said 14,543 people had been evacuated by the UK from Kabul under Operation Pitting, which began on 13 August. This includes British nationals as well as the nearly 8,000 Afghans eligible under the UK's relocation scheme for those who worked for the UK government, along with other vulnerable individuals. But the MoD said the UK's ability to process any more evacuations is now ""extremely reduced and additional numbers will be limited"", with the focus turning to getting diplomats and service personnel out of the country. Liverpool man in rescue bid says no escape now Tired and scared, Afghans start new lives in the UK Afghan details found in British embassy in Kabul Mr Wallace would not confirm when the last British troops would leave the country, but said this would be before the US withdrew by 31 August. He added that the risk of attacks by the Islamic State group in Afghanistan would increase as foreign forces left. Among those who have been trying to flee the country is Sharif Karimi, a former British Army interpreter who is still in Kabul. He told the BBC he was ""so worried"". He said he had been told to travel to the airport - but was not allowed through a Taliban checkpoint and went home after spending five hours there. Mr Karimi said he had been sent a letter showing he was eligible to travel to the UK but despite this, had been left behind. ""I am scared that if we are not evacuated soon from Afghanistan, we will be found by the Taliban and killed,"" he said. He called on the UK government to get him, and others in his position, to help get him out ""as soon as possible"". Another man who remains in Kabul, an English language trainer for the British Council who worked with Afghan school teachers, told the BBC he felt he and dozens of colleagues had been ""left to die by the UK government"". The man - who the BBC is not naming for his own safety - said he was told by the British Council to apply for the UK's Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy scheme because he worked directly for the British government. He said he applied for the scheme but never heard back. ""We see our colleagues dying every day. Our colleague was shot this week,"" he said. ""Our only hope was to be able to evacuate and travel to the UK. But that didn't happen. Right now we don't know what to do. ""In return for our services to the UK, we have been gifted to the Taliban."" While the evacuation operation from the airport is coming to an end, Mr Wallace told the Today programme the UK's Afghan relocation scheme would remain open ""indefinitely"". He added that if eligible people were able to get to other countries, the UK could process them there. The defence secretary said it was likely the Taliban would want to keep the airport functioning in the future and people may be able to leave by that route ""in the medium term"". This video can not be played Getting the plane out of Afghanistan was ""happiest moment of my life"" Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, who served in Afghanistan, said the military had done ""an amazing job"" but many people, including his own interpreter, would not get out of the country. ""I'm not giving up but my anger and shame for those we've left behind to be hunted by the Taliban is growing,""he said in a tweet,external. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer praised the ""courage and heroism"" of troops and officials who helped with the evacuation. However, he said the UK government ""must take its fair share of the responsibility"" for people being left behind and ""has serious questions to answer about how, despite having 18 months to prepare, their failure to plan and inability to influence others has contributed to this tragic political failure"".

"A wounded patient is brought by a taxi to the Emergency hospital in Kabul after the attacks Survivors have spoken of their horror after twin blasts hit crowds of people awaiting evacuation outside Kabul's airport on Thursday. Most witnesses have not been named for their own safety. One Afghan, who previously worked with an international development group and who holds a US visa, was among the thousands of people who had been waiting outside Kabul's airport for hours when the explosion struck. Thousands of people were waiting outside the airport when the attacks began ""It was as if someone pulled the ground from under my feet. For a moment I thought my eardrums were blasted and I lost my sense of hearing,"" he told Reuters news agency. ""I saw bodies and body parts flying in the air like a tornado taking plastic bags... into the air. I saw bodies, body parts, elderly and injured men, women and children scattered in the blast site. ""It is not possible to see doomsday in this life, but today I saw doomsday, I witnessed it with my own eyes."" Latest updates Kabul airport attack: What do we know? Previously, he said, police and security forces would work to clear the scenes of attacks, but in the aftermath of Thursday's bombing ""there was no-one to handle the issue and move the bodies and the wounded to hospital or take them out of sight of the public"". ""Bodies and wounded were lying in the road and in the sewage canal. The little water flowing into it had turned into blood,"" he recalled. A Taliban fighter stands at the scene of the attack ""Physically, I am OK... but I don't think the mental wound and the shock I sustained from today's blast will ever let me live a normal life."" Other witnesses spoke of the chaos at the scene after the initial blast. ""When people heard the explosion, there was total panic,"" a man named Milad, who had been waiting outside the airport with his wife and three children, told the AFP news agency. ""The Taliban then started firing in the air to disperse the crowd. I saw a man rushing with an injured baby in his hands."" ""I will never, ever want to go (to the airport) again. Death to America, its evacuation and visas,"" he said. This video can not be played Twin bombs exploded near the perimeter of Kabul airport, hours after warnings from Western governments Another man, a former interpreter with US forces in Afghanistan, told CBS News how he tried to save an injured child, who was around five years old. ""I just saw a lot of people got hurt and people that were lying on the ground. I saw a baby there and I went to her and I picked her up and started taking her to the hospital."" ""I took her to the hospital, but she died on my hands,"" he said. ""That's heart-breaking. What is going on right now is heart-breaking, this whole country has fallen apart."" ""I tried,"" the interpreter continued. ""I did my best to help her."" Images shared on social media showed desperate survivors bringing the injured to safety using any means available, including wheelbarrows and taxis. One man who helped others to a medical centre told Afghanistan's Tolo news that many people had been thrown down to the ground or into the water by the force of the blast. ""We carried the wounded here on stretchers - and look, my clothes are completely bloodied."" Worried relatives have gathered outside the Emergency hospital The Kabul Surgical Centre, run by the international medical charity Emergency, said that 60 people had arrived in less than two hours. The hospital's medical co-ordinator said in a post on the group's Twitter account that patients were ""terrified, their eyes totally lost in emptiness, their gaze blank.

"A local branch of the Islamic State group in Afghanistan has vowed to continue attacks now that Taliban militants are in control. So who are these IS militants? IS-K - Islamic State Khorasan Province - is the regional affiliate of the Islamic State group. It is the most extreme and violent of all the jihadist militant groups in Afghanistan. IS-K was set up in January 2015 at the height of IS's power in Iraq and Syria, before its self-declared caliphate was defeated and dismantled by a US-led coalition. It recruits both Afghan and Pakistani jihadists, especially defecting members of the Afghan Taliban who don't see their own organisation as extreme enough. ""Khorasan"" refers to a historical region covering parts of modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. The group initially included Pakistan until a separate Pakistan section was declared in May 2019. At its height the group numbered about 3,000 fighters. However, it has suffered significant casualties in clashes with both the US and Afghan security forces, and also with the Taliban. IS-K has targeted Afghan security forces, Afghan politicians and ministries, the Taliban, religious minorities, including Shia Muslims and Sikhs, US and Nato forces, and international agencies, including aid organisations. IS-K have been blamed for some of the worst atrocities in recent years, targeting girls' schools, hospitals and even a maternity ward, where they reportedly shot dead pregnant women and nurses. IS-K claimed responsibility for the deadly attack outside Kabul airport on 26 August Unlike the Taliban, whose interest is confined to Afghanistan, IS-K are part of the global IS network that seeks to carry out attacks on Western, international and humanitarian targets wherever they can reach them. IS-K are based in the eastern province of Nangarhar, close to drug and people-smuggling routes in and out of Pakistan. While most of its activities have been in Nangahar and Kabul, it has also claimed attacks in the provinces of Kunar, Jowzjan, Paktia, Kunduz and Herat. Peripherally yes, via a third party, the Haqqani network. According to researchers, there are strong links between IS-K and the Haqqani network, which in turn is closely linked to the Taliban. The man now in charge of security in Kabul is Khalil Haqqani who has had a $5m (Â£3.6m) bounty on his head. Dr Sajjan Gohel from the Asia Pacific Foundation has been monitoring the militant networks in Afghanistan for years. He says ""several major attacks between 2019 and 2021 involved collaboration between IS-K, the Taliban's Haqqani network and other terror groups based in Pakistan"". When the Taliban took over in Kabul on 15 August, the group released large numbers of prisoners from Pul-e-Charki jail, reportedly including IS and al-Qaeda militants. These people are now at large. But IS-K have major differences with the Taliban, accusing them of abandoning Jihad and the battlefield in favour of a negotiated peace settlement hammered out in ""posh hotels"" in Doha, Qatar. IS-K considers Taliban militants ""apostates"", making their killing lawful under their interpretation of Islamic law. IS militants now represent a major security challenge for the incoming Taliban government, something the Taliban leadership shares in common with Western intelligence agencies. Who are the Taliban?

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"". This video can not be played Former member of Afghan parliament: 'The Taliban would've killed me if they found me' Former member of the Afghan parliament, Naheed Farid, left Afghanistan because she feared the Taliban could kill her, and she worried about the safety of her children. Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"". Click here to read more about what the Taliban takeover means for Africa's jihadists Guterres also warned of extremists feeling emboldened Welcome to our live coverage of the latest developments in Afghanistan. The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world: Here are some of the latest graphics explaining the
coronavirus situation in the UK. The August bank holiday weekend is almost here and many people across the UK will be hoping to make the most of some late summer sun. Self-isolation rulesacross all four nations in the UK have been relaxed- but what about the rest of the Covid-19 restrictions? Social distancing rules have ended in England, Scotland and Wales, but not completely in Northern Ireland. And where do you still need a mask, or an NHS Covid pass? Here's a look at thelatest changes to the rulesacross the UK. A Blackpool taxi firm says it has lost 200 of the 500 drivers on its books after many quit to take jobs as delivery drivers during the pandemic. Taxi firms in the holiday resort town are now offering bonuses to attract new night drivers. Some also say long queues caused by shortages have resulted in anger and abuse by late-night revellers. The council has employed taxi marshals to control queues and has introduced new measures to make it easier for firms to recruit new drivers. Read morehere. Scientists advising the government say it's ""highly likely"" high levels of coronavirus will be seen in schools in England by the end of September. It would be ""sensible"" for the government to plan for this happening, they add in a Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) statement from 11 August. Cases in Scotland have reached a record high since schools reopened for autumn. A decision on whether a vaccine will be offered to 12-15-year-olds is expected soon. All 16 and 17-year-olds across the UK have now been offered a first dose of vaccine against Covid-19. Sage admits it is still difficult to work out whether schools are drivers of transmission, or simply reflecting the spread of the virus in the communities where they are located. But its scientific advisers add that if cases continue to rise, the more pupils and teachers that contract Covid-19, the more schools and education will be disrupted. Read morehere. The Covid outbreak at Ysbyty Gwynedd hospital hit five wards Two hospitals in north Wales have been hit with outbreaks of Covid. Betsi Cadwaladr health board says it is managing the outbreak on two wards at Ysbyty Gwynedd and one at Ysbyty Eryri in Caernarfon, Gwynedd.

coronavirus situation in the UK. The August bank holiday weekend is almost here and many people across the UK will be hoping to make the most of some late summer sun.

A Blackpool taxi firm says it has lost 200 of the 500 drivers on its books after many quit to take jobs as delivery drivers during the pandemic. Taxi firms in the holiday resort town are now offering bonuses to attract new night drivers. Some also say long queues caused by shortages have resulted in anger and abuse by late-night revellers.

Scientists advising the government say it's ""highly likely"" high levels of coronavirus will be seen in schools in England by the end of September. It would be ""sensible"" for the government to plan for this happening, they add in a Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) statement from 11 August. Cases in Scotland have reached a record high since schools reopened for autumn. A decision on whether a vaccine will be offered to 12-15-year-olds is expected soon. All 16 and 17-year-olds across the UK have now been offered a first dose of vaccine against Covid-19. Sage admits it is still difficult to work out whether schools are drivers of transmission, or simply reflecting the spread of the virus in the communities where they are located.

But there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world, andmany states in Africa have struggled to get doses. Find out more aboutvaccine progress around the world here. Scotland's first minister hasruled out a circuit breaker lockdownto combat surging cases, and has said she will be ""watching closely"" to assess whether these numbers might translate into serious illness and hospital admissions. Nicola Sturgeon is hopeful Scotland can get through its spike without the need for tough interventions, saysDavid Wallace Lockhart, BBC Scotland's political reporter. Instead, she hasappealed to the public to take voluntary actionto help avoid more rules in the future: by meeting outdoors, avoiding crowds and limiting physical contact. The coronavirus ""R number"" - the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to - is between 1.0 and 1.1 in England, according to the latest government figures. Last week, it was between 0.9 and 1.2. If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. An R number between 1.0 and 1.1 means that, on average, every 10 people infected will go on to infect between 10 and 11 others. People need to take precautions going forward amid rising Covid case rates, says Wales's health minister - including staying ""outside, if possible, over this bank holiday weekend"". Eluned Morgan says higher case rates are to be expected after restrictions were lifted. She tells BBC Radio Wales: ""At this point, it is important we hold our nerve and that we don't see this spreading further than necessary."" She urges young people, in particular, to take up the offer of a vaccine. This video can not be played Covid: Stay outside for the bank holiday, urges minister Â© 2025 BBC.

This video can not be played 'Magnificent', 'sensational' & the 'perfect player': Ronaldo's top Premier League moments Simon StoneSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live I was told yesterday that he told Juventus he was leaving, then we have this strange situation of him going to the training ground to pick up whatever he needed to pick up. Max Allegri did his press conference before Pep and Ole, and he said that Ronaldo had come in and said 'right I'm leaving, that's it' and I don't think he wouldn't done that without knowing that there was something there from him. I assume from there he knew he was going to Manchester United. When I spoke to people at City yesterday, they seemed to have been downplaying this momentum that had been building up. I wonder if it was always Ronaldo's intention to go to United if United expressed an interest. I'd be interested to know what the reality was because it just feels very definite in the end that Ronaldo was going to and wanted to go to United. I don't think that it's as simple as City didn't want to get involved so then he moved to United, but we may never know about that. Simon StoneSpeaking on BBC Radio 5 Live I'm surprised by the speed of this.

When you think the speed of transfers and conducting negotiations, all the various facets of what goes on in a transfer deal now, it does seem to have happened quite quickly.

Don't tell my wife but this might just trump the wedding!! Jamal Moore:How did Arsenal manage to be the biggest spenders in this crazy transfer window? BBC Radio 5 Live Mick Clegg, Manchester United's power development coach from 2000 to 2011, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""He's a very focused planner of what he wants to do. What he's been able to achieve while just looking at the best players when he was younger and making sure he was up to the job. Working with and them ultimately becoming a great player. ""Power, people think it's physical but power is in the brain. It's the ability to think, feel emotions and of course it's physical as well, but you have to be able to brings all these things together. ""You've got to be able to see, work things out, plan really well, make sure you the training you're doing is right for what you want and you have to put in the time and effort. People reduce power as speed x strength, but the power in the brain is way beyond that. Cristiano Ronaldo's brain is a very powerful brain because he looks at all angles and does everything necessary to be very successful."" Take a look at some of these numbers from Cristiano Ronaldo. In all competitions, Ronaldo has scored 674 goals in 895
appearances at club level across spells at Sporting Lisbon, Manchester United, Real
Madrid and Juventus. His best single season for goals was in 2014-15 at Madrid,
when he scored 61 goals in 54 games. During his first spell at Manchester United, Ronaldo scored 42 goals in 49 appearances in all competitions during the
2007-08 campaign, the third-most ever by a Man Utd player in a single season in
their entire history, behind only Denis Law and Ruud van Nistelrooy in 1963-64
and 2002-03 respectively. Between his Premier League debut in August 2003 and his final
appearance in May 2009, only Frank Lampard (131) and Thierry Henry (124) had a
hand in more Premier League goals than Ronaldo (118), with only Henry
scoring more goals (92) than Ronaldoâs tally of 84. Not sure why I wrote that last update in the style of Line of Duty.

West Ham doing well, all pundits predicting it's between Man City and Chelsea to win league. Then, Cristiano Ronaldo signed for Man Utd...Game on! Simon StoneSpeaking on BBC Radio 5 Live I remember speaking to Juventus when they spent 90million to
get Ronaldo from Real Madrid. They said that they'd worked out that it was more
than a football deal, because it would ensure their status within the top 12
European clubs and it was the top 12 that generated the most money that people
were interested in doing commercial deals with. I'm not sure it's as linear as saying 'how many shirts you
will sell' but clearly they will sell a huge number of shirts with Ronaldo on
the back, I'd have thought it would be off the scale. So if there was a feeling
that United have lost a bit of their mojo - they haven't won the league title
don't forget since 2013 - are they still the club that everyone thought of them
as being when Ronaldo was there first time around? There's no doubt that this
transfer will catapult them again. It won't do any harm for Ronaldo as well,
because he's associated with Manchester United which will allow him to maximise
his marketing potential. The key thing is that Man Utd and Ronaldo want to be
competing for the biggest prizes and that's something that United haven't done
since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 so they will hope that they have more
luck with Ronaldo than Juventus did. Simon StoneSpeaking on BBC Radio 5 Live It's incredible because amid the euphoria of Ronaldo
returning - and it is euphoric. This is a player that won three league titles
in successive seasons with United, he scored 42 goals in the year that
Manchester United won the Champions League - and he scored in the final - he is
an icon at Manchester Untied. Solskjaer said he is one of the greatest-ever players to
have played and he is synonymous with United having spent six years with the
club. It's a euphoric moment for the club, but there are questions
now. What happens to Cavani who has just signed a contract himself? What's his
role now? What is Jadon Sancho's role now? He was supposed to be the person who
was taking up that Ronaldo role so to speak, so there are question marks, but
at the moment they're all getting lost in Ronaldo coming back to Manchester

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""If Taliban want engagement then safe passage is absolutely paramount."" Boris Johnson says he will ""shift heaven and earth"" to help people leave Kabul after 31 August, as evacuations by the UK enter the final stages. The prime minister said he felt a ""great sense of regret"" about those left behind in Afghanistan. No more people are being called to the airport to leave, with the Ministry of Defence saying it had closed processing facilities in Kabul. American troops will withdraw by the end of the month. The US has been running the airport in Afghanistan's capital, where at least 95 people - includingtwo British nationals and the child of a British national- were killed in a suicide bomb attack on Thursday. Mr Johnson said: ""Of course, as we come down to the final hours of the operation there will sadly be people who haven't got through, people who might qualify. ""What I would say to them is that we will shift heaven and earth to help them get out, we will do whatever we can in the second phase."" He added that ""the timing of this is certainly not the one that this country would have chosen, and I think that everybody understands that"". Kabul airport attack: What do we know? British nationals killed in airport bombing Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has expressed ""deep regret"" that not everyone eligible had been evacuated from Afghanistan, including around 800 to 1,100 Afghans and 100 to 150 Britons. But Mr Wallace said the UK's withdrawal ""wasn't hastened by the attack"" on Thursday. At least 150 people were also wounded in the blast, which the group known as Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) says it was behind. Thirteen of the victims were US military personnel. This video can not be played Defence Secretary Ben Wallace: UK will evacuate final 1,000 people on Friday It had earlier been thought there were two explosions, but the Pentagon said on Friday that there had been no second explosion at, or near, the Baron Hotel, which is close to the airport. On Friday evening, the MoD said 14,543 people had been evacuated by the UK from Kabul under Operation Pitting, which began on 13 August. This includes British nationals as well as the nearly 8,000 Afghans eligible under the UK's relocation scheme for those who worked for the UK government, along with other vulnerable individuals. But the MoD said the UK's ability to process any more evacuations is now ""extremely reduced and additional numbers will be limited"", with the focus turning to getting diplomats and service personnel out of the country. Liverpool man in rescue bid says no escape now Tired and scared, Afghans start new lives in the UK Afghan details found in British embassy in Kabul Mr Wallace would not confirm when the last British troops would leave the country, but said this would be before the US withdrew by 31 August. He added that the risk of attacks by the Islamic State group in Afghanistan would increase as foreign forces left. Among those who have been trying to flee the country is Sharif Karimi, a former British Army interpreter who is still in Kabul. He told the BBC he was ""so worried"". He said he had been told to travel to the airport - but was not allowed through a Taliban checkpoint and went home after spending five hours there. Mr Karimi said he had been sent a letter showing he was eligible to travel to the UK but despite this, had been left behind. ""I am scared that if we are not evacuated soon from Afghanistan, we will be found by the Taliban and killed,"" he said. He called on the UK government to get him, and others in his position, to help get him out ""as soon as possible"". Another man who remains in Kabul, an English language trainer for the British Council who worked with Afghan school teachers, told the BBC he felt he and dozens of colleagues had been ""left to die by the UK government"". The man - who the BBC is not naming for his own safety - said he was told by the British Council to apply for the UK's Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy scheme because he worked directly for the British government. He said he applied for the scheme but never heard back. ""We see our colleagues dying every day. Our colleague was shot this week,"" he said. ""Our only hope was to be able to evacuate and travel to the UK. But that didn't happen. Right now we don't know what to do. ""In return for our services to the UK, we have been gifted to the Taliban."" While the evacuation operation from the airport is coming to an end, Mr Wallace told the Today programme the UK's Afghan relocation scheme would remain open ""indefinitely"". He added that if eligible people were able to get to other countries, the UK could process them there. The defence secretary said it was likely the Taliban would want to keep the airport functioning in the future and people may be able to leave by that route ""in the medium term"". This video can not be played Getting the plane out of Afghanistan was ""happiest moment of my life"" Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, who served in Afghanistan, said the military had done ""an amazing job"" but many people, including his own interpreter, would not get out of the country. ""I'm not giving up but my anger and shame for those we've left behind to be hunted by the Taliban is growing,""he said in a tweet,external. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer praised the ""courage and heroism"" of troops and officials who helped with the evacuation. However, he said the UK government ""must take its fair share of the responsibility"" for people being left behind and ""has serious questions to answer about how, despite having 18 months to prepare, their failure to plan and inability to influence others has contributed to this tragic political failure"".

"This video can not be played Sir Jeffrey Donaldson wants Ireland to encourage the EU to change its stance on the Northern Ireland Protocol Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has accused the Irish government of ""harming"" Northern Ireland's relationship with the rest of the UK through its support for the Brexit deal. His comment came after he met Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin. Their meeting in Dublin was their first since Sir Jeffrey became DUP leader. Mr Martin said he accepted unionists had ""genuine concerns"" over post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland. But Sir Jeffrey warned that relations between Dublin and Stormont could become ""untenable"" if problems with the Northern Ireland Protocol could not be resolved. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? MicheÃ¡l Martin says he accepts that unionists' have concerns about the Northern Ireland Protocol He called on the EU to ""change its tune"" on the protocol, which was agreed by the UK and EU to avoid a hard border in Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. That has created a new trade border in the Irish Sea, which is strongly opposed by unionists in Northern Ireland. ""If the Irish government persists in harming our relationship with the rest of the United Kingdom through this protocol then of course that has an impact on our relationship with Dublin,"" said Sir Jeffrey. ""We are expected to operate as normal on a north-south basis - that is not a tenable position and not one I intend to continue with if we cannot resolve the issues around the protocol and do so quickly."" The DUP leader said he told the taoiseach that unionists' concerns that the protocol was having an negative effect on Northern Ireland were ""certainly not diminishing"". This video can not be played The EU is ""ready to respond"" to concerns about the Northern Ireland Protocol, says MicheÃ¡l Martin He cited the ""harm that it's doing to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland"" and the ""political harm"" it could cause ahead of next year's Stormont assembly election. ""We need to address those issues and do so quickly - we need to remove the border that has developed between GB and Northern Ireland in trading terms,"" he said. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Martin said he would continue to speak to unionists about their worries in relation to the protocol. He called for a focus on maintaining relations between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. MicheÃ¡l Martin and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson met at Government Buildings in Dublin ""It would be awful if there was to be any disruption of that progressive work,"" he said. ""I accept from a unionist perspective that they have genuine concerns. ""We don't necessarily agree that they're ones that can't be overcome - we'd have a different perspective to that - but I acknowledge the sincerity of the perspective that has been articulated to us. ""Europe wants to help here but there needs to be very clear presentation from the UK side in terms of where they see the resolution of this."" On Thursday the Northern Ireland Protocol was a key topic of discussion whenFrench President Emmanuel Macron visited Dublin, where he met both Mr Martin and Irish President Michael D Higgins. Emmanuel Macron says Ireland has a ""faithful friend"" in France In the past Mr Macron has ruled out any renegotiation of the Brexit deal.

"A wounded patient is brought by a taxi to the Emergency hospital in Kabul after the attacks Survivors have spoken of their horror after twin blasts hit crowds of people awaiting evacuation outside Kabul's airport on Thursday. Most witnesses have not been named for their own safety. One Afghan, who previously worked with an international development group and who holds a US visa, was among the thousands of people who had been waiting outside Kabul's airport for hours when the explosion struck. Thousands of people were waiting outside the airport when the attacks began ""It was as if someone pulled the ground from under my feet. For a moment I thought my eardrums were blasted and I lost my sense of hearing,"" he told Reuters news agency. ""I saw bodies and body parts flying in the air like a tornado taking plastic bags... into the air. I saw bodies, body parts, elderly and injured men, women and children scattered in the blast site. ""It is not possible to see doomsday in this life, but today I saw doomsday, I witnessed it with my own eyes."" Latest updates Kabul airport attack: What do we know? Previously, he said, police and security forces would work to clear the scenes of attacks, but in the aftermath of Thursday's bombing ""there was no-one to handle the issue and move the bodies and the wounded to hospital or take them out of sight of the public"". ""Bodies and wounded were lying in the road and in the sewage canal. The little water flowing into it had turned into blood,"" he recalled. A Taliban fighter stands at the scene of the attack ""Physically, I am OK... but I don't think the mental wound and the shock I sustained from today's blast will ever let me live a normal life."" Other witnesses spoke of the chaos at the scene after the initial blast. ""When people heard the explosion, there was total panic,"" a man named Milad, who had been waiting outside the airport with his wife and three children, told the AFP news agency. ""The Taliban then started firing in the air to disperse the crowd. I saw a man rushing with an injured baby in his hands."" ""I will never, ever want to go (to the airport) again. Death to America, its evacuation and visas,"" he said. This video can not be played Twin bombs exploded near the perimeter of Kabul airport, hours after warnings from Western governments Another man, a former interpreter with US forces in Afghanistan, told CBS News how he tried to save an injured child, who was around five years old. ""I just saw a lot of people got hurt and people that were lying on the ground. I saw a baby there and I went to her and I picked her up and started taking her to the hospital."" ""I took her to the hospital, but she died on my hands,"" he said. ""That's heart-breaking. What is going on right now is heart-breaking, this whole country has fallen apart."" ""I tried,"" the interpreter continued. ""I did my best to help her."" Images shared on social media showed desperate survivors bringing the injured to safety using any means available, including wheelbarrows and taxis. One man who helped others to a medical centre told Afghanistan's Tolo news that many people had been thrown down to the ground or into the water by the force of the blast. ""We carried the wounded here on stretchers - and look, my clothes are completely bloodied."" Worried relatives have gathered outside the Emergency hospital The Kabul Surgical Centre, run by the international medical charity Emergency, said that 60 people had arrived in less than two hours. The hospital's medical co-ordinator said in a post on the group's Twitter account that patients were ""terrified, their eyes totally lost in emptiness, their gaze blank.

"The UK's pig producers are warning that a shortage of workers is causing a surplus of pigs to be stuck at farms. Trade body the National Pig Association (NPA) said some abattoirs were running 25% below usual capacity. ""If the government doesn't do something soon there will be a lot of perfectly healthy pigs on farms that will have to be destroyed,"" said Zoe Davies, chief executive of the NPA. Each week, the number of excess pigs is growing by 15,000, the NPA said. The shortage of workers in processing plants means they are unable to take in as many pigs to process as they normally would - resulting in too many pigs on farms. Having to house the pigs for longer, while they grow at a rate of a kilo each day, is having a severe impact on the profitability of the farms, according to the NPA. Prisoners to plug worker shortage in meat industry Food firm in 'drastic' action amid driver shortage The industry body said extra costs of feed and abattoir charges for overweight pigs means many farms are operating at a loss. The problem is exacerbating an excess of pigs, which had already been causing issues since the UK left the EU at the beginning of 2021, the NPA added. ""We need access to skilled labour now and we need the government to be able to supply us with the means to find these staff,"" Ms Davies said. A spokesperson from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the government understands the ""importance of seasonal labour"" and is ""aware of the challenges"" that the pork industry has faced in recent months because of the pandemic and labour shortages. ""Defra has been working closely with the pig and processing sectors during this time,"" they said. ""We will continue to work closely with the sector and are keeping the market under close review, recognising the pressures industry is currently facing."" The NPA, which represents 80% of the UK's pig producers, said its members had ""tried desperately"" to recruit people. ""They've upped wages but there are a good proportion of people that left after Brexit and you can't just fill those jobs with thin air,"" Ms Davies said. The NPA said that the wasted meat from the surplus of pigs which could have gone into the food supply chain, will result in the UK's food sector having to import more from the EU. ""We have a good supply of willing people in other countries who do want to come and want to work and they should be allowed to do that,"" Ms Davies added. The meat-processing industry is calling on the government for help in facilitating workers from overseas to solve the shortages. The NPA estimate that up to 80% of staff at meat processing plants are non-UK workers. The UK has about five million pigs in total and 40% of the pork eaten in the country is British while 15-20% is exported.

"A local branch of the Islamic State group in Afghanistan has vowed to continue attacks now that Taliban militants are in control. So who are these IS militants? IS-K - Islamic State Khorasan Province - is the regional affiliate of the Islamic State group. It is the most extreme and violent of all the jihadist militant groups in Afghanistan. IS-K was set up in January 2015 at the height of IS's power in Iraq and Syria, before its self-declared caliphate was defeated and dismantled by a US-led coalition. It recruits both Afghan and Pakistani jihadists, especially defecting members of the Afghan Taliban who don't see their own organisation as extreme enough. ""Khorasan"" refers to a historical region covering parts of modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. The group initially included Pakistan until a separate Pakistan section was declared in May 2019. At its height the group numbered about 3,000 fighters. However, it has suffered significant casualties in clashes with both the US and Afghan security forces, and also with the Taliban. IS-K has targeted Afghan security forces, Afghan politicians and ministries, the Taliban, religious minorities, including Shia Muslims and Sikhs, US and Nato forces, and international agencies, including aid organisations. IS-K have been blamed for some of the worst atrocities in recent years, targeting girls' schools, hospitals and even a maternity ward, where they reportedly shot dead pregnant women and nurses. IS-K claimed responsibility for the deadly attack outside Kabul airport on 26 August Unlike the Taliban, whose interest is confined to Afghanistan, IS-K are part of the global IS network that seeks to carry out attacks on Western, international and humanitarian targets wherever they can reach them. IS-K are based in the eastern province of Nangarhar, close to drug and people-smuggling routes in and out of Pakistan. While most of its activities have been in Nangahar and Kabul, it has also claimed attacks in the provinces of Kunar, Jowzjan, Paktia, Kunduz and Herat. Peripherally yes, via a third party, the Haqqani network. According to researchers, there are strong links between IS-K and the Haqqani network, which in turn is closely linked to the Taliban. The man now in charge of security in Kabul is Khalil Haqqani who has had a $5m (Â£3.6m) bounty on his head. Dr Sajjan Gohel from the Asia Pacific Foundation has been monitoring the militant networks in Afghanistan for years. He says ""several major attacks between 2019 and 2021 involved collaboration between IS-K, the Taliban's Haqqani network and other terror groups based in Pakistan"". When the Taliban took over in Kabul on 15 August, the group released large numbers of prisoners from Pul-e-Charki jail, reportedly including IS and al-Qaeda militants. These people are now at large. But IS-K have major differences with the Taliban, accusing them of abandoning Jihad and the battlefield in favour of a negotiated peace settlement hammered out in ""posh hotels"" in Doha, Qatar. IS-K considers Taliban militants ""apostates"", making their killing lawful under their interpretation of Islamic law. IS militants now represent a major security challenge for the incoming Taliban government, something the Taliban leadership shares in common with Western intelligence agencies. Who are the Taliban?

"Health officials are urging festival-goers this weekend to take a free rapid Covid test before they attend, stay outside and apart from other groups as much as possible. Experts say sharing public transport, tents and cars are key trigger points, with outdoor spaces far less risky. There is concern the events, in places like Reading and Leeds, could lead to a rise in cases in young people. All 16 and 17-year-olds have only recently been offered a Covid vaccine. And tens of thousands of them and older teenagers are expect to attend festivals this bank holiday weekend. Dr Susan Hopkins, of Public Health England (PHE), advised youngsters to wear a face covering if using public transport to travel to festivals, and also urged caution when they return home. ""You may well have caught Covid-19 while you've been away,"" she said. ""Make sure you take an LFD [lateral flow device] test when you get home and then test twice a week after having mixed with a large group of people. ""Try and avoid seeing older or more vulnerable relatives so that you don't pass anything on."" Reading Festival will be emotional, says boss Vaccine target set for 16 and 17-year-olds Waning immunity and rising cases - time to worry? Meradin Peachey, director of public health for west Berkshire, which covers Reading, said: ""Sixteen, 17-year-olds are the main groups that are going to be there and they're not covered yet. ""We are trying to ask people to show proof of a lateral flow test before you even get anywhere near the gates."" The Boardmasters Festival in Cornwall earlier this month, which attracted about 50,000 people,is thought to have created 4,700 coronavirus cases. But council leaders in the county, which has some of highest case rates in England, say there isno reason to cancel any holiday events this weekend. It comes as cases in the UK are climbing again with 38,046 cases and 100 deaths with Covid-19 reported on Friday. Cases are now at a similar to the number reported daily in mid-January around the winter peak. But the number of people admitted to hospital and dying with Covid is far below the levels seen then because of high levels of protection from the vaccines. The Office for National Statistics estimates that infection rates have increased across all four UK nations in the week up to 20 August, with some stark variations. The number of people thought to be infected is: one in 40 in Northern Ireland one in 70 in England one in 120 in Wales one in 140 in Scotland This video can not be played Stay outside for the bank holiday, urges Welsh minister Dr Michael Head, from the University of Southampton, said the main trigger points at mass gatherings were indoor settings. ""Where festival-goers are in a field, even in large numbers, the transmission risks will remain relatively low. ""It is the indoor shared spaces that are key, such as marquees, tents, or shared cars, and use of public transport to and from the event."" He said using masks would be helpful, and everyone should have a Covid-19 vaccine when offered one. Dr Julian Tang, clinical virologist at the University of Leicester, said people needed to make their own assessments of risk. But he said ""these are admittedly very difficult to make accurately without knowing your vaccine responses, those of others, as well as what viral loads people around you might be shedding at any point - and then your individual susceptibility to more severe or long-Covid complications"". The London Ambulance Service is also asking people to use its services wisely this weekend as it prepares for a busy bank holiday, which could be ""what we normally see on New Year's Eve"", it said. The service puts the extra demand down to increased spread of Covid in the community, more people being out and about, and travelling in and out of the capital. It said August was expected to be one of the busiest months ever for the service. Alicia Demirjian, incident director for Covid-19 at Public Health England (PHE), said: ""Cases of Covid-19 are still high, especially among young people. ""If you have Covid-19 symptoms, please do not go out - stay at home and get a PCR test as soon as possible. ""If you are heading to a festival or other event this bank holiday weekend, to protect your friends and others we encourage you to take a free rapid test before you leave to check that you do not have the virus."" PHE said it would be closely monitoring how the start of the school term, which is happening for many children next week in England, affects the number of new infections.

Men's wheelchair basketball Captain Ian Sagar says GB's men's wheelchair basketball team will ""fight back"" after they lost 71-59 to Germany for their first defeat of the Games. They face the USA tomorrow in their third group B game. âNot the result we wanted
today,"" said Sagar. ""We know the players, we know the team and we know Germany are capable of
shooting well and today it was just world-class shooting. âNot the result we wanted, we are ranked number one in the world
and as the number one ranked team we are going to come back, we are going to
fight back. âIt is the USA tomorrow, one of the biggest teams in the world
and that is perfect for us. We are going to come back tomorrow, we are going to
war, and we are going to get this tournament back on track.â FT: USA 50-48 Great Britain Great Britain's mistake early in the fourth quarter was punished as the USA took the lead quickly and never looked back. Despite their best efforts to force a turnover, both teams traded scores as the USA kept GB at arms length by trading scores once they took the lead. The Americans sealed the win when they forced another loose pass that ran out of play as GB went in search of an equaliser. GB will take on Japan in the semi-finals on Saturday, while in the other semi, Australia will face either New Zealand or Canada. Para-archery The archery got under way in Tokyo today, with Jessica Stretton setting a new Paralympic record of 694 to finish first in
the women's individual compound open ranking round. She will progress straight to Monday's last 16. ""Setting a new Paralympic record does feel
amazing, it hasn't really sunk in yet,"" she said. Phoebe Paterson Pine will compete in the first elimination round on Sunday after finishing 16th in the ranking round in the same event as Stretton.

sixth. And in the individual recurve open ranking rounds, Hazel Chaisty finished 12th in the women's and David Phillips was 26th in the men's. Allow Twitter content?

His Games comes to an end in the first round against Spain's Daniel Caverzaschi, beaten in straight sets 6-2 6-0. USA 34-35 Great Britain Great Britain scored with just under 10 seconds left in the third quarter to take a one-score lead into the fourth.

"A wounded patient is brought by a taxi to the Emergency hospital in Kabul after the attacks Survivors have spoken of their horror after twin blasts hit crowds of people awaiting evacuation outside Kabul's airport on Thursday. Most witnesses have not been named for their own safety. One Afghan, who previously worked with an international development group and who holds a US visa, was among the thousands of people who had been waiting outside Kabul's airport for hours when the explosion struck. Thousands of people were waiting outside the airport when the attacks began ""It was as if someone pulled the ground from under my feet. For a moment I thought my eardrums were blasted and I lost my sense of hearing,"" he told Reuters news agency. ""I saw bodies and body parts flying in the air like a tornado taking plastic bags... into the air. I saw bodies, body parts, elderly and injured men, women and children scattered in the blast site. ""It is not possible to see doomsday in this life, but today I saw doomsday, I witnessed it with my own eyes."" Latest updates Kabul airport attack: What do we know? Previously, he said, police and security forces would work to clear the scenes of attacks, but in the aftermath of Thursday's bombing ""there was no-one to handle the issue and move the bodies and the wounded to hospital or take them out of sight of the public"". ""Bodies and wounded were lying in the road and in the sewage canal. The little water flowing into it had turned into blood,"" he recalled. A Taliban fighter stands at the scene of the attack ""Physically, I am OK... but I don't think the mental wound and the shock I sustained from today's blast will ever let me live a normal life."" Other witnesses spoke of the chaos at the scene after the initial blast. ""When people heard the explosion, there was total panic,"" a man named Milad, who had been waiting outside the airport with his wife and three children, told the AFP news agency. ""The Taliban then started firing in the air to disperse the crowd. I saw a man rushing with an injured baby in his hands."" ""I will never, ever want to go (to the airport) again. Death to America, its evacuation and visas,"" he said. This video can not be played Twin bombs exploded near the perimeter of Kabul airport, hours after warnings from Western governments Another man, a former interpreter with US forces in Afghanistan, told CBS News how he tried to save an injured child, who was around five years old. ""I just saw a lot of people got hurt and people that were lying on the ground. I saw a baby there and I went to her and I picked her up and started taking her to the hospital."" ""I took her to the hospital, but she died on my hands,"" he said. ""That's heart-breaking. What is going on right now is heart-breaking, this whole country has fallen apart."" ""I tried,"" the interpreter continued. ""I did my best to help her."" Images shared on social media showed desperate survivors bringing the injured to safety using any means available, including wheelbarrows and taxis. One man who helped others to a medical centre told Afghanistan's Tolo news that many people had been thrown down to the ground or into the water by the force of the blast. ""We carried the wounded here on stretchers - and look, my clothes are completely bloodied."" Worried relatives have gathered outside the Emergency hospital The Kabul Surgical Centre, run by the international medical charity Emergency, said that 60 people had arrived in less than two hours. The hospital's medical co-ordinator said in a post on the group's Twitter account that patients were ""terrified, their eyes totally lost in emptiness, their gaze blank.

"This video can not be played Twin bombs exploded near the perimeter of Kabul airport, hours after warnings from Western governments President Joe Biden has promised to hunt down the jihadists behind an attack in Kabul which killed at least 90 people - including 13 US troops. Mr Biden warned the US would ""not forgive"" the perpetrators. The twin blasts, claimed by a local branch of Islamic State (IS), tore through crowds of men, women and children outside Kabul airport. They were hoping to join the 100,000 people airlifted out of Afghanistan since it fell to Taliban militants. There had been repeated warnings that an attack was likely, but it either did not reach or did not deter those waiting. US troops in control of Kabul international airport have been facilitating the evacuation of foreign nationals and Afghans who had been working with foreign missions. They have been aiming to complete this within a 31 August deadline for US forces to leave under an agreement with the Taliban. A number of European countries have already announced the end of their evacuation plans. The UK said on Friday it would not be processing any more applications, acknowledging it was leaving people behind. Speaking hours after Thursday's attack, Mr Biden vowed to complete the evacuation mission, adding ""we will not be deterred by terrorists"". Who are IS-K? He said the US military had been ordered to attack the leadership, assets and facilities of the group known as Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K), active in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The group is part of the global IS network, but has local links - even to the Taliban. However, IS-K have accused the Taliban of abandoning the battlefield in favour of a negotiated peace settlement. The attack at the airport - which began at about 18:00 local time (13:30 GMT) - targeted ""translators and collaborators with the American army"", the jihadist group said. The first blast happened near the Abbey Gate, where US and British forces have been checking people entering the airport, followed by a second minutes later  at a hotel which was used by British officials to process Afghans hoping to travel to the UK. Survivors described the horror in the wake of the attack, with one saying they saw ""bodies and body parts flying in the air like a tornado blowing plastic bags"". Another recounted how they tried to take an injured baby to safety, only for the child to die in their arms. Pictures being shared on social media suggest families have lost several members. Hospitals were quickly overwhelmed with the injured. Alberto Zanin, the medical director of one facility run by Italian NGO Emergency, described on Twitter how the victims ""could not speak, many were terrified, their eyes totally lost in emptiness, their gaze blank"". Thursday's events as they happened Airport attack: What we know Thirteen US troops were among those killed - the first US military casualties in Afghanistan since February 2020. Mr Biden said the troops who had died ""were heroes who were on a selfless mission to save the lives of others"". The head of US Central Command, Gen Frank McKenzie, said the threat from IS-K remained high and US forces were working with Taliban to try to stop further attacks and that the Taliban had already prevented many. But the attack is likely to significantly complicate the evacuation effort ahead of the deadline. There are currently 5,800 US troops on the ground at Kabul airport with a further 1,000 UK troops also there. To date, 104,000 civilians have been transferred from Afghanistan, including 66,000 by the US and 37,000 by allies and partners. Where will all the Afghan refugees go? UK enters final stages of Afghan evacuation About 5,000 people are waiting at the airport and many more are still trying to get through the perimeter checkpoints. A number of countries, including Canada, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Denmark had already stopped their operations. Turkey has announced that its troops, who had been providing security at the airport for six years, were withdrawing. Kabul attack: What we know Attack leaves many casualties.

Taxi firms in the holiday resort town are now offering bonuses to attract new night drivers. Some also say long queues caused by shortages have resulted in anger and abuse by late-night revellers. The council has employed taxi marshals to control queues and has introduced new measures to make it easier for firms to recruit new drivers. Read morehere. Scientists advising the government say it's ""highly likely"" high levels of coronavirus will be seen in schools in England by the end of September. It would be ""sensible"" for the government to plan for this happening, they add in a Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) statement from 11 August. Cases in Scotland have reached a record high since schools reopened for autumn. A decision on whether a vaccine will be offered to 12-15-year-olds is expected soon. All 16 and 17-year-olds across the UK have now been offered a first dose of vaccine against Covid-19. Sage admits it is still difficult to work out whether schools are drivers of transmission, or simply reflecting the spread of the virus in the communities where they are located. But its scientific advisers add that if cases continue to rise, the more pupils and teachers that contract Covid-19, the more schools and education will be disrupted. Read morehere. The Covid outbreak at Ysbyty Gwynedd hospital hit five wards Two hospitals in north Wales have been hit with outbreaks of Covid. Betsi Cadwaladr health board says it is managing the outbreak on two wards at Ysbyty Gwynedd and one at Ysbyty Eryri in Caernarfon, Gwynedd. It says it is caring for 34 patients with Covid-19 infections across both sites, 14 of which are have confirmed hospital-acquired infections. Affected patients are being isolated and wards are currently closed while visiting remains restricted. The health board's executive director of nursing and midwifery Gill Harris says cases in the community have been increasing in recent weeks leading to a rise in the number of patients needing hospital treatment for the virus.

Today is the 15th day in August that thenumber of deaths recorded in the UK,externalof someone who had tested positive for coronavirus in the previous 28 days has been 100 or more. That underlines a substantial rise in deaths this month after several months of lower figures. For context, there was only one day in the whole of April, May, June and July when the the number of deaths announced was in three figures - that was 27 July, when 131 deaths were reported. Today is the last Friday of August, and while today's figure is actually lower than last Friday's when 114 fatalities were reported, you have to go back all the way to February and the winter wave of the virus to find a higher figure for the final Friday of the month. Here are the numbers of deaths recorded in the UK on the last Friday of the previous months this year: Thelatest figures,externalshow deaths have increased by 9.9% from the previous week (14 to 20 August), with 756 recorded in the past seven days, a rise of 68. Cases have risen 9.1% from the previous week, with 239,237 recorded between 21
and 27 August, an increase of 19,887. Another 55,140 people in the UK have had a first dose
of a coronavirus vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 88.2% of the adult population has now had at least one jab. And a further 144,936 have had a second
vaccine dose now. As of today, 78.0% of the adult
population has now had both jabs. Correction 17 September 2021: This post originally said deaths had increased 9.9% per 100,000 people from the previous week. It has been corrected to simply reflect that deaths had increased by 9.9% from the previous week. There
have been a further 38,046 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK today,
according to thelatest government
figures,external. And
there have been another 100 deaths of people
who had tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. In London, usage of the Tube network is regularly reaching at least half of pre-pandemic levels,Transport for London (TfL) says. On weekdays, demand is often at 50% of what it was before the pandemic, and it is reaching more than 60% at weekends. This is up from about 40% across the entire week in early May. An average of more than 1.8 million journeys are being made on the London Underground every weekday. Last weekend, passenger numbers were at 58% of pre-pandemic levels on Saturday and 62% on Sunday. Bus travel in the afternoon is also continuing to grow. Overall demand is reaching about two-thirds of pre-pandemic levels on weekdays and hitting up to 75% at weekends. About 3.5 million journeys are being made every weekday on London buses, which is likely to increase further once schools return from next week. England football manager Gareth Southgate says he was targeted for abuse after supporting the UK government drive to get more young people vaccinated. Southgatedelivered a video messagebacking the programme shortly after England's defeat by Italy on penalties in the final of Euro 2020 in July. He says: ""I was asked to do a video supporting the vaccination programme, which I thought was responsible. ""And of all the things that I've received abuse for over the summer - of which there's been several - that's probably the one I've received the most abuse over."" Southgate says, as a result, he is going to keep out of the argument ""for the time being"". But while admitting ""it's very much an individual situation"", Southgate adds: ""Our only way out of this pandemic across the world are the vaccinations - certainly for the vulnerable people."" This video can not be played Gareth Southgate: 'Go and get your Covid vaccine done' Denmark will end all coronavirus restrictions by 10 September, according to health officials, who say the virus no longer poses a ""threat to society"" thanks to the fact more than 70% of the population is fully vaccinated, AFP reports. In a statement,Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said,external: ""The epidemic is under control, we have record vaccination levels. That is why, on 10 September, we can lift the special rules we had to introduce in the fight against Covid-19."" However, he insists ""the epidemic is not over"" and says the government ""will not hesitate to act quickly if the pandemic once again threatens the essential functioning of society"". Denmark was one of the first nations to bring in a partial lockdown in March 2020, closing schools and non-essential businesses and services. It has relaxed and reinforced its measures throughout the pandemic, andin April became the first European nation to introduce a ""corona pass""for access to places such as restaurants, cinemas, gyms and hair salons. The ""corona pass"" requirement - which has already been removed for some venues including museums - will end for more places come 1 September, but will still be needed to enter nightclubs and other large events until 10 September.

We've just explained how hundreds of people who attended a music festival in Derbyshire earlier this month went on to positive for coronavirus. And as 500,000 people prepare to head to big festivals this bank holiday weekend, health officials are urging fans to follow some simple steps - such as taking a free Covid lateral flow test before they go - to reduce the risk of catching or spreading Covid-19.

Hundreds of people who attended a heavy metal music festival in Derbyshirehave tested positive for Covid-19, health officials say. Bloodstock took place on 11 to 15 August near the village of Walton-on-Trent, in Derbyshire. Local public health officials confirmed about 500 people from across the country had ""attended the festival prior to testing positive"". Iain Little, Derbyshire County Council's deputy director of public health, says there did not appear to be any rises in infections locally as most people had stayed on the festival site. He adds: ""Our public health team was involved in planning for the event with South Derbyshire District Council, and were happy that the festival organisers were following best practice and national guidance."" This year's festival attracted 20,000 people - its largest attendance ever - after having to move online last year because of the pandemic. Rachael Greenfield, Bloodstock festival director, says organisers had done ""everything in their power"" to lessen the risks and went ""above and beyond"" government Covid guidance. She says while there was ""no guarantee"" all the cases derived from the event, it was ""impossible"" to completely remove the risk of infection. More than five billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered in over 190 countries worldwide. China and India have administered the highest number of doses, with more than two billion and 600 million respectively. The US ranks third, with about 365 million. But there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world, andmany states in Africa have struggled to get doses.

Scotland's first minister hasruled out a circuit breaker lockdownto combat surging cases, and has said she will be ""watching closely"" to assess whether these numbers might translate into serious illness and hospital admissions. Nicola Sturgeon is hopeful Scotland can get through its spike without the need for tough interventions, saysDavid Wallace Lockhart, BBC Scotland's political reporter. Instead, she hasappealed to the public to take voluntary actionto help avoid more rules in the future: by meeting outdoors, avoiding crowds and limiting physical contact. The coronavirus ""R number"" - the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to - is between 1.0 and 1.1 in England, according to the latest government figures. Last week, it was between 0.9 and 1.2. If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. An R number between 1.0 and 1.1 means that, on average, every 10 people infected will go on to infect between 10 and 11 others. People need to take precautions going forward amid rising Covid case rates, says Wales's health minister - including staying ""outside, if possible, over this bank holiday weekend"". Eluned Morgan says higher case rates are to be expected after restrictions were lifted.

"This video can not be played Sir Jeffrey Donaldson wants Ireland to encourage the EU to change its stance on the Northern Ireland Protocol Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has accused the Irish government of ""harming"" Northern Ireland's relationship with the rest of the UK through its support for the Brexit deal. His comment came after he met Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin. Their meeting in Dublin was their first since Sir Jeffrey became DUP leader. Mr Martin said he accepted unionists had ""genuine concerns"" over post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland. But Sir Jeffrey warned that relations between Dublin and Stormont could become ""untenable"" if problems with the Northern Ireland Protocol could not be resolved. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? MicheÃ¡l Martin says he accepts that unionists' have concerns about the Northern Ireland Protocol He called on the EU to ""change its tune"" on the protocol, which was agreed by the UK and EU to avoid a hard border in Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. That has created a new trade border in the Irish Sea, which is strongly opposed by unionists in Northern Ireland. ""If the Irish government persists in harming our relationship with the rest of the United Kingdom through this protocol then of course that has an impact on our relationship with Dublin,"" said Sir Jeffrey. ""We are expected to operate as normal on a north-south basis - that is not a tenable position and not one I intend to continue with if we cannot resolve the issues around the protocol and do so quickly."" The DUP leader said he told the taoiseach that unionists' concerns that the protocol was having an negative effect on Northern Ireland were ""certainly not diminishing"". This video can not be played The EU is ""ready to respond"" to concerns about the Northern Ireland Protocol, says MicheÃ¡l Martin He cited the ""harm that it's doing to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland"" and the ""political harm"" it could cause ahead of next year's Stormont assembly election. ""We need to address those issues and do so quickly - we need to remove the border that has developed between GB and Northern Ireland in trading terms,"" he said. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Martin said he would continue to speak to unionists about their worries in relation to the protocol. He called for a focus on maintaining relations between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. MicheÃ¡l Martin and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson met at Government Buildings in Dublin ""It would be awful if there was to be any disruption of that progressive work,"" he said. ""I accept from a unionist perspective that they have genuine concerns. ""We don't necessarily agree that they're ones that can't be overcome - we'd have a different perspective to that - but I acknowledge the sincerity of the perspective that has been articulated to us. ""Europe wants to help here but there needs to be very clear presentation from the UK side in terms of where they see the resolution of this."" On Thursday the Northern Ireland Protocol was a key topic of discussion whenFrench President Emmanuel Macron visited Dublin, where he met both Mr Martin and Irish President Michael D Higgins. Emmanuel Macron says Ireland has a ""faithful friend"" in France In the past Mr Macron has ruled out any renegotiation of the Brexit deal. During his visit to Ãras an UachtarÃ¡in, the Irish president's residence, Mr Macron wrote in the guestbook that Ireland ""occupies a precious place in the heart of the European dream"". Mr Macron's note explained that France would remain a ""faithful friend for the future"". DUP leader calls for renegotiation of Brexit deal In June, Sir Jeffrey's predecessor as DUP leaderEdwin Poots visited Dublin and met Mr Martinalong with DUP colleague Paul Givan, who has since become first minister of Northern Ireland. Mr Poots said Mr Martin recognised the ""genuine concerns in unionist and loyalist communities around the protocol"". But Mr Poots was ousted within 50 days of becoming DUP leader and was replaced by Sir Jeffrey. Poots will attend next north-south meeting DUP leader calls for renegotiation of Brexit deal Ireland and France links 'never been stronger' What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

However, he insists ""the epidemic is not over"" and says the government ""will not hesitate to act quickly if the pandemic once again threatens the essential functioning of society"". Denmark was one of the first nations to bring in a partial lockdown in March 2020, closing schools and non-essential businesses and services. It has relaxed and reinforced its measures throughout the pandemic, andin April became the first European nation to introduce a ""corona pass""for access to places such as restaurants, cinemas, gyms and hair salons. The ""corona pass"" requirement - which has already been removed for some venues including museums - will end for more places come 1 September, but will still be needed to enter nightclubs and other large events until 10 September.

We've just explained how hundreds of people who attended a music festival in Derbyshire earlier this month went on to positive for coronavirus. And as 500,000 people prepare to head to big festivals this bank holiday weekend, health officials are urging fans to follow some simple steps - such as taking a free Covid lateral flow test before they go - to reduce the risk of catching or spreading Covid-19.

Hundreds of people who attended a heavy metal music festival in Derbyshirehave tested positive for Covid-19, health officials say. Bloodstock took place on 11 to 15 August near the village of Walton-on-Trent, in Derbyshire. Local public health officials confirmed about 500 people from across the country had ""attended the festival prior to testing positive"". Iain Little, Derbyshire County Council's deputy director of public health, says there did not appear to be any rises in infections locally as most people had stayed on the festival site. He adds: ""Our public health team was involved in planning for the event with South Derbyshire District Council, and were happy that the festival organisers were following best practice and national guidance."" This year's festival attracted 20,000 people - its largest attendance ever - after having to move online last year because of the pandemic. Rachael Greenfield, Bloodstock festival director, says organisers had done ""everything in their power"" to lessen the risks and went ""above and beyond"" government Covid guidance. She says while there was ""no guarantee"" all the cases derived from the event, it was ""impossible"" to completely remove the risk of infection. More than five billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered in over 190 countries worldwide. China and India have administered the highest number of doses, with more than two billion and 600 million respectively. The US ranks third, with about 365 million. But there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world, andmany states in Africa have struggled to get doses.

Scotland's first minister hasruled out a circuit breaker lockdownto combat surging cases, and has said she will be ""watching closely"" to assess whether these numbers might translate into serious illness and hospital admissions. Nicola Sturgeon is hopeful Scotland can get through its spike without the need for tough interventions, saysDavid Wallace Lockhart, BBC Scotland's political reporter. Instead, she hasappealed to the public to take voluntary actionto help avoid more rules in the future: by meeting outdoors, avoiding crowds and limiting physical contact. The coronavirus ""R number"" - the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to - is between 1.0 and 1.1 in England, according to the latest government figures. Last week, it was between 0.9 and 1.2. If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. An R number between 1.0 and 1.1 means that, on average, every 10 people infected will go on to infect between 10 and 11 others. People need to take precautions going forward amid rising Covid case rates, says Wales's health minister - including staying ""outside, if possible, over this bank holiday weekend"". Eluned Morgan says higher case rates are to be expected after restrictions were lifted.

UK and around the world: Here are some of the latest graphics explaining the
coronavirus situation in the UK. The August bank holiday weekend is almost here and many people across the UK will be hoping to make the most of some late summer sun. Self-isolation rulesacross all four nations in the UK have been relaxed- but what about the rest of the Covid-19 restrictions? Social distancing rules have ended in England, Scotland and Wales, but not completely in Northern Ireland. And where do you still need a mask, or an NHS Covid pass? Here's a look at thelatest changes to the rulesacross the UK. A Blackpool taxi firm says it has lost 200 of the 500 drivers on its books after many quit to take jobs as delivery drivers during the pandemic. Taxi firms in the holiday resort town are now offering bonuses to attract new night drivers. Some also say long queues caused by shortages have resulted in anger and abuse by late-night revellers. The council has employed taxi marshals to control queues and has introduced new measures to make it easier for firms to recruit new drivers. Read morehere. Scientists advising the government say it's ""highly likely"" high levels of coronavirus will be seen in schools in England by the end of September. It would be ""sensible"" for the government to plan for this happening, they add in a Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) statement from 11 August. Cases in Scotland have reached a record high since schools reopened for autumn. A decision on whether a vaccine will be offered to 12-15-year-olds is expected soon. All 16 and 17-year-olds across the UK have now been offered a first dose of vaccine against Covid-19. Sage admits it is still difficult to work out whether schools are drivers of transmission, or simply reflecting the spread of the virus in the communities where they are located. But its scientific advisers add that if cases continue to rise, the more pupils and teachers that contract Covid-19, the more schools and education will be disrupted. Read morehere. The Covid outbreak at Ysbyty Gwynedd hospital hit five wards Two hospitals in north Wales have been hit with outbreaks of Covid. Betsi Cadwaladr health board says it is managing the outbreak on two wards at Ysbyty Gwynedd and one at Ysbyty Eryri in Caernarfon, Gwynedd. It says it is caring for 34 patients with Covid-19 infections across both sites, 14 of which are have confirmed hospital-acquired infections. Affected patients are being isolated and wards are currently closed while visiting remains restricted.

"This video can not be played Twin bombs exploded near the perimeter of Kabul airport, hours after warnings from Western governments President Joe Biden has promised to hunt down the jihadists behind an attack in Kabul which killed at least 90 people - including 13 US troops. Mr Biden warned the US would ""not forgive"" the perpetrators. The twin blasts, claimed by a local branch of Islamic State (IS), tore through crowds of men, women and children outside Kabul airport. They were hoping to join the 100,000 people airlifted out of Afghanistan since it fell to Taliban militants. There had been repeated warnings that an attack was likely, but it either did not reach or did not deter those waiting. US troops in control of Kabul international airport have been facilitating the evacuation of foreign nationals and Afghans who had been working with foreign missions. They have been aiming to complete this within a 31 August deadline for US forces to leave under an agreement with the Taliban. A number of European countries have already announced the end of their evacuation plans. The UK said on Friday it would not be processing any more applications, acknowledging it was leaving people behind. Speaking hours after Thursday's attack, Mr Biden vowed to complete the evacuation mission, adding ""we will not be deterred by terrorists"". Who are IS-K? He said the US military had been ordered to attack the leadership, assets and facilities of the group known as Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K), active in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The group is part of the global IS network, but has local links - even to the Taliban. However, IS-K have accused the Taliban of abandoning the battlefield in favour of a negotiated peace settlement. The attack at the airport - which began at about 18:00 local time (13:30 GMT) - targeted ""translators and collaborators with the American army"", the jihadist group said. The first blast happened near the Abbey Gate, where US and British forces have been checking people entering the airport, followed by a second minutes later  at a hotel which was used by British officials to process Afghans hoping to travel to the UK. Survivors described the horror in the wake of the attack, with one saying they saw ""bodies and body parts flying in the air like a tornado blowing plastic bags"". Another recounted how they tried to take an injured baby to safety, only for the child to die in their arms. Pictures being shared on social media suggest families have lost several members. Hospitals were quickly overwhelmed with the injured. Alberto Zanin, the medical director of one facility run by Italian NGO Emergency, described on Twitter how the victims ""could not speak, many were terrified, their eyes totally lost in emptiness, their gaze blank"". Thursday's events as they happened Airport attack: What we know Thirteen US troops were among those killed - the first US military casualties in Afghanistan since February 2020. Mr Biden said the troops who had died ""were heroes who were on a selfless mission to save the lives of others"". The head of US Central Command, Gen Frank McKenzie, said the threat from IS-K remained high and US forces were working with Taliban to try to stop further attacks and that the Taliban had already prevented many. But the attack is likely to significantly complicate the evacuation effort ahead of the deadline. There are currently 5,800 US troops on the ground at Kabul airport with a further 1,000 UK troops also there. To date, 104,000 civilians have been transferred from Afghanistan, including 66,000 by the US and 37,000 by allies and partners. Where will all the Afghan refugees go? UK enters final stages of Afghan evacuation About 5,000 people are waiting at the airport and many more are still trying to get through the perimeter checkpoints. A number of countries, including Canada, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Denmark had already stopped their operations. Turkey has announced that its troops, who had been providing security at the airport for six years, were withdrawing. Kabul attack: What we know Attack leaves many casualties.

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control.

Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"".

A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"".

""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"".

The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""If Taliban want engagement then safe passage is absolutely paramount."" Boris Johnson says he will ""shift heaven and earth"" to help people leave Kabul after 31 August, as evacuations by the UK enter the final stages. The prime minister said he felt a ""great sense of regret"" about those left behind in Afghanistan. No more people are being called to the airport to leave, with the Ministry of Defence saying it had closed processing facilities in Kabul. American troops will withdraw by the end of the month. The US has been running the airport in Afghanistan's capital, where at least 95 people - includingtwo British nationals and the child of a British national- were killed in a suicide bomb attack on Thursday. Mr Johnson said: ""Of course, as we come down to the final hours of the operation there will sadly be people who haven't got through, people who might qualify. ""What I would say to them is that we will shift heaven and earth to help them get out, we will do whatever we can in the second phase."" He added that ""the timing of this is certainly not the one that this country would have chosen, and I think that everybody understands that"". Kabul airport attack: What do we know? British nationals killed in airport bombing Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has expressed ""deep regret"" that not everyone eligible had been evacuated from Afghanistan, including around 800 to 1,100 Afghans and 100 to 150 Britons. But Mr Wallace said the UK's withdrawal ""wasn't hastened by the attack"" on Thursday. At least 150 people were also wounded in the blast, which the group known as Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) says it was behind. Thirteen of the victims were US military personnel. This video can not be played Defence Secretary Ben Wallace: UK will evacuate final 1,000 people on Friday It had earlier been thought there were two explosions, but the Pentagon said on Friday that there had been no second explosion at, or near, the Baron Hotel, which is close to the airport. On Friday evening, the MoD said 14,543 people had been evacuated by the UK from Kabul under Operation Pitting, which began on 13 August. This includes British nationals as well as the nearly 8,000 Afghans eligible under the UK's relocation scheme for those who worked for the UK government, along with other vulnerable individuals. But the MoD said the UK's ability to process any more evacuations is now ""extremely reduced and additional numbers will be limited"", with the focus turning to getting diplomats and service personnel out of the country. Liverpool man in rescue bid says no escape now Tired and scared, Afghans start new lives in the UK Afghan details found in British embassy in Kabul Mr Wallace would not confirm when the last British troops would leave the country, but said this would be before the US withdrew by 31 August. He added that the risk of attacks by the Islamic State group in Afghanistan would increase as foreign forces left. Among those who have been trying to flee the country is Sharif Karimi, a former British Army interpreter who is still in Kabul. He told the BBC he was ""so worried"". He said he had been told to travel to the airport - but was not allowed through a Taliban checkpoint and went home after spending five hours there. Mr Karimi said he had been sent a letter showing he was eligible to travel to the UK but despite this, had been left behind. ""I am scared that if we are not evacuated soon from Afghanistan, we will be found by the Taliban and killed,"" he said. He called on the UK government to get him, and others in his position, to help get him out ""as soon as possible"". Another man who remains in Kabul, an English language trainer for the British Council who worked with Afghan school teachers, told the BBC he felt he and dozens of colleagues had been ""left to die by the UK government"". The man - who the BBC is not naming for his own safety - said he was told by the British Council to apply for the UK's Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy scheme because he worked directly for the British government. He said he applied for the scheme but never heard back. ""We see our colleagues dying every day. Our colleague was shot this week,"" he said. ""Our only hope was to be able to evacuate and travel to the UK. But that didn't happen. Right now we don't know what to do. ""In return for our services to the UK, we have been gifted to the Taliban."" While the evacuation operation from the airport is coming to an end, Mr Wallace told the Today programme the UK's Afghan relocation scheme would remain open ""indefinitely"". He added that if eligible people were able to get to other countries, the UK could process them there. The defence secretary said it was likely the Taliban would want to keep the airport functioning in the future and people may be able to leave by that route ""in the medium term"". This video can not be played Getting the plane out of Afghanistan was ""happiest moment of my life"" Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, who served in Afghanistan, said the military had done ""an amazing job"" but many people, including his own interpreter, would not get out of the country. ""I'm not giving up but my anger and shame for those we've left behind to be hunted by the Taliban is growing,""he said in a tweet,external. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer praised the ""courage and heroism"" of troops and officials who helped with the evacuation. However, he said the UK government ""must take its fair share of the responsibility"" for people being left behind and ""has serious questions to answer about how, despite having 18 months to prepare, their failure to plan and inability to influence others has contributed to this tragic political failure"". This video can not be played Starmer: Urgent plan needed for those left in Afghanistan Arrivals on official flights enter a 10-day Covid quarantine in a hotel Government officials and local authorities are trying to find them permanent homes A shortage of suitable accommodation means many will be placed in hotels Some will get refugee status and can live in the UK permanently Others will get a five-year visa to live and work in the UK - and can then apply for permanent residence Afghans arriving independently will enter the normal system for asylum claims - which has a backlog of 70,000 people These people cannot settle, or work, while their claims are considered Are you in Afghanistan or do you have loved ones there?

Men's wheelchair basketball Captain Ian Sagar says GB's men's wheelchair basketball team will ""fight back"" after they lost 71-59 to Germany for their first defeat of the Games. They face the USA tomorrow in their third group B game. âNot the result we wanted
today,"" said Sagar. ""We know the players, we know the team and we know Germany are capable of
shooting well and today it was just world-class shooting. âNot the result we wanted, we are ranked number one in the world
and as the number one ranked team we are going to come back, we are going to
fight back. âIt is the USA tomorrow, one of the biggest teams in the world
and that is perfect for us. We are going to come back tomorrow, we are going to
war, and we are going to get this tournament back on track.â FT: USA 50-48 Great Britain Great Britain's mistake early in the fourth quarter was punished as the USA took the lead quickly and never looked back. Despite their best efforts to force a turnover, both teams traded scores as the USA kept GB at arms length by trading scores once they took the lead. The Americans sealed the win when they forced another loose pass that ran out of play as GB went in search of an equaliser. GB will take on Japan in the semi-finals on Saturday, while in the other semi, Australia will face either New Zealand or Canada. Para-archery The archery got under way in Tokyo today, with Jessica Stretton setting a new Paralympic record of 694 to finish first in
the women's individual compound open ranking round. She will progress straight to Monday's last 16. ""Setting a new Paralympic record does feel
amazing, it hasn't really sunk in yet,"" she said. Phoebe Paterson Pine will compete in the first elimination round on Sunday after finishing 16th in the ranking round in the same event as Stretton.

sixth. And in the individual recurve open ranking rounds, Hazel Chaisty finished 12th in the women's and David Phillips was 26th in the men's. Allow Twitter content?

"A 12-year-old boy from London has made about Â£290,000 during the school holidays, after creating a series of pixelated artworks called Weird Whales and selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs). With NFTs, artwork can be ""tokenised"" to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought and sold. They do not generally give the buyer the actual artwork or its copyright. Benyamin Ahmed is keeping his earnings in the form of Ethereum - the crypto-currency in which they were sold. This means they could go up or down in value and there is no back-up from the authorities if the digital wallet in which he is holding them is hacked or compromised. He has never had a traditional bank account. Benyamin's classmates are as yet unaware of his new-found crypto-wealth, although he has made YouTube videos about his hobby, which he enjoys alongside swimming, badminton and taekwondo. ""My advice to other children that maybe want to get into this space is don't force yourself to do coding, maybe because you get peer pressured - just as if you like cooking, do cooking, if you like dancing, do dances, just do it to the best of your ability,"" he said. Benyamin's father, Imran, a software developer who works in traditional finance, encouraged Benyamin and his brother, Yousef, to start coding at the ages of five and six. The children have had the advantage of a strong network of technology experts to call on for advice and help - but he is extremely proud of them. ""It was a little bit of a fun exercise - but I picked up on really early that they were really receptive to it and they were really good,"" Imran said. ""So then we started getting a little bit more serious - and now it's every single day... but you can't cram this stuff, you can't say I'm going to learn coding in three months."" The boys did 20 or 30 minutes of coding exercises a day - including on holiday, he said. Weird Whales is Benyamin's second digital-art collection, following an earlier Minecraft-inspired set that sold less well. This time, he drew inspiration from a well known pixelated whale meme image and a popular digital-art style but used his own program to create the set of 3,350 emoji-type whales. ""It was interesting to see all of them hatch, as they appeared on my screen slowly generating,"" he said. Benyamin is already working on his third, superhero-themed collection. He would also like to make an ""underwater game"" featuring the whales. ""That would be amazing,"" he said. Imran is ""100% certain"" his son has not broken copyright law and has engaged lawyers to ""audit"" his work, as well as getting advice on how to trademark his own designs. This video can not be played Will digital-only trading cards replace physical ones? The art world is divided over the current trend for NFTs. Artists say they are a useful additional line of revenue. And there are many stories of eye-wateringly high sales. But there is also scepticism over whether they are a realistic long-term investment. And former Christie's auctioneer Charles Allsopp toldBBC News buying them made ""no sense"". ""The idea of buying something which isn't there is just strange,"" he said earlier this year.

"A 12-year-old boy from London has made about Â£290,000 during the school holidays, after creating a series of pixelated artworks called Weird Whales and selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs). With NFTs, artwork can be ""tokenised"" to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought and sold. They do not generally give the buyer the actual artwork or its copyright. Benyamin Ahmed is keeping his earnings in the form of Ethereum - the crypto-currency in which they were sold. This means they could go up or down in value and there is no back-up from the authorities if the digital wallet in which he is holding them is hacked or compromised. He has never had a traditional bank account. Benyamin's classmates are as yet unaware of his new-found crypto-wealth, although he has made YouTube videos about his hobby, which he enjoys alongside swimming, badminton and taekwondo. ""My advice to other children that maybe want to get into this space is don't force yourself to do coding, maybe because you get peer pressured - just as if you like cooking, do cooking, if you like dancing, do dances, just do it to the best of your ability,"" he said. Benyamin's father, Imran, a software developer who works in traditional finance, encouraged Benyamin and his brother, Yousef, to start coding at the ages of five and six. The children have had the advantage of a strong network of technology experts to call on for advice and help - but he is extremely proud of them. ""It was a little bit of a fun exercise - but I picked up on really early that they were really receptive to it and they were really good,"" Imran said. ""So then we started getting a little bit more serious - and now it's every single day... but you can't cram this stuff, you can't say I'm going to learn coding in three months."" The boys did 20 or 30 minutes of coding exercises a day - including on holiday, he said. Weird Whales is Benyamin's second digital-art collection, following an earlier Minecraft-inspired set that sold less well. This time, he drew inspiration from a well known pixelated whale meme image and a popular digital-art style but used his own program to create the set of 3,350 emoji-type whales. ""It was interesting to see all of them hatch, as they appeared on my screen slowly generating,"" he said. Benyamin is already working on his third, superhero-themed collection. He would also like to make an ""underwater game"" featuring the whales. ""That would be amazing,"" he said. Imran is ""100% certain"" his son has not broken copyright law and has engaged lawyers to ""audit"" his work, as well as getting advice on how to trademark his own designs. This video can not be played Will digital-only trading cards replace physical ones? The art world is divided over the current trend for NFTs. Artists say they are a useful additional line of revenue. And there are many stories of eye-wateringly high sales. But there is also scepticism over whether they are a realistic long-term investment. And former Christie's auctioneer Charles Allsopp toldBBC News buying them made ""no sense"". ""The idea of buying something which isn't there is just strange,"" he said earlier this year. ""People who invest in it are slight mugs - but I hope they don't lose their money."" What are NFTs and why are some worth millions?

before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world: Here are some of the latest graphics explaining the
coronavirus situation in the UK. The August bank holiday weekend is almost here and many people across the UK will be hoping to make the most of some late summer sun. Self-isolation rulesacross all four nations in the UK have been relaxed- but what about the rest of the Covid-19 restrictions? Social distancing rules have ended in England, Scotland and Wales, but not completely in Northern Ireland. And where do you still need a mask, or an NHS Covid pass? Here's a look at thelatest changes to the rulesacross the UK. A Blackpool taxi firm says it has lost 200 of the 500 drivers on its books after many quit to take jobs as delivery drivers during the pandemic. Taxi firms in the holiday resort town are now offering bonuses to attract new night drivers. Some also say long queues caused by shortages have resulted in anger and abuse by late-night revellers. The council has employed taxi marshals to control queues and has introduced new measures to make it easier for firms to recruit new drivers. Read morehere. Scientists advising the government say it's ""highly likely"" high levels of coronavirus will be seen in schools in England by the end of September. It would be ""sensible"" for the government to plan for this happening, they add in a Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) statement from 11 August. Cases in Scotland have reached a record high since schools reopened for autumn. A decision on whether a vaccine will be offered to 12-15-year-olds is expected soon. All 16 and 17-year-olds across the UK have now been offered a first dose of vaccine against Covid-19. Sage admits it is still difficult to work out whether schools are drivers of transmission, or simply reflecting the spread of the virus in the communities where they are located. But its scientific advisers add that if cases continue to rise, the more pupils and teachers that contract Covid-19, the more schools and education will be disrupted. Read morehere. The Covid outbreak at Ysbyty Gwynedd hospital hit five wards Two hospitals in north Wales have been hit with outbreaks of Covid. Betsi Cadwaladr health board says it is managing the outbreak on two wards at Ysbyty Gwynedd and one at Ysbyty Eryri in Caernarfon, Gwynedd. It says it is caring for 34 patients with Covid-19 infections across both sites, 14 of which are have confirmed hospital-acquired infections. Affected patients are being isolated and wards are currently closed while visiting remains restricted. The health board's executive director of nursing and midwifery Gill Harris says cases in the community have been increasing in recent weeks leading to a rise in the number of patients needing hospital treatment for the virus. ""This is a timely reminder that the virus has not gone away,"" she adds. Read morehere. Today is the 15th day in August that thenumber of deaths recorded in the UK,externalof someone who had tested positive for coronavirus in the previous 28 days has been 100 or more. That underlines a substantial rise in deaths this month after several months of lower figures. For context, there was only one day in the whole of April, May, June and July when the the number of deaths announced was in three figures - that was 27 July, when 131 deaths were reported. Today is the last Friday of August, and while today's figure is actually lower than last Friday's when 114 fatalities were reported, you have to go back all the way to February and the winter wave of the virus to find a higher figure for the final Friday of the month. Here are the numbers of deaths recorded in the UK on the last Friday of the previous months this year: Thelatest figures,externalshow deaths have increased by 9.9% from the previous week (14 to 20 August), with 756 recorded in the past seven days, a rise of 68. Cases have risen 9.1% from the previous week, with 239,237 recorded between 21
and 27 August, an increase of 19,887. Another 55,140 people in the UK have had a first dose
of a coronavirus vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 88.2% of the adult population has now had at least one jab. And a further 144,936 have had a second
vaccine dose now. As of today, 78.0% of the adult
population has now had both jabs. Correction 17 September 2021: This post originally said deaths had increased 9.9% per 100,000 people from the previous week. It has been corrected to simply reflect that deaths had increased by 9.9% from the previous week. There
have been a further 38,046 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK today,
according to thelatest government
figures,external. And
there have been another 100 deaths of people
who had tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. In London, usage of the Tube network is regularly reaching at least half of pre-pandemic levels,Transport for London (TfL) says. On weekdays, demand is often at 50% of what it was before the pandemic, and it is reaching more than 60% at weekends. This is up from about 40% across the entire week in early May. An average of more than 1.8 million journeys are being made on the London Underground every weekday. Last weekend, passenger numbers were at 58% of pre-pandemic levels on Saturday and 62% on Sunday. Bus travel in the afternoon is also continuing to grow. Overall demand is reaching about two-thirds of pre-pandemic levels on weekdays and hitting up to 75% at weekends. About 3.5 million journeys are being made every weekday on London buses, which is likely to increase further once schools return from next week. England football manager Gareth Southgate says he was targeted for abuse after supporting the UK government drive to get more young people vaccinated. Southgatedelivered a video messagebacking the programme shortly after England's defeat by Italy on penalties in the final of Euro 2020 in July. He says: ""I was asked to do a video supporting the vaccination programme, which I thought was responsible. ""And of all the things that I've received abuse for over the summer - of which there's been several - that's probably the one I've received the most abuse over."" Southgate says, as a result, he is going to keep out of the argument ""for the time being"". But while admitting ""it's very much an individual situation"", Southgate adds: ""Our only way out of this pandemic across the world are the vaccinations - certainly for the vulnerable people."" This video can not be played Gareth Southgate: 'Go and get your Covid vaccine done' Denmark will end all coronavirus restrictions by 10 September, according to health officials, who say the virus no longer poses a ""threat to society"" thanks to the fact more than 70% of the population is fully vaccinated, AFP reports. In a statement,Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said,external: ""The epidemic is under control, we have record vaccination levels. That is why, on 10 September, we can lift the special rules we had to introduce in the fight against Covid-19."" However, he insists ""the epidemic is not over"" and says the government ""will not hesitate to act quickly if the pandemic once again threatens the essential functioning of society"". Denmark was one of the first nations to bring in a partial lockdown in March 2020, closing schools and non-essential businesses and services. It has relaxed and reinforced its measures throughout the pandemic, andin April became the first European nation to introduce a ""corona pass""for access to places such as restaurants, cinemas, gyms and hair salons. The ""corona pass"" requirement - which has already been removed for some venues including museums - will end for more places come 1 September, but will still be needed to enter nightclubs and other large events until 10 September.

A total of 6,835 new cases have been reported today - more than 1,800 above the previous highest figure. We've just explained how hundreds of people who attended a music festival in Derbyshire earlier this month went on to positive for coronavirus. And as 500,000 people prepare to head to big festivals this bank holiday weekend, health officials are urging fans to follow some simple steps - such as taking a free Covid lateral flow test before they go - to reduce the risk of catching or spreading Covid-19. Here's a quick rundown of what the experts advise: Dr Susan Hopkins, of Public Health England  Dr Michael Head, from the University of Southampton  You can read morehere. Hundreds of people who attended a heavy metal music festival in Derbyshirehave tested positive for Covid-19, health officials say. Bloodstock took place on 11 to 15 August near the village of Walton-on-Trent, in Derbyshire. Local public health officials confirmed about 500 people from across the country had ""attended the festival prior to testing positive"". Iain Little, Derbyshire County Council's deputy director of public health, says there did not appear to be any rises in infections locally as most people had stayed on the festival site. He adds: ""Our public health team was involved in planning for the event with South Derbyshire District Council, and were happy that the festival organisers were following best practice and national guidance."" This year's festival attracted 20,000 people - its largest attendance ever - after having to move online last year because of the pandemic. Rachael Greenfield, Bloodstock festival director, says organisers had done ""everything in their power"" to lessen the risks and went ""above and beyond"" government Covid guidance. She says while there was ""no guarantee"" all the cases derived from the event, it was ""impossible"" to completely remove the risk of infection. More than five billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered in over 190 countries worldwide. China and India have administered the highest number of doses, with more than two billion and 600 million respectively. The US ranks third, with about 365 million. But there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world, andmany states in Africa have struggled to get doses. Find out more aboutvaccine progress around the world here. Scotland's first minister hasruled out a circuit breaker lockdownto combat surging cases, and has said she will be ""watching closely"" to assess whether these numbers might translate into serious illness and hospital admissions. Nicola Sturgeon is hopeful Scotland can get through its spike without the need for tough interventions, saysDavid Wallace Lockhart, BBC Scotland's political reporter. Instead, she hasappealed to the public to take voluntary actionto help avoid more rules in the future: by meeting outdoors, avoiding crowds and limiting physical contact. The coronavirus ""R number"" - the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to - is between 1.0 and 1.1 in England, according to the latest government figures. Last week, it was between 0.9 and 1.2. If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. An R number between 1.0 and 1.1 means that, on average, every 10 people infected will go on to infect between 10 and 11 others. People need to take precautions going forward amid rising Covid case rates, says Wales's health minister - including staying ""outside, if possible, over this bank holiday weekend"". Eluned Morgan says higher case rates are to be expected after restrictions were lifted. She tells BBC Radio Wales: ""At this point, it is important we hold our nerve and that we don't see this spreading further than necessary.""

Scientists advising the government say it's ""highly likely"" high levels of coronavirus will be seen in schools in England by the end of September. It would be ""sensible"" for the government to plan for this happening, they add in a Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) statement from 11 August. Cases in Scotland have reached a record high since schools reopened for autumn. A decision on whether a vaccine will be offered to 12-15-year-olds is expected soon. All 16 and 17-year-olds across the UK have now been offered a first dose of vaccine against Covid-19. Sage admits it is still difficult to work out whether schools are drivers of transmission, or simply reflecting the spread of the virus in the communities where they are located. But its scientific advisers add that if cases continue to rise, the more pupils and teachers that contract Covid-19, the more schools and education will be disrupted. Read morehere.

Today is the 15th day in August that thenumber of deaths recorded in the UK,externalof someone who had tested positive for coronavirus in the previous 28 days has been 100 or more.

For context, there was only one day in the whole of April, May, June and July when the the number of deaths announced was in three figures - that was 27 July, when 131 deaths were reported. Today is the last Friday of August, and while today's figure is actually lower than last Friday's when 114 fatalities were reported, you have to go back all the way to February and the winter wave of the virus to find a higher figure for the final Friday of the month. Here are the numbers of deaths recorded in the UK on the last Friday of the previous months this year: Thelatest figures,externalshow deaths have increased by 9.9% from the previous week (14 to 20 August), with 756 recorded in the past seven days, a rise of 68.

and 27 August, an increase of 19,887. Another 55,140 people in the UK have had a first dose
of a coronavirus vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 88.2% of the adult population has now had at least one jab. And a further 144,936 have had a second
vaccine dose now. As of today, 78.0% of the adult
population has now had both jabs. Correction 17 September 2021: This post originally said deaths had increased 9.9% per 100,000 people from the previous week. It has been corrected to simply reflect that deaths had increased by 9.9% from the previous week. There

there have been another 100 deaths of people
who had tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. In London, usage of the Tube network is regularly reaching at least half of pre-pandemic levels,Transport for London (TfL) says. On weekdays, demand is often at 50% of what it was before the pandemic, and it is reaching more than 60% at weekends. This is up from about 40% across the entire week in early May. An average of more than 1.8 million journeys are being made on the London Underground every weekday. Last weekend, passenger numbers were at 58% of pre-pandemic levels on Saturday and 62% on Sunday. Bus travel in the afternoon is also continuing to grow. Overall demand is reaching about two-thirds of pre-pandemic levels on weekdays and hitting up to 75% at weekends. About 3.5 million journeys are being made every weekday on London buses, which is likely to increase further once schools return from next week. England football manager Gareth Southgate says he was targeted for abuse after supporting the UK government drive to get more young people vaccinated. Southgatedelivered a video messagebacking the programme shortly after England's defeat by Italy on penalties in the final of Euro 2020 in July. He says: ""I was asked to do a video supporting the vaccination programme, which I thought was responsible. ""And of all the things that I've received abuse for over the summer - of which there's been several - that's probably the one I've received the most abuse over."" Southgate says, as a result, he is going to keep out of the argument ""for the time being"". But while admitting ""it's very much an individual situation"", Southgate adds: ""Our only way out of this pandemic across the world are the vaccinations - certainly for the vulnerable people."" This video can not be played Gareth Southgate: 'Go and get your Covid vaccine done' Denmark will end all coronavirus restrictions by 10 September, according to health officials, who say the virus no longer poses a ""threat to society"" thanks to the fact more than 70% of the population is fully vaccinated, AFP reports. In a statement,Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said,external: ""The epidemic is under control, we have record vaccination levels. That is why, on 10 September, we can lift the special rules we had to introduce in the fight against Covid-19."" However, he insists ""the epidemic is not over"" and says the government ""will not hesitate to act quickly if the pandemic once again threatens the essential functioning of society"". Denmark was one of the first nations to bring in a partial lockdown in March 2020, closing schools and non-essential businesses and services. It has relaxed and reinforced its measures throughout the pandemic, andin April became the first European nation to introduce a ""corona pass""for access to places such as restaurants, cinemas, gyms and hair salons. The ""corona pass"" requirement - which has already been removed for some venues including museums - will end for more places come 1 September, but will still be needed to enter nightclubs and other large events until 10 September.

Hundreds of people who attended a heavy metal music festival in Derbyshirehave tested positive for Covid-19, health officials say. Bloodstock took place on 11 to 15 August near the village of Walton-on-Trent, in Derbyshire. Local public health officials confirmed about 500 people from across the country had ""attended the festival prior to testing positive"". Iain Little, Derbyshire County Council's deputy director of public health, says there did not appear to be any rises in infections locally as most people had stayed on the festival site. He adds: ""Our public health team was involved in planning for the event with South Derbyshire District Council, and were happy that the festival organisers were following best practice and national guidance."" This year's festival attracted 20,000 people - its largest attendance ever - after having to move online last year because of the pandemic. Rachael Greenfield, Bloodstock festival director, says organisers had done ""everything in their power"" to lessen the risks and went ""above and beyond"" government Covid guidance. She says while there was ""no guarantee"" all the cases derived from the event, it was ""impossible"" to completely remove the risk of infection. More than five billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered in over 190 countries worldwide. China and India have administered the highest number of doses, with more than two billion and 600 million respectively. The US ranks third, with about 365 million.

"Fewer than one in four homeless people housed by the government's Everyone In scheme have moved into permanent accommodation, according to figures seen by the BBC. The initiative provided over 37,000 rough sleepers with a place to stay during the pandemic. But housing charity Shelter warned many were still in temporary homes or may even be back on the streets. The government said the figures were ""misleading"". And it said it would ""build on the progress made"" by the scheme by providing over Â£750m this year to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping. All rough sleepers in England 'to be housed' 'I was living in a tent in a graveyard' Government's rough sleeping strategy 'out of step' Shelter submitted Freedom of Information requests to every local authority in England to find out what had happened to those helped by Everyone In, which was launched in March 2020 as the pandemic hit the country. The data - shared with the BBC - showed more than three quarters of those initially accommodated, around 29,000 people, were in emergency or temporary accommodation, had reconnected with friends or family, or were likely to have returned to the streets. The charity warned the gains from the ""watershed"" scheme were at risk of being ""squandered"" if the government -which has pledged to end rough sleeping by the next general election- does not ensure accommodation becomes permanent. When the pandemic hit the UK in 2020 and the country went into lockdown, there were concerns about the vulnerability of rough sleepers as coronavirus spread. At the end of March 2020, the government announced its plan to put a roof over the head of everyone on the streets in England by working with local councils to provide accommodation. They initially pledged Â£3.2m to fund the Everyone In scheme, which saw homeless people moved into places like the-then empty hotels or other emergency accommodation to reduce the spread of the virus and keep them safe. Funding was ended two months later to the anger of many charities, but the government said it had made a number of more targeted funding pledges to tackle the issue since. As of January 2021, 37,000 rough sleepers had been given emergency accommodation as part of the initiative. While widely praised, campaigners have kept the pressure on the government for a more permanent fix, saying Everyone In showed what could be done to tackle rough sleeping. Shelter's chief executive, Polly Neate, said: ""We're gravely concerned that with funding for Everyone In running out, and councils returning to 'business as usual', we will see people forced out onto the streets. ""It would be a travesty if we allowed rough sleeping to slide back to pre-pandemic levels. ""The government needs to get a grip on this situation urgently and look at what comes next."" Shelter has called on the government to provide ongoing, dedicated funding to local authorities to ensure its commitment to end rough sleeping can be met, along with more rough sleeping support and a ""new generation"" of social homes. Ms Neate added: ""The country opening back up isn't an excuse to forget about homeless people."" But a spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the charity's analysis had not taken into account those who had moved into supported housing or who had been reconnected with family and friends. The department said it was tracking the outcome of each person helped by Everyone In, with the results to be published ""in due course"". But they said the scheme had been ""widely recognised as a considerable success"", and that 26,000 people had already moved into longer-term accommodation. The government has also launched a Rough Sleeping Accommodation Programme, which it said would fund 6,000 long-term move-on homes for rough sleepers by the end of the parliamentary term.

"The fitness bike maker Peloton is to slash the price of its flagship bike as people head back to the gym and do less exercise at home. The US firm will cut the price of its less expensive Bike machine by about 20% to $1,495 from Thursday. The change will take effect in all of its markets, including the US, UK, Canada, Australia and Germany. It came as losses widened at the firm in the fourth quarter of the year and revenue growth began to slow. The company has also had to shoulder costs associated with a treadmill itrecalled in May, following the death of a child. As more people exercised at home during the pandemic, sales of Peloton products surged, more than doubling to $4bn in the year to 30 June. However, the New York-based firm said it only expected revenue of $800m in the first quarter of the financial year, far below market estimates of $1bn. Peloton set to build first US factory It also said the decision to slash the price of its flagship bike would hit near-term profitability, sending its shares down 15% in after hours trading. It is the second time in a year that the firm has cut the price of its Bike product. ""We know price remains a barrier and are pleased to offer our most popular product at an attractive everyday price point,"" the firmsaid in a letter to shareholders,external. Peloton said it would begin selling a cheaper redesigned model of its Tread running machines next week in the US, after an older version and its more expensive Tread+ machine were pulled over safety concerns. It came after a child was pulled under the Tread+ and died. Users had also reported the touch screen falling off the Tread.

"Thousands of people are scrambling to flee Afghanistan after the Taliban seized back control of the country, almost two decades after they were ousted by a US-led coalition. The United Nations has warned that up to half a million Afghans could flee the country by the end of the year and has called on neighbouring countries to keep their borders open. The current crisis comes on top of the 2.2 million Afghan refugees already in neighbouring countries and 3.5 million people forced to flee their homes within Afghanistan's borders. The US-led operation to evacuate people by air has now ended, with the last flight taking off from Kabul airport just after midnight on Tuesday - a deadline agreed with the Taliban for foreign forces to withdraw. More than 123,000 civilians were evacuated by US forces and its coalition partners after the Taliban took control of the capital on 14 August - but it's unclear exactly how many of those were Afghan nationals. The US has said that it flew nearly 80,000 civilians out of Kabul and of those, about 5,500 were Americans and more than 73,500 were either Afghans or other foreign nationals. While the UK Ministry of Defence, which ended its evacuations on Saturday, said it had flown out more than 15,000 people and some 8,000 of them were Afghans. At the height of the operation, the US said its military planes were departing the airport every 39 minutes - although the evacuations did slow down after the suicide bomb attack on the 26 August outside the airport, which killed about 170 people, including 13 American troops. Many of those flown out of the country were taken to emergency processing centres set up in several countries, including Spain, Germany, Qatar and Uzbekistan. The Ramstein military base in Germany has become a makeshift camp for thousands of Afghans As many as 300,000 Afghans have been affiliated with US operations in the country since 2001,according,externalto the International Rescue Committee, and tens of thousands of them are eligible to obtain a US visa - but many will now have to find a different way out of the country. At the weekend, the US said it had received assurances from the Taliban that Afghan nationals who are issued with valid travel documents by another country will be allowed to leave Afghanistan. The Taliban control all the main land crossing points with Afghanistan's neighbours (shown on the map below) and reports suggest they are only allowing traders or those with valid travel documents to leave the country. However, many of those trying to flee because they fear for their safety under Taliban rule will not have any paperwork. The UN has urged Afghanistan's neighbours to keep their borders open to refugees and called on the international community to support those countries. But Uzbekistan, which borders the north of Afghanistan, has said its main crossing point is closed to ""ensure security"" and there are no plans to open it. Pakistan, which has the longest border with Afghanistan, has also said it will not accept refugees - with its US ambassador telling the BBC: ""We are already overburdened by the refugees, and it is beyond our capacity to host any more refugees."" Last week, satellite imagery of the Spin Boldak crossing point between Afghanistan and Pakistan showed a large crowd of people gathered on the Afghan side. The BBC's Shumaila Jaffery, who was at the crossing point, said it was a chaotic scene with many Afghans not being allowed to enter Pakistan. Last Friday, two Afghans were reportedly killed by Pakistani security forces at the Torkham border crossing after trying to enter Pakistan illegally. There have also been reports of thousands of Afghans trying to cross the western border with Iran, but it's unclear how many have been successful. Left behind in Afghanistan: If I can't get out, I'll die The latest movement of Afghans is part of a historical exodus from a country that has suffered instability and conflict over many years. Even before the Taliban retook control, more than 550,000 people had been forced to flee their homes this year due to fighting, according to the UNHCR. That means an estimated 3.5 million Afghans are currently internally displaced within the country. In addition to those within Afghanistan's borders, about 2.2 million refugees and asylum seekers were also seeking sanctuary in neighbouring nations as of the end of last year. This year, Afghans have also had to deal with a severe drought and food shortages across most of the country. A report by the UN World Food Programme (WFP) in June said that 14 million people - more than a third of the population - were suffering from hunger. Mary-Ellen McGroarty, WFP country director for Afghanistan, said last week that unless emergency food and medical supplies arrived soon, the ""already horrendous situation"" would become ""an absolute catastrophe, a complete humanitarian disaster"". Neighbouring countries Pakistan and Iran saw the highest numbers of Afghanistan's refugees and asylum seekers last year. Almost 1.5 million fled to Pakistan in 2020, while Iran hosted 780,000, according to UNHCR figures. Germany was third, with more than 180,000, while Turkey took nearly 130,000. When looking at asylum seeker numbers only - those who have applied for sanctuary in another country but whose claims have not yet been granted - Turkey, Germany and Greece top the list, with about 125,000, 33,000 and 20,000 respectively. Although there are no Afghan asylum seekers in Iran, those with refugee cards - an official document recognising their status - are able to access the country's health and education systems. The UN has called on its member states to help Afghan people in ""their darkest hour of need"" - but while some countries have offered refugees a safe haven, others have indicated they will not be giving sanctuary to those fleeing the crisis. BothPakistanandIranhave said that they cannot cope with a further influx of Afghan refugees. Officials in both countries have said that any refugees that do arrive will have to stay in camps near the border until they can return to Afghanistan. Uzbekistanhas said it will help transfer Afghans to third countries but will only host refugees temporarily. TheTajikistangovernment previously offered to accept up to 100,000 refugees but it's unclear if any have been allowed in yet.Turkmenistanhas said its airspace can be used for evacuation flights but it hasn't made any commitment to take in refugees itself. Turkish security forces patrolling the border with Iran help an exhausted Afghan family InTurkey, the government has urged European countries to take responsibility for any new migrant crisis, saying Turkey would not be ""Europe's migrant storage unit"". The country has stepped up construction of a border wall with Iran to thwart those entering illegally. Officials in severalEuropean Unioncountries say they are keen to avoid a repeat of the 2015 migrant crisis, when there was a populist backlash against large numbers of Syrian refugees being allowed to enter EU territory. France, which evacuated more than 2,800 people from Kabul airport, mostly Afghans, has indicated it will accept some refugees but has not specified a number.Germanyhas also not specified a number but Chancellor Angela Merkel has said as many as 40,000 people still in the country may have a right to be evacuated to Germany if they feel they are endangered. Polish soldiers have been erecting a fence along the border with Belarus to stop illegal crossings Other EU countries, likeAustria,PolandandSwitzerlandhave said they will not accept any new Afghan arrivals and are upping their border security to guard against illegal arrivals. TheUKhas said it will take in 5,000 Afghans in 2021 as part of a scheme to resettle 20,000 over the next few years, focusing on those at greatest risk from the Taliban. TheUShas not said how many refugees it will accept yet, but it has authorised $500m (Â£367m) for ""unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs of refugees"".Canadahas said that it will resettle 20,000 Afghans whileAustraliahas said it will take in 3,000. Several countries, includingKosovoandUganda, have also accepted US requests to temporarily accept Afghan refugees before they are resettled elsewhere.

"This video can not be played Twin bombs exploded near the perimeter of Kabul airport, hours after warnings from Western governments President Joe Biden has promised to hunt down the jihadists behind an attack in Kabul which killed at least 90 people - including 13 US troops. Mr Biden warned the US would ""not forgive"" the perpetrators. The twin blasts, claimed by a local branch of Islamic State (IS), tore through crowds of men, women and children outside Kabul airport. They were hoping to join the 100,000 people airlifted out of Afghanistan since it fell to Taliban militants. There had been repeated warnings that an attack was likely, but it either did not reach or did not deter those waiting. US troops in control of Kabul international airport have been facilitating the evacuation of foreign nationals and Afghans who had been working with foreign missions. They have been aiming to complete this within a 31 August deadline for US forces to leave under an agreement with the Taliban. A number of European countries have already announced the end of their evacuation plans. The UK said on Friday it would not be processing any more applications, acknowledging it was leaving people behind. Speaking hours after Thursday's attack, Mr Biden vowed to complete the evacuation mission, adding ""we will not be deterred by terrorists"". Who are IS-K? He said the US military had been ordered to attack the leadership, assets and facilities of the group known as Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K), active in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The group is part of the global IS network, but has local links - even to the Taliban. However, IS-K have accused the Taliban of abandoning the battlefield in favour of a negotiated peace settlement. The attack at the airport - which began at about 18:00 local time (13:30 GMT) - targeted ""translators and collaborators with the American army"", the jihadist group said. The first blast happened near the Abbey Gate, where US and British forces have been checking people entering the airport, followed by a second minutes later  at a hotel which was used by British officials to process Afghans hoping to travel to the UK. Survivors described the horror in the wake of the attack, with one saying they saw ""bodies and body parts flying in the air like a tornado blowing plastic bags"". Another recounted how they tried to take an injured baby to safety, only for the child to die in their arms. Pictures being shared on social media suggest families have lost several members. Hospitals were quickly overwhelmed with the injured. Alberto Zanin, the medical director of one facility run by Italian NGO Emergency, described on Twitter how the victims ""could not speak, many were terrified, their eyes totally lost in emptiness, their gaze blank"". Thursday's events as they happened Airport attack: What we know Thirteen US troops were among those killed - the first US military casualties in Afghanistan since February 2020. Mr Biden said the troops who had died ""were heroes who were on a selfless mission to save the lives of others"". The head of US Central Command, Gen Frank McKenzie, said the threat from IS-K remained high and US forces were working with Taliban to try to stop further attacks and that the Taliban had already prevented many. But the attack is likely to significantly complicate the evacuation effort ahead of the deadline. There are currently 5,800 US troops on the ground at Kabul airport with a further 1,000 UK troops also there. To date, 104,000 civilians have been transferred from Afghanistan, including 66,000 by the US and 37,000 by allies and partners. Where will all the Afghan refugees go? UK enters final stages of Afghan evacuation About 5,000 people are waiting at the airport and many more are still trying to get through the perimeter checkpoints. A number of countries, including Canada, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Denmark had already stopped their operations. Turkey has announced that its troops, who had been providing security at the airport for six years, were withdrawing. Kabul attack: What we know Attack leaves many casualties.

"This video can not be played Johnson: ""We always knew this was a moment where there were going to be particular vulnerabilities to terrorism"" The UK will continue its operation to evacuate people from Afghanistan despite the ""despicable"" attack at the capital's airport, Boris Johnson says. Speaking after an emergency meeting, the PM pledged the UK would be working ""flat out"" until ""the last moment"". But he also acknowledged the push was nearing its conclusion, with hours remaining. Two explosions hit Kabul airporton Thursday, killing some 90 people - among them 13 US military personnel. At least 150 people were also wounded in the attack, which the so-called Islamic State group say it was behind. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said there had been ""no reported UK military or UK government casualties"". Figures released by the MoD on Thursday night showed 13,146 individuals had been flown out by the UK so far. Live: US braces for further attacks after Kabul bombing Explosion outside Kabul airport Kabul airport attack: What do we know? In an address on Thursday night,President Joe Biden also promised to carry onwith the evacuation, which is due to end on 31 August. He said the US would ""not forgive"" and ""not forget"" the attack, telling the perpetrators: ""We will hunt you down and make you pay."" US commanders have said they are on alert for more attacks by so-called Islamic State, including possible rockets or vehicle-borne bombs targeting Kabul airport. By Damian Grammaticas,BBC political correspondent In the aftermath of the suicide bombings at the airport, the pace of the emergency airlift from Afghanistan has slowed but it has not halted. The BBC understands that people who'd already been allowed inside the airport perimeter have continued to be processed, to be boarded on to departing planes. But sources said the numbers arriving to be processed had decreased considerably as the Taliban were turning back many Afghans, particularly those who did not hold foreign passports or visas. Boris Johnson said the UK was ""coming towards the very end"" of its operation and suggested ""the overwhelming majority of those eligible"" had now been flown out. But there remain many clamouring not to be left behind, including interpreters who had worked for the British military, security guards from the UK embassy, Afghan soldiers trained by British forces, those who worked with international organisations and academics. Thursday's twin blasts took place outside the Abbey Gate - where US and British forces have been stationed to help with evacuations - and at a nearby hotel,following warnings there could be terrorist incidents in the area. Speaking after chairing an emergency Cobra meeting, the PM described the blasts - reportedly carried out by suicide bombers - as ""barbaric"". He said: ""I want to stress that this threat of a terrorist attack is one of the constraints that we've been operating under... in the big extraction that's been going on, and we've been ready for it, we've been prepared for it. ""And I want to stress that we're going to continue with that operation - and we're now coming towards the end of it, to the very end of it, in any event. ""But, clearly, what this attack shows is the importance of continuing that work in as fast and as efficient a manner as possible in the hours that remain to us, and that's what we're going to do."" The total number of casualties remains unconfirmed Continuing, Mr Johnson said the Foreign Office, Home Office and Border Force teams were ""going to work flat out"" to get people through ""as fast as they can"". He added: ""We're going to keep going up until the last moment."" The US has set the deadline of the end of the month for the withdrawal of its troops, with President Biden rejecting calls from Mr Johnson and other allies for an extension. In the past 12 hours, some countries including Canada, Germany and Australia have announced that they have ended their evacuation operations. Charity worker Pen Farthing targeted in airport attack UK's Kabul evacuation going at 'significant pace' Tired and scared, Afghans start new lives in the UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has offered condolences to the families of the civilians who were killed or injured, saying the US troops who were killed and harmed ""paid the ultimate sacrifice while helping others reach safety"". ""The UK and US remain resolute in our mission to get as many people out as possible. It is testament to the remarkable courage of our personnel that they continue to do so while under fire,"" he said. A statement from the MoD said: ""Our primary concern remains the safety of our personnel, British citizens and the citizens of Afghanistan. We are in close contact with our US and other NATO allies at an operational level on the immediate response to this incident."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called the attack ""devastating"", and said his thoughts were with ""all those killed and wounded, serving personnel supporting the evacuations and all those desperately trying to leave"". He added: ""The bravery of the troops at the airport will always outweigh the cowardice of those who wish to harm us."" This video can not be played Earlier, Boris Johnson said the UK had rescued the ""overwhelming majority"" of people to whom it owes a debt Kabul airport iscurrently being defended and run by the US, which has 5,800 troops on the ground - with the help of more than 1,000 UK troops. Armed Forces minister James Heappey declined to give a date for the last UK evacuation flights, but said it was likely that UK and other foreign troops would have to leave before the last American airlifts. However, Mr Johnson has insisted the US deadline will not mark the end of the UK's efforts to help people wishing to flee the Taliban-controlled country. He said on Thursday that the current airlifts were just the ""first phase"". ""Even beyond the US deadline of 31 of this month, we hope to be able to continue to say to people, well you can come out,"" he said.

""And I want to stress that we're going to continue with that operation - and we're now coming towards the end of it, to the very end of it, in any event. ""But, clearly, what this attack shows is the importance of continuing that work in as fast and as efficient a manner as possible in the hours that remain to us, and that's what we're going to do."" The total number of casualties remains unconfirmed Continuing, Mr Johnson said the Foreign Office, Home Office and Border Force teams were ""going to work flat out"" to get people through ""as fast as they can"". He added: ""We're going to keep going up until the last moment."" The US has set the deadline of the end of the month for the withdrawal of its troops, with President Biden rejecting calls from Mr Johnson and other allies for an extension. In the past 12 hours, some countries including Canada, Germany and Australia have announced that they have ended their evacuation operations. Charity worker Pen Farthing targeted in airport attack UK's Kabul evacuation going at 'significant pace' Tired and scared, Afghans start new lives in the UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has offered condolences to the families of the civilians who were killed or injured, saying the US troops who were killed and harmed ""paid the ultimate sacrifice while helping others reach safety"". ""The UK and US remain resolute in our mission to get as many people out as possible. It is testament to the remarkable courage of our personnel that they continue to do so while under fire,"" he said. A statement from the MoD said: ""Our primary concern remains the safety of our personnel, British citizens and the citizens of Afghanistan. We are in close contact with our US and other NATO allies at an operational level on the immediate response to this incident."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called the attack ""devastating"", and said his thoughts were with ""all those killed and wounded, serving personnel supporting the evacuations and all those desperately trying to leave"". He added: ""The bravery of the troops at the airport will always outweigh the cowardice of those who wish to harm us."" This video can not be played Earlier, Boris Johnson said the UK had rescued the ""overwhelming majority"" of people to whom it owes a debt Kabul airport iscurrently being defended and run by the US, which has 5,800 troops on the ground - with the help of more than 1,000 UK troops. Armed Forces minister James Heappey declined to give a date for the last UK evacuation flights, but said it was likely that UK and other foreign troops would have to leave before the last American airlifts. However, Mr Johnson has insisted the US deadline will not mark the end of the UK's efforts to help people wishing to flee the Taliban-controlled country. He said on Thursday that the current airlifts were just the ""first phase"". ""Even beyond the US deadline of 31 of this month, we hope to be able to continue to say to people, well you can come out,"" he said.

"Mr Cook's payout was part of a deal he struck when he took over from co-founder Steve Jobs Apple chief executive Tim Cook has received more than five million shares in the technology giant, as he marks ten years in the job. A company filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) watchdog shows that he sold most of the shares for more than $750m (Â£550m). It is part of a deal he struck when he took over from co-founder Steve Jobs. The award depended on how well Apple's shares performed compared to other firms on the S&P 500 stock index. According to Apple's filing with the SEC, Mr Cook was eligible for the award as the company's shares had risen by 191.83% over the last three years. It also noted that Apple's share price has increased 1,200% since he became chief executive on 24 August 2011. The company behind the iPhone, iPad and MacBook now has a market valuation of almost $2.5tn. Last year, Mr Cook agreed to a new pay package that runs to the end of 2026. A SEC filing also showed that earlier this week Mr Cook donated almost $10m worth of Apple shares to charity, without naming the recipient. In 2015, Mr Cook said he would give away his entire fortune before he dies, and is known to have donated tens of millions of dollars to charity. He currently has a net worth of around $1.5bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire's Index. Mr Cook has often spoken publicly about his concerns over issues including HIV and Aids, climate change, human rights and equality. He follows other mega-rich US business people who have said they would give away all or a significant portion of their fortunes in their lifetimes. In 2010, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and investment veteran Warren Buffett launched the Giving Pledge, which called on billionaires to give away at least half of their fortunes. Earlier this year, Mr Buffett donated to charity another $4.1bn worth of shares in his company Berkshire Hathaway.

"This video can not be played Twin bombs exploded near the perimeter of Kabul airport, hours after warnings from Western governments President Joe Biden has promised to hunt down the jihadists behind an attack in Kabul which killed at least 90 people - including 13 US troops. Mr Biden warned the US would ""not forgive"" the perpetrators. The twin blasts, claimed by a local branch of Islamic State (IS), tore through crowds of men, women and children outside Kabul airport. They were hoping to join the 100,000 people airlifted out of Afghanistan since it fell to Taliban militants. There had been repeated warnings that an attack was likely, but it either did not reach or did not deter those waiting. US troops in control of Kabul international airport have been facilitating the evacuation of foreign nationals and Afghans who had been working with foreign missions. They have been aiming to complete this within a 31 August deadline for US forces to leave under an agreement with the Taliban. A number of European countries have already announced the end of their evacuation plans. The UK said on Friday it would not be processing any more applications, acknowledging it was leaving people behind. Speaking hours after Thursday's attack, Mr Biden vowed to complete the evacuation mission, adding ""we will not be deterred by terrorists"". Who are IS-K? He said the US military had been ordered to attack the leadership, assets and facilities of the group known as Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K), active in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The group is part of the global IS network, but has local links - even to the Taliban. However, IS-K have accused the Taliban of abandoning the battlefield in favour of a negotiated peace settlement. The attack at the airport - which began at about 18:00 local time (13:30 GMT) - targeted ""translators and collaborators with the American army"", the jihadist group said. The first blast happened near the Abbey Gate, where US and British forces have been checking people entering the airport, followed by a second minutes later  at a hotel which was used by British officials to process Afghans hoping to travel to the UK. Survivors described the horror in the wake of the attack, with one saying they saw ""bodies and body parts flying in the air like a tornado blowing plastic bags"". Another recounted how they tried to take an injured baby to safety, only for the child to die in their arms. Pictures being shared on social media suggest families have lost several members. Hospitals were quickly overwhelmed with the injured. Alberto Zanin, the medical director of one facility run by Italian NGO Emergency, described on Twitter how the victims ""could not speak, many were terrified, their eyes totally lost in emptiness, their gaze blank"". Thursday's events as they happened Airport attack: What we know Thirteen US troops were among those killed - the first US military casualties in Afghanistan since February 2020. Mr Biden said the troops who had died ""were heroes who were on a selfless mission to save the lives of others"". The head of US Central Command, Gen Frank McKenzie, said the threat from IS-K remained high and US forces were working with Taliban to try to stop further attacks and that the Taliban had already prevented many. But the attack is likely to significantly complicate the evacuation effort ahead of the deadline. There are currently 5,800 US troops on the ground at Kabul airport with a further 1,000 UK troops also there. To date, 104,000 civilians have been transferred from Afghanistan, including 66,000 by the US and 37,000 by allies and partners. Where will all the Afghan refugees go? UK enters final stages of Afghan evacuation About 5,000 people are waiting at the airport and many more are still trying to get through the perimeter checkpoints. A number of countries, including Canada, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Denmark had already stopped their operations. Turkey has announced that its troops, who had been providing security at the airport for six years, were withdrawing. Kabul attack: What we know Attack leaves many casualties.
