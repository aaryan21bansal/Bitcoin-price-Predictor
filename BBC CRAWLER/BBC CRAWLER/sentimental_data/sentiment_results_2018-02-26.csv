"This was a wide-ranging speech setting out Labour's views of Britain's place in the world after Brexit. But the main focus was on the UK's future economic relationship with the European Union. The BBC's Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris has been looking at a few key quotes from the speech. This was the key passage of Jeremy Corbyn's speech - putting clear water between Labour and the government. He wants to stay in a customs union to avoid the imposition of tariffs on goods traded within Europe, and to help solve the Brexit conundrum at the Irish border. As a member of the EU, the UK is currently in the customs union, which means that all countries impose a common external tariff - in effect the same tax - on goods being brought in from elsewhere in the world. Once those goods have crossed the external border, there are no further tariffs to move them around inside the customs union. Mr Corbyn wants to replicate most of that in a new customs union, which would certainly help companies who rely on moving goods across EU borders several times in their manufacturing process. But it wouldn't entirely solve the problem in Ireland, because some of the border issues - such as food safety or animal welfare - involve regulations that are nothing to do with the customs relationship. Here Mr Corbyn addresses the government's primary reason for opposing the formation of a new customs union: that it would stop the UK doing trade deals around the world. He says he wants to ensure that the UK will be able to negotiate new trade deals ""in the national interest"". Although he is not explicit about what this involves in practice, it appears to mean that Labour wants the UK to be involved in negotiating those trade deals alongside the EU. He is not suggesting that the UK would be an entirely separate entity in international trade. Membership of a customs union constrains your ability to sign your own trade deals, because you can't alter external tariffs. But you can negotiate on services, or on harmonising regulations with other countries. Mr Corbyn argues that this is a compromise worth making, and it is another significant departure from government policy. The Conservatives accuse him of wanting to have his cake and eat it - a familiar theme. This is Mr Corbyn's political pitch, trying to peel enough Tory MPs away from the government to be able to defeat it in Parliament on the question of a customs union. He is trying to position Labour in the middle ground - supporting what appears to be a softer version of Brexit rather than what he would see as a hard ideological one. Of course anything Labour proposes, just like anything the government has proposed, does not have to win the approval of Parliament alone. It would also have to be negotiated with the rest of the EU, which remains suspicious of any UK effort to cherry-pick the best bits. Mr Corbyn was very clear about this - attacking the government for starting with what he called rigid red lines on immigration and only afterwards working out what it meant for the economy. He says it is very clear that free movement of people from the EU would come to an end. There would, he says, be reasonable management of immigration, but the economy should always come first. This is a delicate balancing act. Without free movement of people, the UK will not get the same access to the single market that it has now. On the other hand, Labour can't ignore the ""take back control"" message entirely. But it is interesting to note that there was no mention at all in this speech of the future role of the European Court of Justice. It has always been clear that Jeremy Corbyn has never been a massive EU enthusiast. He says he campaigned for ""Remain with reform"" - which sounds suspiciously like David Cameron. But he was trying to appeal to both Remain and Leave voters in this speech, arguing that Brexit would lead neither to disaster nor to a land of milk and honey. Like the prime minister, he is trying to claim the Brexit middle ground. But, also like the prime minister, that doesn't mean he can sit on the fence, with little more than a year to go before Brexit is due to happen.

"This video can not be played Liam Fox: UK doesn't need a fairy godmother Any form of customs union with the EU after Brexit would be a ""complete sellout"" for the UK, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has said. The UK would find itself in a ""worse position"" than it is now, he said, if it left the existing arrangement but negotiated a similar new one. Having to accept EU rules and limits on doing other deals would make the UK ""less attractive"", he said. But his former top official has criticised the government's strategy. Sir Martin Donnelly, who was permanent secretary in the Department for International Trade until last year, said any deals done after Brexit would not compensate for leaving the single market and the customs union. Giving up access to the EU market and its existing trade agreements was ""rather like rejecting a three course meal now in favour of the promise of a packet of crisps later"", he said. Congestion charge 'shows way for NI border' Corbyn backs customs union membership Reality Check: How much of the UK's trade is with the EU? Sir Martin, who has previously warned about leaving the single market and has worked for the European Commission in the past, said that negotiating full access to the single market without accepting EU rules would require a ""fairy godmother specialised in trade law"". Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he did ""not agree for a moment"" with Sir Martin's verdict, because the ""real growth opportunities"" were outside the EU. Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a long-term customs union, as Labour has proposed, would lead to ""colony status for the UK"", which would not get a say in trade policy. The customs union means there are no internal tariffs And Mr Fox hit back at Sir Martin as he took questions after his speech, saying it was ""unsurprising that those who spend a lifetime working in the European Union see moving away from the European Union as being threatening"". He added: ""The UK Brexit process is, as we've all discovered, a little more complex than a packet of Walkers."" The government has said it wants a customs agreement with the EU - which is the UK's single largest trading partner accounting for 43% of exports - but one that does not stop it from doing free trade deals with other countries. Mr Fox, one of the most prominent Brexiteers in the cabinet, is the latest minister to set out his stall as part of the government's attempt to map out ""the road to Brexit"", which is due to happen in March 2019. His speech came the day after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn set out his approach to Brexit, saying he backed the UK being in a ""new and comprehensive"" customs union with the EU. Laura Kuenssberg on Labour's position Coveney of 'one mind' with EU negotiators Brexit: All you need to know Mr Corbyn says a new customs union will help protect existing jobs and supply chains while giving the UK a say in future deals negotiated by the EU. But Mr Fox rejected this, saying the UK would have to cede ""considerable control"" of its trade policy to Brussels in any customs union. In his speech, at Bloomberg in London, Mr Fox said that changing economic and trade patterns meant the EU was a less significant partner than 15 years ago and the UK must have the freedom to exploit the ""opportunities of the future"", particularly in services and digital industries. ""As rule takers, without any say in how the rules were made, we would be in a worse position than we are today,"" he said. ""It would be a complete sellout of Britain's national interests."" Citing Turkey's experience of being outside the EU but joined in a customs union with it, he  said that if the UK found itself unable to set its own rules in key sectors of the economy, this would ""remove the bulk of incentives"" for other countries to enter into comprehensive free trade agreements. ""The inevitable price of trying to negotiate with one arm tied behind our back is that we would become less attractive to potential trade partners and forfeit many of the opportunities that would otherwise be available."" UK 'could join Pacific free trade zone' Brexit UK 'won't be Mad Max-style world' Japan warns on Brexit 'high stakes' Flexibility, he said, must be the basis of the UK's trade policy if it is to support the fledgling industries that will provide much of the employment and income of the future. ""There is a growing awareness that a full-blown gold-plated free trade agreement may not be the only solution in a fast-changing global economy,"" he said. There is a ""global trade toolbox"" of different options, including ""multi-country alliances of the like-minded"", he said. ""All of these options are available. But only to countries with independent trade policies."" Labour said it made more sense for the UK to be negotiating new trade deals alongside the EU, adding: ""Liam Fox is divorced from reality and isolated from British businesses and workers."" But Conservative MP Nigel Evans told BBC 2's Daily Politics: ""When you're doing trade deals between one country and another country, it's a lot easier than when you're doing it with somebody representing 28 countries."" Meanwhile former World Trade Organisation chief Pascal Lamy argued that whatever Brexit option was chosen ""will necessitate a border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic. ""There will have to be a border"", he told the Commons Brexit committee, because checks will have to be carried out on goods and people. He suggested a ""Macau option"" for Northern Ireland. ""You should think about giving to Northern Ireland the same autonomous trade capacity that China has given to Macau, which doesn't mean that Macau doesn't belong to China,"" he said. The European Commission will publish the first draft of its proposed withdrawal treaty on Wednesday, which it wants both sides to agree to by the autumn to allow for an orderly departure.

"This video can not be played Leicester explosion: What we know Five people have died in an explosion at a shop in Leicester. Residents said they heard ""a big thud, like an earthquake"" at the time of the blast in Hinckley Road at about 19:00 GMT on Sunday. Five other people remain in hospital, one in a critical condition, Leicestershire Police said. Supt Shane O'Neill said police believe there may be more people unaccounted for and rescue efforts were continuing on Monday. As it happened: Five dead in building explosion At this stage the explosion is not being linked to terrorism, he added. The building consisted of a shop premises on the ground level and a two-storey flat above. Crews are searching through debris strewn across Hinckley Road The shop had gone through many owners but recently became a Polish supermarket called Zabka. It is believed to have only been trading since the new year. Store owner Aram Kurd, who was on duty with another member of staff, said he had gone to the storeroom when the explosion happened. This video can not be played Shop owner trapped under rubble: ""I saw fire from everywhere, like I was inside hell"" ""I heard a big bang, I thought 'What was that?' and found myself on the floor. ""My eyes were open, looking up and my body was half covered in rubble. I couldn't breathe, I was lying....I don't know how long for. ""Everywhere I could see fire, like I was inside hell."" Mr Kurd said he did not know what happened to the member of staff. Krishna Rungen, who lives nearby, said his brother-in-law lived at the address with his wife and three sons. Mr Rungen said his brother-in-law, who was at work when the explosion happened, was at the hospital with his youngest son, who was not seriously injured. ""I am still waiting for news from the hospital and from the police,"" he said. A section of Hinckley Road in Leicester remains cordoned off Matt Cane, group manager at Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service, said the bodies of the five people were found during the search of the building. He added fire crews were still working to find survivors who may be trapped in ""voids"" inside the collapsed building. ""When you look at the pictures of the building it looks incredibly unlikely that we would find anybody but we are absolutely committed to search and rescue at this stage,"" he said. ""There are still pockets of fire in the basement area of the building."" Rescue work was temporarily suspended at about 14:00 on Monday over fears for the stability of a neighbouring building. This video can not be played Supt Shane O'Neill said that four people had died, before the death toll later rose to five Gas network Cadent said it had assisted emergency services on Sunday night by ""isolating the gas supply"" to the building and adjoining properties on Hinckley Road. Supt O'Neill, from Leicestershire Police, said he ""can't say at this stage"" what may have caused the explosion. ""It is a joint investigation between the fire service and the police and the priority is to make the area safe,"" he added. He urged anyone who knows someone who is missing to contact police, adding: ""It is still a search and rescue operation. It is important we try and find as many people as possible."" Tony Hartley, who lives near the blast site, said a group of men ran to the scene to help the injured people. ""Me and a friend lifted up a steel girder with about five other blokes and removed a bloke from underneath it,"" he said. ""We then turned round, saw rubble and heard a little boy crying. There was me and another bloke sifting through the rubble and we managed to pull the boy out. ""I said to him 'Is there anybody else in there?' and he said 'My friend's a metre back inside the building' and that's when the emergency services turned up. Leicestershire Police declared a ""major incident"" after the blast in Hinckley Road Amid the unfolding tragedy of the past few days, many positive stories have emerged of ordinary people helping others in their hour of need. Before emergency services arrived and the flames took hold, people rushed out of homes and businesses and started trying to dig through the rubble. Dave Hornby - who directed traffic in his slippers - described how he saw dozens of people helping. ""There were a lot of people around the shop front pulling rubble apart trying to get people out - there were probably 20 or 30,"" he said. ""There was a chap who pulled somebody out. He wasn't sure whether the person was in the building or just walking past at the time, and he dragged them out literally from the rubble."" Mr Hornby himself was thanked by a police officer who mistook him for an off-duty colleague. Others gave first aid so the emergency services could concentrate on helping those most badly injured. One woman described how her daughter and son-in-law treated two people who were taken away in ambulances. ""My daughter is a nurse so we went out and we did what we could,"" she said. ""People were fetching chairs so we could sit the patients down. The police were giving us first aid kits and silver foil blankets because they wanted to help people who were really bad."" Further people have given shelter to neighbours unable to return to their own homes. Mr Hornby said the community in the area is ""very good"" and ""everybody just went out and did what they could"".

She said: ""The building had gone down and people were trying to help where they could by taking the bricks off. But the fire was getting bigger and bigger so people were told to leave the scene."" This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the extent of the blast at a shop in Hinckley Road Emergency service workers remain at the scene and are being offered drinks and food by a rapid relief team. A 79-year-old resident, who lives nearby but did not want to be named, said a 15-year-old boy suffered head injuries in the blast. ""Someone brought him a duvet to keep him warm while waiting for an ambulance to arrive. Someone also brought him a stool from one of the houses and a chap was bandaging his head. I think he had a cut above his eyes and his back was hurt."" Search and rescue crews search through the rubble By BBC reporter John Alexander There was a noise which sounded like the pilot light of a house boiler being lit, a loud whoosh followed by a tremor, like an earthquake. At first I thought my boiler had exploded or my roof was falling in so ran outside, as did most of my neighbours. Then we were all asked to leave our houses. I think the shop was usually open until about 22:00, most of the shops are convenience stores and takeaways along the road where the explosion was. I tried to find out last night when we could get back into our houses and what they thought had caused the blast but they weren't prepared to say. I was told we could return if we wanted at 04:30 and the power has been restored. The road is still closed and there is a large plume of smoke coming from the building, the fire is still burning. Rescue efforts are still under way as police believe there may be more people unaccounted for Hinckley Road, from its junction with Bolton Road to its junction with Woodville Road, remains closed in both directions and motorists are advised to avoid the area. About 28 properties in Hinckley Road were left without electricity following the explosion but power has since been restored, Western Power Distribution said. Firefighters are expected to be on the site for ""a number of days"" and it was ""still too early to say"" what caused the explosion, Mr Cane added. Leicester explosion: What we know.

"This video can not be played Mark Rowley said four far-right terror attacks were foiled last year The retiring head of counter-terrorism policing in the UK has warned of the growing threat of far-right terrorism. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, who will retire from the Met Police next month, said four extreme-right terror plots were disrupted last year. Ten Islamist-inspired plots have been foiled since March last year, he added. In a speech made at Policy Exchange, the Met Police's Mr Rowley also warned that far-right extremists are working in similar ways to Islamist extremists. He said they create intolerance, exploit grievances, and generate distrust of state institutions. One of the four alleged far-right plots disrupted was that of white supremacist Ethan Stables. Earlier this month,he was convicted of plotting an axe and machete attack on a gay pride event at a pub in Barrow. The clues right-wing terrorists give away UK unveils extremism blocking tool Was 2017 the worst year for UK terrorism? Mr Rowley said: ""Islamist and right-wing extremism is reaching into our communities through sophisticated propaganda and subversive strategies creating and exploiting vulnerabilities that can ultimately lead to acts of violence and terrorism. ""Ten conspiracies of an Islamist nature were stopped since the Westminster attack. ""And I can tell you today that over the same period police have been able to prevent a further four extreme, right-wing inspired plots in the UK."" He said it was ""important we make these figures public in order to illustrate the growth of right-wing extremism"". Referring to the banned group National Action, he said: ""For the first time we have a home-grown proscribed white supremacist, neo-Nazi terror group, which seeks to plan attacks and build international networks."" Last year, the security service MI5 joined the fight against the right-wing terrorist threat. There are currently more than 600 live investigations and more than 3,000 people of interest at any one time. While they have not been involved directly in terrorism, he singled out Tommy Robinson, who founded the English Defence League (EDL), and Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First, as voices from the far right who stir up tensions. Mr Rowley told the BBC: ""In the noise and focus on the global threat, and what we've wrestled with with Daesh [the Islamic State group], I don't think the change and growth in extreme right-wing terrorist threat has been explained or described well enough - and that's one of the things I wanted to do."" Aside from the attempted gay pride attack in Barrow, the other three alleged plots that were foiled last year are yet to come to trial. One allegedly involved a neo-Nazi buying a machete with the intention of murdering the Labour MP Rosie Cooper. Mr Rowley oversaw the response to five terror attacks in the UK last year, including at Westminster Mr Rowley said the ability of extremists and terrorists of all kinds to ""ply their trade"" through the internet was of great concern. He urged social media companies to do more to combat extremism. ""Many of them tried to argue for some that they simply provide pipes, they have no editorial responsibilities,"" he said. ""That argument was always in my view nonsense. They've stopped using that argument. They've started to try and take some responsibility. ""I think to be fair to them, they can't exert editorial control over everything that is published on their sites. ""But they can exert a massive amount of control both on the day-to -ay management of it, and I think more in the future about how they design their platforms and their operating systems and their products. ""Their products shouldn't simply be designed for maximising profit, they should be designed with a parallel objective around public safety."" Mr Rowley was also asked what should happen to two Londoners suspected of being members of an Islamic State cell - dubbed ""the Beatles"" by Western media because of their British accents. The gang was notorious for kidnapping Western hostages and filming their murders - often by beheading. Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh were captured in Syria in January and are accused of links to a string of hostage murders in Iraq and Syria. Mr Rowley said: ""The people who have done the most ghastly things overseas, the ones who don't fight to the death, we would all like to see them never able to do anyone any harm ever again. ""Locking them up and throwing away the key would be a great idea."" Mohammed Emwazi, better known as ""Jihadi John"", was a suspected member of the cell before his death.

"A five-year-old girl with a history of asthma was turned away from seeing her doctor because she was ""late"" - and died that night in hospital. An inquest heard Ellie-May Clark was not seen by Grange Clinic in Newport despite having an emergency appointment because it operated a ""10 minute rule"". A chance to ""provide potentially life-saving treatment was missed"" said the coroner, giving a narrative verdict. After the hearing in Newport, Ellie-May's family said ""she was let down"". Call to publish GMC's Ellie-May GP findings Ellie-May's mother Shanice Clark told the inquest in Newport she requested a home visit when her daughter began wheezing and was unable to walk home from Malpas Court Primary School in January 2015. This video can not be played Ellie-May's grandmother Brandi Clark told the BBC in 2017 that Ellie-May was ""so funny and loving"" Instead, she was offered an emergency slot for 25 minutes later. She said she told the receptionist she might be late as she had to arrange childcare and catch a bus. Ms Clark said when she arrived at the surgery in the Malpas area of Newport she was five minutes late for her 17:00 appointment but had spoken to the receptionist by 17:10. But this time was disputed by former receptionist Ann Jones who told the inquest she believed it was 18 minutes past five when the doctor was informed that Ellie-May had arrived. The child's mother was then told by GP Dr Joanne Rowe, a partner in the surgery and its lead for child safeguarding, that she would have to return in the morning. The Grange Clinic in the Malpas area of Newport However, the coroner heard this was the first time the rule had been imposed on an emergency appointment. Ms Clark said she was ""angry"" and ""upset"" when they were asked to come back. She said Ellie asked: ""Why won't the doctor see me?"" Dr Rowe did not ask the reason behind Ellie-May's emergency appointment, or look into her medical notes before refusing to see her. The hearing was told Ms Clark continued to check on her daughter at home every 10 to 15 minutes and at about 22:30 she was coughing. Ms Clark said Ellie-May then fell off the bed and was turning blue. She was taken to the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport by ambulance but died. The inquest was told that the cause of death was bronchial asthma. The family have acknowledged an apology from Dr Joanne Rowe Wendy James, senior coroner for Gwent, recorded a narrative conclusion and said it was ""not acceptable"" for Ellie-May to have been turned away from her emergency appointment without any clinical assessment or advice for what to do if her condition worsened. ""From the evidence before me, it is not possible for me to determine with certainty whether an earlier intervention would have altered the outcome for Ellie but nonetheless Ellie should have been seen by a GP that day and she was let down by the failures in the system,"" she said. ""Ellie-May Clark died of natural causes where the opportunity to provide potentially life-saving treatment was missed."" The family released a statement and were ""disappointed that a finding of neglect was not reached"". ""The family acknowledge an apology from Dr Rowe, especially as they have been waiting in excess of three years for an outcome and to receive answers to their questions,"" said their lawyer Justin Chisnall. The coroner will write a report to the clinic and the local health board to address the lack of an effective and robust care plan for Ellie-May. A spokesman for Aneurin Bevan University Health Board said it would be ""inappropriate to comment whilst we await the coroner's report"".

"This video can not be played Heavy snow and freezing winds are forecast for Tuesday Snow is falling across parts of the UK as very cold air sweeps in from Russia. Heavy snow is expected across southern and eastern England overnight on Monday - with warnings extending into the Midlands, Scotland and Wales on Tuesday morning. Many areas have been hit by freezing temperatures, with a wind chill making it feel like -15C in some places. Rail firms have warned of disruption, with many planning to run a reduced service overnight and on Tuesday. A snow emergency was declared in Kentand the council urged people not to contact it unless there is an emergency. Heavy snow is forecast for much of Yorkshire, Teesside, Durham and Newcastle in the early hours of Tuesday morning, which is likely to cause delays on the roads, the Met Office said. A warning is also in place for London and parts of the South East on Tuesday, with the possibility of delays and cancellations on travel networks as well as power cuts in rural areas.

"Mark Aizlewood's former clubs include Cardiff City, Bristol City, Leeds United and Charlton Athletic Ex-footballers Mark Aizlewood and Paul Sugrue have been jailed for their part in a Â£5m football apprenticeship fraud. The government-funded scheme claimed to help youngsters from deprived backgrounds gain coaching qualifications. But those running it lied about the number of people enrolled and did not carry out all of the promised training. In total, four men were found guilty and two others admitted fraud charges at Southwark Crown Court. Aizlewood, 58, was a Welsh international while Sugrue, 56, played for clubs including Middlesbrough and Cardiff City. Judge David Tomlinson said the scam involved ""eye watering sums of government money"". Jailing Aizlewood for six years and Sugrue for seven years, he added: ""There was a serious detrimental effect on colleges of further education"" calling it a ""shameful exploitation"". Ex-players guilty of fraud False Premier League dreams sold for Â£5m Fellow director Keith Williams, 45, from Anglesey, and Jack Harper, 30, from Merseyside were found guilty of fraud charges alongside Aizlewood and Sugrue, following a four-month trial. Williams was jailed for four years and Harper for 18 months. Two other men, Christopher Martin, 53, from Catmore, Berkshire, and Stephen Gooding, 53, from Bridgwater in Somerset, had previously pleaded guilty for their role in the youth training scheme fraud. Martin was given five years and three months in prison, while Gooding was sentenced to 20 months. Aizlewood was identified by investigators as the leader of the scam, using his influence to defraud colleges, charities, football clubs and sports associations between 2009 and 2011. Capped 39 times by Wales, he played for Newport County, Luton Town, Charlton Athletic, Leeds United, Bradford City, Cardiff City and Bristol City. Most recently, he was manager at Carmarthen Town, who terminated his contract when the verdict was announced. The four directors of Luis Michael Training: Mark Aizlewood, Paul Sugrue, Chris Martin and Keith Williams Mark Aizlewood was sentenced to six years for conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. He was convicted of one count but cleared of the other Paul Sugrue will serve seven years for two counts of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation Keith Williams was found guilty of two counts of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation and will serve four years Jack Harper was found guilty of fraud and using a false instrument and was given an 18-month sentence Christopher Martin admitted two charges of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation before the trial and was given five years, three months Stephen Gooding admitted one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation and was given 20 months Aizlewood set up Luis Michael Training Ltd as a football-based apprenticeship scheme with Sugrue, Williams and Martin, promising to provide full-time training in football coaching as well as work experience and a Â£95 weekly salary to 3,800 students. Instead, the court heard that for every apprentice enrolled, the defendants claimed money provided by the UK government. Hundreds of the students on their books did not even exist, while some lived at the opposite end of the country from the scheme or were doing just two to three hours of study a week. The men were charged after a whistleblower alerted Gwent Police in November 2011 and the Serious Fraud Office spent more than four years collecting 5.2 million pieces of evidence and interviewing 600 people. Investigations found that between October 2009 and December 2010, Sugrue pocketed Â£516,000, Aizlewood Â£424,000, Gooding Â£448,000, Harper Â£311,000, Williams Â£295,000 and Martin Â£249,000.

"Jonathan and Eleanor Udall were on honeymoon when the crash happened A fifth British tourist has died following a helicopter crash in the Grand Canyon that also killed her new husband. Eleanor Udall, nee Milward, 29, was on her honeymoon with Jonathan Udall, when the accident happened on 10 February. Mr Udall, who was in his 30s and from Brighton, died four days ago. Mrs Udall's family said it was ""with great sadness"" that they announced their daughter had died in a Las Vegas hospital as a result of her injuries. ""The family are exceedingly grateful for everything done by rescue services and volunteers in the Canyon, and throughout the last two weeks by the exceptional staff at UMC (University Medical Centre, Las Vegas),"" their statement said. Stuart Hill, 30, and his girlfriend Becky Dobson, 27, and brother Jason, 32, from Worthing, West Sussex, died in the crash. Another Briton, Jennifer Barham, 39, and the pilot Scott Booth, 42, were injured when the aircraft crashed in the remote Quartermaster Canyon. A message posted on Monday on a crowdfunding page set up to help Mr and Mrs Udall said: ""It deeply saddens me once more to update this page. ""Yesterday Ellie lost her battle to her injuries, the only consolidation I can muster is that she is no longer in pain and is, I hope, with Jon. ""The continued support to this page is heart-warming during this tragic time. ""May we never forget this wonderful couple."" Parents' tribute to 'wonderful' sons Grand Canyon helicopter crash victims 'life and soul of party' Mr and Mrs Udall, who both worked at Yorkshire Building Society, were friends with the other Britons in the helicopter. Stuart (left) and Jason Hill also died in the crash The Eurocopter (now Airbus) EC130 helicopter had spun out of control as it came in to land before crashing and catching fire. The crash is being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board but an initial report indicates possible causes could include a mechanical problem and gusty winds. The chief of the Hualapai Police, Francis Bradley, had described the terrain as ""extremely rugged"". He said the rescue efforts had been hampered by severe weather conditions and gusts of up to 50mph (80 km/h). Jason and Stuart Hill and Ms Dobson, who had been in the US for Stuart's 30th birthday, died at the scene. Becky Dobson was on holiday to celebrate her boyfriend's 30th birthday Jason Hill worked as a corporate lawyer for Shoosmiths in its Milton Keynes office. Stuart Hill was a salesman at a Mercedes-Benz dealership in Brighton, East Sussex, while his girlfriend Ms Dobson, worked as a veterinary receptionist for Vets 4 Pets in Worthing. High winds delayed emergency services from getting the injured to hospital The helicopter company involved - Papillon Airways - calls itself ""the world's largest aerial sightseeing company"" and says it flies more than 600,000 people a year. The Grand Canyon, which is more than one mile (1.6km) deep, is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the US.

" The phone rings. Shelley knows who it is before she answers it. Embarrassed, she leaves her desk and walks into the kitchen so that none of her colleagues can hear. “You need to come and get him. We can't control him, you have to come now,” says an all-too-familiar voice. It's March 2017 and  Shelley's eight-year-old son Cruz has been playing up at school - again. He's only in Year 3 but his behaviour has been a problem for years. Cruz and Shelley Shelley first raised concerns with the school when he was in reception but as time has gone by, his refusal to play by the rules has become increasingly serious. It is infringing on his and his classmates' ability to learn - and the school is taking action. This time, the voice at the other end of the phone explains, his behaviour is putting himself in danger. No more details are given about the nature of Cruz's latest misdemeanour. Shelley doesn't ask. She doesn't need to. The phone calls have become a regular occurrence, practically every other week, with other behavioural issues in between. “He's smashed up the classroom… he's hiding under the desk... he's ripped up someone's work,” she's been told before. On one occasion, the school had to be evacuated. This time, she is told on arrival, Cruz tried to leave the school grounds by climbing over the main gate. Shelley apologises profusely to staff - as she has done on many occasions. But this time feels different. She knows Cruz is running low on chances. She has been told before that the school will consider permanent exclusion. She needs to find a solution, but doesn't know where to turn. It's a Monday afternoon at Hawkswood Primary Pupil Referral Unit in north London, and five children sit behind their desks, eyes on the teacher. “Why do we think Jo was kicked out of school?” asks deputy head teacher Leah Mwaniki, in a class designed to help pupils understand how to control their behaviour. Kyan puts his hand up. “Because she was naughty,” he says. Kyan has been in the pupil referral unit (PRU) for more than a month, having been referred by his school. He was at risk of exclusion because of his violent behaviour and angry outbursts. “Do we say ‘naughty’?” Mwaniki asks rhetorically, looking for a different answer. Teachers are careful not to label their pupils. Kyan tries again. “[She made] the wrong choices,” he says, this time getting the answer spot on. “We teach the children that they have a choice when they feel frustrated,” explains head teacher Marie Gentles after the class. Marie Gentles “They have a choice when they feel anxious or angry, and we teach them they're in control of those choices.” Hawkswood specialises in caring for children like Kyan, who have been - or are on the verge of being - permanently excluded from their mainstream school. With small class sizes - usually with up to eight children in each - it focuses on pupils' emotional wellbeing, background and behavioural difficulties, and prepares them to go back into mainstream education. “Some children have come from a background of some form of abuse but not all children have, and I think that's important to stress,” Gentles says. “Most parents are working, trying really hard to provide for their children. But somewhere along the line something's gone slightly wrong.” Like other pupil referral units across the UK, the school follows the national curriculum. Pupils stay for at least 20 weeks before returning to mainstream education, but only once they are judged to be ready. It is home to 40 pupils, all of primary school age, though pupil referral units catering for secondary school pupils also exist. Such schools have become increasingly important in recent years. The Victoria Derbyshire programme has discovered that the number of children educated in primary-age PRUs has risen 34% in recent years - from 3,181 in 2013-14 to 4,261 in 2016-17. But there is still a stigma attached to them. “Parents can be very, very resistant,” says Gentles. “They think there's going to be children fighting in the corridors. And they walk in and it's really calm.” When the idea of sending Cruz to a pupil referral unit was first mentioned to Shelley by her son's “early help team”, she admits she scoffed at the idea. “I said, ‘No, that's where all the weird kids go, the outcasts,’” she says. But desperate for change and worried that a permanent exclusion was imminent, she decided to contact Hawkswood herself. “As soon as I walked through the door I thought, ‘He has to come here. This is what he needs,’” she says. “The staff understood me. They got me. They said, ‘He's misunderstood, and we need to get to the bottom of it.’” Shelley wipes away tears as she speaks, recalling that moment. “The reason I'm getting emotional is because of the way they wanted to help me. “No-one had listened. My family were giving up hope, and the school gave me that hope back.” Throughout Cruz's childhood, Shelley's parenting had been scrutinised by her own family who thought she could manage him better. “They would be thinking that I'm behaving like a weak parent,” she says. “They'd say, ‘He needs to be disciplined, he needs to be told. Do this with him, do that.’ “But normal discipline procedures were not working with him. It's not that I wasn't trying to be strict.” It reached the stage where Shelley decided to quit her job to focus on Cruz, despite the financial strain it would cause. At times, Shelley says, it was only the knowledge that she had three other well-behaved children that stopped her from questioning her judgement as a parent. Cruz does not see his father but Shelley is keen to stress that he comes from a “very stable, loving family”, and that his father's absence is not the root cause of his behaviour. “Cruz showed signs of this behaviour even when I was with his dad, from when he was in nursery,” she says. Shelley with Cruz as a baby “When he was a toddler, he showed signs of being problematic. “He did not like to conform. He was rebellious, he had a temper. He didn't like being told what to do.” As he grew older, Cruz would frequently cause fights with his brothers and sisters. Cruz with his brother and sister He was also violent in class, although it is not something he wants to talk about. Asked to describe his behaviour at the time, Cruz pauses to reflect on how best to answer. “I called out in class. Everybody did,” he says sheepishly, his body language closed off. Shelley, though, knows the extent of the problem all too well - and the effects it had on her son's relationships with others. “Cruz wasn't making friends. Any child that tried to get close, Cruz would bully, push away. They couldn't find common ground. “Then you worry that if he's not able to make friends, not able to fit in in a class environment, how's he going to fit into the big wide world? “I love him, but I want everyone else to love him. But how could they, with the way he's acting?” Shelley was also concerned about the way he viewed himself. “I remember one time when Cruz had a massive panic attack,” she says. Cruz was just eight years old at the time. “I didn't know how to help him. I couldn't believe it. “Part of me was like, ‘Where's he getting this from. Has he seen a film? Is he making it up?’ But it was heartfelt. He meant it. “He was in a really dark place, and he expressed it by not wanting to be around any more. He thought no-one loved him. “Even though he was showered with love and care, he didn't feel it.” As Cruz entered Hawkswood for the first time, she could only hope it would make a difference. It's an English lesson, and four of Hawkswood's youngest pupils are sitting cross-legged on a rug in the centre of a busy, brightly coloured room. The walls are adorned with the children's artwork, storage baskets full of cuddly toys hang from the ceiling and a rail of dressing-up clothes sits by the door. The pupils are reading from a picture book with the teacher but one child has been separated from the group. Anni is just five years old but she has already been permanently excluded from her mainstream school. She is having to be held down on her chair by deputy head teacher Kate Milligan while her colleague continues reading with the others. But Anni is pushing boundaries. She spits at Milligan's face. Anni spits at Kate Milligan A verbal warning is given but she continues, leading Milligan to use a restraint technique known in the school as “safe holding”. Used as a last resort, it can take many forms. It involves a teacher applying pressure, often to the child's shoulders, to stop their movement. In some cases it can involve the adult standing behind the child and placing their arms across them, with their right palm on the child's left shoulder, and their left palm on the child's right shoulder, effectively prohibiting them from moving. It is designed to protect the children for their own safety and the safety of others - something that is explained to them. Staff are regularly trained on its use. In this instance, Milligan places her palm on the left hand side of Anni's face to stop her spitting in the teacher's direction. “This behaviour is not acceptable and we won't be having that tomorrow,” she tells the five-year-old calmly but authoritatively. Anni screams and continues to spit on the hand of Milligan - who calmly asks for another teacher to join her. She arrives and sits on the opposite side of Anni, placing her palm on the right-hand-side of the child's face, ensuring she can only look forward. As they do this, they emphasise how Anni has the choice to behave well. “Until this afternoon, this little blip, she has been such a superstar,” says Milligan. “She had the best morning.” Anni begins to calm down, and after just two minutes reaches the point where Milligan is confident the restraint technique is no longer needed. “I'm taking my hand away,” she says, “because I know you can control your spitting.” It works, and as Milligan leads her back to class, Anni holds her hand. The restraint technique is just one of many methods teachers employ. Another is diversion - trying to change the subject away from a child's misbehaviour - which often proves successful. The school also finds that with all its children, improving their verbal communication skills is vital. Hawkswood employs a language therapist to help with this. “A lot of our children here aren't able to find the words to express themselves when they first come here, which is why they do it via their behaviour,” explains head teacher Marie Gentles. The behaviour of some of the pupils not only vastly improves while at Hawkswood, she says, but they also learn how to communicate with their peers back in mainstream school. This allows them to form and maintain friendships, often for the first time. Another key tool is being “utterly consistent” across the board with pupils, forming “firm but fair boundaries” to help them understand what is acceptable behaviour and what merits praise and recognition. Kate Milligan Humour also works well, she adds. “They need to see [teachers] and understand you on a human level - and not just see you as an authority figure within the school.” While most children attending Hawkswood have a background of violent behaviour, the school understands that they must take a bespoke approach to helping each child. For Cruz, discipline techniques were important to keep his actions in check. But for his long-term growth, the building of his relationship with Milligan was perhaps the key to his progression. “I absolutely adored him,” the deputy head and Key Stage 2 teacher says. “You could tell he had an amazing mum and family. “He's incredibly bright but the bad behaviour had overshadowed everything.” Milligan says her biggest success in working with Cruz was creating a connection with him that allowed him to feel comfortable enough to open up. “The children really emotionally invest with you, and so you have to reciprocate that. “Before he was reserved in some scenarios but he came out of his shell.” During his time at Hawkswood, Cruz told Milligan about having suicidal thoughts. “I addressed the subject and at first he denied it,” she says. “But then when comfortable and ready he said, ‘Nobody wants me any more.’ “We talked for hours about how important he was. “I encouraged the three of us [Cruz, Shelley and Milligan] to talk, so he could see how desperate his mum was to help. “It has given him ways of coping with such thoughts.” Over time, she says, Cruz began to show his “witty, charismatic” side. “He has a gift for art, he has a gift for sports. No-one had seen that before. “His mum knew it was there but even she hadn't seen it for a long time. “The other children loved him, too.” And it wasn't just Cruz who developed with Milligan's help. Shelley did too. At the end of the school day at Hawkswood, parents and teachers chat and even laugh together as the classes file out one by one, in perfect lines. This easy relationship between the adults is one that is seen at school gates across the UK, but for many parents at Hawkswood, it may be an entirely new experience. At Cruz's mainstream school, while other parents discussed their child's progress and activities in and out of class, Shelley felt unable to contribute. “I couldn't really talk about fun, extra-curricular stuff with other parents because he wouldn't take part in any clubs or outside activities, or enjoy himself at parties. “Because he wasn't engaging in the classroom either, I couldn't relate to any of the work that they were doing,” she says. With Cruz not having any close friends, there was no easy route to meeting other parents. Instead she felt alone, unable to share the realities of the daily power struggle and sleepless nights spent worrying about her son's future. There was also another strand to the emotional problems. Shelley was ashamed. “Why was my child the one at school that was ruining the class and misbehaving?” she remembers asking herself. “Other people made me feel I must be doing something wrong.” It was a feeling that intensified when Cruz's bad behaviour spiked. “I did feel shame because there were incidents where Cruz was hitting other children at school, or maybe breaking their pencil, or ripping up some work. “I felt that parents would be looking at me when I was taking him to school. You know, ‘That's the one. It was Cruz, Cruz did it.’ “There was once where one of the dads at school was kind of making a beeline for me, because he wanted to express how angry he was that Cruz was disrupting the class. “And the funny thing is, I wanted to have that conversation because I wanted somebody to talk to me about it. “I wanted to say, ‘I'm with you, I understand, if someone was doing what Cruz was doing to my kid I would feel the same’. “But no-one ever wanted to, because no-one wanted their child to really hang out with him. So why would they need to get to know me?” Hawkswood, in contrast, presented an outlet for Shelley. Milligan told Shelley to come to her for advice when she was having a down day. “I knew Shelley needed mental health support as much as Cruz,” Milligan says, reflecting on the first time she met her. Milligan says it is common for parents to feel guilt and shame - believing they could have been a better parent. “How on earth do you cope when no-one else likes your child?” Now, the improvements in Cruz and Shelley's relationship since he first arrived at Hawkswood reflect Milligan's efforts and dedication. “He is able to show me more affection,” says Shelley. That in itself has been enough to restore Shelley's confidence as a parent. But for many families with a child on the brink of exclusion, it is a postcode lottery as to whether a pupil referral unit is available. Government figures show that in 2016-17 there were 6,685 reported permanent exclusions in England across primary and secondary education. But the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank says that the real figure for pupils being educated in schools for excluded pupils - including PRUs and other provision - is far higher. In October 2017, it said that in the last year it had estimated that some 48,000 – one in every 200 pupils in England – had been placed in alternative provision. Nationwide across England, the number of primary age children educated in PRUs has risen. The Victoria Derbyshire programme's Freedom of Information request to all 150 local authorities in England, of which 130 responded, has shown that in some areas - such as Stockport and North Yorkshire - there were no primary-age pupil referral units in 2016-17. There are fears that in some areas, mainstream schools are referring children to PRUs simply to “get rid” of pupils causing disruption, without first exploring all avenues to managing their behaviour. Many local areas have a fair access panel, in which head teachers and other leading educational figures decide whether a child should be placed in a PRU, or whether the school must first try other approaches. But one man who has been running a pupil referral unit in a city in England told us in his area the panel “just fell apart, because [mainstream heads] were all a bit too parochial, looking after their own schools”. The man - whom we will call Robert - says his PRU became vastly oversubscribed, which he says restricted its ability to work with children in small groups, as originally designed. “They were coming out [of mainstream school to join the PRU] at a rate of just over one a day,” he explains. Funding for pupils also differs between local authorities - from £4,000 per pupil per month in Kirklees to £565 per month in Nottinghamshire. In addition, £10,000 of government funding is also made available per pupil. This total spend is far greater than the £4,900 per year the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates is spent on the average primary school pupil in England. But at Hawkswood - whose local authority Waltham Forest spends £1,473 each month per pupil - teachers firmly believe that giving every child an opportunity to succeed is worth the cost. Many experts believe that early intervention is also key in preventing problems further down the line - such as in secondary school, when academic pressures mount. For Cruz, it certainly made a difference. Cruz stands in a gown and mortarboard clutching his scroll, smiling as he poses for the camera. It is 20 weeks since Cruz first walked into the pupil referral unit and his behaviour has improved to the extent that he is now ready to go back into mainstream schooling. The graduation ceremony laid on by Hawkswood is a symbol of that, showcasing the great work he has done during his time at the school. Milligan makes a speech about the progress Cruz has made. “It was brilliant, it was lovely,” says Shelley, remembering the sense of pride both she and her son felt that day. She believes at the heart of Cruz's progression was his growth in self-confidence. “They just started to believe in him. Then he started to believe in himself. “He had never taken part in any sporting activity in his mainstream school,” she continues, giving just one example of how he has changed. “But at Hawkswood they grabbed hold of him and said, ‘You can do it. You are a good footballer.’ Suddenly Cruz became involved in football, he started to want to be involved in sports.” “He took part in Waltham Forest cross country, where he ran for his school in the borough. They made him believe he could do it.” The effects of Hawkswood are still evident now in February, with Cruz having been back in mainstream school for a month. Cruz agrees. “It was good, it was really good,” he says in a quiet, reflective manner. Speaking in the family kitchen in between chats about his favourite Arsenal players and WWE wrestlers, his calm, happy persona is unrecognisable from how Shelley describes her son before his time at the PRU. “I liked everything about Hawkswood,” he says, revealing how his favourite lesson was cookery class. “We made Christmas dinner, ice cream, dinners with chicken.” “We just 100% feel so much more positive about the future,” Shelley explains. Cruz's behaviour is not perfect - he still has blips - but there is a marked improvement. “He is much more able to control himself. He is able to apologise, reflect on what he's done,” says Shelley. “He's still working hard at his behaviour but he's learned to accept responsibility.” Milligan adds that his self-esteem is much improved. “The way he holds himself around peers has really changed. He has built his confidence, and realises, ‘I'm worth being somebody's friend,’” she says. Shelley has not received a single phone call asking her to pick Cruz up from school since he returned to mainstream education. She is still in regular contact with the teachers but has now learned to take a different approach to managing his behaviour. “My attitude with the school before was, ‘I'm so sorry, sorry for his behaviour.’ “Now, I say, ‘Let's work together, let's help him.’” Shelley also knows that Hawkswood will be there to support her and Cruz if there are any lapses in his behaviour. “They've left the door open. So any problems for him or me, they'll get involved, which makes me feel confident,” she says. Hawkswood Centre Shelley hopes that by sharing her story it will improve awareness of pupil referral units and help to dispel the stigma that surrounds them. “I definitely had a negative opinion of the children who would go to a place like that. “But when you experience a child in your family who needs that kind of intervention, you change your whole perception of what it's all about.” It will require continued determination but Cruz and Shelley can now look ahead with far greater optimism. “I'm going to be an inventor,” says Cruz as he envisions his life as a grown-up. “I'm going to make stairs so that when you fall down them you won't get hurt.” Built with Shorthand",Positive,0.9999894
" The phone rings. Shelley knows who it is before she answers it. Embarrassed, she leaves her desk and walks into the kitchen so that none of her colleagues can hear. “You need to come and get him. We can't control him, you have to come now,” says an all-too-familiar voice. It's March 2017 and  Shelley's eight-year-old son Cruz has been playing up at school - again. He's only in Year 3 but his behaviour has been a problem for years. Cruz and Shelley Shelley first raised concerns with the school when he was in reception but as time has gone by, his refusal to play by the rules has become increasingly serious. It is infringing on his and his classmates' ability to learn - and the school is taking action. This time, the voice at the other end of the phone explains, his behaviour is putting himself in danger. No more details are given about the nature of Cruz's latest misdemeanour. Shelley doesn't ask. She doesn't need to. The phone calls have become a regular occurrence, practically every other week, with other behavioural issues in between. “He's smashed up the classroom… he's hiding under the desk... he's ripped up someone's work,” she's been told before. On one occasion, the school had to be evacuated. This time, she is told on arrival, Cruz tried to leave the school grounds by climbing over the main gate. Shelley apologises profusely to staff - as she has done on many occasions. But this time feels different. She knows Cruz is running low on chances. She has been told before that the school will consider permanent exclusion. She needs to find a solution, but doesn't know where to turn. It's a Monday afternoon at Hawkswood Primary Pupil Referral Unit in north London, and five children sit behind their desks, eyes on the teacher. “Why do we think Jo was kicked out of school?” asks deputy head teacher Leah Mwaniki, in a class designed to help pupils understand how to control their behaviour. Kyan puts his hand up. “Because she was naughty,” he says. Kyan has been in the pupil referral unit (PRU) for more than a month, having been referred by his school. He was at risk of exclusion because of his violent behaviour and angry outbursts. “Do we say ‘naughty’?” Mwaniki asks rhetorically, looking for a different answer. Teachers are careful not to label their pupils. Kyan tries again. “[She made] the wrong choices,” he says, this time getting the answer spot on. “We teach the children that they have a choice when they feel frustrated,” explains head teacher Marie Gentles after the class. Marie Gentles “They have a choice when they feel anxious or angry, and we teach them they're in control of those choices.” Hawkswood specialises in caring for children like Kyan, who have been - or are on the verge of being - permanently excluded from their mainstream school. With small class sizes - usually with up to eight children in each - it focuses on pupils' emotional wellbeing, background and behavioural difficulties, and prepares them to go back into mainstream education. “Some children have come from a background of some form of abuse but not all children have, and I think that's important to stress,” Gentles says. “Most parents are working, trying really hard to provide for their children. But somewhere along the line something's gone slightly wrong.” Like other pupil referral units across the UK, the school follows the national curriculum. Pupils stay for at least 20 weeks before returning to mainstream education, but only once they are judged to be ready. It is home to 40 pupils, all of primary school age, though pupil referral units catering for secondary school pupils also exist. Such schools have become increasingly important in recent years. The Victoria Derbyshire programme has discovered that the number of children educated in primary-age PRUs has risen 34% in recent years - from 3,181 in 2013-14 to 4,261 in 2016-17. But there is still a stigma attached to them. “Parents can be very, very resistant,” says Gentles. “They think there's going to be children fighting in the corridors. And they walk in and it's really calm.” When the idea of sending Cruz to a pupil referral unit was first mentioned to Shelley by her son's “early help team”, she admits she scoffed at the idea. “I said, ‘No, that's where all the weird kids go, the outcasts,’” she says. But desperate for change and worried that a permanent exclusion was imminent, she decided to contact Hawkswood herself. “As soon as I walked through the door I thought, ‘He has to come here. This is what he needs,’” she says. “The staff understood me. They got me. They said, ‘He's misunderstood, and we need to get to the bottom of it.’” Shelley wipes away tears as she speaks, recalling that moment. “The reason I'm getting emotional is because of the way they wanted to help me. “No-one had listened. My family were giving up hope, and the school gave me that hope back.” Throughout Cruz's childhood, Shelley's parenting had been scrutinised by her own family who thought she could manage him better. “They would be thinking that I'm behaving like a weak parent,” she says. “They'd say, ‘He needs to be disciplined, he needs to be told. Do this with him, do that.’ “But normal discipline procedures were not working with him. It's not that I wasn't trying to be strict.” It reached the stage where Shelley decided to quit her job to focus on Cruz, despite the financial strain it would cause. At times, Shelley says, it was only the knowledge that she had three other well-behaved children that stopped her from questioning her judgement as a parent. Cruz does not see his father but Shelley is keen to stress that he comes from a “very stable, loving family”, and that his father's absence is not the root cause of his behaviour. “Cruz showed signs of this behaviour even when I was with his dad, from when he was in nursery,” she says. Shelley with Cruz as a baby “When he was a toddler, he showed signs of being problematic. “He did not like to conform. He was rebellious, he had a temper. He didn't like being told what to do.” As he grew older, Cruz would frequently cause fights with his brothers and sisters. Cruz with his brother and sister He was also violent in class, although it is not something he wants to talk about. Asked to describe his behaviour at the time, Cruz pauses to reflect on how best to answer. “I called out in class. Everybody did,” he says sheepishly, his body language closed off. Shelley, though, knows the extent of the problem all too well - and the effects it had on her son's relationships with others. “Cruz wasn't making friends. Any child that tried to get close, Cruz would bully, push away. They couldn't find common ground. “Then you worry that if he's not able to make friends, not able to fit in in a class environment, how's he going to fit into the big wide world? “I love him, but I want everyone else to love him. But how could they, with the way he's acting?” Shelley was also concerned about the way he viewed himself. “I remember one time when Cruz had a massive panic attack,” she says. Cruz was just eight years old at the time. “I didn't know how to help him. I couldn't believe it. “Part of me was like, ‘Where's he getting this from. Has he seen a film? Is he making it up?’ But it was heartfelt. He meant it. “He was in a really dark place, and he expressed it by not wanting to be around any more. He thought no-one loved him. “Even though he was showered with love and care, he didn't feel it.” As Cruz entered Hawkswood for the first time, she could only hope it would make a difference. It's an English lesson, and four of Hawkswood's youngest pupils are sitting cross-legged on a rug in the centre of a busy, brightly coloured room. The walls are adorned with the children's artwork, storage baskets full of cuddly toys hang from the ceiling and a rail of dressing-up clothes sits by the door. The pupils are reading from a picture book with the teacher but one child has been separated from the group. Anni is just five years old but she has already been permanently excluded from her mainstream school. She is having to be held down on her chair by deputy head teacher Kate Milligan while her colleague continues reading with the others. But Anni is pushing boundaries. She spits at Milligan's face. Anni spits at Kate Milligan A verbal warning is given but she continues, leading Milligan to use a restraint technique known in the school as “safe holding”. Used as a last resort, it can take many forms. It involves a teacher applying pressure, often to the child's shoulders, to stop their movement. In some cases it can involve the adult standing behind the child and placing their arms across them, with their right palm on the child's left shoulder, and their left palm on the child's right shoulder, effectively prohibiting them from moving. It is designed to protect the children for their own safety and the safety of others - something that is explained to them. Staff are regularly trained on its use. In this instance, Milligan places her palm on the left hand side of Anni's face to stop her spitting in the teacher's direction. “This behaviour is not acceptable and we won't be having that tomorrow,” she tells the five-year-old calmly but authoritatively. Anni screams and continues to spit on the hand of Milligan - who calmly asks for another teacher to join her. She arrives and sits on the opposite side of Anni, placing her palm on the right-hand-side of the child's face, ensuring she can only look forward. As they do this, they emphasise how Anni has the choice to behave well. “Until this afternoon, this little blip, she has been such a superstar,” says Milligan. “She had the best morning.” Anni begins to calm down, and after just two minutes reaches the point where Milligan is confident the restraint technique is no longer needed. “I'm taking my hand away,” she says, “because I know you can control your spitting.” It works, and as Milligan leads her back to class, Anni holds her hand. The restraint technique is just one of many methods teachers employ. Another is diversion - trying to change the subject away from a child's misbehaviour - which often proves successful. The school also finds that with all its children, improving their verbal communication skills is vital. Hawkswood employs a language therapist to help with this. “A lot of our children here aren't able to find the words to express themselves when they first come here, which is why they do it via their behaviour,” explains head teacher Marie Gentles. The behaviour of some of the pupils not only vastly improves while at Hawkswood, she says, but they also learn how to communicate with their peers back in mainstream school. This allows them to form and maintain friendships, often for the first time. Another key tool is being “utterly consistent” across the board with pupils, forming “firm but fair boundaries” to help them understand what is acceptable behaviour and what merits praise and recognition. Kate Milligan Humour also works well, she adds. “They need to see [teachers] and understand you on a human level - and not just see you as an authority figure within the school.” While most children attending Hawkswood have a background of violent behaviour, the school understands that they must take a bespoke approach to helping each child. For Cruz, discipline techniques were important to keep his actions in check. But for his long-term growth, the building of his relationship with Milligan was perhaps the key to his progression. “I absolutely adored him,” the deputy head and Key Stage 2 teacher says. “You could tell he had an amazing mum and family. “He's incredibly bright but the bad behaviour had overshadowed everything.” Milligan says her biggest success in working with Cruz was creating a connection with him that allowed him to feel comfortable enough to open up. “The children really emotionally invest with you, and so you have to reciprocate that. “Before he was reserved in some scenarios but he came out of his shell.” During his time at Hawkswood, Cruz told Milligan about having suicidal thoughts. “I addressed the subject and at first he denied it,” she says. “But then when comfortable and ready he said, ‘Nobody wants me any more.’ “We talked for hours about how important he was. “I encouraged the three of us [Cruz, Shelley and Milligan] to talk, so he could see how desperate his mum was to help. “It has given him ways of coping with such thoughts.” Over time, she says, Cruz began to show his “witty, charismatic” side. “He has a gift for art, he has a gift for sports. No-one had seen that before. “His mum knew it was there but even she hadn't seen it for a long time. “The other children loved him, too.” And it wasn't just Cruz who developed with Milligan's help. Shelley did too. At the end of the school day at Hawkswood, parents and teachers chat and even laugh together as the classes file out one by one, in perfect lines. This easy relationship between the adults is one that is seen at school gates across the UK, but for many parents at Hawkswood, it may be an entirely new experience. At Cruz's mainstream school, while other parents discussed their child's progress and activities in and out of class, Shelley felt unable to contribute. “I couldn't really talk about fun, extra-curricular stuff with other parents because he wouldn't take part in any clubs or outside activities, or enjoy himself at parties. “Because he wasn't engaging in the classroom either, I couldn't relate to any of the work that they were doing,” she says.

"Jonathan and Eleanor Udall were on honeymoon when the crash happened A fifth British tourist has died following a helicopter crash in the Grand Canyon that also killed her new husband. Eleanor Udall, nee Milward, 29, was on her honeymoon with Jonathan Udall, when the accident happened on 10 February. Mr Udall, who was in his 30s and from Brighton, died four days ago. Mrs Udall's family said it was ""with great sadness"" that they announced their daughter had died in a Las Vegas hospital as a result of her injuries. ""The family are exceedingly grateful for everything done by rescue services and volunteers in the Canyon, and throughout the last two weeks by the exceptional staff at UMC (University Medical Centre, Las Vegas),"" their statement said. Stuart Hill, 30, and his girlfriend Becky Dobson, 27, and brother Jason, 32, from Worthing, West Sussex, died in the crash. Another Briton, Jennifer Barham, 39, and the pilot Scott Booth, 42, were injured when the aircraft crashed in the remote Quartermaster Canyon. A message posted on Monday on a crowdfunding page set up to help Mr and Mrs Udall said: ""It deeply saddens me once more to update this page. ""Yesterday Ellie lost her battle to her injuries, the only consolidation I can muster is that she is no longer in pain and is, I hope, with Jon. ""The continued support to this page is heart-warming during this tragic time. ""May we never forget this wonderful couple."" Parents' tribute to 'wonderful' sons Grand Canyon helicopter crash victims 'life and soul of party' Mr and Mrs Udall, who both worked at Yorkshire Building Society, were friends with the other Britons in the helicopter. Stuart (left) and Jason Hill also died in the crash The Eurocopter (now Airbus) EC130 helicopter had spun out of control as it came in to land before crashing and catching fire. The crash is being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board but an initial report indicates possible causes could include a mechanical problem and gusty winds. The chief of the Hualapai Police, Francis Bradley, had described the terrain as ""extremely rugged"". He said the rescue efforts had been hampered by severe weather conditions and gusts of up to 50mph (80 km/h). Jason and Stuart Hill and Ms Dobson, who had been in the US for Stuart's 30th birthday, died at the scene. Becky Dobson was on holiday to celebrate her boyfriend's 30th birthday Jason Hill worked as a corporate lawyer for Shoosmiths in its Milton Keynes office. Stuart Hill was a salesman at a Mercedes-Benz dealership in Brighton, East Sussex, while his girlfriend Ms Dobson, worked as a veterinary receptionist for Vets 4 Pets in Worthing. High winds delayed emergency services from getting the injured to hospital The helicopter company involved - Papillon Airways - calls itself ""the world's largest aerial sightseeing company"" and says it flies more than 600,000 people a year. The Grand Canyon, which is more than one mile (1.6km) deep, is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the US.

"This video can not be played A doctor in Eastern Ghouta says there is still shelling, but ""the level is less than before"" Russia's President Vladimir Putin has ordered a daily five-hour pause in the Syrian government's assault on the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area. It will start on Tuesday, and include the creation of a ""humanitarian corridor"" to allow civilians to leave. The rebel enclave near Damascus, where 393,000 civilians are trapped, has been under intense bombardment by government forces with Russian support. More than 560 people have been killed in eight days, a monitoring group says. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu made the announcement about the ""humanitarian pause"", saying it would run from 09:00 until 14:00 local time (07:00-12:00 GMT) daily. In a further statement, the ministry said the Syrian Red Crescent would help set up the corridor and people would receive information about it via leaflets, text messages and videos. Life in Eastern Ghouta - read residents' stories Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? Why is there a war in Syria? No. A UN Security Council resolution passed on Saturday demanded that ""all parties cease hostilities without delay for at least 30 consecutive days"" to allow humanitarian aid deliveries and medical evacuations of critically ill people. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Monday that the resolution needed to be implemented immediately, warning: ""Eastern Ghouta cannot wait. It's high time to stop this hell on Earth."" But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that the UN-mandated truce would ""start when all sides of the conflict agree on how to introduce it"". He said the jihadist groups Islamic State (IS) and al-Qaeda would be excluded, as well as the major Islamist rebel factions Ahrar al-Sham and Jaysh al-Islam. Mr Lavrov called them ""partners of al-Nusra Front"" - the name of a former al-Qaeda affiliate whose latest incarnation is an alliance of jihadists called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). It has a small presence in the Eastern Ghouta. By Jeremy Bowen, Middle East editor, BBC News If it works, President Putin's announcement of a daily humanitarian truce is the best news the hard-pressed people in the Eastern Ghouta have had since the bombardment intensified more than a week ago. However, it is not the full implementation of the UN Security Council resolution. That resolution was weakened by the compromises necessary to stop it being vetoed by the Russians, who are Syrian President Assad's most essential allies. No start date was agreed for the ceasefire demanded by the resolution. Instead, it used the wording ""without delay"". That leaves a lot of scope for Russia to impose conditions to buy more time for attacks on armed opposition groups. Operations against the jihadists of IS and al-Qaeda are excluded from the resolution. But Moscow also says it will continue to hit Jaysh al-Islam. It is by far the most powerful opposition group in the Eastern Ghouta, is backed by Saudi Arabia, and has been to the Geneva peace talks. Jaysh al-Islam has accepted the ceasefire, while reserving the right of self-defence. Russia and the Syrian government regard all the opposition groups as terrorists. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, says 36 people have been killed in the enclave since the UN resolution was passed at the weekend. On Monday, 22 people were killed in air and artillery strikes on the towns of Douma and Harasta, it reported. This video can not be played Rawaa has been living in a basement with around 75 others for months The Syria Civil Defence, a rescue organisation whose volunteers operate in rebel-held areas, said nine civilians had been killed in a strike on one building in Douma. The official Sana news agency meanwhile cited police as saying a civilian had been injured in the government-controlled Qassa area of Damascus by shells fired by Eastern Ghouta rebels. Government health official Zaher Hajjo told Reuters news agency that rebel shellfire had caused 36 deaths and a number of injuries in the last four days. Ambulance drivers reported a chlorine smell following reported a large explosion in the town of al-Shifuniya at around 18:30 (16:30 GMT). The opposition-run health directorate in the Eastern Ghouta said at least 18 people were treated after presenting symptoms consistent with exposure to a toxic chemical, including breathing difficulties, eye irritation and dizziness. One male infant died, while a four-month-old baby had to be put on a ventilator, it added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

None of the reports could be independently verified, and it was unclear whether the boy's death was related to exposure to a chemical or the initial explosion. Mr Lavrov said ""bogus stories"" about the use of chlorine were a ""provocation"" intended to sabotage the UN resolution. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. However, experts from the UN and the Organisations for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons say government forces used chlorine as a weapon at least three times between 2014 and 2015. They are also confident that government forces used the nerve agent Sarin in an attack on a northern rebel-held town last April, killing more than 80 people.

"This video can not be played Trump: 'I would have run in even if I didn't have weapon' US President Donald Trump has said he would have run in to the Florida high school where 17 people were shot dead this month even if he was not armed. ""I really believe I'd run in there even if I didn't have a weapon,"" Mr Trump told a group of state governors gathered at the White House. Mr Trump also said it was ""disgusting"" that officers reportedly did not confront the suspect on 14 February. The massacre was the second-deadliest ever shooting at a US school. ""I think most of the people in this room would have done that, too,"" said Mr Trump on Monday of his assertion that he would have rushed into the school. He added: ""You never know until you're tested."" Where US protest movements might go from here 'Arm me with books' - the teachers saying no to guns After Florida, some owners give up guns His comments came after Florida governor Rick Scott on Sunday launched an inquiry into law enforcement's response to the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Scot Peterson, a 32-year veteran officer who had been assigned to guard the high school, resigned last week as it emerged he had remained outside the building where most of the pupils were killed. Mr Trump had previously suggested that the actions taken that day by Mr Peterson - who has since resigned from the force - could have made him a ""coward"". But on Monday, a lawyer for Mr Peterson hit back against Mr Trump's claim, saying his client had been ""maligned"" by his previous boss, Sheriff Scott Israel. ""Let there be no mistake, Mr Peterson wishes that he could have prevented the untimely passing of the seventeen victims on that day, and his heart goes out to the families of the victims in their time of need,"" his lawyer Joseph DiRuzzo III said in a statement provided to the BBC. ""However, the allegations that Mr Peterson was a coward and that his performance, under the circumstances, failed to meet the standards of police officers are patently untrue. America's gun culture in 10 charts Six radical ways to stop US school shootings Is it time for US teachers to carry guns? ""Mr Peterson is confident that his actions on that day were appropriate under the circumstances and that the video (together with the eye-witness testimony of those on the scene) will exonerate him of any sub-par performance,"" the lawyer's statement said. Mr DiRuzzo said Mr Peterson believed the shooting was occurring outside the building and ""initiated a Code Red lockdown of the entire school campus"". He also provided ""handwritten diagrams"" of the school to responding Swat officers, according to the lawyer. Sheriff Israel has defended himself from criticism amid calls for his resignation, saying that he should not be blamed for the actions of a rogue ""deserter"". ""I've given amazing leadership to this agency,"" he said during a CNN interview on Sunday, insisting that he has no plans to quit. Broward County Sheriff's Office is reportedly also investigating why three of its deputies appeared to remain outside the building with their guns drawn as the attack unfolded. Mr Trump criticised those officers as well, saying they ""weren't exactly medal of honour winners""- a reference to the US military award for valour. ""The way they performed was frankly disgusting,"" Mr Trump added. This video can not be played Seven things the NRA blames after Florida In the wake of the attack, which was carried out by a former student, Mr Trump has called for US teachers to be trained and armed with concealed firearms. He also suggested that teachers receive a ""yearly bonus"" for carrying guns, but in a tweet, conceded that such a decision should be ""up to states"" to legislate. Mr Trump has also pushed for expanded background checks and mental health screenings in order to legally purchase a gun, and suggested raising the legal age requirement to buy a semi-automatic rifle. The president has also called for so-called bump stocks - which convert rifles into machine guns - to be banned under federal law. During his remarks on Monday, Mr Trump told governors not to ""be afraid"" of clashing with the National Rifle Association (NRA) - a powerful pro-gun lobby which has opposed several of Mr Trump's proposals. ""Don't worry about the NRA, they're on our side,"" he said. ""And you know what, if they're not with you, we have to fight them every once in a while. That's OK. They're doing what they think is right."" Students, including activist Emma Gonzalez (L), returned to school on Sunday for the afternoon In Florida, students are preparing to return full-time to their classrooms on Wednesday after some attended a volunteer ""orientation"" on Sunday. ""It's like the first day of school,"" a 16-year-old girl in attendance told the New York Times. ""But it's not normal at all.""

"This video can not be played ""Any parent watching would be very worried"": Footage from suspected unregistered school Concerns have been raised about child safety in unregistered schools, after a BBC investigation filmed a teacher appearing to strike a pupil's head. The BBC filmed a suspected unregistered ultra-orthodox Jewish school in Essex, and photos from two other such schools showed dirty and unhygienic conditions. Ofsted said it has identified more than 350 suspected unregistered schools, but lacked sufficient powers to close them. The Department for Education said 38 had ceased to operate since 2016. Schools in England should be registered with the government if they teach five or more children for 18 hours a week or more. Since 2014, more than 50 safeguarding alerts - concerns of abuse or neglect - were raised at schools not registered with the government, the BBC found. The BBC investigation also filmed one suspected unregistered ultra-orthodox Jewish school in Westcliff-on-Sea. The footage of a teacher appearing to strike a boy and manhandle a distressed child showed ""huge safeguarding issues"", Anne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner for England said. ""When the adult turns round, the child steps back and the adult clearly strikes the child"", she said, observing the footage. The synagogue, on whose grounds the school is based, said it was not aware of any incidents, but asked for more information. It also denied there was an unregistered school operating on the site. It said ""home schooling"" was provided within the 18 hours limit. But when it was observed by the BBC, it was operating for longer hours. If you have any information or experience with unregistered schools that you are willing to share with the BBC you can get in touch with us, in confidence, athaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Photographs from inside two other suspected unregistered schools show shocking conditions, including poor food hygiene, dangerous wiring and dirty rooms in a state of disrepair. There are concerns over extremist material at some sites. The BBC obtained a copy of a book from an unregistered Islamic school in Birmingham. In one section it openly advocates the murder of homosexuals. ""This punishment is to be carried out on both the one who does this and the one to whom it is done, if it is done freely and by choice"", the section read. Most of the safeguarding alerts the BBC uncovered related to physical abuse allegations. Some were also sexual. Not all unregistered schools are faith-based. Of those where a religious ethos is known, half are Islamic. Poor food hygiene was visible in some photographs Ofsted set up a specialist taskforce in 2016 to look at the problem and has issued warning notices to 50 suspected unregistered schools. But it has failed to prosecute a single proprietor for running one. Chief Inspector Amanda Spielman said many cases ""could and should have been taken forward"" by the Department for Education but none have been approved. She said the law was not ""strong enough"" and Ofsted wanted more investigatory powers. ""We can't even pick up evidence that we find there,"" she said. ""If we find some unsuitable teaching material we can't even take that away, we have to let the proprietors of the school walk out of the door with it."" Dame Louise Casey, who warned about the problem in her 2016 review into integration and opportunity in our most isolated and deprived communities, said the Department for Education ""really need to wake up"" and ""take action"". ""We have pockets where kids are growing up in environments that are incredibly isolated, secluded, they're managed within themselves. ""Essentially there is one dominating religion and within that is an ideology that is frankly anti-British, anti our way of life."" In a statement the Department for Education said: ""The secretary of state has to consent to a prosecution, but this happens at the end of the process, after the director of public prosecution has made a decision to charge. ""So far no case has reached that stage,"" it said. ""No child should be placed at risk and where a school is operating illegally action must be taken.""

"This video can not be played David Lidington said the ""vast majority"" of EU powers would start off in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast Changes to a proposed Brexit law on the return of powers from Brussels will ""strengthen and enhance"" devolution, a UK government minister has pledged. The Welsh and Scottish governments have claimed the EU (Withdrawal) Billamounts to a Whitehall ""power grab"". Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said he was offering ""very big changes"" to the law to settle the row. Wales' First Minister Carwyn Jones said he wanted further progress that went beyond ""warm words"". All you need to know about Brexit EU withdrawal bill 'assault on devolution' Brexit bill is 'a naked power grab' The bill aims to ensure the rules currently set by European law still apply in the UK after Brexit, while giving the UK Parliament power to change them. But the Welsh and Scottish government have objected to the current proposals saying they amount to a ""power grab"" which undermines devolution. Under the plans, powers in devolved areas like farming are set to return to Westminster rather than Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast. Carwyn Jones (R) presses the case for a ""soft Brexit"" with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier (L) After a meeting of UK, Welsh and Scottish ministers in London on Thursday, all three governments saidprogress was being made but further discussions are needed to try to reach agreement. The UK government has said it intends to change the bill and has proposed that the vast majority of the 64 powers returning from the EU will now go to the devolved administrations. In a speech at the Airbus plant in Broughton, Flintshire, on Monday, Mr Lidington said that the new offer represents a ""significant step forward in these negotiations"". He said: ""This offer puts beyond doubt our commitment to a smooth and orderly departure from the European Union, in a way that doesn't just respect the devolution settlements, but strengthens and enhances them."" Mr Lidington also said the UK's ""common market"" must be maintained post-Brexit and dismissed the idea of independence for nations, saying the UK works better in ""unity"". ""By retaining UK frameworks where necessary we retain our ability not only to act in the national interest when we need to, but to do so with a unity of purpose,"" he said. Food labelling and hygiene rules were one area where powers could be retained within a UK-wide framework, Mr Lidington suggested. ""Four different sets of rules would only make it more difficult and more expensive for a cheesemaker in Monmouthshire to sell to customers in Bristol or for cattle farmers in Aberdeenshire to sell their beef in Berwick-upon-Tweed,"" he said. First Minister Carwyn Jones,currently visiting the USA, said: ""I welcome the commitment of the UK government to continue to work with us on their EU (Withdrawal) Bill. ""However, as currently drafted, the Bill allows the UK government to take control of devolved policy areas, such as farming and fishing, once the UK has left the EU. ""This is an unacceptable attack on devolution in both Wales and Scotland. ""We now need further progress that goes beyond warm words and I hope the 'very big changes' promised in the speech equate to sensible amendments to the Bill which respect devolution.""

"James Carter appeared to have no qualifications to undertake building or roofing works A rogue trader who conned customers out of Â£140,000 and pretended his firm worked on BBC One's DIY SOS programme has been jailed for five years. James Carter let his 15 victims believe he was a skilled roofer and builder but he was in fact ""grossly incompetent"", Stafford Crown Court heard. If customers complained, he often used threats and intimidation. The 40-year-old, from Stourbridge, West Midlands, had earlier admitted five charges related to fraudulent trading. Midlands Live: Pedestrian hit by van on M6; Friend stabbed to death in 'play fight' The court heard Carter, of Vicarage Road, Wollaston, appeared to have no qualifications to undertake building or roofing works and customers often had to pay out more to remedy the work he did through his firm Central Roofing Services. A 69-year-old woman was left so frightened after he threatened her when she challenged him about the quality of his work that she locked herself in her house until he left, Dudley Trading Standards said. Carter's van brazenly claimed the firm had appeared on the TV show ""There were suggestions that he and the boys would come round to strip the roof off one of the properties,"" spokesman Chris King said. Evidence from the 15 customers cheated out of money by Carter, who also had three aliases, included a care home in Stourbridge which paid Â£18,000 for a new roof, which was found to be leaking three weeks later. A woman from Solihull paid Â£80,000 for an extension to her home but then had to spend a further Â£20,000 because Carter's work was so poor. Carter was once seen fleetingly on the BBC prime time programme fitting a window while working as a labourer for another firm, but then told customers the ""complete lie"" that he was part of the show to give something back to the community, the court heard. The prosecution alleged he also drove around in a van which falsely represented, through its livery, that his business had undertaken work on the show. Carter was also given a criminal behaviour order which bans him from providing future roofing or building services.

Schools in England should be registered with the government if they teach five or more children for 18 hours a week or more. Since 2014, more than 50 safeguarding alerts - concerns of abuse or neglect - were raised at schools not registered with the government, the BBC found. The BBC investigation also filmed one suspected unregistered ultra-orthodox Jewish school in Westcliff-on-Sea. The footage of a teacher appearing to strike a boy and manhandle a distressed child showed ""huge safeguarding issues"", Anne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner for England said. ""When the adult turns round, the child steps back and the adult clearly strikes the child"", she said, observing the footage. The synagogue, on whose grounds the school is based, said it was not aware of any incidents, but asked for more information. It also denied there was an unregistered school operating on the site. It said ""home schooling"" was provided within the 18 hours limit. But when it was observed by the BBC, it was operating for longer hours. If you have any information or experience with unregistered schools that you are willing to share with the BBC you can get in touch with us, in confidence, athaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Photographs from inside two other suspected unregistered schools show shocking conditions, including poor food hygiene, dangerous wiring and dirty rooms in a state of disrepair. There are concerns over extremist material at some sites. The BBC obtained a copy of a book from an unregistered Islamic school in Birmingham. In one section it openly advocates the murder of homosexuals. ""This punishment is to be carried out on both the one who does this and the one to whom it is done, if it is done freely and by choice"", the section read. Most of the safeguarding alerts the BBC uncovered related to physical abuse allegations. Some were also sexual. Not all unregistered schools are faith-based. Of those where a religious ethos is known, half are Islamic. Poor food hygiene was visible in some photographs Ofsted set up a specialist taskforce in 2016 to look at the problem and has issued warning notices to 50 suspected unregistered schools. But it has failed to prosecute a single proprietor for running one. Chief Inspector Amanda Spielman said many cases ""could and should have been taken forward"" by the Department for Education but none have been approved. She said the law was not ""strong enough"" and Ofsted wanted more investigatory powers. ""We can't even pick up evidence that we find there,"" she said. ""If we find some unsuitable teaching material we can't even take that away, we have to let the proprietors of the school walk out of the door with it."" Dame Louise Casey, who warned about the problem in her 2016 review into integration and opportunity in our most isolated and deprived communities, said the Department for Education ""really need to wake up"" and ""take action"". ""We have pockets where kids are growing up in environments that are incredibly isolated, secluded, they're managed within themselves. ""Essentially there is one dominating religion and within that is an ideology that is frankly anti-British, anti our way of life."" In a statement the Department for Education said: ""The secretary of state has to consent to a prosecution, but this happens at the end of the process, after the director of public prosecution has made a decision to charge. ""So far no case has reached that stage,"" it said. ""No child should be placed at risk and where a school is operating illegally action must be taken.""

"Chvrches, Wolf Alice and Jorja Smith are all appearing on this year's festival circuit The days of male-dominatedmusic festivals,externalcould be drawing to a close, after 45 events pledged to achieve a 50/50 gender balance by 2022. Brighton's Great Escape, the Cheltenham Jazz Festival, Liverpool Sound City and the BBC Proms are among those who have signed up to the initiative. It is supported by Garbage star Shirley Manson, who recently called the music industry's lack of equality ""insane"". Last year,80% of festival headliners were male, a BBC study discovered. This video can not be played We asked performers at Eurosonic for their views on improving the gender balance at festivals. The commitment to gender equality was drawn up by Keychange and the PRS Foundation, with the aim of creating a ""better, more inclusive music industry for present and future generations"". ""Last year, on average, women made up 26% of the festival line-ups in the UK, so we're talking about doubling that in a five-year timeframe,"" said Vanessa Reed, CEO of the PRS Foundation. ""That's quite ambitious but it's achievable."" The pledge has been adopted by BBC Music Introducing, which hosts stages for new artists at festivals including Glastonbury and Reading & Leeds. However, those festivals have yet to sign the pledge on a wider scale. Gabrielle Aplin is among the artists to have appeared on the BBC Music Introducing stage at Glastonbury The movement comes after an outcry over the lack of female performers at festivals across the UK. The Wireless festival, in particular, came in for criticism when it announced its initial line-up, featuring just three women. Lily Allen posted a doctored version of the event's poster, with all the male names erased. ""The struggle is real,"" she noted. DJ Annie Mac responded, calling the situation ""appalling"".

Melvin Benn, MD of Festival Republic, which arranges the event, told the BBC that his bookers had tried to secure more female acts. ""18 female artists were approached to play Wireless Fest this year, only three of which were secured for our first announcement."" he said. ""Certain artists were unable to commit due to touring schedules or other reasons. In an ideal world, all 18 would have confirmed and we would be having a different conversation."" So is it possible to achieve gender equality by 2022? Rapper Little Simz, who curates her own festival, Wonderland, thinks so. ""I believe its possible. It seems to be heading that way,"" she told BBC Two's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""At my festival, it's 75% women. So if I'm able to do it at my level, then the big festivals are."" Melvin Benn was less sure about the idea of imposing a quota. Melvin Benn also organises Reading and Leeds festival - headlined by Kendrick Lamar this year ""Is that the right way to go about it - to say it's got to be 50/50? I don't know that it is,"" he said. Instead, he has launched a project called ReBalance, which will provide 36 female artists with one week's studio recording time over the next three years. The aim is to ""create a bigger pool of female acts"" so that festivals have a ""greater choice"" when it comes to booking their line-ups. ""So actually, I do support the principle of it [gender equality]. I've chosen a slightly different way to go about it, but with the same principal aim."" Reed said that Keychange would have succeeded ""when it's not needed any more"". ""I'm hoping that in five or 10 years from now, we'll have got to a point where we don't need to keep talking about this, and the stages better reflect the audiences they're serving.""

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn speaks to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg about his Brexit plans Two things can be true at the same time. It is true that Jeremy Corbyn has not dramatically shifted Labour's Brexit policy. For months the party has been saying that some form of customs union with the European Union after Brexit is a possibility. Corbyn backs customs union membership The party's tip toes towards this policy have been long anticipated. And in the last few days his shadow team had given the game away in terms of the party's firmer backing for this idea. The notion of a customs union will be welcomed by businesses who want to minimise the disruption of Brexit - and the idea would go some way towards solving the problem of the Irish border, which as we've discussed many times is one of the tensions in the government's position. This speech, and this policy move, is no Remainiac dream. Jeremy Corbyn has not suddenly become a convert to staying in the single market, nor for a second referendum. The Labour leader has stopped short of where many of his MPs would like him to go, and are already calling for publicly - full backing for the UK to stay in the single market. And it is also the case that it is extremely likely that the European Union would say a hypothetical 'no' to what he is asking for: a say in future trade deals alongside this new proposed customs arrangement. Mr Corbyn also said in his speech that a Labour government would ""not countenance a deal that left Britain as a passive recipient of rules decided elsewhere by others"". So, if the EU says we can't have a say in a customs union, and Mr Corbyn says he wouldn't join a union if the UK wasn't given a say, what happens then? Nothing about what outwardly seems a softer Brexit is guaranteed. If the promise is an impossible one, is it really a promise at all? What is, however, also true is that as the government and Parliament wrangles over Brexit, this new position on customs does give Labour a clear dividing line with the Tories - yes, one of those old chestnuts. That might rile Brexit-backing Labour voters, and worries some MPs. And it does make a potential defeat in the Commons when the Trade and Customs Bill eventually gets there more likely. Yet there is also nothing certain about that. Yes, there is probably a majority in Parliament for staying in a customs union. But for the government to be beaten on that, or forced to move towards Labour's new position, depends on the will of Tory Remainer rebels being ready to take a course of action that could damage the government. Jeremy Corbyn can today pave the way, but he can't be sure they will take the bait.

"This video can not be played David Lidington said the ""vast majority"" of EU powers would start off in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast Changes to a proposed Brexit law on the return of powers from Brussels will ""strengthen and enhance"" devolution, a UK government minister has pledged. The Welsh and Scottish governments have claimed the EU (Withdrawal) Billamounts to a Whitehall ""power grab"". Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said he was offering ""very big changes"" to the law to settle the row. Wales' First Minister Carwyn Jones said he wanted further progress that went beyond ""warm words"". All you need to know about Brexit EU withdrawal bill 'assault on devolution' Brexit bill is 'a naked power grab' The bill aims to ensure the rules currently set by European law still apply in the UK after Brexit, while giving the UK Parliament power to change them. But the Welsh and Scottish government have objected to the current proposals saying they amount to a ""power grab"" which undermines devolution. Under the plans, powers in devolved areas like farming are set to return to Westminster rather than Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast. Carwyn Jones (R) presses the case for a ""soft Brexit"" with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier (L) After a meeting of UK, Welsh and Scottish ministers in London on Thursday, all three governments saidprogress was being made but further discussions are needed to try to reach agreement. The UK government has said it intends to change the bill and has proposed that the vast majority of the 64 powers returning from the EU will now go to the devolved administrations. In a speech at the Airbus plant in Broughton, Flintshire, on Monday, Mr Lidington said that the new offer represents a ""significant step forward in these negotiations"". He said: ""This offer puts beyond doubt our commitment to a smooth and orderly departure from the European Union, in a way that doesn't just respect the devolution settlements, but strengthens and enhances them."" Mr Lidington also said the UK's ""common market"" must be maintained post-Brexit and dismissed the idea of independence for nations, saying the UK works better in ""unity"". ""By retaining UK frameworks where necessary we retain our ability not only to act in the national interest when we need to, but to do so with a unity of purpose,"" he said. Food labelling and hygiene rules were one area where powers could be retained within a UK-wide framework, Mr Lidington suggested. ""Four different sets of rules would only make it more difficult and more expensive for a cheesemaker in Monmouthshire to sell to customers in Bristol or for cattle farmers in Aberdeenshire to sell their beef in Berwick-upon-Tweed,"" he said. First Minister Carwyn Jones,currently visiting the USA, said: ""I welcome the commitment of the UK government to continue to work with us on their EU (Withdrawal) Bill. ""However, as currently drafted, the Bill allows the UK government to take control of devolved policy areas, such as farming and fishing, once the UK has left the EU. ""This is an unacceptable attack on devolution in both Wales and Scotland. ""We now need further progress that goes beyond warm words and I hope the 'very big changes' promised in the speech equate to sensible amendments to the Bill which respect devolution.""

"The former finance director of collapsed construction firm Carillion ""dumped"" the last of his shares at the earliest possible moment, MPs say. Richard Adam sold shares worth hundreds of thousands of pounds in early 2017 as soon as he qualified for them after leaving Carillion in December 2016. The information was released by a joint committee of MPs looking into Carillion's collapse. Mr Adam said he had sold them ""when I was invited to do so by the company"". The information was published by the Work and Pensions and Business Select Committees, which are conducting a joint inquiry into Carillion's collapse. More than 1,000 Carillion workers have lost their jobs since the firm went into liquidation last month. Regulator was warned over Carillion pensions Investors 'fled' as Carillion collapsed Carillion: Six charts that explain what happened Mr Adam retired at the end of December 2016. On 1 March 2017, he sold all the shares he had at the time for Â£534,000, including performance awards for 2013-15 of Â£277,000, which fell due once he had retired. He then sold his long-term incentive plan awards for 2014 on 8 May 2017, the day they matured, for Â£242,000. Mr Adam commented: ""I sold the shares that I was eligible to sell when I was invited to do so by the company as I retired. More than half of the shares in the company that I had an interest in at retirement have been lost as a result of the company entering liquidation."" The committees also published a response from Mr Adam's successor, Zafar Khan, whose contract with Carillion was terminated last September after eight months in the job. A few days before his contract was ended, Mr Khan had issued a financial update showing things had worsened since July 2017, when Carillion had written off Â£845m in losses on underperforming contracts, the committee said. They added: ""Mr Khan argues that it is surprising that the board were 'spooked' by his update, as it should have been apparent to the board by then that the company was struggling to improve both its net debt and profit positions."" Frank Field, chairman of the Work and Pensions Select Committee, accused Mr Adam of ""dumping the last of his shares at the first possible moment, because he is - with his own money at least - 'risk-averse'. What conclusions are we to draw from that?"" He added: ""The other directors appear keen to set up the hapless Zafar Khan as the fall guy for the collapse. It is not lost on us, however, that he inherited Carillion's mountain of debt.""

"Lecturers at four more universities joined the strike on Monday Staff at four more universities have joined the strike over pension cuts, with 61 now affected, the University and College Union said on Monday. Support for the action remains ""solid"", with pickets braving freezing temperatures, according to the union. Staff say the pension changes will cost the average academic Â£10,000 a year in retirement - but the employers say the scheme has a deficit of more than Â£6bn. Bosses have ruled out new discussions on the changes at talks due on Tuesday. Under a plan agreed in January, the Universities Superannuation Scheme will change from a defined benefit scheme, giving members a guaranteed income in retirement, to a defined contribution scheme, where pensions are subject to changes in the stock market. On Friday, the employers, Universities UK, issued a call for more talks but said the discussion would not reopen the decision to press ahead with the changes,taken by the Joint Negotiating Committee on 23 January. And, in a letter to university vice-chancellors and principals, which became public over the weekend, UUK's chief executive Alistair Jarvis, argued that talks without preconditions could not ""achieve a sustainable resolution to the dispute"". The union has agreed to the talks but has expressed misgivings that these preconditions mean they will not address ""the very reason for the strike"". Pension plan could be reversed, say bosses University lecturers begin strike in pension dispute University strike: What's it all about? Universities UK says it will, however, consider ""a credible proposal that addresses the significant financial issues the scheme is facing"". ""It would be irresponsible of employers to walk away"" from the January decision ""without an alternative being agreed"", a UUK spokeswoman said. The union disputes the method which concluded that the scheme was in such a poor financial state and has called for a new evaluation. Some vice-chancellors are backing this view with Peter Piot, director of London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, urging ""a further actuarial valuation of the scheme"". University of Warwick vice-chancellor Stuart Croft has also criticised the valuation method andsuggests a solution could be for government to guarantee the scheme,,externalas it already does the Teachers' Pension Scheme and the Local Government Pension Scheme. While Anthony Forster, vice-chancellor of Essex University, has said ""university employers must step up to the plate and commit to increasing employer contributions to the scheme"". ""Principled compromise is the answer,"" he argued. Some 18 vice-chancellors have so far called on Universities UK to adopt a more conciliatory approach. As of Monday evening almost 115,000 students across 43 universities had signed petitions, broadly supportive of the lecturers' position, and asking for fee refunds for lost teaching hours, according to figures fromChange.org,,externalanalysed by UCU member Chris Forde, professor of employment studies at Leeds University. In the first wave of a month-long programme of strikes, staff walked out at 57 universities on Thursday and Friday last week. They, together with the staff at four more institutions whose three-day strike started on Monday, will be joined by colleagues at three more universities in weeks three and four of the action.

"George Wilkinson, Harry Rice and Josh McGuinness were killed on their way to a five-aside football centre A driver has admitted killing three teenage boys he hit at more than 70mph as they walked to a birthday party. Jaynesh Chudasama, who was drunk, lost control of his car as he overtook another vehicle, sending the victims flying into the air in the crash. Harry Rice, 17, and 16-year-olds George Wilkinson and Josh McGuinness, died instantly, the Old Bailey heard. Chudasama, 28, admitted three counts of causing death by dangerous driving after the crash in Hayes, west London. The defendant, of Hayes, had traces of cannabis in his system when he ploughed into the victims in Shepiston Lane, on 26 January. Josh was struck with such force he was thrown over a fence and into a cemetery, the court was told. Hayes triple death crash victims 'incredible boys' Man charged over triple death crash Harry was carried on the bonnet of the car until it crashed into the cemetery wall, and a girl held George's hand as he lay half in the road and half on the pavement. Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC said it was estimated Chudasama was more than two-and-a-half times the legal drink-drive limit when his Audi mounted the pavement at about 20:40 GMT. ""In the course of over-taking another vehicle, the defendant lost control of his car,"" Mr Aylett said. ""The vehicle struck and fatally injured three boys who were walking along the pavement."" Chudasama was more than two-and-a-half times the legal drink-drive limit when he crashed the Audi, the court heard Eight hours after the crash the defendant had 79 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood - one milligram below the legal limit. His level at the time of the crash was therefore estimated at 213 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, the court heard. After hitting the victims Chudasama and his passenger got out of the car and ran away, the court heard. They were pursued by two boys, who dragged the driver back to where their friends lay dead. One of them later admitted he had struck Chudasama over the head with a bottle to stop him getting away. Jaynesh Chudasama had alcohol and cannabis in his system when he crashed, the court heard When police arrived and an officer went over to help the defendant, some of the group asked why he was helping the man who had just killed the teenagers. The victims, who have beendescribed as ""incredible"" and popular by their friends and families, were among a group of friends walking towards the Goals five-a-side football club for the 16th birthday party. Harry's father Ian Rice said seeing the defendant in court today was ""very traumatic"" and he was disappointed with the guilty plea. ""We're not very happy, we would have preferred it going to a trial, because at this rate, having pleaded guilty, he can get a third off his sentence. We don't feel that is sufficient,"" Mr Rice said. Tracy Blackwell, Josh's mother, said: ""I couldn't put it into words how we feel. [It's] ripped us apart, it's affected everyone, not just us - hundreds of friends, because that's how nice the boys were."" Sarah Baker, George's mother, added that the boys were all ""well behaved"" and ""cheeky"", and that she was ""devastated"" to lose them. Harry's father Ian Rice, George's mother Sarah Baker, and Josh's mother Tracy Blackwell paid tribute to the boys outside court today The boys were all pronounced dead at the scene of the crash, at about 20:40 GMT. An accident investigator established Chudasama, a car rental firm employee, had been driving at 71mph on a road with a 60mph speed limit, the court heard. Judge Wendy Joseph said speed limits ""were not figures to be aimed at"". A crowd gathered on Shepiston Lane to pay tribute to the boys Judge Joseph said five other children's lives had been put at risk when Chudasama lost control of the car. Chudasama is due to be sentenced on 9 March.  The maximum jail term for causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years. Mr Rice, Ms Baker and Ms Blackwell all said they wanted to see the defendant be handed three life sentences. Mr Rice said: ""We've got three boys - it should be three, consecutive life sentences."" Last year the government announcedplans to give life sentences to killer drivers. The victims were old school friends at Harefield Academy in Uxbridge and funerals for two of the boys had yet to take place, the court heard. George had gone on to become an apprentice electrician, Josh was a labourer and Harry a semi-professional footballer.

"Rosie was one of many women locked out of desirable areas because of agents' DSS bans The thousands of lettings agents and landlords around the country who reject housing benefit claimants could be flouting equality laws, due to a recent legal case. The widespread practice has led to ""no-go zones"" for those on lower incomes - especially in desirable residential areas. But single mother Rosie Keogh won compensation for sex discrimination from a lettings agency that refused to consider her as a tenant because she was on state benefit. The cleaner and former paralegal successfully argued that blanket bans on benefit claimants indirectly discriminated against women, especially single women. This is because they are proportionately more likely to be claiming housing benefit than single men, according to official figures. Bardot wades into row over singer's will I was stalked by a polar bear Police drone finds crash driver in ditch Rosie's attempt to rent a property in a smart area of Birmingham in May 2016 was blocked when the lettings agent found she would pay some of the rent via housing benefit. The agent told her it would not be proceeding with her application for a property in Kings Heath before it had looked into her individual circumstances or assessed how reliable a tenant she would be. She had been living in the same property for 11 years with the rent being paid in full every time. After a letter of complaint was dismissed by the agents, the mother of one issued a claim for discrimination in the county court. ""I felt something had to be done to challenge it. I was motivated by anger at such inequitable practice,"" said Rosie. ""It made me feel like a second-class citizen. ""You are being treated differently - and it's women and women with children who are bearing the brunt of this because they need to work part-time."" And Rosie is not alone. There are whole areas of towns and cities in England that have become virtual no-go zones for people on housing benefit because lettings agents and landlords are unwilling to deal with them. A survey of 1,137 private landlords for housing charity Shelter in 2017 found that 43% had an outright ban on letting to such claimants. A further 18% preferred not to let to them. And aninvestigation by the BBC last year found many landlords prefer to let to families with pets than those on benefits. Rosie was supported in her case by Shelter, whose legal officer Rose Arnall said: ""By applying a blanket policy they are actually preventing good tenants from accessing the private rented sector. ""Women are more likely to be caring for children and therefore working part-time and are therefore more likely to top up their income by claiming housing benefit."" Because of the lack of available social housing, more than a fifth of those renting privately are relying on housing benefit either wholly or partly to cover their rent, according to 2017 figures. Eighteen months after Rosie first began her fightback, lettings agent Nicholas George admitted indirect discrimination on the grounds of her sex, settling out of court with Â£2,000 compensation. She also had help from the Bar Pro Bono Unit with the case who found a barrister willing to help for free. Robert Brown gave advice and drew up the consent order which was witnessed by a judge at Birmingham County Court. Although not setting a legally binding precedent, the case established that the practice could be considered indirect sexual discrimination. Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said private renting was so expensive that many people could not get by without housing benefit, even if they were working. ""Our advisers repeatedly hear from desperate mothers battling to find someone willing to let to them, in spite of being able to pay the rent. ""We are urging all landlords and letting agents to get rid of 'no DSS' policies, and treat people fairly on a case-by-case basis."" Chris Norris, head of policy at the National Landlords Association, agreed there was no place for discrimination on the basis of someone's gender. ""Cases like this highlight the very worst of what a minority of renters have to put up with when looking to secure a home in the private rented sector."" He added: ""The number of landlords willing to rent to housing benefit tenants has fallen dramatically over the last few years because cuts to welfare and problems with the universal credit system are making it more and more difficult for anyone in receipt of housing support to pay their rent on time and sustain long-term tenancies."" Labour's housing spokesman John Healey said government cuts to housing benefit had stripped away the safety net for families and led to ""no-go zones"" for families on low and middle incomes. ""These short-sighted decisions have made landlords more wary of tenants claiming housing benefit and so made discrimination more likely."" A government spokesman said: ""It's wrong to treat someone differently because they are claiming a benefit. ""The majority of claimants are comfortable managing their money but we are increasing support to help people who need it to stay on top of their payments."" He added that from April, people in receipt of housing benefit would receive two weeks' rent when they moved on to universal credit and landlords could now apply to have the benefit paid directly to them if their tenants were more than two months in arrears. But one landlord, Tom Black, said his landlord insurance prohibited him from taking tenants that are on housing benefits when their tenancy starts. Another said: ""As a council accredited landlord who trains others to become accredited,â I can safely say that the ""no DSS"" is not down to landlord preference or discrimination... it's entirely down to (a.) mortgage terms and (b.) severe delays in the claimants HB claim, universal credit policy to pay claimants directly into their bank account. ""We personally could fill our houses 10 times over if we could rent to DSS as our phones never stop ringing, day and night, whenever we advertise a vacant one."" I am a mother of 3 children, ages 3, 7 and 11. I have had to private rent for the last 8 years due to the lack of council properties available. I have moved 7 times within those 8 years and each time to a completely different area because of lack of estate agents and landlords who will except housing benefit. We have had to move due to landlords no longer wanting us after the benefit cuts, and also bad landlords who would not keep the house together. Due to be refused a tenancy over and over again so many times due to being on housing benefit, we have had to look further afield. We have moved from Southampton to Eastleigh to Gosport to Andover. My daughter who is aged 11 has been very affected by this after now being in her 8th school and this has effected her education and her mental health, due to constantly having to make new friends and losing many every time. This is all because there are so so many landlords who will not accept housing benefit even though we are great tenants and always pay our rent on time as it is our priority. This needs to come to a stop. We do not feel safe in any property. We have been faced with homelessness previously due to not finding anywhere and even when we Have, the estate agents feel they can charge hundreds of pounds more due to our circumstances which does not make any sense as we have a low income so we are forced to be homeless if we can't pay or find a suitable guarantor. These guarantors that they want have to be very specific and earning so much money but unfortunateley not everyone knows someone that is employed and earning so much money. My family and I have been trying to move house for over a year now. We currently rent privately and have been keeping up with our rent at this property for over 7 years. I search online every day for properties, from Cornwall, right up to the Scottish Borders. I am lucky if I find 1 property a month that will accept DSS and be in a suitable area for us to raise our children. Being so few of these properties, they are snapped up almost amediately. People on benefits are being viewed as a nuisance risk and are being pushed into inner city areas blighted by crime. The children are being punished because their parents can't work, or have a job with a low income. How can that be fair? Welcome to my world!! It is hardly news that pretty much all Lettings Agents have 'No DSS' on their advertisements. The other way they stop Housing Benefit recipients from renting are - 'HB accepted with a guarantor' (I don't know anyone who could do this for me) or, the absolute doozie 'HB considered, please ask' (this means, Housing Benefit considered if you can pay six months' rent up front, plus their fee and a deposit - if you had that much spare, you wouldn't be claiming Housing Benefit!). I have battled to house my family, as, even when I was well enough to work, I needed a HB top-up, as I'm a full-time carer for 2 of my adult children, I can only work part-time. If I'm honest, I have lied to agents in the past, just to get a roof over our heads. I am a wheelchair user and any property I phone up and tell then this and I'm on housing benefits it's a straight no not even considered. I arranged a viewing at a house in risinghurst, oxford and got as far as signing documents. Landlord was happy to be housing a mother and two children (aswel as the family dog) but as soon as I mentioned housing benefits paying a small fraction of the cost, the entire agreement shut down and the agent became frustrated that I hadn't told her prior to viewing. It was embarrassing and upsetting. We are stuck in a privately rented property that is much too small for us because nobody will give us the benefit of the doubt. If we are asked to vacate this property I have no faith that we will be able to find anywhere else to live. Despite that we have paid our current landlord every month for 11 years, and that  upon graduation, I will be earning a more than reasonable wage and the benefits will only be temporary. It's degrading and frustrating. The sooner this is (rightly) viewed as discrimination, the better. I was denied even inquiring about looking at private flats in London simply due to claiming housing benefit. Surprisingly, my wage is above the national average just over 29,000, but in London and having a child, this still entitled me and my partner to around Â£440 per month housing benefit.  I tried to explain to the letting agent I am in full time, contracted employment, and anyone with a child earning under Â£35,000 per annum will be receiving housing benefit of some sort in London and they said it didn't matter. This isn't just blocking women from renting it's blocking entire families. My daughter was a blame-free tenant for 10 years in one property from which she was given notice for no reason.  Despite numerous letters of appeal and requests for conciliatory meetings, the landlords did not answer any of her correspondence.  She could not even get them to give her a written reference.  She sought replacement accommodation for herself (a lone parent) and her two little children aged 6 and 3, for six months before finding a landlord/ estate agent who would take her (on housing benefit) with my husband as guarantor.  The whole experience has not only caused her great stress and anxiety and has led to an exacerbation of her chronic depression, but has also affected her six-year old who has become angry and withdrawn and fearful they will be evicted again from their new home.  The stipulation ""no HB, Children or Pets"" was appended to most of the rental properties on offer.  It reminded me of London in the 50s and 60s.  ""No blacks or Irish."" I am disabled and I have to be on housing benefits. It is virtually impossible to find a place that accepts housing benefits and those that do accept it require a guarantor with unacceptable requirements.  I was made homeless and spent time sleeping rough when my landlord of my previous place decided to renovate and increase rent and price me out of the place and so he asked me to leave.  I had paid rent in full for the previous 8 years with him no problem and have never had a problem.  I am now stuck in a council home with no chance of ever moving or improving the place where I live.  The equality act should account for disabled people on housing benefits being discriminated against.  Since I could not go to a letting agent I tried to rent a place from a landlord personally advertising and renting their property, going that route I was also told on a number of occasion that their buy-to-let mortgages stated they could not let out to people on housing benefits.  This shows the banks are also discriminating against disabled and people on housing benefit.  Is it just because of a few rotten apples spoiling the bunch for the rest of us?  Where and when does this discrimination originate from?  The 70's or 80's? The fact letting agents call it DSS makes me think so, it hasn't been called that for decades.  What are the statistic for rent arrears with people on housing benefit versus those on jobs?  What about those with disabilities? With JSA type benefits allowing housing benefits they can be stopped and rent arrears can accrue if you miss an appointment, a horrible position to have that held over your head, however, if disabilities grant housing benefit, your disability is not going to suddenly disappear and your housing benefit with it.  It is blatant discrimination against people with disabilities and those on housing benefit, it disgusts me. Renting decisions should be based on your previous history and if it is good you should not automatically be excluded or need a guarantor. Housing Benefit is just that. For Housing. Landlords would accept benefit tenants if rent was paid directly to Landlords with a guarantee that it would start at the beginning of a tenancy and be guaranteed to continue. The reality is that once a tenant is is a property, the assessments can take many weeks. The slightest error by a tenant means the application has to start again, meaning 6-8 weeks delay. The Council isn't concerned as the applicant isn't homeless. This is the reality, while of course a Landlord still has to pay his mortgage. I just get tired of the ill informed comments by Shelter. How many properties to HB tenants do they rent out? How many properties do they rent to anyone? Millions in income. So why don't they put their income to good use, and help solve the problem. Yes, there are bad Landlords, but the vast majority are good, and wish for good, long term tenants. Conversely, there are good HB tenants, but equally others who are not..

"Ms Ardern and Mr Gayford were asked about the date their child was conceived An Australia TV interview with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in which she was called ""attractive"" has been widely criticised as ""creepy"". In an interview on current affairs show 60 Minutes, veteran reporter Charles Wooley said he was ""smitten"" by the PM. He also asked Ms Ardern, who recently announced she is pregnant, when her baby was conceived. 60 Minutes later defended itself, saying it was showing the ""human side"" of its interviewees. But Ms Ardern told reporters that she was ""not fazed"" by the line of questioning. ""It's fair to say that I couldn't recall there being anything from the interview that particularly stood out to me,"" she said on Monday. The 60 Minutes interview was a profile of Ms Ardern, who, at 37, became New Zealand's youngest prime minister in over a century in October last year. Allow Twitter content?

""I've met a lot of prime ministers in my time, but none so young and not so many so smart, and never one so attractive,"" said Mr Wooley in his opening. He also focused much of the interview on Ms Ardern's pregnancy. ""One really important political question that I want to ask you, and that is what exactly is the date that the baby's due?"" he asked her and her partner, Clarke Gayford. ""It's interesting how much people have been counting back to the conception date,"" he then added. Ms Ardern responded by saying the baby was conceived when the ""election was over"", but that they did not ""need to get into those details"".

But when asked about the furore in a press conference on Monday, Ms Ardern said she was ""not fazed"". The question about when her child was conceived should be ""put under the heading of 'too much information',"" she said. 60 Minutes later defended its coverage in a statement sent to New Zealand media. ""60 Minutes reporters have always asked the tough questions which the public has been wanting to hear, while also showing the human side of these individuals that we rarely get to see,"" said a spokesperson in the statement. Mr Wooley ""came away from his interview with Jacinda Ardern in awe of her poise, intelligence and everyday charm, which was reflected in the full story"", the spokesperson said. 60 Minutes reporter Mr Wooley similarly defended the interview, calling the social media backlash ""Orwellian"". ""I think you got to be so careful with newspeak and thought crime and everything else, we suffer the same thing in Australia,"" Mr Wooley told radio network NewsTalk ZB. He said he did not regret the interview but added that his wife had accused him of ""gushing"". Ms Ardern announced her pregnancy in January this year.It will make her the second elected world leader to give birth while in office. She will be taking six weeks of maternity leave before going back to work. ""I am not the first woman to multi-task. I am not the first woman to work and have a baby - there are many women who have done this before,"" she said at the time. Baby questions have dogged her throughout her political leadership. On her first day as opposition leader, she was controversially asked in an interview whether she had made ""a choice between having babies and having a career"". Ms Ardern replied that such a question was ""totally unacceptable in 2017"". ""It is a woman's decision about when they choose to have children and it should not predetermine whether or not they are given a job or have job opportunities,"" she said.

"This video can not be played A doctor in Eastern Ghouta says there is still shelling, but ""the level is less than before"" The UN has renewed its appeal for an immediate truce in the besieged Syrian rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area, amid reports of more deaths in air strikes. The UN Security Council demanded on Saturday that all parties cease fighting for 30 days ""without delay"". But the Syrian government's ally Russia said the truce would begin only once they had agreed how to implement it. It came as activists reported that nine civilians were killed in a government air strike on the town of Douma. At least 541 people have been killed by government air and artillery strikes since hostilities escalated eight days ago, according to a medical charity. Life in Eastern Ghouta - read residents' stories Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? Why is there a war in Syria? The Eastern Ghouta is the last major rebel-held area near the capital, Damascus, and has been besieged since 2013 by the Syrian military with support from Russia and Iran-backed militias. Reports on Monday morning spoke of renewed bombardment of the enclave, where some 393,000 civilians are trapped. The Syria Civil Defence, whose rescue workers are known as the White Helmets, said nine civilians were killed in a strike on one building in Douma. A monitoring group said the victims were from the same family. The official Sana news agency meanwhile cited police as saying a civilian had been injured in the government-controlled Qassa area of Damascus by shells fired by rebels in the Eastern Ghouta. On Sunday, at least 20 civilians were killed in government air and artillery attacks, according to the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), a charity that operates hospitals in the enclave. Casualties were also reported following what the opposition newspaper Enab Baladi reported was a ground offensive by pro-government forces that rebels repelled. Addressing the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres said Security Council resolutions were ""only meaningful if they are effectively implemented and that is why I expect the resolution to be immediately implemented and sustained"". This video can not be played Rawaa has been living in a basement with around 75 others for months He added: ""Eastern Ghouta cannot wait. It's high time to stop this hell on Earth."" The UN Security Council resolution demanded that ""all parties cease hostilities without delay"" and ensure ""a durable humanitarian pause for at least 30 consecutive days throughout Syria"". The resolution was agreed to enable humanitarian aid deliveries and medical evacuations of the critically ill,external, but operations against the jihadist groups Islamic State (IS), al-Qaeda and what the resolution terms al-Nusra Front are not covered by the truce. Al-Nusra Front was the name of al-Qaeda's former official affiliate in Syria.Its latest incarnation is an alliance of jihadist groupscalled Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). HTS has a presence in the Eastern Ghouta, but the enclave is dominated by the Islamist rebel groups Jaysh al-Islam and Faylaq al-Rahman. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini on Monday called on the Syrian government and its supporters to ensure the process of de-escalation took place. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the cessation of hostilities would ""start when all sides of the conflict agree on how to introduce it"". The Syrian government has denied targeting civilians and said it is trying to liberate the Eastern Ghouta from ""terrorists"" - a term it has used to describe both the jihadist militants and the mainstream rebels. One doctor, who gave his name as Dr Jad, told the BBC medics were working with ""no electricity, no medication, no oxygen, bombs, no medication for anaesthesia, no painkillers, no antibiotics"". This video can not be played ""At least in heaven there's food"": The children caught up in Eastern Ghouta air strikes He added: ""They are working in a really, really dreadful, difficult situation; it reminds us of the First World War."" The Syrian Network for Human Rights group, which tracks casualties, says 12,763 civilians have died as a result of attacks by Syrian government forces and their allies in the Eastern Ghouta since March 2011, when the Syrian civil war began. Ambulance drivers reported a chlorine smell after a bombardment air strike in the town of al-Shifuniya. Workers within the opposition-run health ministry said there had been admissions on Sunday of people suffering symptoms consistent with exposure to chlorine gas. They said 18 people had been treated ""with oxygen nebulising sessions"", that one male infant had died, and that a four-month-old baby was on a ventilator. Allow Twitter content?

It was unclear whether the boy's death was related to gas or the explosion. The Syrian American Medical Society, a relief organisation, also told the BBC there were patients ""suffering from symptoms indicative to exposure to chemical compounds"". None of reports could be independently verified. Mr Lavrov said on Monday that ""bogus stories"" about the use of chlorine were a ""provocation"" intended to sabotage the UN resolution. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. However, a joint investigation by experts from the UN and the Organisations for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons concluded two years ago that government forces had used chlorine as a weapon at least three times between 2014 and 2015. The experts are also confident that government forces used the nerve agent Sarin in an attack on the northern rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun last April, killing more than 80 people.

"David Davis and Theresa May will meet Michel Barnier this week Downing Street has insisted Britain will leave the EU customs union after Brexit amid claims of Tory disunity over the UK-EU future relationship. Theresa May has faced calls to spell out what she wants from the talks ahead of the UK's departure in March 2019. In a customs union the UK would have tariff-free trade within the EU, but would lose the ability to strike its own deals with other countries. It comes ahead of a meeting with the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Explained: Customs union and single market Laura Kuenssberg: Customs union - the, a, or c? Amber Rudd hits back at Brexiteers What is the Brexit 'transition phase' all about? The prime minister and Brexit Secretary David Davis will meet Mr Barnier ahead of the next round of negotiations getting under way. Later, talks between officials will focus for the first time on the transitional period planned for after Brexit. Potential sticking points include citizens' rights, with the UK insisting EU nationals arriving during this time should not have the same rights as those who arrived before Brexit day. Mr Barnier, who is on his way to London, said he wanted to ""accelerate"" his schedule of meetings As he set off for London, Mr Barnier said there was ""not a moment to lose"" in order to secure a deal before the end of the year. Asked about the UK's position on the customs union, he said Downing Street's ""red lines"" would be respected but the UK must respect the ""rules of the union"". How close the UK will remain to the EU's single market and customs union has been a topic of debate among leading Brexiteers and some of those closest to the prime minister. Conservative MP Kwasi Kwarteng, who is an aide to Chancellor Philip Hammond, suggested the latest statement on the customs union was ""perfectly consistent"" with what No 10 had been saying all along, given that Mrs May had been ""pretty clear"" in her January 2017 Lancaster House speech the UK would be leaving. This video can not be played MP Kwasi Kwarteng tells Today a border in Northern Ireland doesn't have to be ""hard"" Pressed on how he squared this reality with Mr Hammond's stated desire for the UK and EU to move ""very modestly"" apart in terms of trade, he told BBC Radio 4's Today that ""being modestly apart does not mean you have to be in a customs union"". He said the government had to make it clearer its core aim was a free trade deal with the EU. On Sunday Eurosceptic Tory Bernard Jenkin accused the government of being ""vague"" and ""divided"", saying Chancellor Philip Hammond was not sticking to the approach put forward by the prime minister. Home Secretary Amber Rudd - who was a leading figure in the Remain campaign - played down the divisions in the cabinet, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: ""I have a surprise for the Brexiteers, which is the committee that meets in order to help make these decisions is more united than they think."" Future options? In a position paper published in August, the UK set out two potential options for future long-term customs operations. A ""partnership"" arrangement would see the UK ""align precisely"" with the EU in terms of imports and exports, removing the need for any customs checks between the two. The UK would continue to operate its own checks on goods coming from outside the EU - and safeguards would be needed to prevent goods entering the EU that had not complied with its rules. An alternative scenario would involve the UK extending customs checks to EU arrivals but under a ""highly streamlined arrangement"" to minimise disruption at ports and airports. This would seek to make the existing system of customs checks ""even more efficient"", for example using number plate recognition technology at ports, which could be linked to customs declarations for what the vehicles are carrying, meaning the vehicles do not have to be manually stopped and checked. UK proposes 'untested' customs system Ms Rudd said they agreed on the need for ""frictionless trade"", the ability to strike international trade deals and to avoid a hard border in Ireland, hitting back at those who question whether such a deal can be secured. ""We want to have a bespoke agreement,"" she said. ""Now we're not going to surrender before we have that battle."" She said Mrs May - who will chair a meeting of the 10-strong Brexit cabinet sub-committee on Wednesday and Thursday - had an ""open mind"" on how customs will be managed after Brexit. This video can not be played Amber Rudd says Jacob Rees-Mogg should not have accused Treasury of fiddling figures Quizzed on what the model might look like, she said she was ""not intimidated at all"" by critics' warnings about customs unions membership. Labour said it was ""foolhardy"" to rule out any kind of customs union with the UK's largest trading partner.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn speaks to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg about his Brexit plans Two things can be true at the same time. It is true that Jeremy Corbyn has not dramatically shifted Labour's Brexit policy. For months the party has been saying that some form of customs union with the European Union after Brexit is a possibility. Corbyn backs customs union membership The party's tip toes towards this policy have been long anticipated. And in the last few days his shadow team had given the game away in terms of the party's firmer backing for this idea. The notion of a customs union will be welcomed by businesses who want to minimise the disruption of Brexit - and the idea would go some way towards solving the problem of the Irish border, which as we've discussed many times is one of the tensions in the government's position. This speech, and this policy move, is no Remainiac dream. Jeremy Corbyn has not suddenly become a convert to staying in the single market, nor for a second referendum. The Labour leader has stopped short of where many of his MPs would like him to go, and are already calling for publicly - full backing for the UK to stay in the single market. And it is also the case that it is extremely likely that the European Union would say a hypothetical 'no' to what he is asking for: a say in future trade deals alongside this new proposed customs arrangement. Mr Corbyn also said in his speech that a Labour government would ""not countenance a deal that left Britain as a passive recipient of rules decided elsewhere by others"". So, if the EU says we can't have a say in a customs union, and Mr Corbyn says he wouldn't join a union if the UK wasn't given a say, what happens then? Nothing about what outwardly seems a softer Brexit is guaranteed. If the promise is an impossible one, is it really a promise at all? What is, however, also true is that as the government and Parliament wrangles over Brexit, this new position on customs does give Labour a clear dividing line with the Tories - yes, one of those old chestnuts. That might rile Brexit-backing Labour voters, and worries some MPs. And it does make a potential defeat in the Commons when the Trade and Customs Bill eventually gets there more likely. Yet there is also nothing certain about that. Yes, there is probably a majority in Parliament for staying in a customs union. But for the government to be beaten on that, or forced to move towards Labour's new position, depends on the will of Tory Remainer rebels being ready to take a course of action that could damage the government. Jeremy Corbyn can today pave the way, but he can't be sure they will take the bait.

"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""We've long championed being in a customs union with the EU"" Jeremy Corbyn is to confirm a shift in the Labour Party's position on remaining in the customs union after Brexit, Sir Keir Starmer has indicated. The shadow Brexit secretary said Labour's front bench was ""unanimous"" in its backing for striking a new deal with the EU after Brexit. The UK would leave the customs union but then negotiate a treaty that will ""do the work of the customs union"". But Liam Fox said Labour's position did not make sense. Analysis: Labour's customs union policy 'evolves' What's the difference between single market and customs union? The international trade secretary told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""Labour say they want to join a customs union. What does that mean? ""Is it like Turkey, which has a customs union but only in goods, not in agriculture, not in services, not in finance? Is that what we want for Britain? Will we take rules in certain sectors but not in others?"" Sir Keir also warned Prime Minister Theresa May ""crunch time"" was coming, as MPs geared up to vote on her policy of staying out of the customs union when the UK leaves the EU next March so that the UK can strike its own trade deals. Labour leader Mr Corbyn is due to make a speech on Monday setting out his party's position. Labour has previously said it wants the UK to retain the ""benefits"" of the customs union and the single market without saying how that would be achieved. Sir Keir said being in a customs union permanently was the ""the only way realistically to get tariff free access,"" which was ""really important for our manufacturing base"" and the only way to avoid the return of a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He said Britain was more likely to strike new deals if it works ""jointly with the EU"", adding: ""We all want to do bold new trade agreements but we would be better off doing that with the EU."" Anna Soubry: Ready to call off revolt? By BBC Political Correspondent Emma Vardy Labour's efforts to persuade Conservative rebels to side with them are set to intensify. Now that Labour appears to have come down firmly on the side of a softer Brexit, after months of hedging its bets, there's a renewed focus at Westminster on whether Tory rebels can defeat Theresa May and keep the UK in the customs union. On paper, there would appear to be the numbers for pro-EU Conservative MPs to side with Labour (and the Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru and Green Party) to overturn Theresa May's majority. But Conservative rebels would need nerves of steel to torpedo the PM's whole Brexit strategy. It could pave the way to another general election, which might just deliver a Labour government. The PM is hoping she can say enough this week to keep the Remainers on side, but the ""meaningful vote"" on Brexit expected in the autumn looms ever larger. Mr Fox has said the UK can only strike its own trade deals if it is not part of a customs union - and he told Andrew Marr his department was working with ""21 different countries"" to get agreements in place that could be signed as soon as the UK leaves. He said Mrs May would be setting out what the cabinet had agreed on the UK's future economic relationship with the EU in a speech on Friday, in the north-east of England. And he urged Remain-supporting Tory MPs, who are threatening to derail the prime minister's plan to leave the customs union, to have an ""an open mind"" and listen to what she had to say, which would ""deal with a lot of the reservations that they have"". This video can not be played Liam Fox: ""Labour say they want to join a customs union, what does that mean?"" The Labour leadership is under pressure from some of their own MPs to join forces with Conservative rebels and the Lib Dems to back an amendment to the Trade Bill, currently making its way through Parliament, to stay in a customs union. Mr Fox said a vote on the bill, which had been due to take place next week, had been delayed because ""we want to persuade our colleagues of the merits of our argument before we take the bill forward"". Sir Keir said the Labour leadership had not yet decided to back the rebel Tory amendments but claimed they were similar to ones that had been tabled by the Labour front bench. He said Mrs May did not have a majority in Parliament for staying out of a customs union and she would face a ""crunch"" vote ""sooner rather than later"" - although he denied Labour was engaged in a cynical attempt to remove her from office and force a general election. This video can not be played Iain Duncan Smith warned would-be Tory rebels Tory rebel Anna Soubry suggested she was ready to pull back if Mrs May announced measures that would amount to a customs agreement on Friday, telling BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: ""It's absolutely beholden now on the government to get itself in the right place."" In his speech on Monday, Mr Corbyn will say the EU ""is not the root of all our problems and leaving it will not solve all our problems,"" adding: ""Brexit is what we make of it together, the priorities and choices we make in the negotiations.""

Although they regard Mr Corbyn's expected commitment on Monday as a ""step forward"", they said this falls ""way short"" of where Labour should be on Brexit.

"The former finance director of collapsed construction firm Carillion ""dumped"" the last of his shares at the earliest possible moment, MPs say. Richard Adam sold shares worth hundreds of thousands of pounds in early 2017 as soon as he qualified for them after leaving Carillion in December 2016. The information was released by a joint committee of MPs looking into Carillion's collapse. Mr Adam said he had sold them ""when I was invited to do so by the company"". The information was published by the Work and Pensions and Business Select Committees, which are conducting a joint inquiry into Carillion's collapse. More than 1,000 Carillion workers have lost their jobs since the firm went into liquidation last month. Regulator was warned over Carillion pensions Investors 'fled' as Carillion collapsed Carillion: Six charts that explain what happened Mr Adam retired at the end of December 2016. On 1 March 2017, he sold all the shares he had at the time for Â£534,000, including performance awards for 2013-15 of Â£277,000, which fell due once he had retired. He then sold his long-term incentive plan awards for 2014 on 8 May 2017, the day they matured, for Â£242,000. Mr Adam commented: ""I sold the shares that I was eligible to sell when I was invited to do so by the company as I retired. More than half of the shares in the company that I had an interest in at retirement have been lost as a result of the company entering liquidation."" The committees also published a response from Mr Adam's successor, Zafar Khan, whose contract with Carillion was terminated last September after eight months in the job. A few days before his contract was ended, Mr Khan had issued a financial update showing things had worsened since July 2017, when Carillion had written off Â£845m in losses on underperforming contracts, the committee said. They added: ""Mr Khan argues that it is surprising that the board were 'spooked' by his update, as it should have been apparent to the board by then that the company was struggling to improve both its net debt and profit positions."" Frank Field, chairman of the Work and Pensions Select Committee, accused Mr Adam of ""dumping the last of his shares at the first possible moment, because he is - with his own money at least - 'risk-averse'. What conclusions are we to draw from that?"" He added: ""The other directors appear keen to set up the hapless Zafar Khan as the fall guy for the collapse. It is not lost on us, however, that he inherited Carillion's mountain of debt.""

"The measure is largely aimed at cheap, high-strength alcohol in supermarkets and off-licenses The Scottish government has recommended that the minimum price for a unit of alcohol should be set at 50p. The minimum pricing scheme will come into force in May, after ministers won out in a lengthy legal battle. Legislation was approved at Holyrood in 2012, but onlycleared legal challenges in the Supreme Courtin November 2017. Health Secretary Shona Robison said a consultation had backed the planned 50p unit price, which will go before MSPs at Holyrood before it comes into force. Minimum pricing is designed to cut the intake of problem drinkers by raising the price of the strongest, cheapest alcohol, with the extra revenue going to retailers. Alcohol Focus Scotland had found that super-strength cider and own-brand spirits could be bought for as little as 18p per unit. A 50p minimum price was outlined inthe original legislation, which was the first of its kind in the UK, and has now been endorsed via a public consultation. This would raise the price of the cheapest bottle of red wine (9.4 units of alcohol) to Â£4.69, a four-pack of 500ml cans of 4% lager (8 units) would cost at least Â£4 and a 70cl bottle of whisky (28 units of alcohol) could not be sold for less than Â£14. Normal strength cider (5% ABV) would cost at least Â£2.50 a litre but a super-strength version (7.5% ABV) would have to cost a minimum of Â£3.75 for a litre. The Scotch Whisky Association had pursued a lengthy legal challenge to the legislation, claiming that an excise duty or tax would be an equally effective way of cutting problem drinking. However judges at the Supreme Court in London rejected this, saying that minimum pricing was a ""proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim"" and would target ""the health hazards of cheap alcohol and the groups most affected in a way that an increase in excise or VAT does not"". Ms Robison said: ""I am grateful to everyone who took the time to respond to the consultation on our proposed minimum price per unit of alcohol and I am happy to confirm that we will be moving forward with our recommendation of 50 pence. ""With alcohol on sale today in some places at just 16 pence per unit, we have to tackle the scourge of cheap, high-strength drink that causes so much damage to so many families. This move will save thousands of lives."" Opposition parties have raised some questions about aspects of the policy, with the Greens and Lib Dems calling for a 60p minimum price and Labour saying the cash raised should be ""clawed back"" by the state rather than retailers.

"This video can not be played A doctor in Eastern Ghouta says there is still shelling, but ""the level is less than before"" The UN has renewed its appeal for an immediate truce in the besieged Syrian rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area, amid reports of more deaths in air strikes. The UN Security Council demanded on Saturday that all parties cease fighting for 30 days ""without delay"". But the Syrian government's ally Russia said the truce would begin only once they had agreed how to implement it. It came as activists reported that nine civilians were killed in a government air strike on the town of Douma. At least 541 people have been killed by government air and artillery strikes since hostilities escalated eight days ago, according to a medical charity. Life in Eastern Ghouta - read residents' stories Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? Why is there a war in Syria? The Eastern Ghouta is the last major rebel-held area near the capital, Damascus, and has been besieged since 2013 by the Syrian military with support from Russia and Iran-backed militias. Reports on Monday morning spoke of renewed bombardment of the enclave, where some 393,000 civilians are trapped. The Syria Civil Defence, whose rescue workers are known as the White Helmets, said nine civilians were killed in a strike on one building in Douma. A monitoring group said the victims were from the same family. The official Sana news agency meanwhile cited police as saying a civilian had been injured in the government-controlled Qassa area of Damascus by shells fired by rebels in the Eastern Ghouta. On Sunday, at least 20 civilians were killed in government air and artillery attacks, according to the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), a charity that operates hospitals in the enclave. Casualties were also reported following what the opposition newspaper Enab Baladi reported was a ground offensive by pro-government forces that rebels repelled. Addressing the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres said Security Council resolutions were ""only meaningful if they are effectively implemented and that is why I expect the resolution to be immediately implemented and sustained"". This video can not be played Rawaa has been living in a basement with around 75 others for months He added: ""Eastern Ghouta cannot wait. It's high time to stop this hell on Earth."" The UN Security Council resolution demanded that ""all parties cease hostilities without delay"" and ensure ""a durable humanitarian pause for at least 30 consecutive days throughout Syria"". The resolution was agreed to enable humanitarian aid deliveries and medical evacuations of the critically ill,external, but operations against the jihadist groups Islamic State (IS), al-Qaeda and what the resolution terms al-Nusra Front are not covered by the truce. Al-Nusra Front was the name of al-Qaeda's former official affiliate in Syria.Its latest incarnation is an alliance of jihadist groupscalled Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). HTS has a presence in the Eastern Ghouta, but the enclave is dominated by the Islamist rebel groups Jaysh al-Islam and Faylaq al-Rahman. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini on Monday called on the Syrian government and its supporters to ensure the process of de-escalation took place. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the cessation of hostilities would ""start when all sides of the conflict agree on how to introduce it"". The Syrian government has denied targeting civilians and said it is trying to liberate the Eastern Ghouta from ""terrorists"" - a term it has used to describe both the jihadist militants and the mainstream rebels. One doctor, who gave his name as Dr Jad, told the BBC medics were working with ""no electricity, no medication, no oxygen, bombs, no medication for anaesthesia, no painkillers, no antibiotics"". This video can not be played ""At least in heaven there's food"": The children caught up in Eastern Ghouta air strikes He added: ""They are working in a really, really dreadful, difficult situation; it reminds us of the First World War."" The Syrian Network for Human Rights group, which tracks casualties, says 12,763 civilians have died as a result of attacks by Syrian government forces and their allies in the Eastern Ghouta since March 2011, when the Syrian civil war began. Ambulance drivers reported a chlorine smell after a bombardment air strike in the town of al-Shifuniya. Workers within the opposition-run health ministry said there had been admissions on Sunday of people suffering symptoms consistent with exposure to chlorine gas. They said 18 people had been treated ""with oxygen nebulising sessions"", that one male infant had died, and that a four-month-old baby was on a ventilator. Allow Twitter content?

It was unclear whether the boy's death was related to gas or the explosion. The Syrian American Medical Society, a relief organisation, also told the BBC there were patients ""suffering from symptoms indicative to exposure to chemical compounds"". None of reports could be independently verified. Mr Lavrov said on Monday that ""bogus stories"" about the use of chlorine were a ""provocation"" intended to sabotage the UN resolution. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. However, a joint investigation by experts from the UN and the Organisations for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons concluded two years ago that government forces had used chlorine as a weapon at least three times between 2014 and 2015. The experts are also confident that government forces used the nerve agent Sarin in an attack on the northern rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun last April, killing more than 80 people.

"Ms Ardern and Mr Gayford were asked about the date their child was conceived An Australia TV interview with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in which she was called ""attractive"" has been widely criticised as ""creepy"". In an interview on current affairs show 60 Minutes, veteran reporter Charles Wooley said he was ""smitten"" by the PM. He also asked Ms Ardern, who recently announced she is pregnant, when her baby was conceived. 60 Minutes later defended itself, saying it was showing the ""human side"" of its interviewees. But Ms Ardern told reporters that she was ""not fazed"" by the line of questioning. ""It's fair to say that I couldn't recall there being anything from the interview that particularly stood out to me,"" she said on Monday. The 60 Minutes interview was a profile of Ms Ardern, who, at 37, became New Zealand's youngest prime minister in over a century in October last year. Allow Twitter content?

""I've met a lot of prime ministers in my time, but none so young and not so many so smart, and never one so attractive,"" said Mr Wooley in his opening. He also focused much of the interview on Ms Ardern's pregnancy. ""One really important political question that I want to ask you, and that is what exactly is the date that the baby's due?"" he asked her and her partner, Clarke Gayford. ""It's interesting how much people have been counting back to the conception date,"" he then added. Ms Ardern responded by saying the baby was conceived when the ""election was over"", but that they did not ""need to get into those details"".

But when asked about the furore in a press conference on Monday, Ms Ardern said she was ""not fazed"". The question about when her child was conceived should be ""put under the heading of 'too much information',"" she said. 60 Minutes later defended its coverage in a statement sent to New Zealand media. ""60 Minutes reporters have always asked the tough questions which the public has been wanting to hear, while also showing the human side of these individuals that we rarely get to see,"" said a spokesperson in the statement. Mr Wooley ""came away from his interview with Jacinda Ardern in awe of her poise, intelligence and everyday charm, which was reflected in the full story"", the spokesperson said. 60 Minutes reporter Mr Wooley similarly defended the interview, calling the social media backlash ""Orwellian"". ""I think you got to be so careful with newspeak and thought crime and everything else, we suffer the same thing in Australia,"" Mr Wooley told radio network NewsTalk ZB. He said he did not regret the interview but added that his wife had accused him of ""gushing"". Ms Ardern announced her pregnancy in January this year.It will make her the second elected world leader to give birth while in office. She will be taking six weeks of maternity leave before going back to work. ""I am not the first woman to multi-task. I am not the first woman to work and have a baby - there are many women who have done this before,"" she said at the time. Baby questions have dogged her throughout her political leadership. On her first day as opposition leader, she was controversially asked in an interview whether she had made ""a choice between having babies and having a career"". Ms Ardern replied that such a question was ""totally unacceptable in 2017"". ""It is a woman's decision about when they choose to have children and it should not predetermine whether or not they are given a job or have job opportunities,"" she said.

"Norway's Svalbard Global Seed Vault first opened in February 2008 The vault storing the world's most precious seeds is taking delivery on Monday of consignments that will take it to the one million mark. More than 70,000 crops will be added to frozen storage chambers buried deep within a mountain in the Arctic Circle. Cereal staples, unusual crops like the Estonian onion potato, and barley used to brew Irish beer are among them. Monday marks the tenth anniversary of the Global Seed Vault in Svalbard. One of three chambers is now almost full of packets of seeds, each a variety of an important food crop. The number of deposits amounts to 1,059,646. This number excludes emergency withdrawals of about 90,000 seeds needed to make up for precious samples stranded in Syria due to the conflict there. ""Hitting the million mark is really significant,"" said Hannes Dempewolf, senior scientist of the Crop Trust, an international organisation dedicated to conserving the diversity of the crops we rely on for food. ""Only a few years back I don't think we would have thought that we would get there."" Crop diversity is regarded as essential for safeguarding the future of the world's food supply amid pressures such as drought and climate change. The reinforced vault is designed to hold back-ups of samples stored elsewhere in seed banks around the world. Hunter barley seeds are being deposited by the Irish government More than a million different food crops have been deposited by 73 institutions since 26 February 2008. In 2015 and 2017 deposits of wheat, lentil, chickpea and other crops stranded in a seed bank in Syria due to the civil conflict were withdrawn by theInternational Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas,external. Many of the seeds have been grown up and replaced. The vault opens about twice a year for deposits. Monday's additions include unique varieties of rice, wheat and maize; black-eyed pea - a major protein source in Africa and South Asia; and Bambara groundnut, which is being developed as a drought tolerant crop in Africa. The resurgence of craft brewing and distilling in Ireland has led to requests from breweries for seeds of malting barley to be added to the collections. ""The hunter variety is a type of malting barley that is important for Irish crop brewing and distilling,"" said Dempewolf. Last year, the vault suffered flooding to the entrance of the vault due to extreme weather. However, the water did not reach the frozen chambers deep within where the seeds are stored. New waterproof walls have been fitted to make sure water can never enter the actual vault and reinforcements are underway to prepare it for a warmer, wetter future. Scientists estimate that there are about 2.2 million unique varieties of crops in the world's gene banks that will eventually be deposited at Svalbard. ""The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is an iconic reminder of the remarkable conservation effort that is taking place every day, around the world and around the clock - an effort to conserve the seeds of our food crops,"" said Marie Haga, executive director of the Crop Trust. ""Safeguarding such a huge range of seeds means scientists will have the best chance of developing nutritious and climate-resilient crops that can ensure future generations don't just survive, but thrive.""

"UK millennials are on track to be the most overweight generation since records began, health experts say. Based on population trends, more than seven in every 10 people born between the early 1980s and mid-90s will be too fat by the time they reach middle age. In comparison, about half of the ""baby boomer"" generation, born just after World War Two, were fat at that age. Being fat as an adult is linked to 13 different types of cancer, says Cancer Research UK, who did the analysis. The list includes breast, bowel and kidney cancer, but only 15% of people in the UK are aware of the link, according to the charity. Child and teen obesity spreading across the globe UK most overweight country in Western Europe Many unaware of eating disorder signs Teenager challenges 100-calorie snack advert Britain is the most obese nation in Western Europe, with rates rising faster than in any other developed nation. Obesity prevalence has been increasing in the UK, from 15% in 1993 to 27% in 2015. In 2015, the highest obesity levels were seen in people aged 55 to 64, but experts are concerned that younger generations are on track to become fatter still. Cancer Research UK wants to make the associated health risks clear to the wider public. Spokeswoman Prof Linda Bauld said: ""Extra body fat doesn't just sit there; it sends messages around the body that can cause damage to cells. ""This damage can build up over time and increase the risk of cancer in the same way that damage from smoking causes cancer. ""While these estimates sound bleak, we can stop them becoming a reality. ""Millennials are known for following seemingly healthy food trends, but nothing beats a balanced diet. ""Eating plenty of fruit, vegetables and other fibre filled foods like whole grains, and cutting down on junk food is the best way to keep a healthy weight."" Prof Russell Viner, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ""There is a danger that being overweight is becoming normalised, as we know that many people struggle to recognise obesity in themselves, and often are unable to see when their child is overweight. ""Knowledge of the links between cancer and smoking have driven smoking rates down dramatically amongst our young people. ""We need the same recognition of the dangers of obesity.""

"Business minister Claire Perry said the cap should be in place by the end of 2018 New legislation to free people from ""rip off"" energy tariffs should be operating next winter, a move which would protect 11 million customers. The law will allow energy regulator Ofgem to limit how much companies can charge customers for their standard variable tariffs. The government is under pressure to ensure that the measure is ready for the next cold spell. Trade body Energy UK said it was vital the cap did not stifle competition. The government said the Domestic Gas and Electricity Bill,external, which is being introduced to Parliament on Monday, should be implemented by Ofgem ""as soon as possible so that customers get the protection they need by the end of this year"". Rachel Reeves, who chairs the Business Committee in the Commons, said: ""Energy consumers have been overcharged for too long and the government now needs to quickly ensure this legislation is passed in time to protect customers next winter."" The law will limit the cost of firm's standard default tariffs until 2020. Following that, the cap may be extended on an annual basis until 2023. One million households who get the Warm Home Discount saw an energy price cap introduced in February - an extension ofthe cap already in place for prepayment meter customers. This will also apply to another two million vulnerable households next winter. When customers' fixed-term deals end they usually automatically move to this tariff, which applies to 11 million households. Ofgem says the price difference between the average standard variable tariff default deal and the cheapest rate in the market was Â£308 at the last count in December. It is moving to introduce legislation to cap these variable tariffs, overseen by Ofgem. This will not take effect until the law is passed. The government wants it done by the end of the year at least. Some suppliers are moving towards abandoning variable tariffs. Ofgem has also changed the rules to allow suppliers to default customers on to another fixed deal. Customers are still likely to be better off by searching and switching themselves. Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""It's often older people or those on low incomes who are stuck on rip-off energy tariffs, so today we are introducing legislation to force energy companies to change their ways."" The move is an admission that encouraging consumers to regularly switch providers to pay less has not been as successful as hoped. About a third of households are charged a variable price for their energy at a default rate set by their energy company, because they have not chosen to shop around for a cheaper fixed-price deal. Price cap on energy bills 'urgently needed' British Gas scraps standard tariff for new customers How many people will the cap on energy prices help? The Department for Business Energy and the Industrial Sector said that the energy market was not working and that domestic customers of the ""Big Six"" energy companies were paying on average Â£1.4bn a year more than they would in a truly competitive market. ""We're going to give powers to Ofgem to make this energy market work for everybody by winter 2018, to set a maximum absolute cap [to be] paid by customers on standard variable and default tariffs, the tariffs that the majority of households are on and sometimes don't even know it,"" the Energy and Clean Growth Minister, Claire Perry, told the BBC's Today programme. The Business Department says the average annual savings between standard tariffs and fixed rate deals could be up to Â£300. The changes are separate from Ofgem's safeguard tariff, which is already helping some five million vulnerable customers pay lower prices. The key decision over what level the new cap will be set at will be made by Ofgem. Energy UK, which represents the major suppliers, said it was important that the price cap reflected costs - most of which were outside their control, such as distribution costs and the wholesale cost of energy. Lawrence Slade, chief executive of the industry body, said energy providers were concerned a cap would damage investment and competition. ""The risk of unintended consequences around caps is serious. What we have to do is, working with Ofgem and the government, is make sure the cap has sufficient headroom to allow competition to continue,"" he told the BBC. Last weekCentrica, which owns British Gas, said it was cutting around 4,000 jobs worldwide, over half of them in the UK. The firm said the prospect of an energy price cap was part of the reason for the lay-offs. British Gas,  E.On and Scottish Power have all made moves to abolish standard variable tariffs, although customers who do not opt for a fixed-price rate will still be moved onto a default tariff.

"UK millennials are on track to be the most overweight generation since records began, health experts say. Based on population trends, more than seven in every 10 people born between the early 1980s and mid-90s will be too fat by the time they reach middle age. In comparison, about half of the ""baby boomer"" generation, born just after World War Two, were fat at that age. Being fat as an adult is linked to 13 different types of cancer, says Cancer Research UK, who did the analysis. The list includes breast, bowel and kidney cancer, but only 15% of people in the UK are aware of the link, according to the charity. Child and teen obesity spreading across the globe UK most overweight country in Western Europe Many unaware of eating disorder signs Teenager challenges 100-calorie snack advert Britain is the most obese nation in Western Europe, with rates rising faster than in any other developed nation. Obesity prevalence has been increasing in the UK, from 15% in 1993 to 27% in 2015. In 2015, the highest obesity levels were seen in people aged 55 to 64, but experts are concerned that younger generations are on track to become fatter still. Cancer Research UK wants to make the associated health risks clear to the wider public. Spokeswoman Prof Linda Bauld said: ""Extra body fat doesn't just sit there; it sends messages around the body that can cause damage to cells. ""This damage can build up over time and increase the risk of cancer in the same way that damage from smoking causes cancer. ""While these estimates sound bleak, we can stop them becoming a reality. ""Millennials are known for following seemingly healthy food trends, but nothing beats a balanced diet. ""Eating plenty of fruit, vegetables and other fibre filled foods like whole grains, and cutting down on junk food is the best way to keep a healthy weight."" Prof Russell Viner, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ""There is a danger that being overweight is becoming normalised, as we know that many people struggle to recognise obesity in themselves, and often are unable to see when their child is overweight. ""Knowledge of the links between cancer and smoking have driven smoking rates down dramatically amongst our young people. ""We need the same recognition of the dangers of obesity.""

"Harvey Weinstein is facing dozens of accusations of abuse The New York studio co-founded by disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein will file for bankruptcy after talks to sell its assets to an investor group collapsed. Talks ended two weeks ago whenthe New York attorney general's office filed a lawsuitagainst the Weinstein Company. Directors said an ""orderly bankruptcy"" was the only viable option possible. Mr Weinstein faces dozens ofallegations of sexual abuse,external, including rape, but denies non-consensual sex. ""The Weinstein Company has been engaged in an active sale process in the hopes of preserving assets and jobs,"" the board said in a statement. ""Today, those discussions concluded without a signed agreement."" The statement said bankruptcy was the ""only viable option to maximise the company's remaining value"". Weinstein timeline: How the scandal unfolded Harvey Weinstein's accusers Weinstein 'derailed my career' The civil rights lawsuit against the company alleges that Mr Weinstein sexually harassed and abused women employed by the studio for years, as well as making verbal threats to kill staff members. It accuses senior executives at the company, including Mr Weinstein's brother Robert, of failing to prevent the mistreatment of staff despite being presented with evidence. New York Attorney-General Eric Schneiderman is seeking an unspecified sum to cover damages, plus penalties, for victims of alleged abuse. A lawyer for Mr Weinstein has said a ""fair investigation"" will show that many of the allegations were without merit, while the company's directors has said many of the allegations relating to the board were ""inaccurate"". The Weinstein Company: Biggest US box-office gross successes The Weinstein Company is based in New York Django Unchained (2012) ($162.8m) The King's Speech (2010) ($138.8m) Silver Linings Playbook (2012) ($132.1m) Inglourious Basterds (2009) ($120.5m) The Butler (2013) ($116.6m) The allegations against Mr Weinstein first surfaced in October last year, when the New York Times published a story detailing decades of allegations of sexual harassment against Mr Weinstein. Since then, more than 50 women, including some of the biggest names in Hollywood, have accused the film producer of sexual assault, harassment, abuse and rape. In the wake of the allegations, Mr Weinstein was sacked by the board of his company. He is under investigation by UK and US police, but no criminal charges have yet been brought. Mr Weinstein, who was once among the most powerful men in Hollywood, has admitted that his behaviour has ""caused a lot of pain"" but has described many of the allegations against him as ""patently false"".

"Sandals lay strewn in the yard of Dapchi's school after the attack The father of a 14-year-old girl who is among 110 believed to have been abducted by Boko Haram has pleaded with the Nigerian government to act quickly. ""We don't want these girls to stay long with those militants. Anything can happen to them,"" Kachalla Bukar told the BBC.

"Fellow climbers have branded Denis Urubko's decision ""completely suicidal"" A Polish expedition hoping to complete the first winter ascent of the world's second-highest mountain, K2, says one of its climbers appears to have launched an unauthorised solo attempt. Russo-Polish mountaineer Denis Urubko left teammates on Saturday at the base camp on the border between Pakistan and China, a spokesman told the BBC. The 44-year-old split off from the group after a series of arguments. One climber described a solo attempt in winter as ""completely suicidal"". Expedition spokesman Michal Leksinski said he thought Urubko wanted to reach the top this month so his effort would definitely count as a winter climb. Leksinski said he trusted his colleague to turn back if he had to, rather than endanger himself or the team. He believes the next 48 hours are critical. 'Chronicler of the Himalayas' dies at 94 Left out to freeze on K2 and forgotten Urubko reportedly left without a radio, after refusing to discuss his plans. ""He was trying to persuade the team to push for the summit in February,"" a porter with the group told AFP news agency. ""He has had a heated debate with the team leader and left for the summit without saying a word."" Professional mountaineers have expressed dismay at the climber's decision. ""A solo attempt of K2 in winter is completely suicidal,"" said Pakistani climber Mirza Ali Baig. K2's nickname is The Savage Mountain because it is so difficult to climb Karim Shah, a mountaineering friend of Urubko, agreed the move was ""very risky"". ""He is known as the 'Himalayan expert' among the mountaineering community... but his decision is not correct and does not suit someone of his stature,"" he said. He is said to be a highly capable mountaineer who has conquered all of the world's 14 peaks over 8,000m. The expedition members believe he has probably reached an existing K2 camp located at 7,200m. This video can not be played Elisabeth Revol describes her rescue from one of Pakistan's most deadly Himalayan mountains, Nanga Parbat Urubko made headlines just last monthby saving a stricken French climber, Elisabeth Revol. He and three other team members were flown by helicopter from K2 to the 8,126m Nanga Parbat in Pakistan - nicknamed Killer Mountain - where they performed an audacious night-time rescue. K2, the pinnacle of the Karakoram range, stands at a majestic 8,611m (28,251ft). It is the only peak above 8,000m never climbed in winter. A spokesman for the expedition said its members would continue to support Mr Urubko It has a higher fatality-to-summit rate than Everest, and is known as the Savage Mountain due to its fiendish conditions. K2's steepness challenges even the world's most accomplished climbers. Avalanches are an ever-present risk, and in winter temperatures can fall to -50C, accompanied by winds of up to 200km/hr (124mph).

"Lynda Kent says people with eating disorders become very secretive ""I must have been in denial - I was in denial,"" says Lynda Kent, whose daughter developed an eating disorder 15 years ago at the age of 19. ""I didn't want to see there was a problem, until her sister made it very clear that we had a problem."" Lynda says she knew nothing about eating disorders back then and was slow to pick up on the telltale signs. Her story is not untypical, as a survey finds one in three adults could not name any signs of an eating disorder. The YouGov survey of 2,108 adults in the UK - to mark Eating Disorders Awareness Week - also found 79% were unable to name psychological symptoms, such as low self-esteem or having a distorted perception of weight. The eating disorder charity Beat says low awareness of the early signs of illnesses like anorexia and bulimia is linked to delayed treatment and increased risk of the illness becoming life-threatening. Lynda says the early warning signs are often subtle. ""In the early days, you don't see all the signs. Some of them can be mood swings - my daughter became very withdrawn and very quiet. ""She started to display signs of avoiding food, avoiding the truth of where she was eating that food, and lying - so she'd say 'I ate earlier' or 'I'm eating at a friend's'. ""But it was a very long time before dramatic signs were being shown. It was her sister who noticed it and spoke up and said: 'Can't you see what's happening, Mum?'."" The charity Beat says the main signs to watch out for are: becoming obsessive about food changes in behaviour having distorted beliefs about their body size often tired or struggling to concentrate disappearing to the toilet after meals starting to exercise excessively Beat chief executive Andrew Radford says the survey findings are worrying because when early signs are picked up on and sufferers are treated early, they are more likely to make a sustained recovery. ""If you are worried about a family member, a friend or colleague, talk to them and encourage them to visit their GP or self-refer to an eating disorder service."" Teenager challenges 100-calorie snack ad When being treated for an eating disorder means leaving home Lynda says parents and relatives need to be aware that people with eating disorders can become very secretive as they try to hide the extent of their problem. ""They become very clever about not wanting to be found out, a bit like alcoholics, so they become very clever at manipulating the situation they're in."" She recalls how one time she had left her daughter some chicken in the fridge and, in an attempt to look like she had eaten it, the teenager carved the meat off the bone, but threw it over the fence so as not to be discovered. ""Until you understand eating disorders, you think it's all about getting them to eat, but it's the mind that needs attending to. ""If the mind isn't dealt with, the food won't change, because it all comes from a place of insecurity and control - food is the only thing they can control."" Lynda suggests that anyone who is concerned about a loved one should research the issues thoroughly and get help as soon as possible. ""You've got to get on to it fairly fast - the longer you have it, the worse it is to deal with. ""Early intervention is absolutely key. If you can get treatment early, you can nip it in the bud earlier. ""But they have got to be in a place where they want help,"" she adds. Despite more than 10 years of battling anorexia, the story of Lynda and her daughter does have a happy ending. After private treatment in the US, her daughter's health has been stable for the past five years and she is working as a producer for the BBC. ""I'm full of hope,"" says Lynda, ""if I think back five-and-a-half years, I was very worried that I might not see my daughter alive again. ""If someone as poorly as she was can pull through, there's hope. But it takes a lot of love, care and devotion, but there is hope.""

"This video can not be played Seven things the NRA blames after Florida The US National Rifle Association (NRA) has said it does not support any gun ban following a shooting in a Florida school that left 17 people dead. The NRA's comments appear to go against President Donald Trump's proposals to tighten gun controls. Since the 14 February attack on the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School the NRA has become a target of a campaign for tougher gun laws. On Sunday, some students returned to the school for the first time. Students, including activist Emma Gonzalez (L), returned to school on Sunday for the afternoon Accompanied by their parents, they were back for what the authorities in Parkland described as ""orientation"". A variety of support services were available at the campus. Students are preparing to return full-time to their classrooms on Wednesday. âSpike in school threatsâ after Florida shooting Florida survivor: 'I'm not an actor' Dana Loesch, a spokeswoman for the influential gun lobby group, told ABC News: ""The NRA doesn't back any ban."" Anti-gun activists demonstrated in Pompano Beach, Florida, on Sunday She said the massacres like that in Florida were not caused by the NRA. Ms Loesch suggested there had been errors by local law enforcement agencies and a lack of action by politicians. Florida officials revealed after the shooting that an armed officer assigned to the school had stood outside the building during the shooting and not intervened. NRA under fire for Parks and Rec gif Firms cut NRA ties amid Florida backlash The NRA endorsed Mr Trump during his 2016 presidential election campaign. Speaking earlier this week, the president said arming teachers could prevent school shootings like that in Florida. Teachers carrying a concealed gun could end attacks ""very quickly"", he said. This video can not be played School shooting survivor's tearful plea Mr Trump also proposed raising the age limit for buying certain types of guns from 18 to 21. The suspect accused of carrying out the shooting in Florida is former student Nikolas Cruz, 19. Mr Trump also backed a ban on modifications that enable semi-automatic rifles to shoot more rounds per minute. These are known as bump stocks. And the president called for improved background checks on gun buyers. 'Arm me with books' - the teachers saying no to guns After Florida, some owners give up guns On Wednesday, President Trump listened to pleas for gun reform from about 40 students, teachers and families in the executive mansion's state dining room. Hundreds of teenagers from the Washington DC suburbs rallied outside at the time - some voicing support for arming teachers. Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow died in last week's attack - the second-deadliest shooting at a US public school - said: ""We, as a country, failed our children."" ""It should've been one school shooting and we should've fixed it,"" he went on to say. ""And I'm pissed. It's my daughter I'm not going to see again.""

"Inpersonators, animals and athletes - the stars took all different forms Mikaela Shiffrin, Shaun White, Marcel Hirscher, Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir - all the big names lived up to the hype when their moment arrived. But what of the Winter Olympics' surprises? There were a few, and not all came in the form of shock gold medals. Let's take a look at the unlikely stars of Pyeongchang 2018... There really had to be an animal in this list  - and the penultimate day of competition delivered the goods. Milena Bykova, competing for the neutral Olympic athletes from Russia team, narrowly avoided squishing the little critter on her run in the snowboarding giant slalom. The slow motion replay shows it JUST got away unharmed - bar the inevitable palpitations. Gold medal for bravery to that squirrel. This video can not be played Slalom squirrel - snowboarder narrowly avoids furry intruder Bookmark this page for those moments you need a pick-me-up, or even a little cry. Tongan taekwondo fighter turned cross country skier Pita Taufatofua, known as ""the topless Tongan"",finished 114th in the 15km race. The 34-year-old may have been 23 minutes slower than the gold medallist but he didn't see that as failure. His aim was to not ski into a tree and to finish before they turned out the lights. Nailed it. Not only that, but he displayed outstanding sportsmanship, waiting at the finish line for last-placed German Madrazo before hoisting the 43-year-old Mexican onto his shoulders. Despite the freezing conditions, the crowds stayed the extra half an hour to cheer on the remaining finishers. Hot chocolates all round. This video can not be played Winter Olympics: Cross-country crowd gets behind Tongan and Mexican skiers Freestyle skier Gus Kenworthy, despite his 12th place finish, says this Olympics was more fulfilling than when he won a silver medal in Sochi four years ago. Why? ""Because I did it as me"" he told CNN. Kenworthy, who came out as gay in 2015, shared a kiss with boyfriend Matthew Wilkas before his qualifying run, a moment that has become a viral sensation and been hailed as a celebration of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender pride. ""My childhood self would never have dreamed of seeing a gay kiss on TV at the Olympics, but for the first time ever a kid watching at home CAN! Love is love is love."" he added. Kenworthy and his boyfriend Matthew say they had no idea this moment was being broadcast A Kim Jong-un impersonatormade the headlines when he was removed from the ice hockey arena, having tried to join in with the North Korean cheerleaders during the unified Korean women's ice hockey team's match against Japan. The imposter, who identified himself only as Howard, was filmed shaking hands with crowd members as he was escorted out of the arena by security. He reportedly claimed he had not committed any crime by looking like the North Korean president and cheering a hockey team. Earlier, he gatecrashed the opening ceremony with a doppelganger of US president Donald Trump. ""My face is too political,"" he said. ""I was born with this face, I've got to live with it."" Howard didn't appear to entertain the North Korean cheerleaders These Olympics gave us two of best moustaches we have seen. Possibly ever. American Matt Hamilton was the proud owner of one of them - and it was clearly lucky as the United States upset the odds to beat favourites Sweden to gold in the men's curling. Matt Hamilton's moustache became an internet sensation overnight... But we have to hand it to Robert Johansson and his outstanding face fuzz. The Norwegian ski jumper is taking home a gold and two bronze medals from Pyeongchang - but, more importantly, he can add 'BBC Sport's facial hair of the Games award' to his Wikipedia page. Excellently manicured... In a country which only a few weeks ago had barely heard of curling, the South Korean national team became superstars. Uiseong gymnasium was full of fans of the ""Garlic Girls"" for the gold-medal match The ""Garlic Girls"" are so named because of the small garlic-producing region they come from. Then there are the names they gave each other after sitting down for breakfast one day: Steak, Yogurt, Pancake, Sunny and Chocho. They appear so modest, but these incredible, determined underdogs won comfortably against established curling nations such as Canada, Great Britain and the US and made it all the way to the gold medal match. The Swedes has clearly not read the script though - they beat the home side 8-3 in the final. More on the Garlic Girls We have seen some outstanding outfits from competitors and fans alike in South Korea. The Norwegian curling team absolutely smashed it on Valentine's Day with these trousers, despite the awful colour clash with their shirts. Norway celebrated Valentine's Day in style Team USA's Nasa-inspired snowboarding outfits stood out. They even came complete with spaceman helmets for those medal-winning moments. Snowboarder Kyle Mack celebrated his silver medal in the big air with ""snow walk"" And while the majority of figure skaters opt for short, sparkly dresses, France's Mae Berenice Meite looked incredible in this embellished cat suit. The word ""chic"" springs to mind. Meite wore an unconventional cat suit for her performance BBC Sport's Nick Hope in Pyeongchang: The stars of the Games - unofficially London 2012 had its 'Games Makers', Sochi 2014 its 'Ice Makers' and Baku 2015 the 'Flame Makers' - all of whom were brilliant - but the volunteers at Pyeongchang 2018 have been on another level. They may have been given an official - and somewhat unfortunate - ""Passion Crew"" title but they have lived up to that enthusiastic billing with constant energy and countless 'Gangnam Style' dance renditions. Friendly, phenomenally good at English and always smiling, they helped lift the spirits of athletes, coaches, media and spectators during the most brutal sub-zero temperatures in South Korea. The unofficial stars of the Games. What a spectacle. A new event for this Olympics and we certainly hope it is here to stay. The women's competition allowed the athletes to show their full potential, after bad weather made for a chaotic slopestyle final, withAustria's Anna Gasserthe pre-games favourite proving her star quality.

"Harvey Weinstein is facing dozens of accusations of abuse The New York studio co-founded by disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein will file for bankruptcy after talks to sell its assets to an investor group collapsed. Talks ended two weeks ago whenthe New York attorney general's office filed a lawsuitagainst the Weinstein Company. Directors said an ""orderly bankruptcy"" was the only viable option possible. Mr Weinstein faces dozens ofallegations of sexual abuse,external, including rape, but denies non-consensual sex. ""The Weinstein Company has been engaged in an active sale process in the hopes of preserving assets and jobs,"" the board said in a statement. ""Today, those discussions concluded without a signed agreement."" The statement said bankruptcy was the ""only viable option to maximise the company's remaining value"". Weinstein timeline: How the scandal unfolded Harvey Weinstein's accusers Weinstein 'derailed my career' The civil rights lawsuit against the company alleges that Mr Weinstein sexually harassed and abused women employed by the studio for years, as well as making verbal threats to kill staff members. It accuses senior executives at the company, including Mr Weinstein's brother Robert, of failing to prevent the mistreatment of staff despite being presented with evidence. New York Attorney-General Eric Schneiderman is seeking an unspecified sum to cover damages, plus penalties, for victims of alleged abuse. A lawyer for Mr Weinstein has said a ""fair investigation"" will show that many of the allegations were without merit, while the company's directors has said many of the allegations relating to the board were ""inaccurate"". The Weinstein Company: Biggest US box-office gross successes The Weinstein Company is based in New York Django Unchained (2012) ($162.8m) The King's Speech (2010) ($138.8m) Silver Linings Playbook (2012) ($132.1m) Inglourious Basterds (2009) ($120.5m) The Butler (2013) ($116.6m) The allegations against Mr Weinstein first surfaced in October last year, when the New York Times published a story detailing decades of allegations of sexual harassment against Mr Weinstein. Since then, more than 50 women, including some of the biggest names in Hollywood, have accused the film producer of sexual assault, harassment, abuse and rape. In the wake of the allegations, Mr Weinstein was sacked by the board of his company. He is under investigation by UK and US police, but no criminal charges have yet been brought. Mr Weinstein, who was once among the most powerful men in Hollywood, has admitted that his behaviour has ""caused a lot of pain"" but has described many of the allegations against him as ""patently false"".

"The North Korean general and Ivanka Trump cheered from the same stand - but are not expected to meet The United States says any dialogue with North Korea must have nuclear disarmament as the end goal. The North indicated on the last day of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang it was ready for talks, according to South Korea. North Korea has previously said it will not accept any preconditions. ""We will see if Pyongyang's message... that it is willing to hold talks, represents the first steps along the path to denuclearization,"" the US said. Reports about the North's willingness to speak to the US emerged after a meeting of its officials with the South Korean president before the Games' closing ceremony on Sunday. North Korea's controversial Olympics delegate North Korea at the Winter Olympics: All you need to know The politics behind the 'peace Olympics' US President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka also attended the ceremony but she is not expected to talk with any North Koreans, even though she sat a few feet from their main envoy, Gen Kim Yong-chol, at the Olympic Stadium. North Korea was ""very willing"" to hold talks with the US, said the office of South Korean President Moon Jae-in. It added that the North had ""agreed that inter-Korea talks and North-US relations should improve together"". The revelation from the South Korean presidency came hours after a furious statement from the North that describedfresh sanctions announced by Washingtonas ""an act of war"". Pyongyang's foreign ministry praised the way the two Koreas had co-operated together during the Olympics but said the US had ""brought the threat of war to the Korean peninsula with large-scale new sanctions"". The Korean peninsula has been divided since the 1950-53 war and the two sides have never signed a peace treaty. The rapprochement between the two Koreas has been seen as a move by the North to drive a wedge between the South and the US. Experts have cautioned that the latest developments do not put an end to underlying regional tensions, particularly following last year's nuclear and missile tests carried out by the North. South Korean media is abuzz with suggestions that North-US talks could still take place while the respective delegations are in town. The BBC's Laura Bicker, in Pyeongchang, asked an official from South's government if the meeting could take place in the next two days, and the answer was: ""We will see."" Mike Pence was seated directly in front of the North Korean delegation at the opening ceremony North Korea has sent an eight-person team across the border, including Gen Kim Choe Kang-il, a senior diplomat handling North American affairs. Meanwhile, Allison Hooker - a Koreas specialist from the US National Security Council - is part of the US delegation. She met Gen Kim in 2014 in North Korea, as the US tried to free two American detainees. The scene could be set for a more low-key meeting than a failed attempt with US Vice-President Mike Pence. He had been set to meet Kim Yo-jong, the sister of North Korean President Kim Jong-un, at the start of the Games but the meeting was cancelled inexplicably by the North Koreans, according to the US officials.

"""Uncle, we are waiting for you"" reads these children's poster Relatives of the 44 crew members of a lost Argentine submarine have begun raising funds to search for it privately. The navy called off its rescue mission for the ARA San Juan in December, two weeks after it went missing. Relatives have opened an account and asked for the public to donate. No trace of the vessel has been found despite extensive searching underwater and by air. All those who were on board are presumed dead. The vessel was the newest of the three submarines in the Argentine navy's fleet They were understood to have had air for no more than 10 days. The navy stopped its rescue mission two weeks after the sub's disappearance saying there was no longer hope of finding any survivors. The search for the missing vessel and the bodies of the crew continued but with a reduced number of ships. ""We want to keep looking, we are not going to stop,"" relatives said in a statement. ""We are looking for the truth and you can accompany us. With a small donation we will take a big step. Help us."" Who were the San Juan crew? How relatives' sorrow turned to anger The families of the crew members have long expressed dissatisfaction with the navy's handling of the aftermath of the sub's disappearance. At the time, some said they did not believe the official version of events, while others said they needed to find the bodies of their loved ones in order to be able to grieve. Some relatives suggested the submarine, which was 34 years old, had been in a bad state of repair. The Argentine navy said it had passed system safety checks and President Mauricio Macri said it had been ""in perfect condition"". More than a dozen countries helped with the official search and 4,000 personnel were deployed. Earlier this month the Argentine government announced it would offer $4.9m (Â£3.5m) for information that led to the submarine being found. The ARA San Juan, a navy vessel, was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southernmost tip of South America, when it reported an ""electrical breakdown"". According to naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi, the submarine surfaced and reported what was described as a ""short circuit"" in the vessel's batteries. The sub was ordered back to base but disappeared. The Argentine navy's last contact with the vessel was at approximately 07:30 (10:30 GMT) on 15 November 2017, at which point its captain reportedly confirmed that the crew were well. What happens when a submarine vanishes Eight days after the sub vanished, the Vienna-based Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organisation said that it had detected a noise a few hours after the sub's last contact, about 30 nautical miles (60km) north of the vessel's last-known position. The Argentine navy said this could have been the sound of the submarine imploding. The submarine, with its 44 crew, set off under the command of Pedro MartÃ­n FernÃ¡ndez. Forty-three of the crew were men but there was also one woman, Eliana MarÃ­a Krawczyk. The 35-year-old was the first female officer in Argentina to serve on a submarine. The rest of the crew were submariners of varying ages and experience. Accidents involving submarines are rare. Here are some of the most serious: All 70 crew aboard China'sGreat WallMing-class submarine suffocated in 2003 when a diesel engine malfunctioned, consuming the vessel's oxygen supply Russia'sKursksubmarine sank in the Barents Sea in 2000 aftera torpedo exploded during an exercise, killing all 118 on board, including 23 who survived the blast but died due to a lack of oxygen TheUSS Scorpionsank in the Atlantic in 1968, possibly because a torpedo exploded, killing the 99 crew TheUSS Threshersank during diving tests in 1963, killing all 129 on board - the biggest submarine death toll in history Antarctic tribute to lost submarine crew Argentina ends missing sub rescue mission Water led to missing sub's battery failure Who are the crew of missing Argentine submarine?

Carlisle Street and part of Hinckley Road have been closed and people are being asked to avoid the area. Electricity has been cut off for a number of properties. Emergency services remain at the scene and Leicestershire Police said the ""search and rescue operation"" would continue throughout Monday. Crews are searching through debris strewn across Hinckley Road Angel Namaala lives opposite the shop and told the BBC she heard ""this big thud, like an earthquake"". She said: ""The building had gone down and people were trying to help where they could by taking the bricks off. But the fire was getting bigger and bigger so people were told to leave the scene."" She said she and others helped a boy, believed to be aged about 15, who was hurt in the blast. ""He was in there when it happened. I think he was in the flat above the shop. We were keeping him warm and assuring him he'd be OK and the ambulance would be there,"" she added. ""Someone was with him already bringing him to the road so I stopped and gave him my coat. And other neighbours gave him blankets to cover himself."" Police said neighbouring buildings in Hinckley Road were damaged as a result of the blast Six fire engines were sent to the scene and a fire service spokeswoman said the property was a two-floor building with a loft conversion that had suffered a ""pancake collapse"". Leicestershire Police said: ""The cause of the explosion will be the subject of a joint investigation by the police and Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service."" Allow Twitter content?

All of the casualties have been taken to Leicester Royal Infirmary and people have been asked not to attend A&E unless ""absolutely necessary"". Witnesses said the shop was formerly a Londis but recently became a Polish supermarket. Looking down Hinckley Road, past the cordon, there's a smoking gap where the shop once stood. It exploded with such force that glass and debris were scattered across all four lanes of the dual carriageway. It's a few hours since the blast, but the air is still thick with smoke. Earlier, dozens of onlookers gathered - many with scarves over their mouths, or jumpers pulled up, to avoid breathing in fumes. Witnesses said the destroyed shop had flats above it, and at least one of those injured is thought to have been a resident. BBC journalist John Alexander said the emergency services had cordoned off about 60 houses in the area. ""I live about 80 yards away from where it happened,"" he said. ""I felt a tremor, what felt like an earthquake shock and I heard a very low boom that sounded like a very, very fast release of pressure. ""I thought my house was going to fall down on top of me and all my neighbours have said the same thing."" The fire service said its teams are working in ""tough conditions"" Harish Pattni was in a pizza shop six doors down when the explosion happened. He said: ""I've never experienced anything like this. It sounded like those big, loud boom speakers that people have in their cars, real vibration. The bass sound was so loud that it shattered the car windows. ""The flames started more or less upstairs so I thought it must be something to do with upstairs, the flats. ""My immediate worry was when I saw the floorboards, all the wood on the floor level, I thought there must be people in the shop trapped."" Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn speaks to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg about his Brexit plans Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has backed the UK being in a permanent customs union with the EU in a speech setting out his approach to Brexit. He said this would avoid the need for a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland and ensure free-flowing trade for business. The policy shift could lead to Labour siding with Tory rebels to defeat Theresa May on her Brexit strategy. But a customs union after Brexit would be a ""complete sell out"", International Trade Secretary Liam Fox will argue. Mr Corbyn insisted in an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg that his speech was a ""firming up"" of Labour's existing policy, which was to back customs union membership during the planned two-year transition period after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. Key quotes: And what he meant Read Laura Kuenssberg's analysis Brexit: All you need to know This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Brexit is what we make of it In his speech, at Coventry University, Mr Corbyn said Labour would be ""looking for a Brexit that puts the working people first"". In a shift from the party's policy at last year's general election, he said the UK should strike a new customs deal with the EU at the end of transition. ""Labour would seek a final deal that gives full access to European markets and maintains the benefits of the single market and the customs union,"" he said. ""We have long argued that a customs union is a viable option for the final deal. ""So Labour would seek to negotiate a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union to ensure that there are no tariffs with Europe and to help avoid any need for a hard border in Northern Ireland."" Theresa May held key Brexit strategy talks at Chequers last week The prime minister has insisted the UK will leave both the single market and the customs union, allowing it to negotiate its own post-Brexit trade deals. Mrs May will give details in a speech on Friday of how her plan for a ""managed diversion"" from the EU will work in practice, after first briefing the cabinet. The Conservatives accused Mr Corbyn of ""betraying millions of Labour voters"" who had backed Brexit. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn has revealed a 'big' Brexit difference with Theresa May, the BBC's Chris Morris says. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said Labour's ""confused policy would be bad for jobs and wages"". And in a speech on Tuesday, he will say the UK would find itself in a ""worse position"" than it is now if it leaves the existing customs union but negotiates a similar arrangement. A customs union allows free-flowing trade between member nations without making companies pay export taxes, or tariffs, at the border. However, the members normally have joint trade agreements with countries not in their customs union. A single market is a deeper form of co-operation, which effectively merges the economies of member states together, allowing the free movement of goods, services, money and people as if they were part of a single country. What's the difference between single market and customs union? Mr Corbyn rejected calls from pro-EU figures like Lord Mandelson and a number of his own backbenchers to commit to staying in the EU single market, saying instead that he wanted a ""close relationship"" with it. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer has not ruled out continuing with free movement of people between the UK and the EU in some form after Brexit, under Labour's plans, but he told BBC News it would have to be negotiated - as would any financial contribution the UK would make. He said the UK could work ""jointly"" with the EU after Brexit to strike trade deals with other nations - something the government insists is not possible. Analysis By BBC political correspondent Ian Watson So the dividing lines are clear politically - if less clear in practice. Clear politically, because the government is committed to coming out of the customs union. And in contrast Labour now says it wants to negotiate ""a new comprehensive customs union"" with the EU. That puts clear blue water between opposition and government - and may signal to Remain voters that Labour wants a 'softer' Brexit, staying closer to the EU. But in practice, there may be fewer differences than meets the eye.  Jeremy Corbyn wants a customs union that would still give the UK a say in EU-led trade deals - which the EU may resist. And Theresa May has spoken of a new ""customs arrangement,"" which would, er, allow independent trade deals.  But it's currently in the government and opposition's political interests to emphasise the differences,  not the similarities. Jeremy Corbyn refused to be drawn on whether his policy shift was an attempt to remove Theresa May from office and force a general election. Tory rebels have been tight-lipped about whether they would vote against Mrs May if it came down to a confidence vote in her premiership, saying that was unlikely to happen. But Labour MP Frank Field, who backed Leave and said Mr Corbyn was once more Eurosceptic than him, told the BBC that being in a customs union or the single market would be a ""deceit"" and dismissed suggestions Tory rebels could join with Labour to defeat the government as ""fairy tales"" and they would win any vote by a large majority. Labour's customs union policy 'evolves' Hunt rules out staying in customs union The customs union explained in 45 seconds - BBC News Mr Corbyn was an opponent of the EU when he was a backbench Labour MP, as he explained in his speech. ""I have long opposed the embedding of free market orthodoxy and the democratic deficit in the European Union, and that is why I campaigned to 'remain and reform' in the referendum campaign."" He said scepticism was ""healthy"" but ""often the term 'Eurosceptic' in reality became synonymous with 'anti-European' and I am not anti-European at all, I want to see close and progressive cooperation with the whole of Europe after Brexit"". He said this ""new relationship"" he wanted to negotiate with the EU would ensure Labour could deliver on its plans to nationalise public utilities, invest in industry and curb the outsourcing of public services. Mr Corbyn's speech was welcomed by Britain's largest trade unions while industry body, the CBI, said staying in a customs union would ""grow trade without accepting freedom of movement or payments to the EU"". Pro-European Labour MPs said he had not gone far enough and urged him to commit to staying in the single market. But former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said it was the ""first step in a complete Labour sell-out"" while the DUP, the party Mrs May relies on to win key votes in the Commons, said it was ""cheap political opportunism"". Liberal Democrats leader Sir Vince Cable tweeted that Mr Corbyn's customs union stance was a ""small step to sanity"", but added: ""In #SingleMarket he is still following @theresa-may cake and eat it policy. Just wants red cherries rather than blue raisins.""

"Sandals lay strewn in the yard of Dapchi's school after the attack The father of a 14-year-old girl who is among 110 believed to have been abducted by Boko Haram has pleaded with the Nigerian government to act quickly. ""We don't want these girls to stay long with those militants. Anything can happen to them,"" Kachalla Bukar told the BBC. Jihadists stormed the school in the town of Dapchi in the north-eastern Yobe state on 19 February. The attack has revived memories of the Chibok schoolgirl abduction in 2014. President Muhammadu Buhari said it was a ""national disaster"" and apologised to the girls' families. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories Six questions about Nigeria's 'new Chibok' Why January is Boko Haram's deadliest month Who are Boko Haram? Mr Bukar says his wife cannot stop crying and he cannot sleep since their ""brilliant"" daughter Aisha disappeared. ""We are begging the government to control the situation quickly."" But even as he begged for action, officials were falling out over the circumstances which led to the kidnapping. On Monday, the Nigerian army released a long statement blasting Yobe State Governor Ibrahim Gaidam, who revealed on Sunday that soldiers had been removed from checkpoints around the town ahead of the kidnapping without his knowledge. Distraught relatives are demanding answers from the Nigerian authorities The army initially denied Mr Gaidam's allegations, but has now admitted they did redeploy soldiers away from Dapchi because they felt it was relatively secure. All the same, it said the governor's comments were ""misleading and misinforming"". According to the statement, it was the job of police to continue to secure the town. Anger has been growing among the girls' parents over the troop pull-out. The army has now deployed extra troops and planes to search for the schoolgirls,half of whom are reported to have been taken across the border to Niger,,externalaccording to the Daily Trust newspaper. ""We want to assure Nigerians that no stone will be left unturned in our determination to rescue these girls,"" Nigeria's Information Minister Lai Mohammed told the BBC. The school is to remain closed for the time being, an official told news agency AFP. Parents had already told the BBC they were not prepared to let their daughters return until better security measures were in place. Dapchi, which is about 275km (170 miles) north-west of Chibok, came under attack last Monday, causing students and teachers from the Government Girls Science and Technical College to flee into the surrounding bush. The secret diaries of the Chibok girls What we know about Chibok kidnappings The fate of the Chibok girls Residents say that Nigeria's security forces, backed by military jets, later repelled the attack. Authorities initially denied the students had been kidnapped, saying they were hiding from their attackers. But they later admitted that 110 girls were missing after the attack. Parents of the missing girls check student lists in Dapchi Boko Haram militants have been fighting a long insurgency in the country's north in their quest for an Islamic state in the region. Nearly four years ago they abducted 276 girls from a school in Chibok, leading to a worldwide #BringBackOurGirls campaign. The location of more than 100 of those girls is still unknown.

"This video can not be played A doctor in Eastern Ghouta says there is still shelling, but ""the level is less than before"" Air strikes by the Syrian government on a rebel-held enclave have continued despite a ceasefire resolution passed by the UN Security Council on Saturday. Hundreds of people have died in a week of bombardment of the Eastern Ghouta enclave near the capital, Damascus. The latest attacks include a ground offensive that began hours after the UN urged a 30-day truce ""without delay"". On Sunday, France and Germany called on Russia to put pressure on the Syrian government to honour the ceasefire. Life in Eastern Ghouta - read residents' stories Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? Why is there a war in Syria? Speaking to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a joint telephone conversation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron have asked for help with implementing the UN resolution. The UN resolution was agreed to allow for aid deliveries and medical evacuations,external, but operations against the biggest jihadist rebel groups are not covered by the truce. The region is the last major rebel-held area near the capital Damascus. Government air strikes took place in the rebel enclave on Sunday - soon after the resolution was agreed in New York, although at far lower level than in previous days. At least three people are reported to have died in the latest attacks, while one rebel group in the Eastern Ghouta said it had killed a number of government soldiers. This video can not be played Rawaa has been living in a basement with around 75 others for months The strikes targeted the outskirts of Douma, the main town in the Eastern Ghouta, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). It also reported several casualties on both sides after Syrian government forces clashed with rebels in southern areas of the enclave. Syrian forces on the ground are pushing to enter the Eastern Ghouta, both opposition and pro-government sources said on Sunday. The government has been trying to advance on several fronts but its forces have so far been repelled, rebel groups say. The ceasefire was urged to allow for the delivery of aid to those in serious need Meanwhile, Iran said that while it would ""adhere"" to the ceasefire, it would continue its military operations in areas around Damascus that were not covered, Reuters news agency reports. ""Parts of the suburbs of Damascus, which are specifically controlled by the terrorists of the Nusra Front and other terrorist groups, are not subject to ceasefire,"" Iran's military chief of staff, Maj Gen Mohammad Baqeri, is quoted as saying. Iran, along with Russia, is a key supporter of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and has played a vital role in enabling him to recapture territory across the country. The Syrian American Medical Society, a relief organisation, told the BBC one of its hospitals in the area had received patients suffering from symptoms that indicated a chemical attack. It said one child had died. Eastern Ghouta resident Mohammed Adel said one of his colleagues had visited the hospital and said the child - a boy - had ""suffocated from the chemical attack"". The SOHR said it had received similar information but had not yet been able to confirm if there had been a gas attack. The reports could not be independently verified. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. However, a UN report last October concluded that the Syrian government was responsible for a deadly chemical attackin the north-western town of Khan Sheikhoun on 4 April 2017 Rebels operating in the Eastern Ghouta include a variety of factions, and infighting between them has led to past losses of ground to the Syrian government. The draft resolution had said that the ceasefire would not apply to operations against the Islamic State (IS) group, al-Qaeda and the Nusra Front. The Nusra Front isa former al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria which leads an alliance of factions under the name of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). This video can not be played ""At least in heaven there's food"": The children caught up in Eastern Ghouta air strikes The Syrian government says its attempts to recapture the Eastern Ghouta are directly due to the HTS presence there. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said the situation in the Eastern Ghouta is like ""hell on Earth"". On Sunday, Pope Francis said the violence was ""inhuman"" and called for an immediate halt to the deadly bombardment to allow access for humanitarian aid. Barrel bombs and shells have been dropped on the area, where some 393,000 people remain trapped. While hundreds of people are said to have been killed in assaults by government forces since last Sunday, rebels firing on Damascus have reportedly killed at least 16 civilians. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied targeting civilians and said it is trying to liberate the Eastern Ghouta from ""terrorists"" - a term it has used to describe both the jihadist militants and the mainstream rebel groups that hold the enclave.

"The North Korean general and Ivanka Trump cheered from the same stand - but are not expected to meet The United States says any dialogue with North Korea must have nuclear disarmament as the end goal. The North indicated on the last day of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang it was ready for talks, according to South Korea. North Korea has previously said it will not accept any preconditions. ""We will see if Pyongyang's message... that it is willing to hold talks, represents the first steps along the path to denuclearization,"" the US said. Reports about the North's willingness to speak to the US emerged after a meeting of its officials with the South Korean president before the Games' closing ceremony on Sunday. North Korea's controversial Olympics delegate North Korea at the Winter Olympics: All you need to know The politics behind the 'peace Olympics' US President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka also attended the ceremony but she is not expected to talk with any North Koreans, even though she sat a few feet from their main envoy, Gen Kim Yong-chol, at the Olympic Stadium. North Korea was ""very willing"" to hold talks with the US, said the office of South Korean President Moon Jae-in. It added that the North had ""agreed that inter-Korea talks and North-US relations should improve together"". The revelation from the South Korean presidency came hours after a furious statement from the North that describedfresh sanctions announced by Washingtonas ""an act of war"". Pyongyang's foreign ministry praised the way the two Koreas had co-operated together during the Olympics but said the US had ""brought the threat of war to the Korean peninsula with large-scale new sanctions"". The Korean peninsula has been divided since the 1950-53 war and the two sides have never signed a peace treaty. The rapprochement between the two Koreas has been seen as a move by the North to drive a wedge between the South and the US. Experts have cautioned that the latest developments do not put an end to underlying regional tensions, particularly following last year's nuclear and missile tests carried out by the North. South Korean media is abuzz with suggestions that North-US talks could still take place while the respective delegations are in town. The BBC's Laura Bicker, in Pyeongchang, asked an official from South's government if the meeting could take place in the next two days, and the answer was: ""We will see."" Mike Pence was seated directly in front of the North Korean delegation at the opening ceremony North Korea has sent an eight-person team across the border, including Gen Kim Choe Kang-il, a senior diplomat handling North American affairs. Meanwhile, Allison Hooker - a Koreas specialist from the US National Security Council - is part of the US delegation. She met Gen Kim in 2014 in North Korea, as the US tried to free two American detainees. The scene could be set for a more low-key meeting than a failed attempt with US Vice-President Mike Pence. He had been set to meet Kim Yo-jong, the sister of North Korean President Kim Jong-un, at the start of the Games but the meeting was cancelled inexplicably by the North Koreans, according to the US officials.

"Manchester City have won the League Cup for a fifth time - only Liverpool have won it more often Pep Guardiola secured his first trophy as Manchester City manager as they overpowered Arsenal to win the Carabao Cup in convincing fashion at Wembley. City responded to Monday's shock FA Cup fifth-round defeat by League One Wigan Athletic in style as they swept aside Arsenal and now turn their attention to clinching the Premier League and continuing their Champions League campaign. Sergio Aguero gave City an 18th-minute lead when he took full advantage of Arsenal defender Shkodran Mustafi's feeble challenge to latch on to keeper Claudio Bravo's goal-kick and loft a cool finish over David Ospina. Arsenal were toothless apart from one early opening when Kyle Walker stopped Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the six-yard area and the contest was effectively over when man-of-the-match Vincent Kompany swept in Ilkay Gundogan's cross-shot just before the hour. David Silva put the final flourish on City and Guardiola's day with a powerful shot past Ospina before City closed out the most routine of victories. There was one contentious note which may draw further attention from the Football Association as Guardiola wore his trademark yellow ribbon, which he displays in support of imprisoned politicians in his native Catalonia, despitefacing a charge from English football's governing bodyfor ""wearing a political message"". Analysis: 'Guardiola is visionary Wenger once was' Reaction: Wenger's focus fears after City cup win Reaction to Manchester City's Carabao Cup final victory City manager Guardiola demonstrated his faith in the ability and influence of captain Kompany on his side when he was selected ahead of Â£47.5m John Stones at Wembley. The 31-year-old Belgian centre-back was the mainstay and leader of the Manchester City side who claimed Premier League titles under Roberto Mancini and Manuel Pellegrini in 2012 and 2014 - but has waged a relentless battle against injuries in recent seasons. In 2015-16, Kompany figured in only 22 of City's 59 games while in the following campaign he was involved in just 15 out of 56 - that is just 26.8%. This term he has played in 13 out of 43 games but chose the Wembley stage to demonstrate exactly what he can still mean to Guardiola and City. Kompany was at his imperious best, matching Aubameyang in a first-half race before brushing the Arsenal striker aside to snuff out a rare moment of danger. And he was at the heart of the attacking action as City moved through the gears to exert complete control in the second half, seeing one shot deflected inches wide before reacting first to Gundogan's shot to turn in the crucial second. Kompany celebrated like a man who has known the long, lonely hours searching for full fitness and was enjoying a moment of sweet elation. He led from the back and at the front in a consummate performance. Sergio Aguero (centre) and David Silva (right) have been at City since 2011 and 2010 respectively This was the sort of day Manchester City's owners had in mind when they finally brought Guardiola to Etihad Stadium in the summer of 2016 - watching their side dominating at Wembley to secure his first trophy in England. And while the 47-year-old has brought impetus, ideas and fresh young faces to City in the shape of forwards Leroy Sane and Gabriel Jesus, he has been careful to maintain and nurture the experienced heart of the side that brought the club's years in the wilderness to an end. As well as Kompany, this EFL Cup victory was shaped by the predatory instincts of Aguero, still a world-class striker at 29. The Argentine set City on their way with his usual expertise as he took full advantage of flimsy defending from Arsenal's Mustafi. And it was another member of the old guard, 32-year-old Silva, who provided his usual range of subtlety and creation in midfield, completing the win with a thumping finish across Ospina. Guardiola's first silverware in England ushers in the new era for City - but he has wisely retained the battle-hardened core of the club's previous successes. Arsenal were shambolic for the opening goal and not much better after that If one moment summed up Arsenal's performance, it was the dismal manner in which Mustafi was left appealing limply for a foul after failing to deal with a routine long goal-kick from Bravo, a light-as-a-feather touch from Aguero paving the way for him to beat the onrushing Ospina. Arsenal, quite simply, were overpowered with no answer to City's quality once a lacklustre first 45 minutes gave way to a second half in which Guardiola's side camped out in Gunners territory. Lightweight, loose in possession and defensively weak, Arsenal were no match for City. When the final whistle blew, the portion of Wembley where Arsenal's fans were housed was virtually deserted, many taking Silva's third goal as the signal to head for the exits and beat the rush home. Few could blame them as this was a painful experience. This was a chastening afternoon for Wenger as another trophy hope was ended - faced with the cold, hard reality that Arsenal look light years behind this burgeoning, developing Manchester City. 5 live Football Daily: 'Arsenal were also-rans in two-horse race' Vincent Kompany has been at Manchester City for almost 10 years, winning two Premier League titles, one FA Cup and three League Cups Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola:""The first half was not good - too many mistakes with simple passes - but the second half we played with more courage, more personality. That is why we were outstanding after the break. ""It was so important we won this after going out of the FA Cup. Now we have to focus absolutely on the Premier League and trying to win the games we need to win the title and try and progress to the Champions League quarter-final. ""This win is not for me, it's for Manchester City."" Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger:""When you lose a game like that everything is questioned. This video can not be played Wenger responds to criticism after League Cup final defeat ""But we played against a good side, you cannot say that we played against an average side. They dominate the Premier League and they have good players. It is difficult to come back."" Manchester City's 3-0 win over Arsenal is their biggest ever cup final victory, as well as the Gunners' biggest ever loss in a cup final. Manchester City have won the League Cup for a fifth time - only Liverpool (eight) have won it more often. Arsenal have lost six of their eight League Cup finals, including each of their last three. The Gunners are the first side to lose in three successive appearances in the League Cup final (2007, 2011 and 2018). City are one of four sides to lift the trophy on four successive League Cup final visits (Aston Villa, Liverpool and Manchester United). No manager has lost more League Cup finals than Arsene Wenger (in 2007, 2011 and 2018), level with Sir Alex Ferguson, who also won the trophy four times. Pep Guardiola has triumphed in seven of his previous eight major domestic and European finals, losing only to Real Madrid with Barcelona in the 2011 Copa del Rey final. Sergio Aguero has scored in each of his last five games against Arsenal. He has scored 15 goals in 13 appearances in 2018 - more than any other player in the top five European leagues. This was the biggest win by a Premier League team against another in a League Cup final since 2006 (Manchester United 4-0 Wigan), and biggest in a League Cup final at Wembley since 1996 (Aston Villa 3-0 Leeds). Both sides meet again in the Premier League on Thursday at Emirates Stadium (19:45 GMT). City then host Chelsea on Sunday (16:00), with Arsenal at Brighton earlier in the day (13:30).

" The phone rings. Shelley knows who it is before she answers it. Embarrassed, she leaves her desk and walks into the kitchen so that none of her colleagues can hear. “You need to come and get him. We can't control him, you have to come now,” says an all-too-familiar voice. It's March 2017 and  Shelley's eight-year-old son Cruz has been playing up at school - again. He's only in Year 3 but his behaviour has been a problem for years. Cruz and Shelley Shelley first raised concerns with the school when he was in reception but as time has gone by, his refusal to play by the rules has become increasingly serious. It is infringing on his and his classmates' ability to learn - and the school is taking action. This time, the voice at the other end of the phone explains, his behaviour is putting himself in danger. No more details are given about the nature of Cruz's latest misdemeanour. Shelley doesn't ask. She doesn't need to. The phone calls have become a regular occurrence, practically every other week, with other behavioural issues in between. “He's smashed up the classroom… he's hiding under the desk... he's ripped up someone's work,” she's been told before. On one occasion, the school had to be evacuated. This time, she is told on arrival, Cruz tried to leave the school grounds by climbing over the main gate. Shelley apologises profusely to staff - as she has done on many occasions. But this time feels different. She knows Cruz is running low on chances. She has been told before that the school will consider permanent exclusion. She needs to find a solution, but doesn't know where to turn. It's a Monday afternoon at Hawkswood Primary Pupil Referral Unit in north London, and five children sit behind their desks, eyes on the teacher. “Why do we think Jo was kicked out of school?” asks deputy head teacher Leah Mwaniki, in a class designed to help pupils understand how to control their behaviour. Kyan puts his hand up. “Because she was naughty,” he says. Kyan has been in the pupil referral unit (PRU) for more than a month, having been referred by his school. He was at risk of exclusion because of his violent behaviour and angry outbursts. “Do we say ‘naughty’?” Mwaniki asks rhetorically, looking for a different answer. Teachers are careful not to label their pupils. Kyan tries again. “[She made] the wrong choices,” he says, this time getting the answer spot on. “We teach the children that they have a choice when they feel frustrated,” explains head teacher Marie Gentles after the class. Marie Gentles “They have a choice when they feel anxious or angry, and we teach them they're in control of those choices.” Hawkswood specialises in caring for children like Kyan, who have been - or are on the verge of being - permanently excluded from their mainstream school. With small class sizes - usually with up to eight children in each - it focuses on pupils' emotional wellbeing, background and behavioural difficulties, and prepares them to go back into mainstream education. “Some children have come from a background of some form of abuse but not all children have, and I think that's important to stress,” Gentles says. “Most parents are working, trying really hard to provide for their children. But somewhere along the line something's gone slightly wrong.” Like other pupil referral units across the UK, the school follows the national curriculum. Pupils stay for at least 20 weeks before returning to mainstream education, but only once they are judged to be ready. It is home to 40 pupils, all of primary school age, though pupil referral units catering for secondary school pupils also exist. Such schools have become increasingly important in recent years. The Victoria Derbyshire programme has discovered that the number of children educated in primary-age PRUs has risen 34% in recent years - from 3,181 in 2013-14 to 4,261 in 2016-17. But there is still a stigma attached to them. “Parents can be very, very resistant,” says Gentles. “They think there's going to be children fighting in the corridors. And they walk in and it's really calm.” When the idea of sending Cruz to a pupil referral unit was first mentioned to Shelley by her son's “early help team”, she admits she scoffed at the idea. “I said, ‘No, that's where all the weird kids go, the outcasts,’” she says. But desperate for change and worried that a permanent exclusion was imminent, she decided to contact Hawkswood herself. “As soon as I walked through the door I thought, ‘He has to come here. This is what he needs,’” she says. “The staff understood me. They got me. They said, ‘He's misunderstood, and we need to get to the bottom of it.’” Shelley wipes away tears as she speaks, recalling that moment. “The reason I'm getting emotional is because of the way they wanted to help me. “No-one had listened. My family were giving up hope, and the school gave me that hope back.” Throughout Cruz's childhood, Shelley's parenting had been scrutinised by her own family who thought she could manage him better. “They would be thinking that I'm behaving like a weak parent,” she says. “They'd say, ‘He needs to be disciplined, he needs to be told. Do this with him, do that.’ “But normal discipline procedures were not working with him. It's not that I wasn't trying to be strict.” It reached the stage where Shelley decided to quit her job to focus on Cruz, despite the financial strain it would cause. At times, Shelley says, it was only the knowledge that she had three other well-behaved children that stopped her from questioning her judgement as a parent. Cruz does not see his father but Shelley is keen to stress that he comes from a “very stable, loving family”, and that his father's absence is not the root cause of his behaviour. “Cruz showed signs of this behaviour even when I was with his dad, from when he was in nursery,” she says. Shelley with Cruz as a baby “When he was a toddler, he showed signs of being problematic. “He did not like to conform. He was rebellious, he had a temper. He didn't like being told what to do.” As he grew older, Cruz would frequently cause fights with his brothers and sisters. Cruz with his brother and sister He was also violent in class, although it is not something he wants to talk about. Asked to describe his behaviour at the time, Cruz pauses to reflect on how best to answer. “I called out in class. Everybody did,” he says sheepishly, his body language closed off. Shelley, though, knows the extent of the problem all too well - and the effects it had on her son's relationships with others. “Cruz wasn't making friends. Any child that tried to get close, Cruz would bully, push away. They couldn't find common ground. “Then you worry that if he's not able to make friends, not able to fit in in a class environment, how's he going to fit into the big wide world? “I love him, but I want everyone else to love him. But how could they, with the way he's acting?” Shelley was also concerned about the way he viewed himself. “I remember one time when Cruz had a massive panic attack,” she says. Cruz was just eight years old at the time. “I didn't know how to help him. I couldn't believe it. “Part of me was like, ‘Where's he getting this from. Has he seen a film? Is he making it up?’ But it was heartfelt. He meant it. “He was in a really dark place, and he expressed it by not wanting to be around any more. He thought no-one loved him. “Even though he was showered with love and care, he didn't feel it.” As Cruz entered Hawkswood for the first time, she could only hope it would make a difference. It's an English lesson, and four of Hawkswood's youngest pupils are sitting cross-legged on a rug in the centre of a busy, brightly coloured room. The walls are adorned with the children's artwork, storage baskets full of cuddly toys hang from the ceiling and a rail of dressing-up clothes sits by the door. The pupils are reading from a picture book with the teacher but one child has been separated from the group. Anni is just five years old but she has already been permanently excluded from her mainstream school. She is having to be held down on her chair by deputy head teacher Kate Milligan while her colleague continues reading with the others. But Anni is pushing boundaries. She spits at Milligan's face. Anni spits at Kate Milligan A verbal warning is given but she continues, leading Milligan to use a restraint technique known in the school as “safe holding”. Used as a last resort, it can take many forms. It involves a teacher applying pressure, often to the child's shoulders, to stop their movement. In some cases it can involve the adult standing behind the child and placing their arms across them, with their right palm on the child's left shoulder, and their left palm on the child's right shoulder, effectively prohibiting them from moving. It is designed to protect the children for their own safety and the safety of others - something that is explained to them. Staff are regularly trained on its use. In this instance, Milligan places her palm on the left hand side of Anni's face to stop her spitting in the teacher's direction. “This behaviour is not acceptable and we won't be having that tomorrow,” she tells the five-year-old calmly but authoritatively. Anni screams and continues to spit on the hand of Milligan - who calmly asks for another teacher to join her. She arrives and sits on the opposite side of Anni, placing her palm on the right-hand-side of the child's face, ensuring she can only look forward. As they do this, they emphasise how Anni has the choice to behave well. “Until this afternoon, this little blip, she has been such a superstar,” says Milligan. “She had the best morning.” Anni begins to calm down, and after just two minutes reaches the point where Milligan is confident the restraint technique is no longer needed. “I'm taking my hand away,” she says, “because I know you can control your spitting.” It works, and as Milligan leads her back to class, Anni holds her hand. The restraint technique is just one of many methods teachers employ. Another is diversion - trying to change the subject away from a child's misbehaviour - which often proves successful. The school also finds that with all its children, improving their verbal communication skills is vital. Hawkswood employs a language therapist to help with this. “A lot of our children here aren't able to find the words to express themselves when they first come here, which is why they do it via their behaviour,” explains head teacher Marie Gentles. The behaviour of some of the pupils not only vastly improves while at Hawkswood, she says, but they also learn how to communicate with their peers back in mainstream school. This allows them to form and maintain friendships, often for the first time. Another key tool is being “utterly consistent” across the board with pupils, forming “firm but fair boundaries” to help them understand what is acceptable behaviour and what merits praise and recognition. Kate Milligan Humour also works well, she adds. “They need to see [teachers] and understand you on a human level - and not just see you as an authority figure within the school.” While most children attending Hawkswood have a background of violent behaviour, the school understands that they must take a bespoke approach to helping each child. For Cruz, discipline techniques were important to keep his actions in check. But for his long-term growth, the building of his relationship with Milligan was perhaps the key to his progression. “I absolutely adored him,” the deputy head and Key Stage 2 teacher says. “You could tell he had an amazing mum and family. “He's incredibly bright but the bad behaviour had overshadowed everything.” Milligan says her biggest success in working with Cruz was creating a connection with him that allowed him to feel comfortable enough to open up. “The children really emotionally invest with you, and so you have to reciprocate that. “Before he was reserved in some scenarios but he came out of his shell.” During his time at Hawkswood, Cruz told Milligan about having suicidal thoughts. “I addressed the subject and at first he denied it,” she says. “But then when comfortable and ready he said, ‘Nobody wants me any more.’ “We talked for hours about how important he was. “I encouraged the three of us [Cruz, Shelley and Milligan] to talk, so he could see how desperate his mum was to help. “It has given him ways of coping with such thoughts.” Over time, she says, Cruz began to show his “witty, charismatic” side. “He has a gift for art, he has a gift for sports. No-one had seen that before. “His mum knew it was there but even she hadn't seen it for a long time. “The other children loved him, too.” And it wasn't just Cruz who developed with Milligan's help. Shelley did too. At the end of the school day at Hawkswood, parents and teachers chat and even laugh together as the classes file out one by one, in perfect lines. This easy relationship between the adults is one that is seen at school gates across the UK, but for many parents at Hawkswood, it may be an entirely new experience. At Cruz's mainstream school, while other parents discussed their child's progress and activities in and out of class, Shelley felt unable to contribute. “I couldn't really talk about fun, extra-curricular stuff with other parents because he wouldn't take part in any clubs or outside activities, or enjoy himself at parties. “Because he wasn't engaging in the classroom either, I couldn't relate to any of the work that they were doing,” she says. With Cruz not having any close friends, there was no easy route to meeting other parents. Instead she felt alone, unable to share the realities of the daily power struggle and sleepless nights spent worrying about her son's future. There was also another strand to the emotional problems. Shelley was ashamed. “Why was my child the one at school that was ruining the class and misbehaving?” she remembers asking herself. “Other people made me feel I must be doing something wrong.” It was a feeling that intensified when Cruz's bad behaviour spiked. “I did feel shame because there were incidents where Cruz was hitting other children at school, or maybe breaking their pencil, or ripping up some work. “I felt that parents would be looking at me when I was taking him to school. You know, ‘That's the one. It was Cruz, Cruz did it.’ “There was once where one of the dads at school was kind of making a beeline for me, because he wanted to express how angry he was that Cruz was disrupting the class. “And the funny thing is, I wanted to have that conversation because I wanted somebody to talk to me about it. “I wanted to say, ‘I'm with you, I understand, if someone was doing what Cruz was doing to my kid I would feel the same’. “But no-one ever wanted to, because no-one wanted their child to really hang out with him. So why would they need to get to know me?” Hawkswood, in contrast, presented an outlet for Shelley. Milligan told Shelley to come to her for advice when she was having a down day. “I knew Shelley needed mental health support as much as Cruz,” Milligan says, reflecting on the first time she met her. Milligan says it is common for parents to feel guilt and shame - believing they could have been a better parent. “How on earth do you cope when no-one else likes your child?” Now, the improvements in Cruz and Shelley's relationship since he first arrived at Hawkswood reflect Milligan's efforts and dedication. “He is able to show me more affection,” says Shelley. That in itself has been enough to restore Shelley's confidence as a parent. But for many families with a child on the brink of exclusion, it is a postcode lottery as to whether a pupil referral unit is available. Government figures show that in 2016-17 there were 6,685 reported permanent exclusions in England across primary and secondary education. But the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank says that the real figure for pupils being educated in schools for excluded pupils - including PRUs and other provision - is far higher. In October 2017, it said that in the last year it had estimated that some 48,000 – one in every 200 pupils in England – had been placed in alternative provision. Nationwide across England, the number of primary age children educated in PRUs has risen. The Victoria Derbyshire programme's Freedom of Information request to all 150 local authorities in England, of which 130 responded, has shown that in some areas - such as Stockport and North Yorkshire - there were no primary-age pupil referral units in 2016-17. There are fears that in some areas, mainstream schools are referring children to PRUs simply to “get rid” of pupils causing disruption, without first exploring all avenues to managing their behaviour. Many local areas have a fair access panel, in which head teachers and other leading educational figures decide whether a child should be placed in a PRU, or whether the school must first try other approaches. But one man who has been running a pupil referral unit in a city in England told us in his area the panel “just fell apart, because [mainstream heads] were all a bit too parochial, looking after their own schools”. The man - whom we will call Robert - says his PRU became vastly oversubscribed, which he says restricted its ability to work with children in small groups, as originally designed. “They were coming out [of mainstream school to join the PRU] at a rate of just over one a day,” he explains. Funding for pupils also differs between local authorities - from £4,000 per pupil per month in Kirklees to £565 per month in Nottinghamshire. In addition, £10,000 of government funding is also made available per pupil. This total spend is far greater than the £4,900 per year the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates is spent on the average primary school pupil in England. But at Hawkswood - whose local authority Waltham Forest spends £1,473 each month per pupil - teachers firmly believe that giving every child an opportunity to succeed is worth the cost. Many experts believe that early intervention is also key in preventing problems further down the line - such as in secondary school, when academic pressures mount. For Cruz, it certainly made a difference. Cruz stands in a gown and mortarboard clutching his scroll, smiling as he poses for the camera. It is 20 weeks since Cruz first walked into the pupil referral unit and his behaviour has improved to the extent that he is now ready to go back into mainstream schooling. The graduation ceremony laid on by Hawkswood is a symbol of that, showcasing the great work he has done during his time at the school. Milligan makes a speech about the progress Cruz has made. “It was brilliant, it was lovely,” says Shelley, remembering the sense of pride both she and her son felt that day. She believes at the heart of Cruz's progression was his growth in self-confidence. “They just started to believe in him. Then he started to believe in himself. “He had never taken part in any sporting activity in his mainstream school,” she continues, giving just one example of how he has changed. “But at Hawkswood they grabbed hold of him and said, ‘You can do it. You are a good footballer.’ Suddenly Cruz became involved in football, he started to want to be involved in sports.” “He took part in Waltham Forest cross country, where he ran for his school in the borough. They made him believe he could do it.” The effects of Hawkswood are still evident now in February, with Cruz having been back in mainstream school for a month. Cruz agrees. “It was good, it was really good,” he says in a quiet, reflective manner. Speaking in the family kitchen in between chats about his favourite Arsenal players and WWE wrestlers, his calm, happy persona is unrecognisable from how Shelley describes her son before his time at the PRU. “I liked everything about Hawkswood,” he says, revealing how his favourite lesson was cookery class. “We made Christmas dinner, ice cream, dinners with chicken.” “We just 100% feel so much more positive about the future,” Shelley explains. Cruz's behaviour is not perfect - he still has blips - but there is a marked improvement. “He is much more able to control himself. He is able to apologise, reflect on what he's done,” says Shelley. “He's still working hard at his behaviour but he's learned to accept responsibility.” Milligan adds that his self-esteem is much improved. “The way he holds himself around peers has really changed. He has built his confidence, and realises, ‘I'm worth being somebody's friend,’” she says. Shelley has not received a single phone call asking her to pick Cruz up from school since he returned to mainstream education. She is still in regular contact with the teachers but has now learned to take a different approach to managing his behaviour. “My attitude with the school before was, ‘I'm so sorry, sorry for his behaviour.’ “Now, I say, ‘Let's work together, let's help him.’” Shelley also knows that Hawkswood will be there to support her and Cruz if there are any lapses in his behaviour. “They've left the door open. So any problems for him or me, they'll get involved, which makes me feel confident,” she says. Hawkswood Centre Shelley hopes that by sharing her story it will improve awareness of pupil referral units and help to dispel the stigma that surrounds them. “I definitely had a negative opinion of the children who would go to a place like that. “But when you experience a child in your family who needs that kind of intervention, you change your whole perception of what it's all about.” It will require continued determination but Cruz and Shelley can now look ahead with far greater optimism. “I'm going to be an inventor,” says Cruz as he envisions his life as a grown-up. “I'm going to make stairs so that when you fall down them you won't get hurt.” Built with Shorthand",Negative,0.01768219
"A British skier has fallen to his death in the French Alps, authorities have confirmed. The man - part of a trio who went off-piste in the Alpe d'Huez ski resort - fell from what a mountain rescue spokesperson described as a cliff. A second skier who fell was injured in the ""steep and icy"" conditions, but survived. The third was unharmed and both men were rescued. The Foreign Office said it was giving support to the dead man's family. In a statement confirming the death, it added: ""We remain in close contact with local authorities. Our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time."" Francois Bepol, a spokesperson at the gendarme mountain rescue unit in Grenoble, said the trio got into difficulty after going the wrong way and taking off their skis in an attempt to climb upwards. The accidentfollows the death of 12-year-old French boywho also died after falling from a cliff in the French Alps on Saturday, while his 10-year-old brother survived.

"Business minister Claire Perry said the cap should be in place by the end of 2018 New legislation to free people from ""rip off"" energy tariffs should be operating next winter, a move which would protect 11 million customers. The law will allow energy regulator Ofgem to limit how much companies can charge customers for their standard variable tariffs. The government is under pressure to ensure that the measure is ready for the next cold spell. Trade body Energy UK said it was vital the cap did not stifle competition. The government said the Domestic Gas and Electricity Bill,external, which is being introduced to Parliament on Monday, should be implemented by Ofgem ""as soon as possible so that customers get the protection they need by the end of this year"". Rachel Reeves, who chairs the Business Committee in the Commons, said: ""Energy consumers have been overcharged for too long and the government now needs to quickly ensure this legislation is passed in time to protect customers next winter."" The law will limit the cost of firm's standard default tariffs until 2020. Following that, the cap may be extended on an annual basis until 2023. One million households who get the Warm Home Discount saw an energy price cap introduced in February - an extension ofthe cap already in place for prepayment meter customers. This will also apply to another two million vulnerable households next winter. When customers' fixed-term deals end they usually automatically move to this tariff, which applies to 11 million households. Ofgem says the price difference between the average standard variable tariff default deal and the cheapest rate in the market was Â£308 at the last count in December. It is moving to introduce legislation to cap these variable tariffs, overseen by Ofgem. This will not take effect until the law is passed. The government wants it done by the end of the year at least. Some suppliers are moving towards abandoning variable tariffs. Ofgem has also changed the rules to allow suppliers to default customers on to another fixed deal. Customers are still likely to be better off by searching and switching themselves. Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""It's often older people or those on low incomes who are stuck on rip-off energy tariffs, so today we are introducing legislation to force energy companies to change their ways."" The move is an admission that encouraging consumers to regularly switch providers to pay less has not been as successful as hoped. About a third of households are charged a variable price for their energy at a default rate set by their energy company, because they have not chosen to shop around for a cheaper fixed-price deal. Price cap on energy bills 'urgently needed' British Gas scraps standard tariff for new customers How many people will the cap on energy prices help? The Department for Business Energy and the Industrial Sector said that the energy market was not working and that domestic customers of the ""Big Six"" energy companies were paying on average Â£1.4bn a year more than they would in a truly competitive market. ""We're going to give powers to Ofgem to make this energy market work for everybody by winter 2018, to set a maximum absolute cap [to be] paid by customers on standard variable and default tariffs, the tariffs that the majority of households are on and sometimes don't even know it,"" the Energy and Clean Growth Minister, Claire Perry, told the BBC's Today programme. The Business Department says the average annual savings between standard tariffs and fixed rate deals could be up to Â£300. The changes are separate from Ofgem's safeguard tariff, which is already helping some five million vulnerable customers pay lower prices. The key decision over what level the new cap will be set at will be made by Ofgem. Energy UK, which represents the major suppliers, said it was important that the price cap reflected costs - most of which were outside their control, such as distribution costs and the wholesale cost of energy. Lawrence Slade, chief executive of the industry body, said energy providers were concerned a cap would damage investment and competition. ""The risk of unintended consequences around caps is serious. What we have to do is, working with Ofgem and the government, is make sure the cap has sufficient headroom to allow competition to continue,"" he told the BBC. Last weekCentrica, which owns British Gas, said it was cutting around 4,000 jobs worldwide, over half of them in the UK. The firm said the prospect of an energy price cap was part of the reason for the lay-offs. British Gas,  E.On and Scottish Power have all made moves to abolish standard variable tariffs, although customers who do not opt for a fixed-price rate will still be moved onto a default tariff. Ms Perry said the legislation would still apply to companies that ""try to game the cap"".

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn speaks to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg about his Brexit plans Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has backed the UK being in a permanent customs union with the EU in a speech setting out his approach to Brexit. He said this would avoid the need for a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland and ensure free-flowing trade for business. The policy shift could lead to Labour siding with Tory rebels to defeat Theresa May on her Brexit strategy. But a customs union after Brexit would be a ""complete sell out"", International Trade Secretary Liam Fox will argue. Mr Corbyn insisted in an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg that his speech was a ""firming up"" of Labour's existing policy, which was to back customs union membership during the planned two-year transition period after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. Key quotes: And what he meant Read Laura Kuenssberg's analysis Brexit: All you need to know This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Brexit is what we make of it In his speech, at Coventry University, Mr Corbyn said Labour would be ""looking for a Brexit that puts the working people first"". In a shift from the party's policy at last year's general election, he said the UK should strike a new customs deal with the EU at the end of transition. ""Labour would seek a final deal that gives full access to European markets and maintains the benefits of the single market and the customs union,"" he said. ""We have long argued that a customs union is a viable option for the final deal. ""So Labour would seek to negotiate a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union to ensure that there are no tariffs with Europe and to help avoid any need for a hard border in Northern Ireland."" Theresa May held key Brexit strategy talks at Chequers last week The prime minister has insisted the UK will leave both the single market and the customs union, allowing it to negotiate its own post-Brexit trade deals. Mrs May will give details in a speech on Friday of how her plan for a ""managed diversion"" from the EU will work in practice, after first briefing the cabinet. The Conservatives accused Mr Corbyn of ""betraying millions of Labour voters"" who had backed Brexit. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn has revealed a 'big' Brexit difference with Theresa May, the BBC's Chris Morris says. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said Labour's ""confused policy would be bad for jobs and wages"". And in a speech on Tuesday, he will say the UK would find itself in a ""worse position"" than it is now if it leaves the existing customs union but negotiates a similar arrangement. A customs union allows free-flowing trade between member nations without making companies pay export taxes, or tariffs, at the border. However, the members normally have joint trade agreements with countries not in their customs union. A single market is a deeper form of co-operation, which effectively merges the economies of member states together, allowing the free movement of goods, services, money and people as if they were part of a single country. What's the difference between single market and customs union? Mr Corbyn rejected calls from pro-EU figures like Lord Mandelson and a number of his own backbenchers to commit to staying in the EU single market, saying instead that he wanted a ""close relationship"" with it. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer has not ruled out continuing with free movement of people between the UK and the EU in some form after Brexit, under Labour's plans, but he told BBC News it would have to be negotiated - as would any financial contribution the UK would make. He said the UK could work ""jointly"" with the EU after Brexit to strike trade deals with other nations - something the government insists is not possible. Analysis By BBC political correspondent Ian Watson So the dividing lines are clear politically - if less clear in practice. Clear politically, because the government is committed to coming out of the customs union. And in contrast Labour now says it wants to negotiate ""a new comprehensive customs union"" with the EU. That puts clear blue water between opposition and government - and may signal to Remain voters that Labour wants a 'softer' Brexit, staying closer to the EU. But in practice, there may be fewer differences than meets the eye.  Jeremy Corbyn wants a customs union that would still give the UK a say in EU-led trade deals - which the EU may resist. And Theresa May has spoken of a new ""customs arrangement,"" which would, er, allow independent trade deals.  But it's currently in the government and opposition's political interests to emphasise the differences,  not the similarities. Jeremy Corbyn refused to be drawn on whether his policy shift was an attempt to remove Theresa May from office and force a general election. Tory rebels have been tight-lipped about whether they would vote against Mrs May if it came down to a confidence vote in her premiership, saying that was unlikely to happen. But Labour MP Frank Field, who backed Leave and said Mr Corbyn was once more Eurosceptic than him, told the BBC that being in a customs union or the single market would be a ""deceit"" and dismissed suggestions Tory rebels could join with Labour to defeat the government as ""fairy tales"" and they would win any vote by a large majority. Labour's customs union policy 'evolves' Hunt rules out staying in customs union The customs union explained in 45 seconds - BBC News Mr Corbyn was an opponent of the EU when he was a backbench Labour MP, as he explained in his speech. ""I have long opposed the embedding of free market orthodoxy and the democratic deficit in the European Union, and that is why I campaigned to 'remain and reform' in the referendum campaign."" He said scepticism was ""healthy"" but ""often the term 'Eurosceptic' in reality became synonymous with 'anti-European' and I am not anti-European at all, I want to see close and progressive cooperation with the whole of Europe after Brexit"". He said this ""new relationship"" he wanted to negotiate with the EU would ensure Labour could deliver on its plans to nationalise public utilities, invest in industry and curb the outsourcing of public services. Mr Corbyn's speech was welcomed by Britain's largest trade unions while industry body, the CBI, said staying in a customs union would ""grow trade without accepting freedom of movement or payments to the EU"". Pro-European Labour MPs said he had not gone far enough and urged him to commit to staying in the single market. But former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said it was the ""first step in a complete Labour sell-out"" while the DUP, the party Mrs May relies on to win key votes in the Commons, said it was ""cheap political opportunism"". Liberal Democrats leader Sir Vince Cable tweeted that Mr Corbyn's customs union stance was a ""small step to sanity"", but added: ""In #SingleMarket he is still following @theresa-may cake and eat it policy. Just wants red cherries rather than blue raisins."" Labour customs union shift confirmed Hunt rules out staying in customs union UK will leave customs union, No 10 insists What happens now that a deal's been done?

By Sudha G Tilak, in Delhi The rise of Sridevi is an extraordinary chapter in the nation's film industry. Her acting career began at the tender age of four and by 13 she was cast in the adult role of a complicated woman avenging her lover's death. It was not long before directors took note of her versatile acting abilities and the offers started to snowball. She became a box office magnet from the 1970s to the late 1990s with her numerous films spanning more than five Indian languages. But while Sridevi's screen presence was a glamorous one, her private life was one of heartbreak, loss and estrangement.
