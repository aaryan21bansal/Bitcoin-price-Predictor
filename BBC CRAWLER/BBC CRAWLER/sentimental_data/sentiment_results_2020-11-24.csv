"Dominici played 67 times for France and in recent years had become a familiar figure on TV and radio Tributes have been paid to ""immense"" former France rugby union international Christophe Dominici, who has died aged 48. Dominici was best known for helping France knock New Zealand out of the 1999 Rugby World Cup. A witness saw him climb the roof of a disused building at Saint-Cloud park, near Paris, on Tuesday before falling, officials say. Prosecutors have opened an inquiry into the cause of his death. ""So much sadness. Christophe Dominici was an immense player, an artist. His sudden death is a shock,"" said sports minister Roxana Maracineanu. Dominici played 67 times for his country and won the French championship five times with Stade FranÃ§ais before retiring in 2008. In recent years he had worked as a pundit for French radio and TV. His 1999 World Cup semi-final performance spurred France to a sensational comeback, as he darted down the left of the pitch and seized the ball ahead of two New Zealand defenders to score a try. The All Blacks were leading the game at the time and had the brilliant Jonah Lomu in their line-up. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Dominici quits international game,external His death has stunned the world of rugby. France's rugby federation said the national sport was ""in mourning after the tragic death of our wing Christophe Dominici"". It added: ""We're particularly thinking of his family and loved ones."" A similar message came from the other big rugby union nations. The Welsh Rugby Union said: ""Adieu, Christophe Dominici... what a player."" Allow Twitter content?

Ex-team-mate Vincent Clerc said: ""I came up against him in the past and it was tough. You felt he had this passion to win.""

Earlier this year, Dominici was heavily involved in a bid by a consortium from the United Arab Emirates to take over the financially troubled Beziers rugby club in the south of France. The bid was halted by the sport's financial regulator and Dominici was said by friends to have taken the failure very badly. In a 2009 Le Monde interview, he said: ""[Rugby] let me understand many things - respect for life, people and oneself, along with the values of humility and combat. I was aggressive and put that to collective use. Now I have far more wisdom and maturity.""

"Spoiler alert! After providing much-needed escapism, the Great British Bake Off has made Peter Sawkins, 20, its youngest winner to date. Peter beat fellow finalists Laura Adlington and Dave Friday in Tuesday's finale, which included custard slices, a walnut whirl and dessert towers. Peter, from Edinburgh, said he felt like ""an excited giddy kid"". An average of 9.2 million people watched the final live on Channel 4, according to overnight ratings. That was 2.3 million more than tuned in to last year's final live, and was the show's biggest audience since it moved from BBC One in 2017, Channel 4 said. Bake Off winner's 'absolute dream' victory How has the show changed since series one? Finance student Peter said: ""This is going to be a huge chapter in my life,"" but added he would still finish his degree while continuing to bake. He was nicknamed the ""baby-faced assassin"" by host Noel Fielding, and is the first Scottish winner. ""I hope I have made Scotland proud,"" he said. ""I enjoyed using Scottish flavours and themes when I could throughout the competition."" Host Noel Fielding (left), judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith, and co-host Matt Lucas congratulate Peter (centre) Peter won star baker twice and impressed right from the beginning with his accuracy and polished creations. He went slightly off the boil mid-series, only to come back with a vengeance in the semi-final with his second star baker win, prompting judge Paul Hollywood to exclaim: ""Welcome back!"" Talking about the final challenges set by Paul and fellow judge Prue Leith, Peter said: ""Honestly it was never in my mind that I thought I could win this. ""But I was pleased with my first challenge of a Cranachan custard slice - Prue said it was lovely flaky pastry with good custard and that I had ticked every box."" Hollywood defends Bake Off finalist after trolling Matt Lucas charms critics on Bake Off debut The ganache for his walnut whirl in the technical was described as ""good"" by Paul. Peter went all out for the showstopper challenge with his Bonkers Bake Off bubble cake, which was praised for its flavours. ""Dave, Laura and I were so happy to be in the final together, we were so close and really supported each other,"" said Peter. ""This year particularly all the bakers helped support each other through the journey, from day one.  It's a shame we can't all win."" Peter said he had to hide his trophy in a box in the kitchen He added that hosts Noel and Matt Lucas ""were great to be with in the tent"" . It was Lucas's first series after taking over from Sandi Toksvig ""When Noel called me the baby-faced assassin and said Paul knows that the apprentice takes over from the master - it was quite a funny nickname to be given but I wouldn't expect anything less wacky from Noel.  And I promise you I didn't kill the master at the end of the series."" He revealed that after his win, which happened in August, he had to smuggle his trophy on the plane back to Edinburgh. Once home, it stayed on the family worktop in the kitchen hidden in a box. Prue said of Peter: ""I feel as if he is my grandson"" Judges Prue and Paul said it was the closest final they have had to judge and the hardest decision to make, but it was to be Peter's year. ""Peter should be exceptionally proud,"" said Paul. ""He is the youngest winner we have ever had and the first Scottish winner."" Prue added: ""Do you know I am terribly proud of Peter and I feel as if he is my grandson.  He is such a nice guy and he is so eager to learn, you can't not like him."" Runners-up Dave and Laura congratulated Peter on his success with Dave saying: ""I gave Peter a good run for his money, but he really deserves it. ""I am not at all disappointed, if someone had told me at the beginning that I would be a runner-up, I would take that, all day long."" The Great British Bake Off class of 2020 Laura added: ""I am overjoyed but it's bittersweet that it's all over. I am looking forward to going home, and I am really made up that I got some flowers, to be honest! You genuinely couldn't ask for a better winner, he really does deserve it."" This series the bakers have made everything from battenbergs to biscuits and rainbow bagels to brownies. They faced caged tarts in pastry week, steamed buns in Japanese week, and in 80s week, faced making quiches and ice cream cake in the middle of a heatwave. And like almost everything else, the show's production was shaped by the Covid-19 pandemic. One of the changes was a shortened production period, reduced to about half the usual time. ""Bake Off is normally filmed across 12 or 13 weeks, predominantly at weekends, and that's what the bakers were told would happen at the start,"" producer Kieran Smith said earlier this year. ""But within a month we asked, 'Can you take six weeks off work and come and live in a biosphere?' Everything was complicated, everything was different, but everybody wanted to do it."" The show moved location from Welford Park in Berkshire to a hotel in Essex. Before entering the hotel, everyone involved with the production - including contestants, judges, hosts, crew, staff, and cleaners - were required to self-isolate for nine days and take three Covid-19 tests. Upon arrival, they quarantined at the hotel for 14 days before production began and stayed together in the bubble until filming ended. Follow us onFacebook,externalor on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

A total of 190 deaths were registered in the week ending 13 November,according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).,external This is 24 more than the previous week and account for a quarter of all deaths in Wales. Meanwhile, 19 more deaths have been reported linked to hospital infections at Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board. Deaths reported up to 23 November 66Royal Glamorgan Hospital, Llantrisant 38Prince Charles Hospital, Merthyr Tydfil 67Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend 6Maesteg Hospital There have been 10 more deaths at the Princess of Wales hospital, Bridgend, five at the Royal Glamorgan hospital and four deaths at Prince Charles Hospital in the last week. It takes the total deaths to 177. That includes six deaths at Maesteg hospital reported a few weeks ago. The number of cases linked to the outbreaks has slowed down, rising from 597 to 628. The ONS figures show deaths in care homes involving the virus have also risen to their highest total - 36 - for five months. The proportion of Covid deaths compared to all deaths is higher in Wales than in England in this latest week. There were 56 deaths registered across the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board area, which covers Rhondda Cynon Taf, Bridgend and Merthyr. Of those, 44 were in hospital. There were also 51 deaths in the Aneurin Bevan health board area, across all settings, 29 deaths in Swansea Bay, 27 in Betsi Cadwaladr and 14 in Cardiff and Vale.

RCT has 193.6 deaths per 100,000 people - now the second highest rate across all local authorities in England and Wales. There were 36 deaths in care homes involving Covid-19 - the highest number since 22 May. The total number of Covid deaths in Wales registered by 13 November was 3,240.

So-called 'excess deaths', which compare all registered deaths with previous years, are above the five-year average. Comparing current figures with the number of deaths normally seen at this point in the year is regarded as a useful measure of how the pandemic is progressing.

"Harry Dunn died in a crash outside RAF Croughton last year Harry Dunn's parents have lost their High Court battle against the Foreign Office over whether their son's alleged killer had diplomatic immunity. Mr Dunn, 19, died when his motorbike was in a crash with a car near RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire, in 2019. The suspect, 43-year-old Anne Sacoolas, later left for the United States citing diplomatic immunity. Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said the High Court ruling was ""just a blip along the way"". Mrs Sacoolas, whose husband Jonathan worked as a technical assistant at the RAF base, was charged with causing death by dangerous driving in December, but an extradition request was denied in January. This video can not be played 'It's just another hurdle', Harry Dunn's parents say The legal challenge by Mrs Charles and Mr Dunn's father Tim Dunnclaimed Mrs Sacoolas should not have been granted immunity. But Lord Justice Flaux and Mr Justice Saini concluded ""that Mrs Sacoolas enjoyed immunity from UK criminal jurisdiction at the time of Harry's death"". Mrs Charles said: ""The government and Mrs Sacoolas need to understand that this court ruling is just a blip along the way. ""I promised my boy I would get him justice and that is just what we are going to do. No-one is going to stand in our way."" She added: ""It's obviously disappointing that this court did not find in our favour but we are more focused now than ever on fulfilling our promise."" Family spokesman Radd Seiger said Mr Dunn and Mrs Charles would be appealing against the ruling. Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003, cited diplomatic immunity after the crash and returned to the US Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: ""While this judgment makes clear the Foreign Office acted properly and lawfully throughout, I appreciate that won't provide any solace to the family in their search for justice. ""We stand with them, we're clear that Anne Sacoolas needs to face justice in the UK, and we will support the family with their legal claim in the US."" The High Court judges also rejected a claim by Mr Dunn's parents that the Foreign Office had ""usurped"" Northamptonshire Police's investigation into their son's death. Lord Justice Flaux and Mr Justice Saini found officials had ""sought to assist rather than obstruct Northamptonshire Police in their investigation"". This video can not be played Dominic Raab: 'We continue to offer the Dunn family support' The family's case centred on a 1995 agreement between the UK and the US, granting immunity to administrative and technical staff at the RAF base, which the US waived in relation to ""acts performed outside the course of their duties"". Lawyers for Mr Dunn and Mrs Charles argued that the Foreign Office ""took upon itself the authority to resolve the question of immunity and ultimately and unlawfully decided to accept the US embassy's decision that Anne Sacoolas had immunity"". In written submissions, the Foreign Office argued its officials had ""objected in strong terms"" to Mrs Sacoolas leaving the UK, and ""repeatedly emphasised"" that the department ""wanted the Sacoolas family to co-operate with the UK authorities"". Lord Justice Flaux and Mr Justice Saini ruled that Mrs Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity ""on arrival in the UK"" under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. As this had not been ""expressly waived"", it meant Mrs Sacoolas ""had immunity at the time of Harry's death"" on 27 August, they said. Mr Dunn said: ""It's bad enough feeling the horrible pain of not having Harry around and missing him, but I can't believe the governments are putting us through this. ""It all seems so cruel and needless and I am just as angry today as I ever have been but so determined to see it all through until we have justice.""

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak is unveiling the government's spending plans for the coming year. The Spending Review will include details on public sector pay, NHS funding and money for the devolved administrations in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Mr Sunak will also set out the extent of the damage done to the UK economy by the coronavirus pandemic. A No 10 spokesman said the economic forecasts will be ""a sobering read"". The government's Covid response has led to huge spending and borrowing rises. The chancellor is expected to begin his statement at around 12:30 GMT following Prime Minister's Questions. Sunak pledges to make jobs 'number one priority' How will the Spending Review affect you? Will the Treasury go green? Rishi Sunak's plans: Four things to look out for Some Spending Review announcements have already been trailed. These includean extra Â£3bn for the NHSin England to help tackle the backlog of operations delayed due to Covid,an increase in defence spendinganda Â£4.6bn package to help the unemployed back to work. The government is expected to announce acut in the UK's overseas aid budget to 0.5% of national income, down from the legally binding target of 0.7%. Lockdown restrictions have forced many businesses to temporarily close There have also been reports that the chancelloris considering a pay freeze for all public sector workersexcept frontline NHS staff. Plansto change the way big spending projects are analysed- which the Treasury says is currently biased in favour of the south east of England - will be published alongside the Spending Review. The chancellor may also choose to set aside money to tackle climate change and regional inequalities. Devolved governments will receive money proportionate to any funding England gets in the Spending Review. This is decided using the Barnett formula - devised by Lord Barnett, a Labour politician, in the 1970s. Mr Sunak and Treasury Chief Secretary Stephen Barclay updated the Cabinet on Wednesday morning. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""Cabinet was told the OBR forecasts will show the impact the coronavirus pandemic has had on our economy and they will make for a sobering read, showing the extent to which the economy has contracted and the scale of borrowing and debt levels. ""But - as the IMF (International Monetary Fund), OBR and others have pointed out - the costs would have been much higher had we not acted in the way we have done."" ""It's going to look horrible."" The simple truth about the Spending Review according to a senior MP. The chancellor will bang the drum for his plans to keep people in jobs, or help find new ones. Rishi Sunak will take out the metaphorical megaphone to explain how he'll allocate billions of taxpayers' cash to spend on infrastructure in the coming months. But the headlines of the Spending Review, when governments put their money where their mouths are, won't be in any rhetorical flourishes at the despatch box, nor likely in any surprise announcements kept back as goodies for the public. Read Laura's full preview The government had intended to use the Spending Review to set out its plans for the next three years, however this was reduced to just one year due to the economic turmoil caused by Covid. The difficult financial backdrop will dominate this year's review with the economy projected to be 10% smaller than it was pre-virus. Why should I care what Rishi Sunak says? How much will coronavirus cost the UK? Tax revenues have fallen as many businesses have been forced to close and government schemes to support furloughed workers have led to soaring levels of spending. Public borrowing is expected to rise to Â£372bn - compared to the Â£55bn the government had originally expected to borrow. The Spending Review will be accompanied by economic forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility - including predictions on how tax will be raised. Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the government's ""irresponsible choices"" during the pandemic had ""led to our country experiencing the worst downturn in the G7, and created a jobs crisis"". ""This prime minister and his government talk a good game but they haven't delivered on their promises - and regional inequality has got worse under their watch,"" she said. ""They clapped for key workers - but now they're freezing their pay, and looking to scrap planned minimum wage increases for the private sector."" Unions called for Mr Sunak to maintain investment in the public sector, the TUC's deputy general secretary Paul Nowak telling BBC Breakfast ""now is not the time to make cuts to public services"". And the SNP is calling for a huge stimulus package to support growth and jobs across the whole of the UK. ""The spending has to match the challenges we see in the economy,"" said its economic spokeswoman Alison Thewliss. ""At the moment interest rates are at a record low so the government should be borrowing."" How will the Spending Review affect you?

"England's education secretary acted unlawfully in scrapping a string of legal protections for children in care, Appeal Court judges have ruled. They said Gavin Williamson should have consulted England's children's commissioner and other groups, before scrapping 65 safeguards for children. The court said consulting such bodies would have been ""manifestly in the interest of vulnerable children"". The government says it is disappointed by the ruling. Children's rights group Article 39 mounted the challenge against what it called a ""bonfire of children's rights"" after the government changed the rules safeguarding children through the Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) regulations in April. Parliament did not debate the changes until after they were introduced in April. The legal challenge came after a lengthy battle between the government, peers, opposition MPs and children's rights groups over attempts to push through the changes which cover the rights to support for children in care. The High Court previously ruled in the government's favour. Government challenged on children's rights Ministers' U-turn over children's rights 'Bonfire of children's rights' opposed The regulations affected included legal timescales for social-worker visits to children in care, six-monthly reviews of children's welfare, independent scrutiny of children's homes and senior officer oversight of adoption decision-making for babies and children. The protections affected also cover disabled children having short breaks and children in care sent many miles away from home. The government had argued in an earlier court hearing that these changes were ""minor bureaucratic burdens"", but the Appeal Court said the alterations to children's rights were ""substantial and wide-ranging"". After the government review of the legislation was begun in February, Department for Education officials had private telephone, email and face-to-face conversations with adoption agencies, private providers and local government bodies. But bodies representing children and young people affected by the changes were not consulted, and the children's commissioner - the statutory protector of children's issues - was not informed until after the changes went through. Announcing the ruling, Lord Justice Baker said: ""I can find nothing about the circumstances that existed in March 2020 to justify the secretary of state's decision (if indeed any conscious decision was made) to exclude the children's commissioner and other bodies representing the rights of children in care from the consultation on which he embarked. ""He decided to undertake a rapid informal consultation, substantially by email."" He said he found it appropriate for the consultation to be carried out that way because of the circumstances of the start of the coronavirus pandemic. ""But having decided to undertake the consultation, there was no good reason why that process should not have included the children's commissioner and the other bodies,"" he said. ""On the contrary, there were very good reasons why they should have been included."" Lord Baker said it was ""potentially misleading"" for the government to claim their actions were ""broadly endorsed by the sector"". The children's commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, said she would be seeking urgent assurances from the DfE that this would not be repeated in future. Carolyne Willow, director of Article 39, called the government's actions ""shameful, both in the scale of the protections they took away from very vulnerable children in England and the way they went about it"". ""This should draw to a close back-room, secret government consultations which exclude the rights , views and experiences of children and young people."" A DfE spokesman said: ""Protecting vulnerable children has been at the heart of our response to the Covid-19 pandemic, and our intention has always been to act in their best interests. ""We took swift action to bring in temporary changes during a national crisis, all of which have now expired. ""We will continue working with the Children's Commissioner and children's charities to provide the best possible support to vulnerable children.""

"US shares hit fresh records on Tuesday with the Dow Jones index closing above 30,000 points for the first time amid hopes of a strong economic recovery and end of political uncertainty. The S&P 500 also hit an all-time high as investors bought economically sensitive financial and energy stocks. Trading was fuelled by positive Covid vaccine news and moves to start the Joe Biden presidential transition. Europe's main markets also jumped, with London's FTSE 100 closing up 1.5%. President Donald Trump has given the green light for the formal transfer of power to begin following Mr Biden's election victory. And positive news about coronavirus vaccines has boosted hopes that the US and global economies could be on the path to normality next year. Asian markets followed Wall Street's lead, with Japan's Nikkei up nearly 2% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index 1.4% higher. Indexes in South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore have all edged higher. ""The possibility of having a vaccine next year increases the odds that we're going to see demand return in the new year,"" said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at US-based Baird, said: ""If 2020 has shown us anything it is that stock markets have a tremendous ability to look past bad news if there is sun on the horizon."" Analysts say market sentiment was also helped by news suggesting Mr Biden wants former Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen as his treasury secretary. Yellen tipped as first US female treasury secretary Fed fights move to end some Covid support measures This video can not be played Biden: ""Itâs a team that reflects the fact that America is back"" Among the big Wall Street share movers were plane-maker Boeing, up 3.3%, and oil company Chevron, 5% ahead. Investment banks Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase closed up 3.8% and 4.6% respectively. Other big gainers included Disney, American Express and IBM. A rise in Tesla shares took the electric carmaker's market value above $500bn (Â£374bn). At the close, the Dow Jones was up 1.54% at 30,046.2, while the S&P 500 gained 1.62% to 3,635.4. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose 1.3%, to 12,036.7. Oil prices also rose, with US crude up 4.25% to $44.89 a barrel and Brent up 4% at $47.89. The gold price, a favoured asset when investors are fearful, fell 1.6% to $1,806 an ounce. But the bullish sentiment comes despite US coronavirus cases surging and millions of Americans still unemployed, and some analysts fear shares are due a reality check. Rising Covid-19 cases and delayed economic stimulus measures are red flags, said James McDonald, chief executive of Hercules Investments. But it is not just in the US where shares are surging. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.91%, while the MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.44%, putting it on track to close at a record high.

"As much as Â£1bn in benefit fraud has been prevented from being paid to organised-crime groups in recent months, BBC News has learned. But before the scam was spotted, officials unwittingly confirmed thousands of stolen identities. Fraudsters took advantage of looser rules introduced to cope with a surge of universal credit claims during the pandemic. BBC News has asked the Department for Work and Pensions for a response. In May, a junior civil servant working with High Street banks noticed dozens of claims for universal credit had been made asking for money to be paid into the same bank account. Further investigation identified more than 100,000 fraudulent claims. And officials admit they had confirmed thousands of people's identities to the gangs that had stolen them - and passed on their National Insurance numbers. The Department for Work and Pensions wants to write to those whose data has been compromised. But BBC News has learned it is struggling to identify many of them and is wary of sending out letters to last known addresses in case they end up in the wrong hands, exacerbating the data breach. Claimants whose identities have been stolen can face real hardship, as it can be months before their accurate benefits are paid. Currently, 5.7 million people receive universal credit, almost double the figure for March. To cope with the surge, identity checks were processed online, rather than face-to-face, and information such as the cost of rent and whether someone had been self-employed taken on trust. Criminal gangs have attacked several government Covid-19 schemes. In May, officials told BBC Newsabout Â£1.5bn may already have been lost in fraudulent universal credit payments Last month, a National Audit Office report foundas much as Â£3bn may have been lost through the furlough scheme DWP officials have asked the Treasury for Â£200m over three years, in this spending round, calculating it would enable it to prevent such mass scams and save taxpayers about Â£500m each year. It is estimated more than a million claims for universal credit have still to be properly checked, with additional rising concerns tens of thousands of people may have claimed the benefit without declaring they had received government grants to help the self-employed. However, the Treasury has turned down the request. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak is unveiling the government's spending plans for the coming year. The Spending Review will include details on public sector pay, NHS funding and money for the devolved administrations in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Mr Sunak will also set out the extent of the damage done to the UK economy by the coronavirus pandemic. A No 10 spokesman said the economic forecasts will be ""a sobering read"". The government's Covid response has led to huge spending and borrowing rises. The chancellor is expected to begin his statement at around 12:30 GMT following Prime Minister's Questions. Sunak pledges to make jobs 'number one priority' How will the Spending Review affect you? Will the Treasury go green? Rishi Sunak's plans: Four things to look out for Some Spending Review announcements have already been trailed. These includean extra Â£3bn for the NHSin England to help tackle the backlog of operations delayed due to Covid,an increase in defence spendinganda Â£4.6bn package to help the unemployed back to work. The government is expected to announce acut in the UK's overseas aid budget to 0.5% of national income, down from the legally binding target of 0.7%. Lockdown restrictions have forced many businesses to temporarily close There have also been reports that the chancelloris considering a pay freeze for all public sector workersexcept frontline NHS staff. Plansto change the way big spending projects are analysed- which the Treasury says is currently biased in favour of the south east of England - will be published alongside the Spending Review. The chancellor may also choose to set aside money to tackle climate change and regional inequalities. Devolved governments will receive money proportionate to any funding England gets in the Spending Review. This is decided using the Barnett formula - devised by Lord Barnett, a Labour politician, in the 1970s. Mr Sunak and Treasury Chief Secretary Stephen Barclay updated the Cabinet on Wednesday morning. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""Cabinet was told the OBR forecasts will show the impact the coronavirus pandemic has had on our economy and they will make for a sobering read, showing the extent to which the economy has contracted and the scale of borrowing and debt levels. ""But - as the IMF (International Monetary Fund), OBR and others have pointed out - the costs would have been much higher had we not acted in the way we have done."" ""It's going to look horrible."" The simple truth about the Spending Review according to a senior MP. The chancellor will bang the drum for his plans to keep people in jobs, or help find new ones. Rishi Sunak will take out the metaphorical megaphone to explain how he'll allocate billions of taxpayers' cash to spend on infrastructure in the coming months. But the headlines of the Spending Review, when governments put their money where their mouths are, won't be in any rhetorical flourishes at the despatch box, nor likely in any surprise announcements kept back as goodies for the public. Read Laura's full preview The government had intended to use the Spending Review to set out its plans for the next three years, however this was reduced to just one year due to the economic turmoil caused by Covid. The difficult financial backdrop will dominate this year's review with the economy projected to be 10% smaller than it was pre-virus. Why should I care what Rishi Sunak says? How much will coronavirus cost the UK? Tax revenues have fallen as many businesses have been forced to close and government schemes to support furloughed workers have led to soaring levels of spending. Public borrowing is expected to rise to Â£372bn - compared to the Â£55bn the government had originally expected to borrow. The Spending Review will be accompanied by economic forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility - including predictions on how tax will be raised. Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the government's ""irresponsible choices"" during the pandemic had ""led to our country experiencing the worst downturn in the G7, and created a jobs crisis"". ""This prime minister and his government talk a good game but they haven't delivered on their promises - and regional inequality has got worse under their watch,"" she said. ""They clapped for key workers - but now they're freezing their pay, and looking to scrap planned minimum wage increases for the private sector."" Unions called for Mr Sunak to maintain investment in the public sector, the TUC's deputy general secretary Paul Nowak telling BBC Breakfast ""now is not the time to make cuts to public services"". And the SNP is calling for a huge stimulus package to support growth and jobs across the whole of the UK. ""The spending has to match the challenges we see in the economy,"" said its economic spokeswoman Alison Thewliss. ""At the moment interest rates are at a record low so the government should be borrowing."" How will the Spending Review affect you?

"Scotland has become the first country in the world to make period products free for all. There is now a legal duty on local authorities to provide free items such as tampons and sanitary pads to ""anyone who needs them"". Products will be distributed through councils and education providers as thePeriod Products Act,externalcomes into force. MSPs unanimously approved thePeriod Products (Free Provision) (Scotland) Bill,externalin November 2020. The bill was introduced by Labour MSP Monica Lennon, who has been campaigning to end period poverty since 2016. She said: ""Local authorities and partner organisations have worked hard to make the legal right to access free period products a reality. ""This is another big milestone for period dignity campaigners and grassroots movements which shows the difference that progressive and bold political choices can make. ""As the cost-of-living crisis takes hold, the Period Products Act is a beacon of hope which shows what can be achieved when politicians come together for the good of the people we serve."" Period poverty is when those on low incomes can't afford, or access, suitable period products. With average periods lasting about five days, it can cost up to Â£8 a month for tampons and pads, and some women struggle to afford the cost. Georgie Nicholson, of social enterprise Hey Girls, toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland, period products should be as accessible as toilet roll in public bathrooms. Ms Nicolson said: ""There's a very simple way to describe period poverty: you go to the supermarket and you have to actually choose whether you can buy a bag of pasta or a box of tampons. It's that basic. ""We hear of a lot of mothers going without their period protection just so they can feed their children and using things such as newspaper stuffed into socks or bread... because they're cheaper than period products."" In 2018, a survey ofmore than 2,000 people by Young Scot,externalfound that about one in four respondents at school, college or university in Scotland had struggled to access period products. That year, the Scottish government made history by becoming the first in the world tomake period products free to students.,external Since it launched the scheme, anotherYoung Scot survey found that two-thirds of respondents,externalhad received free period products from their school, college or university in the past year. Of those who accessed the free products, 84% said the scheme had a positive impact on them. As well as period poverty, researchers say period stigma is also an issue for young girls, with the majority feeling embarrassed when buying menstruation products. The impact on education is also an area the bill aims to tackle - with researchers finding64% of girls surveyed,externalin the UK have missed school because of their period. Research showed that 13% had missed an entire school day at least once a month, 34% were worried about leaking and 22% had anxiety linked to periods. ThePeriod Products (Free Provision) (Scotland) Bill,externalputs a legal duty on local authorities to ensure anyone who needs period products can obtain them for free. It will be for the country's 32 councils to decide what practical arrangements are put in place, but they must give ""anyone who needs them"" access to different types of period products ""reasonably easily"" and with ""reasonable dignity"". People should not have to justify why they need period products or the amount that is needed The scheme is operational from 15 August. ThePeriod Products Act,externalsays obtaining the free period products should be neither ""complex nor bureaucratic"". Items should be freely accessible from council or educational institutions, without people having to ask for them. They should not have to justify why they need them or the amount that is needed. There should also be no forms to complete and no other information required for people to access the products, unless it is needed for design or postal delivery. As part of wider work to tackle the stigma around menstruation and period products, the act says responsible bodies should consider the importance of normalisation and visibility. Offering a dignified response does not necessarily require hiding products away. The bill was passed on 24 November 2020 after the Scottish government proposed significant amendments. Since 2017, around Â£27m has been spent to provide access in public settings. The Scottish government made history by becoming the first government in the world tomake period products free to students,externalwhen the scheme began in 2018. In some places, including a number of pubs and restaurants, products are already provided free of charge by the owners. This is a gesture of goodwill rather than a requirement. The UK government has its own period poverty taskforce, with the primary aim of tackling stigma and education around periods. It also wants to improve the accessibility of period products. Free period products were rolled out in all primary and secondary schools in England in January 2020. And a handful of US states have passed laws mandating free period products be provided in schools. The 5% rate of VAT on sanitary products - known as the ""tampon tax"" - was scrapped in January 2021. EU law required members to tax tampons and sanitary towels at 5% since 2001, treating period products as non-essential. The UK was able to get rid of the tax following Brexit, when it was no longer subject to European Union regulations. Before leaving the EU, the UK government had started putting money raised from VAT on period products into a Tampon Tax Fund, which was used to support organisations and charities. It came about after the Stop Taxing Periods campaign, started by Laura Coryton, attracted over 320,000 supporters and worldwide attention. A number of other countries have lowered or scrapped taxes on period products - including a dozen states in the US and countries including Kenya, Canada, Australia, India, Colombia, Malaysia, Nicaragua, Jamaica, Nigeria, Uganda, Lebanon and Trinidad and Tobago.

"This video can not be played French lockdown highlights small business struggles (November 2020 report) France will begin to ease its strict coronavirus restrictions this weekend, allowing non-essential shops to reopen, President Emmanuel Macron has said. People will also be able to share ""moments with the family"" over the Christmas period, Mr Macron announced. But he said bars and restaurants would have to remain closed until 20 January. France has reported more than 2.2 million cases and more than 50,000 confirmed coronavirus-related deaths since the start of the pandemic. In a televised address on Tuesday evening, Mr Macron said the country had passed the peak of the second wave of virus infections. He said that the bulk of lockdown restrictions would be eased from 15 December for the festive period, with cinemas reopening and general travel restrictions lifted, as long as new infections were at 5,000 a day or less. On Monday, France reported 4,452 daily Covid-19 infections - its lowest tally since 28 September. The latest seven-day rolling average for new infections in France is reported to be 21,918. That figure peaked at 54,440 on 7 November. How new lockdowns are changing life across Europe Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Covid vaccine update: When will one be ready? Mr Macron said the recent news of successful vaccine trials offered ""a glimmer of hope"" and that France would aim to begin vaccinations against Covid-19 ""at the end of December or at the beginning of January"", starting with the elderly and most vulnerable. The French president said the situation would be reviewed on 20 January, and if infections remained low, bars and restaurants would then be permitted to reopen. Universities would also be able to accept students again. However, if the situation had worsened, he said he would look at options to avoid triggering a third wave. ""We must do everything to avoid a third wave, do everything to avoid a third lockdown,"" Mr Macron said. He later tweeted to say that all businesses forced to remain closed during the restrictions, such as restaurants, bars and sports halls, would have the choice of receiving up to â¬10,000 (Â£8,900) from a ""solidarity fund"" or the payment of 20% of their turnover. He said that France's ski resorts may have to remain closed until next year because the current risks associated with the virus made it difficult for such sports to resume. However, he said he would discuss the issue with other European leaders and provide an update in the coming days. Ski resorts were responsible for numerous outbreaks of Covid-19 cases across Europe in the early days of the pandemic. Mr Macron said the lockdown would be replaced by a nationwide curfew between 21:00 and 07:00, except on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve. France has been under a second national lockdown since the beginning of November. People have only been permitted to leave home to go to work, buy essential goods, seek medical help or exercise for one hour a day. Anyone going outside must carry a written statement justifying their journey. While all non-essential shops, restaurants and bars have been shut, schools and crÃ¨ches have remained open. Social gatherings have been banned. This video can not be played Empty street in Montmartre, Paris Measures to deal with coronavirus outbreaks remain in place across Europe, but a reduction in daily reported cases in some areas - coupled with the reported success of a number of vaccines - has led countries to revisit their restrictions. Some of the latest developments include: Along with France, politicians from other nations - includingItalianPrime Minister Giuseppe Conte - have said that Europe's ski resorts should close over the winter and that it is too risky to spend the Christmas holiday on the snow The developers ofRussia's main coronavirus vaccine - Sputnik V - have said that it is proving to be up to 95% effective. They have also said that it will be cheaper - and easier to store and transport - than its competitors in the US.

"Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has topped Microsoft founder Bill Gates to become the world's second richest man after a meteoric rise in his personal fortune. Mr Musk's net worth jumped by $7.2bn (Â£5.4bn) to $128bn after shares in his car firm Tesla surged. Only Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is richer, according to theBloomberg Billionaires Index,external. It comes after news Tesla shares will be added to the S&P 500, one of the main share indexes in the US. That triggered a fresh wave of buying of the electric carmaker's shares, sending the company's market value above $500bn and boosting the value of Mr Musk's holding in the business. Musk: Cheaper Tesla ready 'in about three years' Tesla shrugs off pandemic as sales hit new record Elon Musk 'likely has moderate case' of Covid-19 Tesla is already the most valuable car firm in the world, despite producing a fraction of the vehicles of rivals such as Toyota, VW and General Motors. On Tuesday, in a speech in Germany, Mr Musk said it could ""make sense"" for Tesla to expand in Europe by entering the mass-market segment with a small car. ""In the US, the cars tend to be bigger for personal taste reasons,"" he said. ""In Europe, (they) tend to be smaller."" And after years of losses, Tesla has seen five consecutive quarters of profit as sales of its cars perform well despite the pandemic. The California-based firm will be the biggest new entrant on the S&P 500, with a market value of more than $500bn. It means investment funds tracking the index will automatically hold its stock and benefit from gains in its share price - news that has excited investors.

"BeyoncÃ©, Taylor Swift and Dua Lipa lead the nominations for the 2021 Grammy Awards. BeyoncÃ© leads the field, with nine nominations overall, including four for Black Parade, a protest anthem released at the height of the Black Lives Matter protests this summer. Swift, with six nods, could win album of the year for a record-breaking third time with her lockdown album Folklore. Dua Lipa also picked up six nominations for the disco-tinged Future Nostalgia. The British star, who was named best new artist by the Grammys two years ago, was also on hand to read out some of the nominees - including best children's album and best historical album - in an online livestream. Rapper Roddy Ricch tied with Swift and Lipa on six nominations, the majority of which recognised his hit singleThe Box,external, which spent 11 weeks at number one earlier this year.

Coldplay were listed in the best album category for their eighth album Everyday Life, while Mercury Prize-winner Michael Kiwanuka was nominated for best rock album and Laura Marling was listed alongside the late Leonard Cohen in the best folk album category. BeyoncÃ©'s nine nominations increased her historic lead as the Grammys' most-nominated female artist ever. She now has 79 nominations, tying her with Sir Paul McCartney for the second-most nominations of all time. Ahead of her are Thriller producer Quincy Jones, and her husband Jay-Z, who both have 80. Three of BeyoncÃ©'s nominations came for a guest verse onSavage (Remix),external- the breakout hit by fellow Texan musician Megan Thee Stallion.

Alicia Keys, LL Cool J and the new wave of protest songs How Dua Lipa released an album from isolation Grammys drop 'urban' from major award category Many of the nominees were far from being household names, with retro rock band Black Pumas and British multi-instrumentalist Jacob Collier listed in the main categories. Collier's album, Djesse vol 3 also earned the dubious distinction of being the first album of the year nominee not to have earned a place on Billboard's Top 200 chart. There was also a notable presence for songs inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement - most notablyH.E.R.'s moving ballad I Can't Breathe,external, which is up for song of the year. BTS only had one previous Grammy nomination - for best recording package in 2019 The 84 categories also threw up a few quirks.  Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill - which won best album in 1996 - is now nominated in the best musical theatre album category, thanks to a Broadway show based on the star's angst-rock classic. Taylor Swift picks up a nomination for Beautiful Ghosts - her song from the critically-panned Cats movie; while Billie Eilish's No Time To Die is up for an award, despite the James Bond film it accompanies still not having come out. And Kanye West finds himself in the best contemporary Christian music category, thanks to his devotional rap album Jesus Is King, These are the first nominations to be announced since the Recording Academy updated its award categories and rules earlier this year. Amongst the changes, itdropped the term ""urban""as a way of describing music of black origin, to ensure the awards were ""inclusive and reflect[ed] the current state of the music industry"". The rules on voting were also tightened upfollowing allegations of irregularitiesby the Academy's former president, Deborah Dugan.

"The four nations of the UK have agreed UK-wide rules to allow families to meet over Christmas Three households will be allowed to meet in each other's homes over five days between 23-27 December Earlier, Matt Hancock took questions at a joint session of the Health and Social Care Committee and Science and Technology Committee He defended NHS test-and-trace, saying it was not to blame for the second lockdown The health secretary also said the UK should be ""getting back to normal"" after Easter People arriving in England will be soon able to reduce their quarantine period if they pay for a Covid test Globally, the world's most vulnerable must not be ""trampled in the stampede"" for vaccines, the World Health Organization warns The developers of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine say it is proving to be up to 95% effective Edited by Emma Owen We will be back with more coronavirus coverage on our live page tomorrow. Today's updates have been brought to you by: Hugo Bachega, George Bowden, Marie Jackson, Joseph Lee, Emma Owen, Georgina Rannard, Alex Therrien, Lauren Turner and Kate Whannel. Rules will be relaxed for Christmas across the UK We are bringing our live page coverage to an end shortly. Before we do, here's a summary of today's headlines from the UK: Health officials advised people in the US to stay at home for Thanksgiving There are over 30,000 people in hospital - but cases are falling sharply With another 458 deaths reported today, France has become the latest European country to record more than 50,000 deaths during the pandemic. Italy and the UK had already passed that milestone. But France's death toll of 50,237 comes against a background of falling cases, with 9,155 infections today - compared to 45,522 last Tuesday. The number of people in hospital fell by 859 to 30,622, the sharpest fall since the country's lockdown began on 30 October. French President Emmanuel Macron announced a phased end to the lockdown, with shops allowed to reopen on Saturday. Other restrictions will remain in place. Canada's eastern provinces are dissolving their ""bubble"" that has been in effect throughout most of the pandemic. New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island (PEI), Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had restricted domestic travel from outside of their group. Outsiders were expected to quarantine for 14 days, while insiders could move freely. The bubble has been credited with keeping cases low. But on Monday, Newfoundland and Labrador and PEI said they would temporarily end the agreement, as cases in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are on the rise. PEI will also ban non-essential travel until 7 December.  A 10-year-old boy was among those who died in hospital as the UK recorded its highest daily death toll for over five months. The 608 people reported to have died within 28 days of a positive test is the largest total since 12 May, when 614 deaths were recorded. The daily death figures have begun to flatten in recent days, however, following the fall in the number of reported infections. The parents of Fehzan Jamil, who lived in Bradford and is one of the virus's youngest UK victims, told Channel 4 News of their âindescribableâ pain. Tayyaba and Mohammed Jamil said their son, who had epilepsy and other health problems, was a âreally brave fighterâ and a âsoldierâ, who was always cheerful.    Ghislaine Maxwell is due to go on trial in 2021 Ghislaine Maxwell has been quarantined after staff tested positive for Covid-19 at the jail in New York where she is awaiting trial, US prosecutors say. Maxwell is accused of helping her former boyfriend, late financier Jeffrey Epstein, traffic and sexually abuse underage girls and of perjury for denying involvement in such a scheme when she gave her deposition under oath. She has pleaded not guilty. The staff tested positive last week and Maxwell, 58, was checked for the virus on 18 November using a rapid test which was negative, the prosecutors said in a letter to US District Judge Alison Nathan. She will go on trial next year, and is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. The mutations observed in coronavirus isolates from mink have also been observed in ferrets, according to the latestminutes from the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage),external. Sage said preliminary evidence suggested ferrets could pose a risk to those who are most
vulnerable to the virus, but were low risk otherwise. Unlike mink, they are normally not kept in high-intensity farms. Sage said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is currently assessing the risk to people in the UK and is developing messaging for ferret owners. There are fears mutations of the virus in animals could hamper the effectiveness of coronavirus vaccines. Earlier this month,Denmark culled all its mink - up to 17 million animals - because of the spread of coronavirus in the animal. Sage said coordination was needed across academic groups  and relevant bodies on the risks of human to animal transmission and the intensive rearing of
animals. The Sage minutes said the UK's vaccine taskforce would note potential implications for vaccine targeting of variants
including those that are mink-adapted. What's the science behind mink and coronavirus? We take a look here Theo LeggettBBC business correspondent The global airline industry will make a net loss of $118bn (Â£88bn) this year, according to the International Air Transport Association (Iata), and a further loss of $38bn is expected next year. The figures are much higher than previous estimates, and reflect the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, and continued restrictions on travel. Iata's Director General Alexandre de Juniac explained that 2020 had been the worst financial year in the industry's history. Without financial support from governments, he said, there would have been bankruptcies on ""a massive scale"". According to Iata, airlines have been able to cut their costs collectively by $365bn this year, a reduction of nearly 46%. But this has been outweighed by a drop in revenues of more than 60%. The organisation says it does expect the situation to improve next year, with some opening of borders, either through improved testing or a vaccine. But it still expects losses to be greater than any the industry has ever suffered, with the exception of 2020. Passenger numbers are expected to drop to 1.8 billion thisyear from 4.5 billion in 2019, and will recover only partially to 2.8 billion next year, according to the association. Alistair ColemanBBC Disinformation unit Signs like this have wrongly suggested that a royal charter from 1215 gives business owners the right to refuse to close In the UK,a Yorkshire hairdresser is facing fines totalling Â£27,000($36,000) for refusing to close her salon during lockdown. Sinead Quinn has a sign in her shop window saying that she ""does not consent"" to coronavirus laws, claiming her right to do so is set out in the Magna Carta, a royal charter from more than 800 years ago that was England's first form of a written constitution. However, no such right exists and she's been fined multiple times for staying open. She's one of several traders including a tattoo artist in Bristol, and aNottinghamshire bookshop, who claim that ""Article 61"" of the Magna Carta signed by King John in 1215 gives them the right to ignore ""unjust"" laws. But Article 61 was removed from Magna Carta within a year of its signing, andonly three clauses of the document remain law today.,external That's not stopped anti-lockdown social media accounts offering a downloadable notice for businesses to place in their windows. This notice also refers to a""Freeman on the Land"" defence, which claims citizens have had their identities ""stolen"" by the state, and by asserting their rights as ""sovereign citizens"" they are only bound by laws to which they consent. No ""Freeman on the Land"" defence has ever prevailed in court. One scientific expert said the relaxation of restrictions over Christmas will ""almost inevitably"" lead to an increase in transmission, but that the celebration may still be what is needed to âmake it through the rest of winterâ. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, said: âThe issue is whether that increased risk is tolerable in relation to the benefits. At that time schools will be closed so there would naturally be some downward pressure on transmission."" He said if the new tier system is working well ""there will be a downward pressure on transmission before and after the Christmas break"", so any increase in cases ""could be relatively short-lived"". ""After Christmas we will still have to live through a few more months of restrictions at least,"" the professor said. This video can not be played Gove: ""Three households can have a Christmas bubble"" Cabinet minister Michael Gove says people will be able to ""enjoy something closer to a normal Christmas"" after the four nations reached an agreement. But the bubbles, of up to three households, must be exclusive and people have to comply with hospitality rules in place in their area, depending which tier they're in. Mr Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said it was a chance to ""meet close friends and family in a very restricted fashion"". Three households can meet over a five-day
period (23 - 27 December) in the UK. However, those in Northern Ireland have been granted a bigger window (22 - 28 December) to allow for any additional travel time to and from the region. Sam says she wants to get together ""even if it's just for one day"" Families are now facing a big choice about whether to take advantage of the freedom to meet up at Christmas - or whether to play it safe. Sam in Devon is building a grotto in her garden ready for a small family gathering. She told the BBC: ""Itâs the only time of the year I get everybody together, it's very important, it's special. ""Itâs not the presents or anything else, itâs having my family. Even if itâs just for one day."" But she said people ""have to be sensible otherwise weâre going to have a really rotten January"". But others said they would not be travelling. Father and daughter Naomi and Roy said they would not be making the trip between Devon and South Wales this year. ""I would love to do it, but no,"" Naomi said. ""Especially with the vaccine development, it just seems like too high risk regardless of what we're allowed to do."" ""The only thing thatâs missing is the physical contact,"" said Roy, adding that he missed the grandchildren, ""If that has to be, I would rather miss out in 2020 if it means we can do what we normally do in 2021.""  This year, Naomi and dad Roy will spend Christmas apart We've had some more detail about what the Christmas announcements will mean for different groups: In a joint statement from all four governments, the leaders say 2020 ""has been an incredibly difficult year for us all"". ""We have all had to make significant sacrifices in our everyday lives, and many
religious and community groups have already had to change or forgo their
customary celebrations to slow the spread of coronavirus and save lives. ""This cannot be
a ânormalâ Christmas but as we approach the festive period, we have been
working closely together to find a way for family and friends to see each
other, even if it is for a short time, and recognising that it must be both
limited and cautious."" They urge people to use ""personal judgement"" and be ""mindful of the risks"" particularly when meeting those
who are vulnerable. ""We urge the consideration of alternative approaches such as the use of
technology or meeting outside,"" the statement adds. NI First Minister Arlene Foster said she hoped the announcement gave people time to plan First Minister Arlene Foster welcomed the announcement of Christmas arrangements and said she hoped it would give people space to plan. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was a ""message of hope"" but urged people to be responsible, safe and mindful of healthcare workers. âThink, can you meet up differently, can you go for a walk, for example, with a family member?â she said. Arlene Foster said the relaxations would apply in people's homes, in non-essential retail and places of worship but not in hospitality. She said people should stick to the regulations on hospitality concerning the number of households allowed to meet together at the time. Northern Ireland is due to begin a two-week lockdown from this Friday until 11 December, in a bid to curb the spread of the virus before Christmas.  Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said the approach to Christmas was ""not a choice between relaxation or no relaxation"" but a plan to allow celebrations ""in a controlled way"". He stressed this is ""not an instruction to travel"" and ""not an instruction to meet with other people"". Asked if he had any concerns about relaxing the restrictions, he said ""misgivings happen either way"". Mr Drakeford said: ""It is having a form of relaxation where there are rules that people will recognise, that will allow people to enjoy Christmas, but will do it in a controlled way."" He admitted he had ""hesitation"" - because of the state of the virus in Wales and the UK as a whole - but added: ""It is better that we have a common set of arrangements that give people a framework that they can manage within and act responsibly within as well."" Asked about what plans and preparations are being made for the opening months of 2021, he replied: ""What I am keen on is that we don't, on a four nation basis, simply think about five days of Christmas. ""We think of a common approach to Christmas and a common approach to dealing with the consequences of Christmas as well."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the relaxation would not apply to Hogmanay Talking about the plans, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged people to try to limit their interaction. She said there would be some people who felt the need to come
together over Christmas and âwe want to allow thatâ but âjust because this can
be doneâ, it is not the case that people should feel âthey should do it if they
donât have toâ. Ms Sturgeon also confirmed that travel restrictions would be lifted
to allow people to visit families in other parts of the UK within the three-household bubble. She said the three-household bubble was a âfixed bubble for
that five-day period - you canât see two households one day and another two
households the next dayâ. The first minister confirmed the relaxation would not apply
to Hogmanay, saying âwe canât do everything hereâ. ""The last thing we want to do right now is set our
progress back,â she added. On the matter of hugs, she cautioned people against doing things that allow the virus to spread. Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove says he is
""very pleased"" to have reached an agreement with the other four
regions. However he warns that a ""balance has to be struck""
between relaxing the restrictions over Christmas and beating back the virus. He says the progress on vaccines means there is ""light at the end of the tunnel"" but he adds ""it is important we don't let things get too loose over Christmas."" ""I know that people will use these freedoms responsibly."" He said this was an opportunity
for people to ""meet close friends and family in a very restricted fashion,
in order to ensure that those we love can be with us at this special season,
but only for a limited period, but not in hospitality venues and not in any
locations where the virus might spread fast"". Mr Gove said he now planned to
spend Christmas with his mother and father in Aberdeen.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9988707
"As much as Â£1bn in benefit fraud has been prevented from being paid to organised-crime groups in recent months, BBC News has learned. But before the scam was spotted, officials unwittingly confirmed thousands of stolen identities. Fraudsters took advantage of looser rules introduced to cope with a surge of universal credit claims during the pandemic. BBC News has asked the Department for Work and Pensions for a response. In May, a junior civil servant working with High Street banks noticed dozens of claims for universal credit had been made asking for money to be paid into the same bank account. Further investigation identified more than 100,000 fraudulent claims. And officials admit they had confirmed thousands of people's identities to the gangs that had stolen them - and passed on their National Insurance numbers. The Department for Work and Pensions wants to write to those whose data has been compromised. But BBC News has learned it is struggling to identify many of them and is wary of sending out letters to last known addresses in case they end up in the wrong hands, exacerbating the data breach. Claimants whose identities have been stolen can face real hardship, as it can be months before their accurate benefits are paid. Currently, 5.7 million people receive universal credit, almost double the figure for March. To cope with the surge, identity checks were processed online, rather than face-to-face, and information such as the cost of rent and whether someone had been self-employed taken on trust. Criminal gangs have attacked several government Covid-19 schemes. In May, officials told BBC Newsabout Â£1.5bn may already have been lost in fraudulent universal credit payments Last month, a National Audit Office report foundas much as Â£3bn may have been lost through the furlough scheme DWP officials have asked the Treasury for Â£200m over three years, in this spending round, calculating it would enable it to prevent such mass scams and save taxpayers about Â£500m each year. It is estimated more than a million claims for universal credit have still to be properly checked, with additional rising concerns tens of thousands of people may have claimed the benefit without declaring they had received government grants to help the self-employed. However, the Treasury has turned down the request. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"This video can not be played Students from Knowsley on Merseyside say they feel extra stressed in the lead up to exams this year More than one in five secondary pupils in England missed school last week, with worsening Covid disruption. The latest attendance figures show 22% of secondary pupils were missing, based on who was in school last Thursday - up from 17% the previous week. The biggest teachers' union warned of a ""collapse"" in attendance, with almost three quarters of secondary schools sending home pupils. The Department for Education says keeping schools open is a ""priority"". ""The situation has reached a crisis point and the government cannot let coronavirus run riot in schools any longer,"" said Mary Bousted, co-leader of the National Education Union, with almost 900,000 pupils out of school because of Covid incidents. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, backed the principle of keeping schools open, but said it was time for schools to be allowed to operate rota systems. ""The reality behind these figures is that many schools are experiencing disruption on a monumental scale and are desperately trying to cling on to the end of term,"" said the heads' leader. Pupils sent home in half of England's secondary schools More secondary pupils missing lessons during pandemic Almost one in five secondary schools sending pupils home ""The other parents and I have a WhatsApp group and our phones ping and we're all filled with dread over which year group is told to isolate next,"" says Josephine Abbott Millar, a parent from Rugby. Her two sons have faced school being disrupted - and she says they have missed the social life as well as lessons at school. Not every family has the technology to allow children to switch to learning online ""As my eldest has started a new school I think he's really suffered as he's not been allowed to settled in properly,"" she told the BBC. ""Every time he starts to feel a bit settled he has to isolate again for two weeks and he's home again. It's the back and forth that is really disruptive."" There have been concerns about how exams will go ahead next summer when so many pupils have been missing lessons. Russell Hobby, chief executive of Teach First, said being out of school would be most disruptive for the most disadvantaged. ""Studying from home is difficult for all pupils. But our research has found it's pupils from the poorest backgrounds who are the least likely to have laptops and internet while self-isolating, making it nearly impossible for them,"" he said. ""These children will not recover from this if we don't acknowledge the barriers they face,"" says Matthew Martin, head of department in a south London secondary school. He says some pupils have missed a month already this term and only a limited number will really be able continue learning online at home. This is not because of an unwillingness to keep studying, he says, but because families do not have the computer equipment at home to make it possible. England's Department for Education has been committed to keeping schools open, but the weekly figures show rising numbers of pupils missing from the classroom. Overall attendance is down to 83% of pupils, below 86% in the previous week - and although the way figures were gathered changed in October, they show attendance dipping since half term. This fall is particularly concentrated in secondary schools, with 78% in class last Thursday, down from 87% on 5 November. Across both primary and secondary schools, the figures show about one in 10 pupils were out of school because of Covid-related concerns. The great majority of pupils being sent home are because of potential contacts - rather than pupils having caught coronavirus, with only 0.2% of pupils recorded as confirmed cases. Primary schools have so far been less disrupted, with 87% of pupils attending - but the number of schools sending home one more pupils has risen to 29%, compared with 22% the week before. There have been worries about how exams will go ahead next summer Among secondary schools, 73% were sending home pupils, compared with 64% the week before. A Department for Education spokeswoman said almost all schools had remained open this term - and there was online learning for those pupils who were self-isolating. ""It is a national priority to keep education settings open full-time, and that remains equally as important in the weeks up to the end of term as it was when young people returned for the new school year,"" said the DFE spokeswoman.

""America is back"", he said, and ""ready to lead the world, not retreat from it"". If confirmed, Avril Haines will be the first female director of national intelligence and Alejandro Mayorkas the first Latino homeland security boss. Donald Trump has agreed transition moves must start and Mr Biden will now get a top secret intelligence brief. However, the sitting president still refuses to admit defeat, repeating unsubstantiated claims that the 3 November vote was ""rigged"". As well as getting the Presidential Daily Brief- an update on international threats and developments - Mr Biden can now access key government officials and millions of dollars in funds as he prepares to take over on 20 January. Could Biden's win doom this town? What Biden's new foreign policy team tells us What is the presidential transition? On Tuesday, Governor Tom Wolf said he had certified Mr Biden's victory in Pennsylvania, a key swing state. Another, Michigan, certified the same outcome on Monday. Speaking in Wilmington, Delaware, the president-elect highlighted the need to rebuild alliances, as well as tackling coronavirus and climate change. World leaders, he suggested, were ""looking forward to the United States reasserting its historic role as a global leader over the Pacific, as well as the Atlantic, all across the world"". Speaking to NBC News, he said: ""This president, President Trump, has changed the landscape. It's become America first, America alone. We find ourselves in a position where our alliances are being frayed."" Mr Biden also told reporters he had discussed the Irish border issue with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other leaders. US doesn't want guarded border on Ireland - Biden The 310-mile border at the heart of Brexit Mr Biden, who has Irish heritage, said he was against a guarded border, arguing it must be kept open: ""The idea of having the border north and south once again being closed, it's just not right."" This video can not be played Biden: ""We've just got to keep the border open"" between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland Speaking to NBC, Mr Biden said outreach from the White House had been ""sincere"", not ""begrudging"". There were, he said, plans for him to meet the Covid task force in the White House about vaccine distribution and access. Barack Obama's former vice-president said that his time in office would not be a ""third Obama term"" because ""we face a totally different world than we faced in the Obama-Biden administration"". Mr Biden has chosen Jake Sullivan, Linda Thomas-Greenfield and Antony Blinken for key roles Mr Biden presented six key figures on Tuesday: Antony Blinken,Secretary of state. Mr Blinken said the US would soon ""with equal measures of humility and confidence"" restore its relationships with other countries John Kerry,Climate change envoy.He was one of the leading architects of the Paris climate agreement, from which President Trump withdrew. Mr Kerry said the world must ""come together to end the climate crisis"" Avril Haines,Director of national intelligence. Mr Biden said: ""I picked a professional... a fierce advocate for telling the truth"". Alejandro Mayorkas,Secretary of homeland security. Mr Mayorkas said the department had ""a noble mission, to help keep us safe and to advance our proud history as a country of welcome"" Jake Sullivan,White House national security adviser.Mr Sullivan praised his boss, saying he had taught him much about statecraft, but also ""most importantly about human nature"" Linda Thomas-Greenfield,US ambassador to the UN.She said she brought her southern Louisiana roots to her job, calling it ""a cajun spin"" on ""gumbo diplomacy"" One choice that is expected but has not been announced yet is former Federal Reserve chairJanet Yellenas treasury secretary Alejandro Mayorkas (left) and Avril Haines (right) have been formally named; Janet Yellen (centre) is expected to be picked for the treasury Most of the picks, although not Mr Kerry or Mr Sullivan, will need confirmation by the Senate.

Yet progressives feel cheated. They say they helped Mr Biden win, and now they have been shut out of power. These progressives say the cabinet will be filled with ""Clinton and Obama retreads"", as one of them puts it, describing it as a return to the ""Blob"", a term that Ben Rhodes, who served as Mr Obama's speechwriter, once used to describe the Washington establishment. Stephen Wertheim from the Quincy Institute, a think tank focused on foreign policy, says the new Democratic team in the White House may end up acting like the old one, a group of centrists who, he says, focused more on military threats than on issues such as climate change. He adds: ""Progressives have a right to be concerned about whether there will be significant change."" In a  brief appearance in the White House press room on Tuesday, Mr Trump praised the work of his administration, hailed the Dow Jones stock index for passing the 30,000 mark and left without taking questions.

"Members of Labour's ruling body loyal to Jeremy Corbyn have walked out of a meeting in protest over his continued exclusion from the parliamentary party. The 13 representatives of the National Executive Committee said Sir Keir Starmer's decision not to re-instate the whip to Mr Corbyn in a bitter anti-Semitism row was a ""factional"" move. Mr Corbyn has been urged to apologise for remarks downplaying the extent of anti-Semitism when he was leader. His lawyers are challenging the ban. Tuesday's row reflects continuing upheaval at the top of the party over Mr Corbyn's recent suspension from Labour. The NEC agreed to lift the suspension last week after he issued a statement distancing himself from his previous claims that anti-Semitism within the party when he was leader was overstated for political reasons. The NEC is the guiding body for the Labour Party, making key decisions about the party's objectives. Labour chief whip demands apology from Corbyn Corbyn lawyers challenge Labour over MP suspension Starmer: Corbyn will not return as Labour MP But Sir Keir has declined to re-admit him to the parliamentary party, meaning he continues to sit as an independent in the House of Commons. Labour's chief whip Nick Brown has written to Mr Corbyn urging him to make a full and unreserved apology for his earlier comments, which he made after the Equalities and Human Rights Commission found the party had broken the law over its handling of anti-Semitism claims. After their mass walkout from Tuesday's virtual meeting, the 13 representatives, including former MP Laura Pidcock, issued a statement saying they had ""decided not to remain in the NEC meeting today in order to show very clearly how factional the decisions of the current Labour leader have become"". They added: ""We will be returning to future NEC meetings to be the legitimate voice of the membership."" In a letter to the NEC's general secretary David Evans, the group said Tuesday's election of veteran MP Dame Margaret Beckett as chair of the ruling body was a breach of protocol, suggesting the role should have typically passed to the current vice-chair Ian Murray. The former foreign secretary is the longest-serving member of the NEC They suggested the party leadership had ""lobbied for"" Dame Margaret because Mr Murray, who is a senior member of the Fire Brigades Union, had been one of those who had criticised Sir Keir's for his decision to withhold the whip from his predecessor. However Jon Lansman, founder of the pro-Corbyn Momentum group, advised his fellow left-wingers to ""get over themselves"". Labour sources insisted that Margaret Beckett's election was the result of democracy not factionalism. And it demonstrated that, following recent elections, the party leadership now enjoys majority support on the national executive. But it also provides further evidence of an increasing rift between supporters of the current leader and those of the previous incumbent. Dame Margaret, a former foreign secretary who been a Labour MP since 1974, succeeds TSSA union official Andi Fox in the role. Alice Perry, a London councillor seen as loyal to Sir Keir, was elected vice-chair. Sir Keir won the leadership of his party by a wide margin in April but his grip on the NEC remains more tenuous. He has won the body's backing for his reforms so far - but sometimes by very tight margins. In last week's elections of nine constituency representatives, the ""Grassroots Voice"" candidates - who represent the left and are closer to the former leader Jeremy Corbyn - won five places.

"The salon has opened at least twice over the November lockdown A hair salon owner is facing Â£17,000 in fines for repeatedly opening in breach of Covid-19 lockdown rules. Sinead Quinn was working at Quinn Blakey Hairdressers in Oakenshaw, Bradford, on Saturday when Kirklees Council officers issued a Â£4,000 fine. The council found the salon open again on Monday and issued a further Â£10,000 fine. It already had Â£1,000 and Â£2,000 fines for previous breaches. Ms Quinn said on Instagram she did not consent to or accept the fines. More stories from around Yorkshire The salon owner posted videos on the social networking site which show her talking to council officials and police, saying she had not broken any laws. On the video, she is heard saying: ""I don't consent to any fines, so it will just be returned to sender."" A similar sign to the one on the salon door, which references Magna Carta She had also displayed a poster on the salon door which refers to Magna Carta, and says the shop is ""under the jurisdiction of common law"". England is currently in anational lockdown with strict ruleswhich say non-essential shops, including hairdressers, must close. A council spokesman confirmed the fines, saying it had found the business to be ""open and trading"". The first was on 9 November, when a prohibition notice to close was served and Â£1,000 fine issued, and the second on 12 November, when a Â£2,000 fine was imposed. The council said in a statement: ""We completely understand how tough it has been, and continues to be, for local businesses throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. ""We will do all we can to support them through what has been a devastating period, but it is absolutely crucial for people's safety that we all follow the latest Covid-19 rules and guidance."" It added Kirklees had the fifth highest rate in the country, with 135 hospital admissions last week and 25 people dying with coronavirus. The council said it was now ""in the process of exploring alternative action"". West Yorkshire Police said it was a matter for the council. Correction 27 November 2020: In an earlier version of this report we said the salon had been fined Â£27,000 based on information from Kirklees Council which was later corrected. The council said Quinn Blakey had been found to be open on Tuesday 24 November, but it later transpired there were no clients in the salon, so a Â£10,000 fine was not issued on that occasion.

"Amazon has apologised after UK customers received an email announcing the launch of a service available in the US only. Amazon Sidewalk uses customer broadband accounts to create a neighbourhood-wide network for local devices. It can be accessed by certain Amazon-branded devices up to 500m (0.3 miles) away if the home wi-fi is out of reach or not working. But customers with a US-registered device only should have been contacted. And UK customers who received Amazon's email have told BBC News this was not the case. ""We recently began emailing customers with Echo devices registered in the US to give them more information about Amazon Sidewalk,"" an Amazon spokeswoman said. ""This service will only be available in the US when it launches. ""We apologise for any confusion."" Sidewalk was originally announced in 2019. It means Amazon-branded security cameras and smart speakers can still function without a connection. For US customers, the update will arrive in the form of a software update and owners of devices which can use it - including the Ring security camera and Amazon Echo - have to opt out of being part of it. Only certain Amazon devices will be able to access it - not, for example, individual smartphones. Amazon says in the email that Sidewalk ""uses a small portion of your internet bandwidth"" for the service. ""Sidewalk can also extend the coverage for Sidewalk-enabled devices, such as Ring smart lights and pet and object trackers, so they can stay connected and continue to work over longer distances,"" it adds. Security researcher Kevin Beaumonttweeted,externalAmazon appeared to be offering only very limited access to other people's broadband connections. ""It isn't blindly allowing anybody to browse the internet from your connection,"" he said. Amazon haspublished a paper,externaloutlining Sidewalk's security set-up. However, Prof Alan Woodward, a cyber-security expert from Surrey University, said he thought people should not be added to the network by default. ""I think you should opt in rather than opt out of these things,"" he said. ""It feels wrong not knowing what your device is connected to."" Is this the end of the smart home tech war?

"Britons should stop ""soldiering on"" by going to work when sick and making others ill, the health secretary says. Matt Hancock said people in the UK were ""peculiarly unusual and outliers"" for still going to work when unwell. He made the comments in a joint session of the Health and Social Care and the Science and Technology committees. He also told MPs he would like to see the diagnostic capacity built for Covid used to test for other illnesses like flu once the pandemic had passed. The UK now has the capacity to carry out over 500,000 tests a day, with new labs to be opened next year to double that number. He said he wanted to see the ""global-scale diagnostics capability"" continued to be used. ""Afterwards we must use it, not just for coronavirus, but everything,"" he told MPs. ""I want to have a change in the British way of doing things where 'if in doubt, get a test' doesn't just refer to coronavirus but refers to any illness that you might have. ""Why in Britain do we think it's acceptable to soldier on and go into work if you have flu symptoms or a runny nose, thus making your colleagues ill? ""I think that's something that is going to have to change. ""If you have, in future, flu-like symptoms, you should get a test for it and find out what's wrong with you, and if you need to stay at home to protect others, then you should stay at home. ""We are peculiarly unusual and outliers in soldiering on and still going to work, and it kind of being the culture that 'as long as you can get out of bed you still should get into work'. That should change. ""This year there's been far fewer respiratory and other communicable diseases turning up in the NHS. ""I want this massive diagnostics capacity to be core to how we treat people in the NHS so that we help people to stay healthy in the first place, rather than just looking after them when they're ill.""

"Dominici played 67 times for France and in recent years had become a familiar figure on TV and radio Tributes have been paid to ""immense"" former France rugby union international Christophe Dominici, who has died aged 48. Dominici was best known for helping France knock New Zealand out of the 1999 Rugby World Cup. A witness saw him climb the roof of a disused building at Saint-Cloud park, near Paris, on Tuesday before falling, officials say. Prosecutors have opened an inquiry into the cause of his death. ""So much sadness. Christophe Dominici was an immense player, an artist. His sudden death is a shock,"" said sports minister Roxana Maracineanu. Dominici played 67 times for his country and won the French championship five times with Stade FranÃ§ais before retiring in 2008. In recent years he had worked as a pundit for French radio and TV. His 1999 World Cup semi-final performance spurred France to a sensational comeback, as he darted down the left of the pitch and seized the ball ahead of two New Zealand defenders to score a try. The All Blacks were leading the game at the time and had the brilliant Jonah Lomu in their line-up. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Cosy rooms packed with people chatting, laughing and sharing food and drink are traditional at this time of year. Unfortunately, they are also ideal for fuelling the pandemic. Now, plans for coronavirus restrictions to be eased for Christmas have been scaled back, or abandoned in areas with the toughest restrictions. So, for people still planning to meet others - subject to the rules - here are some of the key things to help avoid giving the unwelcome gift of coronavirus. No-one will be popular for saying this, but the evidence is clear - the larger the group, the greater the risk. If it was summer and we could meet outside, where the virus gets dispersed in fresh air, it would be less of a problem. But it's winter, so everyone's inside. And the more people who are involved, the greater the likelihood that someone may be a carrier of the virus - maybe without realising, as they have no symptoms. A study by Sage,,externalthe government's science advisory panel, concludes that if you double the number of people getting together, the odds of infection increase fourfold. It also matters how many different households are meeting, as this increases the potential for the virus to spread. The rules have changed. Intier four areas(that's London and much of the south-east of England), you can't meet people from other households indoors unless they're part of an existing support bubble. And you aren't allowed to travel to other tiers to meet family and friends. In the other tiers in England, up to three households can meet (subject to social distancing rules), but for Christmas Day only. In Scotland, up to three households (a maximum of eight people, not including children under 12) can only meet on 25 December. In Wales the limit is two households for Christmas Day only. In Northern Ireland, up to three households can meet for one day only between 23-27 December. What are the new rules on mixing at Christmas? A modern browser with Javascript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive. Passing around dishes and bottles, encouraging everyone to tuck in, is one of the most natural instincts at Christmas. But coronavirus can survive on surfaces, possibly for several hours, so plates and cutlery can become contaminated. The same applies to board games where everyone's touching the dice and the cards, soSage recommends playing quiz-style games instead,external. It suggests keeping hand sanitiser by the front door and urging everyone arriving to use it. Above all, don't hug granny. ""Elbow bumps or air greetings"" are a safer alternative. Seven things that may be different this Christmas Amid the excitement of reunions, it's perfectly normal for voices to be raised. Add a little alcohol, and maybe have a TV or music on as well, and things can get even noisier. But if someone is infected, the louder they speak, the more virus they release. A lot of research,externalshows that when voices are projected, people emit more tiny droplets of the kind that can carry the coronavirus. So the advice is to avoid singing and dancing. At the very least, try keep those activities quiet or consider wearing masks. Maybe the safest option is to hum Silent Night. Popping in for a quick visit is safer than lingering over dinner for several hours. Researchers say an event's duration has a big impact on the infection risk. In March, more than 50 members of a US choir were confirmed or suspected of being infected, after a two-and-a-half-hour rehearsal session. Scientists reckoned,externalif it had lasted less than an hour, the number of infections would have been reduced by more than half. Prof Cath Noakes, one of the study's authors, says the problem is that tiny particles carrying the virus - known as aerosols - can accumulate in the air: ""There is growing evidence that if you're in a poorly-ventilated space for a long period of time with people who are infected, you may breathe in those aerosols and that might be one of the routes of infection,"" she said. So the recommendation is to plan for shorter events and to try to maximise quality time together. The obvious answer is: ""Of course not, it's too cold outside."" But fresh air dilutes any virus that might be lingering in a crowded room. A Sage report,externalsays the infection risk can be four times greater without proper ventilation. And in this context, ""ventilation"" doesn't mean having fans blowing the air around, but a flow of air from outside. Open up for 10-20 minutes every hour, the report says. According to Prof Noakes, people must dream up creative new options for Christmas That could range from meeting virtually on Zoom, going for a walk, or even delaying big gatherings until next summer. If you are having a meal indoors, try to minimise contact with others for 7-14 days beforehand. Work out a plan for how to minimise the risks - and maybe put up signs or labels to remind people. Also try to avoid having people from different households sitting opposite each other, because speaking face-to-face is another possible route for transmission. The smaller the home, the harder these measures will be, the Sage advisers acknowledge. And laying on hand sanitiser and paying for additional heating while the windows are open may not be affordable for many people. But any social setting increases the risk of infection, says Prof Noakes, and we will have to compromise and do things in a different way. ""The virus doesn't know it's Christmas,"" she says. ""It's just a virus and it thrives on human contact."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one?

Mr Dunn, 19, died when his motorbike was in a crash with a car near RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire, in 2019. The suspect, 43-year-old Anne Sacoolas, later left for the United States citing diplomatic immunity. Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said the High Court ruling was ""just a blip along the way"". Mrs Sacoolas, whose husband Jonathan worked as a technical assistant at the RAF base, was charged with causing death by dangerous driving in December, but an extradition request was denied in January. This video can not be played 'It's just another hurdle', Harry Dunn's parents say The legal challenge by Mrs Charles and Mr Dunn's father Tim Dunnclaimed Mrs Sacoolas should not have been granted immunity. But Lord Justice Flaux and Mr Justice Saini concluded ""that Mrs Sacoolas enjoyed immunity from UK criminal jurisdiction at the time of Harry's death"". Mrs Charles said: ""The government and Mrs Sacoolas need to understand that this court ruling is just a blip along the way. ""I promised my boy I would get him justice and that is just what we are going to do. No-one is going to stand in our way."" She added: ""It's obviously disappointing that this court did not find in our favour but we are more focused now than ever on fulfilling our promise."" Family spokesman Radd Seiger said Mr Dunn and Mrs Charles would be appealing against the ruling. Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003, cited diplomatic immunity after the crash and returned to the US Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: ""While this judgment makes clear the Foreign Office acted properly and lawfully throughout, I appreciate that won't provide any solace to the family in their search for justice. ""We stand with them, we're clear that Anne Sacoolas needs to face justice in the UK, and we will support the family with their legal claim in the US."" The High Court judges also rejected a claim by Mr Dunn's parents that the Foreign Office had ""usurped"" Northamptonshire Police's investigation into their son's death. Lord Justice Flaux and Mr Justice Saini found officials had ""sought to assist rather than obstruct Northamptonshire Police in their investigation"". This video can not be played Dominic Raab: 'We continue to offer the Dunn family support' The family's case centred on a 1995 agreement between the UK and the US, granting immunity to administrative and technical staff at the RAF base, which the US waived in relation to ""acts performed outside the course of their duties"". Lawyers for Mr Dunn and Mrs Charles argued that the Foreign Office ""took upon itself the authority to resolve the question of immunity and ultimately and unlawfully decided to accept the US embassy's decision that Anne Sacoolas had immunity"". In written submissions, the Foreign Office argued its officials had ""objected in strong terms"" to Mrs Sacoolas leaving the UK, and ""repeatedly emphasised"" that the department ""wanted the Sacoolas family to co-operate with the UK authorities"". Lord Justice Flaux and Mr Justice Saini ruled that Mrs Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity ""on arrival in the UK"" under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. As this had not been ""expressly waived"", it meant Mrs Sacoolas ""had immunity at the time of Harry's death"" on 27 August, they said. Mr Dunn said: ""It's bad enough feeling the horrible pain of not having Harry around and missing him, but I can't believe the governments are putting us through this. ""It all seems so cruel and needless and I am just as angry today as I ever have been but so determined to see it all through until we have justice.""

"The total number of deaths occurring in the UK is nearly a fifth above normal levels, latest figures show. Data from national statisticians show there were almost 14,000 deaths in the week ending 13 November. Some 2,838 of the deaths involved Covid - 600 more than the preceding week, according to the analysis of death certificates. The North West and Yorkshire have seen the most excess deaths. The number of deaths in both regions were more than a third above expected levels. By comparison, the number of deaths in the South East was just 2% above the five-year average. But there is hope the rise in the number deaths may soon start slowing. The daily figures published by government - which rely on positive tests - show deaths are not rising as quickly as they were, and may be levelling off. And unlike in the first wave, when the lack of testing meant the government figures underestimated the number of Covid deaths, the two sets of data are mirroring each other. Sarah Scobie, of the Nuffield Trust health think tank, said: ""Despite the end of the second national lockdown in England coming into focus, today's figures are a sobering reminder of the dreadful impact of this virus. She said the high number of deaths was ""piling on the pressure"" on the NHS. ""For some hospitals, particularly in Covid hotspot areas, it will feel as if they are in the depths of winter already.""

"The government has scrapped plans to relax Covid rules at Christmas for London and much of south-east England, where tier four restrictions will now apply. In other regions of England - in tiers one to three - Christmas bubbles will now only be allowed on 25 December. Similar plans have been announced in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England's tier four areas, residents will only be allowed to celebrate Christmas with members of their own household and support bubbles. They will not be allowed to travel to other tiers to see family and friends. More parts of south-east and eastern Englandwill be placed in tier fourfrom 00:01 GMT on Saturday 26 December. Residents will be asked to stay at home and all non-essential shops must close. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live In areas in tiers one, two and three Christmas bubbles will no longer be across five days. Instead, three households coming together will now only be allowed on Christmas Day. People in these tiers are also being asked to stay local. They will not be allowed to host people who live in a tier four area. InWales(two households) andScotland(three households up to a maximum of eight people), Christmas bubbles will also only be allowed on 25 December. In both countries, people are being advised not to form a Christmas bubble, even though they are permitted. In Scotland, travel to and from other parts of the UK will not be allowed over the festive period.

"The UK hospitality industry says that new Covid rules in England ""are killing Christmas"" and has warned pubs, restaurants and hotels face going bust. The government will roll out regional restrictions after Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed the second lockdown in England will end on 2 December. But new rules mean pubs operating under Tier 2can only trade if customers have a ""substantial meal"". In Tier 3, pubs must shut and can only sell goods for takeaway. In contrast, gyms will be allowed to stay open under Tier 3 restrictions while outdoor and indoor spectator sports venues can reopen in Tier 1 and Tier 2 with limits. Non-essential shops and personal care, such as hairdressers, will also be allowed to reopen when lockdown ends. Mr Johnson said: ""I'm very sorry, obviously, for the unavoidable hardship that this will cause for business owners who have already endured so much disruption this year."" But UK Hospitality's chief executive Kate Nicholls said: ""The government is making a point of saying that these measures are needed in order to save Christmas. ""In reality, they are killing Christmas and beyond for many businesses and their customers who look forward to, and rely on, venues being open at this time of year. Sadly, for many staff, it will be a Christmas out of work."" What are the new rules for pubs after lockdown? Gyms and all shops to reopen after English lockdown Fans set to be allowed at outdoor sports The government also said it would ditch the 10pm curfew. However, pubs and restaurants must stop serving alcohol and food at 10pm and customers will have until 11pm to leave the premises. Ms Nicholls said that under the rules that were in place before the current lockdown came into force on 5 November, some 76% of its members warned their business ""would not be viable"" if Tier 2 restrictions remained in placed for three months. That number rose to 94% under the previous Tier 3 rules which stated that pubs could only stay open if they offered a substantial meal. But she said under the new rules ""large swathes will just not be able to open at all"". It's beginning to look a BIT like Christmas for some parts of the economy. For retailers considered non-essential, reopening on 3 December was absolutely crucial. That industry will be breathing a huge sigh of relief as they will now have an opportunity - albeit truncated - to sell the Christmas stock they have bought in. Industry sources told the BBC that although there had been a huge switch in consumer behaviour to internet shopping, the online pipe was still not wide enough to deliver Christmas on its own and the decision to reopen stores would help preserve hundreds of thousands of jobs. However, the hospitality industry is still looking at a very bleak winter. The prime minister said most of the UK would emerge from various forms of lockdown into a higher tier than they were in before it started. That is a disaster for pubs and restaurants. with 76% of them saying that even under the old Tier 2 conditions - in the middle - it was hardly worth opening as capacity was so constrained and alcohol sales so limited. UK Hospitality, which represents the sector, said the return to this would be ""devastating"" and risk one million jobs. The hospitality hit may have a knock-on effect on retailers as fewer shoppers are expected to take the streets if access to pubs, bars and restaurants is heavily restricted. MPs will vote on the proposed rules this week. Mr Johnson is expected to detail which regions in England will be placed into either Tier 1, 2 or 3 on Thursday. Mr Johnson said that ""without sensible precautions, we would risk the virus escalating into a winter or new year surge. The incidence of the disease is still, alas, widespread in many areas."" He said: ""While the previous local tiers did cut the 'R' number, they were not quite enough to reduce it below 1 so the scientific advice I'm afraid is that as we come out [of lockdown] our tiers need to be made tougher."" But Greater Manchester's Mayor Andy Burnham said a toughened Tier 3 ""could be devastating for the hospitality industry and will hit cities and the city economy very, very hard indeed"". William Lees-Jones, managing-director of the brewery and pub chain JW Lees, hopes his pubs are not in Tier 3 areas He warned that ""we will see widespread business failure"" in the hospitality sector if the tougher regional rules go ahead. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged Mr Johnson to outline which regions would be placed into which tier as soon as possible. William Lees-Jones, managing-director of the brewery and pub chain JW Lees, said: ""I just hope that we are all in Tier 2 which means that we can be in business. ""We've brewed an awful lot of beer which we won't have anything to do with."" What will pubs, cafes and gigs be like from 19 July?

"This video can not be played Biden: ""Itâs a team that reflects the fact that America is back"" US President-elect Joe Biden has unveiled officials for six important posts, as he prepares to take office. ""America is back"", he said, and ""ready to lead the world, not retreat from it"". If confirmed, Avril Haines will be the first female director of national intelligence and Alejandro Mayorkas the first Latino homeland security boss. Donald Trump has agreed transition moves must start and Mr Biden will now get a top secret intelligence brief. However, the sitting president still refuses to admit defeat, repeating unsubstantiated claims that the 3 November vote was ""rigged"". As well as getting the Presidential Daily Brief- an update on international threats and developments - Mr Biden can now access key government officials and millions of dollars in funds as he prepares to take over on 20 January. Could Biden's win doom this town? What Biden's new foreign policy team tells us What is the presidential transition? On Tuesday, Governor Tom Wolf said he had certified Mr Biden's victory in Pennsylvania, a key swing state. Another, Michigan, certified the same outcome on Monday. Speaking in Wilmington, Delaware, the president-elect highlighted the need to rebuild alliances, as well as tackling coronavirus and climate change. World leaders, he suggested, were ""looking forward to the United States reasserting its historic role as a global leader over the Pacific, as well as the Atlantic, all across the world"". Speaking to NBC News, he said: ""This president, President Trump, has changed the landscape. It's become America first, America alone. We find ourselves in a position where our alliances are being frayed."" Mr Biden also told reporters he had discussed the Irish border issue with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other leaders. US doesn't want guarded border on Ireland - Biden The 310-mile border at the heart of Brexit Mr Biden, who has Irish heritage, said he was against a guarded border, arguing it must be kept open: ""The idea of having the border north and south once again being closed, it's just not right."" This video can not be played Biden: ""We've just got to keep the border open"" between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland Speaking to NBC, Mr Biden said outreach from the White House had been ""sincere"", not ""begrudging"". There were, he said, plans for him to meet the Covid task force in the White House about vaccine distribution and access. Barack Obama's former vice-president said that his time in office would not be a ""third Obama term"" because ""we face a totally different world than we faced in the Obama-Biden administration"". Mr Biden has chosen Jake Sullivan, Linda Thomas-Greenfield and Antony Blinken for key roles Mr Biden presented six key figures on Tuesday: Antony Blinken,Secretary of state. Mr Blinken said the US would soon ""with equal measures of humility and confidence"" restore its relationships with other countries John Kerry,Climate change envoy.He was one of the leading architects of the Paris climate agreement, from which President Trump withdrew. Mr Kerry said the world must ""come together to end the climate crisis"" Avril Haines,Director of national intelligence. Mr Biden said: ""I picked a professional... a fierce advocate for telling the truth"". Alejandro Mayorkas,Secretary of homeland security. Mr Mayorkas said the department had ""a noble mission, to help keep us safe and to advance our proud history as a country of welcome"" Jake Sullivan,White House national security adviser.Mr Sullivan praised his boss, saying he had taught him much about statecraft, but also ""most importantly about human nature"" Linda Thomas-Greenfield,US ambassador to the UN.She said she brought her southern Louisiana roots to her job, calling it ""a cajun spin"" on ""gumbo diplomacy"" One choice that is expected but has not been announced yet is former Federal Reserve chairJanet Yellenas treasury secretary Alejandro Mayorkas (left) and Avril Haines (right) have been formally named; Janet Yellen (centre) is expected to be picked for the treasury Most of the picks, although not Mr Kerry or Mr Sullivan, will need confirmation by the Senate. Rejection of a nominee is rare. The last was in 1989, although some nominees have withdrawn from consideration. This video can not be played Robert Malley is a school friend of Antony Blinken Joe Biden's picks for the top roles in his administration have been celebrated by centrist Democrats: they speak glowingly of the diversity and experience of the individuals, a group that includes veteran foreign policy experts, and accomplished women and people of colour. Yet progressives feel cheated. They say they helped Mr Biden win, and now they have been shut out of power. These progressives say the cabinet will be filled with ""Clinton and Obama retreads"", as one of them puts it, describing it as a return to the ""Blob"", a term that Ben Rhodes, who served as Mr Obama's speechwriter, once used to describe the Washington establishment. Stephen Wertheim from the Quincy Institute, a think tank focused on foreign policy, says the new Democratic team in the White House may end up acting like the old one, a group of centrists who, he says, focused more on military threats than on issues such as climate change. He adds: ""Progressives have a right to be concerned about whether there will be significant change."" In a  brief appearance in the White House press room on Tuesday, Mr Trump praised the work of his administration, hailed the Dow Jones stock index for passing the 30,000 mark and left without taking questions. While praising the armed forces later in the Rose Garden, he said: ""And as I say, 'America First'. Shouldn't go away from that... 'America First'."" How is President Trump challenging the result?

"Charles Darwin's work on evolution theory by natural selection changed the way we think about the natural world Cambridge University Library has announced that two notebooks written by Charles Darwin, worth many millions of pounds, have been missing for 20 years. One of them contains the 19th Century scientist's famous Tree of Life sketch, exploring the evolutionary relationship between species. Following an ""extensive search"", curators have now concluded they have probably been stolen. They are launching a public appeal for help in trying to find them. ""This is heartbreaking,"" Dr Jessica Gardner, the university's librarian, tells the BBC. ""We will leave no stone unturned,"" in trying to discover what has happened, she adds. Charles Darwin's hunch about early life was probably right The notebooks were last seen in November 2000 after ""an internal request"" to remove them from a special manuscripts storeroom to be photographed. They were taken to a temporary studio, which at the time was in a temporary building in the grounds of the university library because building work was taking place. It was only during ""a routine check"" two months later that it was discovered they were missing. ""We know they were photographed in November,"" says Dr Gardner. ""But we do not know what happened between then and the time in January 2001, when it was determined they were not in their proper place on the shelves. ""And I'm afraid there isn't anything on the remaining record which tells us anything more."" His Tree of Life sketch is among the missing notes Initially librarians thought they might have been put back in the wrong place. ""My predecessors genuinely believed they had been misfiled and they would find them,"" adds Dr Gardner, who became director of library services in 2017. There were a number of ""intense"" searches over the years. They all drew a blank. Perhaps it is not that surprising given the size of the library. It is vast, containing more than 200km of shelving, roughly the distance from Cambridge to Southampton by road. It is home to more than 10 million maps and manuscripts and other objects. At the beginning of this year, Dr Gardner arranged a new search. Specialist staff combed through specific zones of the library's storage facilities. They conducted a ""fingertip"" check through 189 boxes which contain Darwin's books, drawings and letters. But still no notebooks. A new approach was needed, according to Dr Gardner. She says she was ""not willing to accept"" the notebooks would just ""turn up"". So she and her team ""completely reviewed what happened at the time and critically we took a big step back from what had become a common understanding that they had been mis-shelved. ""Reluctantly I have decided that was not the right conclusion."" Instead, she believes: ""These notebooks have probably been stolen."" Theft, she says, ""should be ruled in as a possibility from the start and that wasn't"". Security procedures, she explains, have been ""revised and reviewed"" and ""tightened"" over the last two decades. ""Now if anything of this scale and significance was not found we would be going to the police."" Cambridgeshire Police have now been informed and the disappearance of the notebooks has been recorded on the national Art Loss Register for missing cultural artefacts. The police have also added the missing notebooks to Interpol's database of stolen artworks. Cambridge University Library have appealed for the notebooks to be returned In July 1837, Charles Darwin was a young man of 28. At his home in London, he wrote at the top of the page of one of his red leather notebooks, ""I think"". Then he drew a spindly sketch of a tree. He had recently returned from the Galapagos Islands aboard HMS Beagle and was working through scientific ideas inspired by his trip. ""These notebooks really are Darwin's attempt to pose to himself the question about where do species come from, what is the origin of species?"" explains Jim Secord, emeritus professor of history and philosophy of science at Cambridge University. More than 20 years later, on 24 November 1859, Darwin published a more fully developed tree of life in On the Origin of Species. ""It's almost like being inside Darwin's head when you're looking at these notebooks,"" says Professor Secord. ""They're jottings of all sorts of information that he's writing down. ""You have the sense of him working through these ideas at great speed and that kind of intellectual energy which I think the notebooks really convey. ""I'm a fan of James Joyce and it's always struck me that it's a bit like Leopold Bloom on steroids. You just get the sense of scientific imagination running really deep."" Although the notebooks have been digitised, Professor Secord says the scans can never replace the real thing. ""To have such an iconic object go missing is really a tragedy."" Darwin produced two groundbreaking works - On the Origin of Species and The Descent of Man The notebooks themselves are small, no bigger than a postcard. They were kept in a bespoke blue box, about the size of a paperback. It is still possible the notebooks might be found. ""We won't stop looking,"" says Dr Gardner. But it will take another five years to complete a full search of the remaining shelves and storage rooms. In the meantime, the library is asking the public for help. ""There are good examples where things have been found, thanks to the help of the public,"" says Dr Gardner. ""So I would really appeal to members of the public, former staff, researchers, anyone who might have information which would shed light. But Dr Gardner is reluctant to speculate where the notebooks might be. ""It's possible they are under a bed, that's the best case scenario, someone has found they can't sell them or they're just holding on to them,"" she says. ""This is the time to just safely, even anonymously, get in touch. ""It's those new leads we're looking for, with the help of the police, in order to help recover these for the nation."" Anyone who may have information about the missing notebooks is asked to contact Cambridge University Library, via email at ManuscriptAppeal@lib.cam.ac.uk or Cambridgeshire Police. Charles Darwin was an English scientist - naturalist, geologist and biologist - best known for his work on the theory of evolution by natural selection. His groundbreaking work, On the Origin of Species, was published in 1859 and changed the way we think about the natural world. At the time it was highly controversial, as it provided evidence that certain animals had evolved from others over time, apparently best fit for their surroundings. This was at odds with the long-established religious belief that God had created all creatures, great and small. Darwin studied the divergence of 18 species of passerine birds [""Darwin's finches""] in the GalÃ¡pagos Islands, in the Pacific. He noted the remarkable diversity in beak form and function. ""Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history,"" he wrote, as a result. In his second seminal publication, 1871's The Descent of Man, Darwin applied his theory to the evolution of humans, suggesting we share a common ancestor with the great apes.

"Sickness absence levels in Northern Ireland councils are the highest in the UK, auditors have found. Figures show an average of almost 14 days per employee in 2018-19 - a 13% increase in five years. The findings come from a joint report by Northern Ireland's two public sector auditors. Teachers in Northern Ireland also take more sick days than other parts of the UK, according to the report. Auditor General Kieran Donnelly and Local Government Auditor Pamela McCreedy warned that sickness absence is placing a strain on services. Overall sickness absence in the Northern Ireland civil service has also increased by 10% in five years, with staff off for an average of almost 13 days annually. Northern Ireland's two public sector auditors said the levels are almost double that within the civil service in England. It comes after a report last week by the auditor general revealed how Northern Ireland's civil service isstruggling to cope because of a crisis in staffing levelswith almost 1,500 unfilled vacancies. According to the figures published in the latest, report council workers in 2018/19 took on average 14 days off because of sickness. That compares to 11 days for councils in Scotland and eight in England and Wales. the auditors point to long term absences in many cases caused by mental health illness as being a key reason for the high levels of sickness. Northern Ireland has the highest rates of mental illness in the UK with one in five adults experiencing a mental health problem at any given time. The age profile of those who work in councils and the wider civil service is another contributing factor. Over 40 per cent are over the age of 50 and as a result are more prone to develop health complication. This table shows the average number of days lost due to sickness across NI councils The highest level of sickness absence among council workers was recorded in Causeway Coast and Glens, with 17 days lost to sickness per employee, while the lowest was in Fermanagh and Omagh council were on average 10 days were lost. ""High levels of sickness absence within the public sector are not a new phenomenon. However, this report finds few signs of sustained improvement,"" said Mr Donnelly. ""It is time for public sector organisations to make a concerted effort to reduce the level of sickness absence and to develop a consistent approach to managing attendance."" Mr Donnelly said a ""strong attendance culture needs to be embedded"" across the public sector and he called for a heavy focus to be placed on long term absence with preventative and early intervention measures put in place. ""Sickness absence in NI councils consistently ranks as the highest in the UK, with no indication of significant improvement,"" said Mr Donnelly. ""When significant numbers of staff are unable to work because of sickness, the impact on service delivery including delays, increased workloads, lost productivity and additional financial costs to cover absences is likely to be considerable."" The auditors also report that teachers in 2018/19 took almost 10 days off because of sickness which is an increase of 10% in the past five years. The figure is also the highest in the UK with teachers in Scotland taking six days off while four days per employee were lost in England. he auditors point to long term absences in many cases caused by mental health illness as being a key reason for the high levels of sickness.

"The inquiry focuses on the work of a consultant urologist at Craigavon Area Hospital Northern Ireland's health minister has ordered a statutory public inquiry into ""serious concerns"" about the clinical practice of a hospital consultant. Robin Swann said that hundreds of families had been contacted by his department as a result of a review into urology consultant Aidan O'Brien. Over 1,000 patients' records have been recalled at the Southern Health Trust. The trust said it shared the ""high level of concern"" and ""will be fully co-operating with the Inquiry process"". Preparing for his retirement in June,  Mr O'Brien handed over his case files to the health trust. The BBC understands that it emerged that the treatment of two patients was incomplete - they still required surgery. On further inspection of cases, other issues emerged which eventually led to an investigation of Mr O'Brien's work between January 2019 and June 2020. It comes as an independent inquiry into neurologist Dr Michael Watt is upgraded to a public inquiry. Public inquiries are set up to uncover the truth following scandals or perceived injustices, and have the power to compel people to give testimony, and gather other forms of evidence. Dr Watt was at the centre of Northern Ireland'sbiggest ever patient recall. In 2018, about 3,000 patients were recalled as part of an investigation into his work at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital. Mr Swann ""unreservedly"" apologised to patients and their families for the ""upset and distress caused"" by the review into consultant Aidan O'Brien. Urology, the healthcare area he worked in, deals with the urinary tract in both men and women and male genital organs. Like other areas of NI's healthcare system, it has extensive waiting lists. In a statement to the assembly, Mr Swann said that the Southern Trust contacted his department on 31 July, ""to report an early alert concerning the clinical practice of this consultant"". The minister said the trust informed his department that it had become aware of potential concerns by 7 June, regarding delays of treatment for surgery patients under the care of the consultant urologist. The trust had become aware that two out of 10 patients listed for surgery were not on the hospital's patient administration system at that time. Robin Swann made a statement to the Northern Ireland Assembly After these issues were raised, a look back at the consultant's work was undertaken, with Mr Swann telling the assembly 1,159 patients' records have initially been reviewed and 271 patients or families have been contacted by the trust. Patients recalled after urology review Neurology inquiry concerns not unique, says chair Children's hospital deaths were avoidable Mr Swann said nine cases have so far been identified that meet the threshold for a serious adverse incident (SAI) review, while a further six cases are being reviewed in more detail to establish if those patients have come to harm. Mr Swann said the concerns about clinical practice of the consultant urologist are ""of the gravest concern"". The health minister said it would ""take some time"" before the inquiry began, and the families and patients would have an ""opportunity to influence the terms of reference of the inquiry"". Within an hour, two public health inquiries were announced and an apology was delivered by the health minister. It's not often that events move so quickly in Northern Ireland. Such haste around the urology inquiry signals two things: It is extremely serious, and Robin Swann wants to be seen to be taking the lead. Both recalls have much in common, centring on the work of two individual consultants and the health and welfare of hundreds of patients. The General Medical Council - the healthcare regulator for medical professionals - is also involved with both consultants. And there are questions over the private work that both men were carrying out - in Mr O'Brien's case at his home. By now, Northern Ireland should be an expert in holding public health inquiries. While theinquiry into hyponatraemiawas one of the longest-running in the UK,those into neurologyandthe scandal at Muckamoreare likely to take years to complete. While Northern Ireland is gathering experience in this field, one obvious question has to be asked: When do lessons start being learned? The Southern Trust's Chief Executive Shane Devlin said it was likely more patients would be contacted as reviews of patient notes continue to be carried out. ""I sincerely apologise for the distress and concern this news will cause,"" he said. ""We have already been in touch with patients/families who we have identified through our urgent review of cases, and invited those who we have clinical concerns about to come for a review appointment so we can be assured that their treatment is appropriate."" Colm Gildernew, chairman of the Stormont health committee described the situation as ""concerning"" but welcomed the announcement of an inquiry. DUP MLA Jonathan Buckley said it would ""no doubt cause concern for patients across the southern trust"". Alliance Party MLA Paula Bradshaw said the common factor connecting the medical scandals related toMuckamore,neurology,hyponatraemiaand this are all clinical governance. ""How many times are we going to be brought to this chamber as MLAs to discuss breakdowns in clinical governance?"" she asked. Neurology Inquiry, November 2020Robin Swann announced on Tuesday the Independent Neurological Inquiry would be upgraded to a public inquiry. It is looking at concerns raised about potential misdiagnoses by neurologist Michael Watt in the Belfast Trust, in whichmore than 3,000 patients were recalled. The independent inquiry was launched in May 2018. Muckamore Abbey Hospital, September 2020A public inquiry intoallegations of physical and mental abuse of patientsdating back to 2017 was announced in September. So far 15 people have been arrested in relation to the ill-treatment of patients at the facility, with the most recent arrest taking place on Monday. No one has yet been charged. Hyponatraemia, November 2004The 14-year inquiry into the hyponatraemia-related deaths of five children in Northern Ireland's hospitals was the longest running in British history whenit reported in January 2018. Hyponatraemia is a medical condition that occurs when there is a shortage of sodium in the bloodstream, and the inquiry found four out of the five deaths were avoidable. The minister said he hoped the inquiries would get to the ""root cause"" of the problems. Sinn FÃ©in MLA John O'Dowd described the minister's announcements as probably one of the most disturbing he had heard. He said there was a problem within the ""culture"" of the health service, and that consultants ""have too much power"". Mr Swann said he ""unfortunately recognised"" what Mr O'Dowd had said.

"England's education secretary acted unlawfully in scrapping a string of legal protections for children in care, Appeal Court judges have ruled. They said Gavin Williamson should have consulted England's children's commissioner and other groups, before scrapping 65 safeguards for children. The court said consulting such bodies would have been ""manifestly in the interest of vulnerable children"". The government says it is disappointed by the ruling. Children's rights group Article 39 mounted the challenge against what it called a ""bonfire of children's rights"" after the government changed the rules safeguarding children through the Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) regulations in April. Parliament did not debate the changes until after they were introduced in April. The legal challenge came after a lengthy battle between the government, peers, opposition MPs and children's rights groups over attempts to push through the changes which cover the rights to support for children in care. The High Court previously ruled in the government's favour. Government challenged on children's rights Ministers' U-turn over children's rights 'Bonfire of children's rights' opposed The regulations affected included legal timescales for social-worker visits to children in care, six-monthly reviews of children's welfare, independent scrutiny of children's homes and senior officer oversight of adoption decision-making for babies and children. The protections affected also cover disabled children having short breaks and children in care sent many miles away from home. The government had argued in an earlier court hearing that these changes were ""minor bureaucratic burdens"", but the Appeal Court said the alterations to children's rights were ""substantial and wide-ranging"". After the government review of the legislation was begun in February, Department for Education officials had private telephone, email and face-to-face conversations with adoption agencies, private providers and local government bodies. But bodies representing children and young people affected by the changes were not consulted, and the children's commissioner - the statutory protector of children's issues - was not informed until after the changes went through. Announcing the ruling, Lord Justice Baker said: ""I can find nothing about the circumstances that existed in March 2020 to justify the secretary of state's decision (if indeed any conscious decision was made) to exclude the children's commissioner and other bodies representing the rights of children in care from the consultation on which he embarked. ""He decided to undertake a rapid informal consultation, substantially by email."" He said he found it appropriate for the consultation to be carried out that way because of the circumstances of the start of the coronavirus pandemic. ""But having decided to undertake the consultation, there was no good reason why that process should not have included the children's commissioner and the other bodies,"" he said. ""On the contrary, there were very good reasons why they should have been included."" Lord Baker said it was ""potentially misleading"" for the government to claim their actions were ""broadly endorsed by the sector"". The children's commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, said she would be seeking urgent assurances from the DfE that this would not be repeated in future. Carolyne Willow, director of Article 39, called the government's actions ""shameful, both in the scale of the protections they took away from very vulnerable children in England and the way they went about it"". ""This should draw to a close back-room, secret government consultations which exclude the rights , views and experiences of children and young people."" A DfE spokesman said: ""Protecting vulnerable children has been at the heart of our response to the Covid-19 pandemic, and our intention has always been to act in their best interests. ""We took swift action to bring in temporary changes during a national crisis, all of which have now expired. ""We will continue working with the Children's Commissioner and children's charities to provide the best possible support to vulnerable children.""

"One of the bones comes from the tibia (lower leg bone) of a two-legged meat-eater similar to Sarcosaurus The only dinosaur bones ever found in Ireland have been confirmed to belong to two different species. The bones were previously discovered on the east coast of County Antrim. But a new scientific study from the universities of Portsmouth and Queen's in Belfast has confirmed the origins of the bones for the first time. One is part of the lower leg bone of a carnivore similar to Sarcosaurus; the other is from the upper leg bone of a Scelidosaurus, a four-legged herbivore. The two fossil bones, confirmed to be from early Jurassic rocks, were discovered in Islandmagee during two separate finds in the late 19th Century and the 1980s. Originally it was assumed the fossils were from the same animal, but new analysis published in the Proceedings of the Geologists' Association has confirmed they belong to the two different species. Ireland was underwater for most of the period during which dinosaurs roamed the earth, so there is less chance the remains of land animals would be preserved in rocks dating to that period. Ulster Museum has announced plans to put the bones on display when it reopens after the current coronavirus restrictions are lifted. Dr Mike Simms, a curator and palaeontologist at National Museums NI, said the development was ""a hugely significant discovery"". Experts suggest Scelidosaurus may have been a coastal animal, perhaps even eating seaweed like modern-day marine iguanas ""The great rarity of such fossils here is because most of Ireland's rocks are the wrong age for dinosaurs, either too old or too young, making it nearly impossible to confirm dinosaurs existed on these shores,"" he said. ""The two dinosaur fossils... found were perhaps swept out to sea, alive or dead, sinking to the Jurassic seabed where they were buried and fossilised."" Robert Smyth, researcher at the University of Portsmouth and Professor David Martill, used high-resolution 3D digital models of the fossils in their analysis of the bone fragments, produced by Dr Patrick Collins of Queen's University Belfast. ""Analysing the shape and internal structure of the bones, we realised that they belonged to two very different animals,"" said Mr Smyth, who is originally from Ballymoney. ""Despite being fragmentary, these fossils provide valuable insight on a very important period in dinosaur evolution, about 200 million years ago. ""It's at this time that dinosaurs really start to dominate the world's terrestrial ecosystems."" Professor Martill said: ""Scelidosaurus keeps on turning up in marine strata, and I am beginning to think that it may have been a coastal animal, perhaps even eating seaweed like marine iguanas do today."" The study is part of a larger project to document Jurassic rocks in Northern Ireland and draws on many fossils in Ulster Museum's collections.

"Britons should stop ""soldiering on"" by going to work when sick and making others ill, the health secretary says. Matt Hancock said people in the UK were ""peculiarly unusual and outliers"" for still going to work when unwell. He made the comments in a joint session of the Health and Social Care and the Science and Technology committees. He also told MPs he would like to see the diagnostic capacity built for Covid used to test for other illnesses like flu once the pandemic had passed. The UK now has the capacity to carry out over 500,000 tests a day, with new labs to be opened next year to double that number. He said he wanted to see the ""global-scale diagnostics capability"" continued to be used. ""Afterwards we must use it, not just for coronavirus, but everything,"" he told MPs. ""I want to have a change in the British way of doing things where 'if in doubt, get a test' doesn't just refer to coronavirus but refers to any illness that you might have. ""Why in Britain do we think it's acceptable to soldier on and go into work if you have flu symptoms or a runny nose, thus making your colleagues ill? ""I think that's something that is going to have to change. ""If you have, in future, flu-like symptoms, you should get a test for it and find out what's wrong with you, and if you need to stay at home to protect others, then you should stay at home. ""We are peculiarly unusual and outliers in soldiering on and still going to work, and it kind of being the culture that 'as long as you can get out of bed you still should get into work'. That should change. ""This year there's been far fewer respiratory and other communicable diseases turning up in the NHS. ""I want this massive diagnostics capacity to be core to how we treat people in the NHS so that we help people to stay healthy in the first place, rather than just looking after them when they're ill.""

"The salon has opened at least twice over the November lockdown A hair salon owner is facing Â£17,000 in fines for repeatedly opening in breach of Covid-19 lockdown rules. Sinead Quinn was working at Quinn Blakey Hairdressers in Oakenshaw, Bradford, on Saturday when Kirklees Council officers issued a Â£4,000 fine. The council found the salon open again on Monday and issued a further Â£10,000 fine. It already had Â£1,000 and Â£2,000 fines for previous breaches. Ms Quinn said on Instagram she did not consent to or accept the fines. More stories from around Yorkshire The salon owner posted videos on the social networking site which show her talking to council officials and police, saying she had not broken any laws. On the video, she is heard saying: ""I don't consent to any fines, so it will just be returned to sender."" A similar sign to the one on the salon door, which references Magna Carta She had also displayed a poster on the salon door which refers to Magna Carta, and says the shop is ""under the jurisdiction of common law"". England is currently in anational lockdown with strict ruleswhich say non-essential shops, including hairdressers, must close. A council spokesman confirmed the fines, saying it had found the business to be ""open and trading"". The first was on 9 November, when a prohibition notice to close was served and Â£1,000 fine issued, and the second on 12 November, when a Â£2,000 fine was imposed.

The council said Quinn Blakey had been found to be open on Tuesday 24 November, but it later transpired there were no clients in the salon, so a Â£10,000 fine was not issued on that occasion.

"Nearly nine in 10 products sold on Black Friday are available for the same price or cheaper earlier in the year, according to consumer group Which?. It urged consumers to ""do some research"" in order to spot genuine bargains during the 27 November sale. Retailers including Amazon, Argos and John Lewis said they offered good deals all year round, not just during seasonal shopping events. Many shoppers see Black Friday as a way to buy gifts cheaply before Christmas. More than two-thirds have delayed a purchase to try to find a bargain in the sale, according to Lloyds Bank. It expects Black Friday spending in the UK to soar to Â£750m this year. Black Friday emissions boom predicted Black Friday on Amazon: How to spot fake reviews online Which? tracked the prices of 219 popular home and tech products for six months before the 2019 sale and for six months afterwards. It looked at goods from Amazon, AO.com, Argos, Currys PC World and John Lewis and found only three items were at their cheapest on Black Friday. Natalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at Which?, said: ""Deals that look too good to be true often are, so don't fall for time-limited offers and if you are looking for something in particular, do some research first. ""That way you'll know a genuine bargain when you see one."" Currys PC World was the retailer most likely to have cheaper or similar pricing earlier in the year. For example, a pair of Bose Quietcomfort headphones at the retailer was Â£249 on Black Friday but had been cheaper or the same price on at least 15 occasions in the previous six months. At John Lewis, 70 of 78 products were found to have cost the same or less before the sale. For example, a De'Longhi coffee machine cost Â£1,285 on Black Friday, but had cost the same or less on at least 35 occasions beforehand - falling to less than Â£1,200 on several days in May and June 2019. Amazon came out top of the retailers Which? looked at, although over half (57%) of its products were available cheaper or for the same price in the six months before Black Friday. Responding to the research, most retailers stressed that they price-matched throughout the year. Amazonsaid: ""We seek to offer our customers great value thanks to low prices all year round as well as a number of fantastic seasonal deals events."" AO Worldsaid:""Last year's Black Friday event had over 9,000 fantastic and fair offers for customers and we expect this year to be even bigger."" Argossaid: ""Our Black Friday event gives customers access to hundreds of products at their lowest ever price. They may also be part of sales and promotions we run the following year."" Currys PC Worldsaid it price-matched throughout the year and has additional sales ""to ensure we keep our promise of amazing tech that is affordable and accessible"". John Lewissaid: ""In addition to the variety of offers we have in-store and online during the promotional period, our never knowingly undersold price promise means that we continuously monitor and match the prices of our high street competitors throughout the year."" Shoppers are also being warned to watch out for Black Friday scams. Barclays said consumers who fall victim to an online scam this week could lose an average of Â£735 each. Electronics, trainers, phones and clothing are all popular products used to trick people. Criminals set up fake websites and may offer goods that are bogus, shoddy, or never arrive. A bargain is only a bargain if you get a cheaper price for something you were going to buy anyway. Which? says shoppers should do their research, which may include using websites to check previous prices, and should not buy on impulse. Debt charities would say that, even before you get to that point, make sure you are not busting a budget. Only buy what you can afford and, if it is on credit, have a strict plan to make repayments. Getting caught up in a Black Friday frenzy risks your financial health and, research has shown, your mental health, if a spending spree gets out of control.

If the body remains unclaimed for 35 days, the organisation brings it to the crematorium and performs the Dagbatti rituals, which in Hindu culture are usually performed by the son of the deceased. > There are homeless, abandoned people across the world.

If the body remains unclaimed for 35 days, the organisation brings it to the crematorium and performs the Dagbatti rituals, which in Hindu culture are usually performed by the son of the deceased. > There are homeless, abandoned people across the world.

The BBC's 100 Women team drew up a shortlist based on names gathered by them and suggested by the BBC's network of World Service languages teams. We were looking for candidates who had made the headlines or influenced important stories over the past 12 months, as well as those who have inspiring stories to tell, achieved something significant or influenced their societies in ways that wouldn't necessarily make the news. The pool of names was then assessed against this year's theme - women who led change - and measured for regional representation and due impartiality, before the final names were chosen.

"This video can not be played How other incumbents left the White House after losing Donald Trump has accepted a formal US transition should begin for President-elect Joe Biden to take office. The president said the federal agency overseeing the handover must ""do what needs to be done"", even as he vowed to keep contesting his election defeat. The General Services Administration (GSA) said it was acknowledging Mr Biden as the ""apparent winner"". It came as Mr Biden's victory in the state of Michigan was officially certified, a major blow to Mr Trump. The GSA announcement means the president-elect now has access to top security briefings, office space and government officials as he prepares to take office on 20 January. His transition website has now changed to a US government domain,external. He will begin announcing the people he wants in the top jobs in his cabinet on Tuesday. What Biden's new foreign policy team tells us Biden to pick 'first US female treasury secretary' Why does the US presidential transition matter? It welcomed the start of the transition process as the Democratic president-elect gears up to be sworn in. Joe Biden has been elected America's 46th president ""Today's decision is a needed step to begin tackling the challenges facing our nation, including getting the pandemic under control and our economy back on track,"" a team statement said. Earlier, Mr Biden unveiled his nominations for his foreign policy and national security team, consisting of old colleagues from his years in the Obama administration. He is set to appoint Anthony Blinken as secretary of state and John Kerry as climate envoy, while Janet Yellen is tipped to be the first female US treasury secretary. The list of selections came ahead of a formal announcement Tuesday. Most of the appointments will require Senate confirmation. Mr Trump tweeted as the GSA, which is tasked with formally beginning presidential changeovers, informed the Biden camp that it would start the transition process. GSA administrator Emily Murphy said she was making $6.3m (Â£4.7m) in funds available to the president-elect. Mr Trump said: ""In the best interest of our Country, I am recommending that Emily and her team do what needs to be done,externalwith regard to initial protocols, and have told my team to do the same."" He did not concede, however, and went on to repeat unsubstantiated claims of corruption, pledging to keep up the ""good fight"". It is worth noting that Mr Trump does not have to concede for Mr Biden to be sworn in as the 46th US president. GSA chief Emily Murphy wrote in a letter to Mr Biden on Monday that he could begin to prepare to take the reins of power Ms Murphy, a Trump appointee, cited ""recent developments involving legal challenges and certifications of election results"" in her decision to start the transition process. She said she had received no pressure from the White House over the timing of the move. ""I did, however, receive threats online, by phone, and by mail directed at my safety, my family, my staff, and even my pets in an effort to coerce me into making this determination prematurely,"" Ms Murphy said in a letter to Mr Biden. ""Even in the face of thousands of threats I have remained committed to upholding the law."" She had faced criticism from both political sides for failing to begin the transition process sooner, usually a routine step between the election and the inauguration. Although most of Mr Trump's fellow Republicans have united behind his refusal to accept defeat until now, some have increasingly been breaking rank. Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander, who is retiring, said the president should ""put the country first"" and help Mr Biden succeed. ""When you are in public life, people remember the last thing you do."" This video can not be played BBC Reality Check breaks down the bill for the world's most expensive election West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito said ""at some point, the 2020 election must end"". More than 160 business leaders had also urged Ms Murphy in an open letter to immediately recognise Mr Biden as president-elect. ""Withholding resources and vital information from an incoming administration puts the public and economic health and security of America at risk,â³ they wrote. Michigan is the latest hotly contested state to certify its election result, despite disputes from Mr Trump's campaign. Mr Biden won in Michigan by more than 154,000 votes. However, Mr Trump claimed voter fraud swayed the outcome, without offering evidence. The president's Republican allies had called for the certification - which finalises the outcome of a state's popular vote - to be delayed for two weeks to audit ballots in a heavily Democratic county. However, the Michigan Board of State Canvassers voted to certify the result on Monday. One of two Republicans on the Michigan State Board of Canvassers joined the two Democrats to finalise the outcome. The other Republican board member, Norman Shinkle, abstained, suggesting delaying the certification over irregularities affecting a few hundred votes in one county. Can Trump overturn the election result? 'Overvoting' and other US fraud claims fact-checked This video can not be played How to move on after the US election Mr Biden will now receive all 16 of the state's votes in the US Electoral College, which is expected to approve Mr Biden's victory on 14 December. Mr Trump's legal team said they would still challenge Michigan's results. Mr Trump and his allies have suffered a string of court defeats in key states as they race to challenge the results. InPennsylvania, a Republican judge on Saturday ruled that the Trump campaign had tried to ""disenfranchise almost seven million voters"" with no real evidence. The president's lawyers have appealed now to the Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. The president's other legal efforts in the state have failed to change Mr Biden's lead of some 80,000 votes. The Trump campaign has also called for another recount inGeorgia, after an earlier recount by hand confirmed Mr Biden's win in the state. InWisconsin, a partial recount is under way by request of the Trump campaign. Election officials have accused Trump supporters of obstructing the state's recount of votes. They said observers for Mr Trump were in some cases challenging every single ballot to deliberately slow down proceedings. Who will be the next US president?

"The salon has opened at least twice over the November lockdown A hair salon owner is facing Â£17,000 in fines for repeatedly opening in breach of Covid-19 lockdown rules. Sinead Quinn was working at Quinn Blakey Hairdressers in Oakenshaw, Bradford, on Saturday when Kirklees Council officers issued a Â£4,000 fine. The council found the salon open again on Monday and issued a further Â£10,000 fine. It already had Â£1,000 and Â£2,000 fines for previous breaches.

"As much as Â£1bn in benefit fraud has been prevented from being paid to organised-crime groups in recent months, BBC News has learned. But before the scam was spotted, officials unwittingly confirmed thousands of stolen identities. Fraudsters took advantage of looser rules introduced to cope with a surge of universal credit claims during the pandemic. BBC News has asked the Department for Work and Pensions for a response. In May, a junior civil servant working with High Street banks noticed dozens of claims for universal credit had been made asking for money to be paid into the same bank account. Further investigation identified more than 100,000 fraudulent claims. And officials admit they had confirmed thousands of people's identities to the gangs that had stolen them - and passed on their National Insurance numbers. The Department for Work and Pensions wants to write to those whose data has been compromised. But BBC News has learned it is struggling to identify many of them and is wary of sending out letters to last known addresses in case they end up in the wrong hands, exacerbating the data breach. Claimants whose identities have been stolen can face real hardship, as it can be months before their accurate benefits are paid. Currently, 5.7 million people receive universal credit, almost double the figure for March. To cope with the surge, identity checks were processed online, rather than face-to-face, and information such as the cost of rent and whether someone had been self-employed taken on trust. Criminal gangs have attacked several government Covid-19 schemes. In May, officials told BBC Newsabout Â£1.5bn may already have been lost in fraudulent universal credit payments Last month, a National Audit Office report foundas much as Â£3bn may have been lost through the furlough scheme DWP officials have asked the Treasury for Â£200m over three years, in this spending round, calculating it would enable it to prevent such mass scams and save taxpayers about Â£500m each year. It is estimated more than a million claims for universal credit have still to be properly checked, with additional rising concerns tens of thousands of people may have claimed the benefit without declaring they had received government grants to help the self-employed. However, the Treasury has turned down the request. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"People arriving in England from abroad will be soon able to reduce their quarantine by more than half if they pay for a Covid test after five days, the transport secretary has announced. The rules will come into force from 15 December and the tests from private firms will cost between Â£65 and Â£120. Grant Shapps said the scheme would ""bolster international travel while keeping the public safe"". The travel industry welcomed the policy but described it as ""long overdue"". It follows Boris Johnson's announcement thatEngland will come under ""toughened"" three-tiered regional restrictionswhen the lockdown ends on 2 December. Under the new travel rules, passengers who arrive from a foreign destination not on the government's travel corridors list will still need to enter self-isolation. However, if they pay for a test after five days and it comes back negative, they will no longer need to self-isolate. Results will normally be issued in 24 to 48 hours. This means people could be released from quarantine six days after arrival. Mr Shapps said: ""Our new testing strategy will allow us to travel more freely, see loved ones and drive international business. By giving people the choice to test on day five, we are also supporting the travel industry as it continues to rebuild out of the pandemic."" Who has to quarantine when arriving in the UK? Can I take a winter holiday after lockdown? Scotland and Northern Ireland are considering a similar scheme while Wales said it was ""supportive in principle of the proposals for a Test and Release scheme"". A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We will need to consider the data and evidence underpinning this scheme before making any decisions on changing international travel restrictions in Wales."" Scotland said it was working with the main commercial airports in Scotland and clinical advisers to understand the risks and benefits of the scheme as well as the capacity of private sector labs to conduct testing to a minimum standard. A spokesperson added: ""It is important that any travellers arriving in the UK understand, and respect, the different restrictions in place in the different nations."" That means that if someone is flying into England but their final destination is an address in Scotland, it would not be possible for passengers to take the test in England. Northern Ireland's Department of Health said: ""Consideration is currently being given to the implementation of testing scheme which could potentially allow those who have arrived in Northern Ireland from a non-exempt country to end their self-isolation following receipt of a negative test, which would be privately provided."" A step in the right direction - that's how airlines are describing the government's decision to ease the quarantine regime. The industry is in survival mode, desperate for money so anything that could open up routes and bring in much-needed cash is being welcomed. And this does raise the prospect of Christmas holiday ticket sales. But they say the new plan is still far from perfect. Passengers will still have to go into quarantine, and realistically, a test on day five is still likely to leave them in isolation for the best part of a week in total, as they wait for the results to come through. There's also the cost. The test has to be done privately, and typical prices range from Â£100-150. For a family of four, for example, that's a sizeable extra chunk on the cost of a winter holiday. What airlines are calling for is something more radical. They want a pre-departure testing regime, or a system of quick, regular and cheap tests - which would allow quarantine to be avoided altogether, until a vaccine is ready. But they say this announcement means there is, at least, some light at the end of the tunnel. This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, the industry association representing UK-registered carriers, said the announcement provided ""light at the end of the tunnel"" for the aviation industry and people wanting to go on holiday. He predicted demand for air travel will ""tentatively return"" following the decision but said a pre-departure testing regime that can completely remove the need to self-isolate is ""the only way we're going to comprehensively reopen the market"". Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme quarantine for arrivals was a ""fig leaf that doesn't work"" and that testing for travellers coming to England should happen before departure, rather than after arrival. He also ruled out requiring proof of vaccination for passengers on short-haul routes after Australian carrier Qantassaid it would require it for travellers. Mike and Lucy Hansford When Mike Hansford, 27, travels to the Canary Islands for Christmas next month, he and his family will already have paid a private company Â£120 each for a Covid test. The Spanish island insists that visitors produce a negative Covid test done within the previous 72 hours when they reach its shores. ""We have looked into the NHS's service,"" said Mr Hansford. ""However, what we were explicitly told by the Foreign Office was: 'Do not go to the NHS for your Covid test. You must have one done privately'."" Mr Hansford, who is travelling with his wife Lucy, her parents and two friends, said he assumed they were told to go private to keep tests free for people who are not well, as well as guaranteeing the results arrive in time. On the way back, Mr Hansford said it was highly unlikely he and his wife would pay a further Â£120 for another private test as both work from home and are happy to quarantine for 14 days. ""But I'm not sure how my friends who I'm travelling with will feel,"" he said. ""One of them is a builder and a carpenter by trade so I think it is safe to say he'd rather probably avoid a two-week quarantine."" SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

""The situation has reached a crisis point and the government cannot let coronavirus run riot in schools any longer,"" said Mary Bousted, co-leader of the National Education Union, with almost 900,000 pupils out of school because of Covid incidents. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, backed the principle of keeping schools open, but said it was time for schools to be allowed to operate rota systems. ""The reality behind these figures is that many schools are experiencing disruption on a monumental scale and are desperately trying to cling on to the end of term,"" said the heads' leader. Pupils sent home in half of England's secondary schools More secondary pupils missing lessons during pandemic Almost one in five secondary schools sending pupils home ""The other parents and I have a WhatsApp group and our phones ping and we're all filled with dread over which year group is told to isolate next,"" says Josephine Abbott Millar, a parent from Rugby. Her two sons have faced school being disrupted - and she says they have missed the social life as well as lessons at school. Not every family has the technology to allow children to switch to learning online ""As my eldest has started a new school I think he's really suffered as he's not been allowed to settled in properly,"" she told the BBC. ""Every time he starts to feel a bit settled he has to isolate again for two weeks and he's home again. It's the back and forth that is really disruptive."" There have been concerns about how exams will go ahead next summer when so many pupils have been missing lessons. Russell Hobby, chief executive of Teach First, said being out of school would be most disruptive for the most disadvantaged. ""Studying from home is difficult for all pupils. But our research has found it's pupils from the poorest backgrounds who are the least likely to have laptops and internet while self-isolating, making it nearly impossible for them,"" he said. ""These children will not recover from this if we don't acknowledge the barriers they face,"" says Matthew Martin, head of department in a south London secondary school. He says some pupils have missed a month already this term and only a limited number will really be able continue learning online at home. This is not because of an unwillingness to keep studying, he says, but because families do not have the computer equipment at home to make it possible. England's Department for Education has been committed to keeping schools open, but the weekly figures show rising numbers of pupils missing from the classroom. Overall attendance is down to 83% of pupils, below 86% in the previous week - and although the way figures were gathered changed in October, they show attendance dipping since half term. This fall is particularly concentrated in secondary schools, with 78% in class last Thursday, down from 87% on 5 November. Across both primary and secondary schools, the figures show about one in 10 pupils were out of school because of Covid-related concerns. The great majority of pupils being sent home are because of potential contacts - rather than pupils having caught coronavirus, with only 0.2% of pupils recorded as confirmed cases. Primary schools have so far been less disrupted, with 87% of pupils attending - but the number of schools sending home one more pupils has risen to 29%, compared with 22% the week before. There have been worries about how exams will go ahead next summer Among secondary schools, 73% were sending home pupils, compared with 64% the week before. A Department for Education spokeswoman said almost all schools had remained open this term - and there was online learning for those pupils who were self-isolating. ""It is a national priority to keep education settings open full-time, and that remains equally as important in the weeks up to the end of term as it was when young people returned for the new school year,"" said the DFE spokeswoman.

"As coronavirus began spreading around the world at the start of 2020, in the UK there were weaknesses in the expert analysis of its likely impact, according to a BBC documentary. ""There is going to be a lot of criticism of the scientists - because it's easy to have hindsight. ""It's easy to say if only we'd done this a week earlier we'd have saved 5,000, 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 lives. But if you look at where we were in February, would you really have made these decisions any differently? I don't think you would have."" Those are the words of Prof Calum Semple of the University of Liverpool, one of the key scientists advising the government on Covid-19. Inside an ICU fighting Covid-19 Ever since the novel coronavirus arrived in the UK, ministers have repeatedly said they were ""following the science"". But the UK has ended up with one of the worst death rates in the world - coronavirus has killed more than 50,000 people so far. So how good was the scientific evidence provided in the run-up to lockdown? On 23 January 2020, a woman unknowingly infected with coronavirus flew to the UK from Wuhan and passed through the airport undetected. Eight days later she, and a family member,became the first confirmed UK cases. Prof Semple says criticism was inevitable But what wasn't understood was how many others then followed in their footsteps through February and March - not just from China, but from across Europe. Fergus Walsh: Was coronavirus here earlier than we thought? Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? ""What we hadn't realised was that the virus had already moved into Italy, France and Spain, and was in the ski resorts,"" says Prof Semple, who is on Sage, the government's scientific advisory group. ""It turns out that we had probably 1,500 cases that came in during that period, and that's why Britain was hit so hard. We were given a really bad dose at a very early stage in a large number."" Italy was the first European country to be badly hit by Covid-19 Prof Graham Medley, who chairs the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M), which feeds in to Sage, agrees. ""If I could have known one thing, it would have been the number of imports coming in from mainland Europe. ""I should have thought that if northern Italy has got an epidemic then it's quite likely that other places in Europe have probably got an epidemic as well, and I didn't think that."" Prof Gabriel Scally, a public health expert and former health adviser to Labour, said: ""There was a steady flow of people coming in from various countries as the virus spread. ""We left our borders open, we left our door open to the virus, and that contributed substantially to the very rapid growth in the virus that we subsequently saw."" Information about those early cases was fed into a database called the First Few Hundred (FF100), which was closely studied by modellers for clues about how the virus might spread . Data on Ebola may have been better than that from the current pandemic But there was a problem. ""Unfortunately the First Few Hundred data was not as good as we expected,"" says another SPI-M member, Dr Thibaut Jombart, from Imperial College London. ""There were clearly quite a few mistakes: basic information, basic epidemiological information, was missing. ""At the time I was coming back from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where I spent six months as part of the response to an Ebola outbreak - a very, very messy situation in a warzone, you expect messy data there. It felt like the data situation was less good in the UK than it was in the DRC."" But Prof Medley, who is based at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, defends the FF100 data. ""Modellers always want more and better data. Yes, you could always want it more complete, you could always want it more accurate, but nonetheless the data that we had fulfilled our purpose. ""We were in quite a good position to understand what might happen in the United Kingdom."" Data was not just key to understanding where coronavirus was coming from, but who was worst affected. By mid-February, evidence from China showed older people were particularly at risk. Almost 30,000 'excess' care homes deaths In the UK, modellers warned government that the virus could kill tens of thousands, and advised ""cocooning"" would reduce deaths. There was a lack of understanding about care homes But Dr Ian Hall, of SPI-M, admits models did not reflect how care homes actually work, or identify the serious risk posed by agency staff working in different homes. ""The failure of those models, I guess, was that we didn't know how connected the social care settings were with the community,"" he says. ""As modellers we didn't know - I'm sure there are lots of academics and policy-makers out there, that could have told us this, if we'd asked them."" Coronavirus would go on to kill more than 20,000 people in care homes. The modellers were also trying to predict when the UK would see the peak of cases. In early March, SPI-M was still estimating it was 12 to 14 weeks away. ""We were planning for a pandemic that was fairly slowly growing, on the basis that we had kind of a ramping up of social distancing, over a period of time,"" says Dr Hall. But one member of the committee, Prof Steven Riley, from Imperial College, believed the government's strategy was seriously flawed and would leave intensive care units overwhelmed for a long period of time. On 10 March, when official figures suggested there had been a total of 913 cases - but experts now estimate there were 75,000 - he submitted a paper calling for an immediate lockdown. He says: ""Based only on my knowledge of the epidemiological situation, I did think, at that point, there was an argument for stringent social distancing, for lockdown, as soon as possible. ""The point that I thought needed to be addressed as a matter of urgency, was that initially we should lock down in order to have time to formulate a more precise strategy."" SPI-M's Prof Mark Jit was asked to investigate what the true numbers might be. ""I think everyone knew that they were not picking up all the cases. The big question was by how much were they underestimating the number. ""We decided to look at the number of cases in intensive care units. We knew for each of these cases there will probably be many hundreds of thousands of people who have Covid but didn't have it that seriously."" His calculations predicted that by mid-March there would soon be close to 100,000 new cases each day. ""That was extremely worrying because 100,000 new cases would mean that about a week later we would get 20,000 new hospital patients a day. ""There was the sense that, OK. we really need to get this information to Sage to make decisions about what we're going to do in the UK."" At the same time, other modellers realised that the NHS data they were relying on for their modelling was out of date. ""The data coming in from the UK which we thought was up to the minute was in fact in some cases up to a week old, and so really we weren't looking at a snapshot of how the epidemic was developing now, but how it was in the past,"" says Dr Nick Davies, who is also on SPI-M. ""That was the first time when I started to feel like things really were not under control."" Boris Johnson asked people to stop non-essential contact On 17 March, people across the UK were spending their first day living with unprecedented restrictions on daily life. In aTV address the previous evening, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had told the nation: ""Now is the time for everyone to stop non-essential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel. We need people to start working from home where they possibly can. And you should avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues. Without drastic action, cases could double every five or six days."" But at the University of Manchester, SPI-M's Dr Lorenzo Pellis was looking at data from Italy, and realising that the virus was spreading in Britain at almost twice the speed that had previously been thought. ""I got really concerned,"" said Dr Pellis. ""I was coming out with really short times between that day and potentially breaching hospital capacity."" It meant the NHS was just days away from being swamped by coronavirus patients. The analysis was fed back to Sage. ""And that led to the cascade to full lockdown,"" said his SPI-M collegue Dr Hall. So do the scientists believe they should have acted earlier? Lockdown delay 'cost a lot of lives', says science adviser ""I obviously feel that it's incredibly tragic what has happened in the UK and of course I wish that interventions had been brought in earlier"", says Dr Davies. ""Our own modelling suggests that had lockdown been imposed a week earlier, we may have avoided about half or slightly more than half the number of deaths."" ""I think we got ourselves into a mess by relying on modelling and allowing modelling to drive the whole response,"" says Prof Scally. ""I think the failure of the science, so to speak, will be seen as one of the most important features in what has been a very, very poor response to this global health tragedy."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""This is a new virus and an unprecedented global pandemic and our priority from the outset has been to save lives. We have been guided by the advice of experts from Sage and its sub-committees and our response helped to ensure the NHS was not overwhelmed.""

Today's updates have been brought to you by: Hugo Bachega, George Bowden, Marie Jackson, Joseph Lee, Emma Owen, Georgina Rannard, Alex Therrien, Lauren Turner and Kate Whannel. Rules will be relaxed for Christmas across the UK We are bringing our live page coverage to an end shortly. Before we do, here's a summary of today's headlines from the UK: Health officials advised people in the US to stay at home for Thanksgiving There are over 30,000 people in hospital - but cases are falling sharply With another 458 deaths reported today, France has become the latest European country to record more than 50,000 deaths during the pandemic. Italy and the UK had already passed that milestone. But France's death toll of 50,237 comes against a background of falling cases, with 9,155 infections today - compared to 45,522 last Tuesday. The number of people in hospital fell by 859 to 30,622, the sharpest fall since the country's lockdown began on 30 October. French President Emmanuel Macron announced a phased end to the lockdown, with shops allowed to reopen on Saturday. Other restrictions will remain in place. Canada's eastern provinces are dissolving their ""bubble"" that has been in effect throughout most of the pandemic. New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island (PEI), Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had restricted domestic travel from outside of their group. Outsiders were expected to quarantine for 14 days, while insiders could move freely. The bubble has been credited with keeping cases low. But on Monday, Newfoundland and Labrador and PEI said they would temporarily end the agreement, as cases in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are on the rise. PEI will also ban non-essential travel until 7 December.  A 10-year-old boy was among those who died in hospital as the UK recorded its highest daily death toll for over five months. The 608 people reported to have died within 28 days of a positive test is the largest total since 12 May, when 614 deaths were recorded. The daily death figures have begun to flatten in recent days, however, following the fall in the number of reported infections. The parents of Fehzan Jamil, who lived in Bradford and is one of the virus's youngest UK victims, told Channel 4 News of their âindescribableâ pain. Tayyaba and Mohammed Jamil said their son, who had epilepsy and other health problems, was a âreally brave fighterâ and a âsoldierâ, who was always cheerful.    Ghislaine Maxwell is due to go on trial in 2021 Ghislaine Maxwell has been quarantined after staff tested positive for Covid-19 at the jail in New York where she is awaiting trial, US prosecutors say. Maxwell is accused of helping her former boyfriend, late financier Jeffrey Epstein, traffic and sexually abuse underage girls and of perjury for denying involvement in such a scheme when she gave her deposition under oath. She has pleaded not guilty. The staff tested positive last week and Maxwell, 58, was checked for the virus on 18 November using a rapid test which was negative, the prosecutors said in a letter to US District Judge Alison Nathan. She will go on trial next year, and is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. The mutations observed in coronavirus isolates from mink have also been observed in ferrets, according to the latestminutes from the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage),external. Sage said preliminary evidence suggested ferrets could pose a risk to those who are most
vulnerable to the virus, but were low risk otherwise. Unlike mink, they are normally not kept in high-intensity farms. Sage said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is currently assessing the risk to people in the UK and is developing messaging for ferret owners. There are fears mutations of the virus in animals could hamper the effectiveness of coronavirus vaccines. Earlier this month,Denmark culled all its mink - up to 17 million animals - because of the spread of coronavirus in the animal. Sage said coordination was needed across academic groups  and relevant bodies on the risks of human to animal transmission and the intensive rearing of
animals. The Sage minutes said the UK's vaccine taskforce would note potential implications for vaccine targeting of variants
including those that are mink-adapted. What's the science behind mink and coronavirus? We take a look here Theo LeggettBBC business correspondent The global airline industry will make a net loss of $118bn (Â£88bn) this year, according to the International Air Transport Association (Iata), and a further loss of $38bn is expected next year. The figures are much higher than previous estimates, and reflect the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, and continued restrictions on travel. Iata's Director General Alexandre de Juniac explained that 2020 had been the worst financial year in the industry's history. Without financial support from governments, he said, there would have been bankruptcies on ""a massive scale"". According to Iata, airlines have been able to cut their costs collectively by $365bn this year, a reduction of nearly 46%. But this has been outweighed by a drop in revenues of more than 60%. The organisation says it does expect the situation to improve next year, with some opening of borders, either through improved testing or a vaccine. But it still expects losses to be greater than any the industry has ever suffered, with the exception of 2020. Passenger numbers are expected to drop to 1.8 billion thisyear from 4.5 billion in 2019, and will recover only partially to 2.8 billion next year, according to the association. Alistair ColemanBBC Disinformation unit Signs like this have wrongly suggested that a royal charter from 1215 gives business owners the right to refuse to close In the UK,a Yorkshire hairdresser is facing fines totalling Â£27,000($36,000) for refusing to close her salon during lockdown. Sinead Quinn has a sign in her shop window saying that she ""does not consent"" to coronavirus laws, claiming her right to do so is set out in the Magna Carta, a royal charter from more than 800 years ago that was England's first form of a written constitution. However, no such right exists and she's been fined multiple times for staying open. She's one of several traders including a tattoo artist in Bristol, and aNottinghamshire bookshop, who claim that ""Article 61"" of the Magna Carta signed by King John in 1215 gives them the right to ignore ""unjust"" laws. But Article 61 was removed from Magna Carta within a year of its signing, andonly three clauses of the document remain law today.,external That's not stopped anti-lockdown social media accounts offering a downloadable notice for businesses to place in their windows. This notice also refers to a""Freeman on the Land"" defence, which claims citizens have had their identities ""stolen"" by the state, and by asserting their rights as ""sovereign citizens"" they are only bound by laws to which they consent. No ""Freeman on the Land"" defence has ever prevailed in court. One scientific expert said the relaxation of restrictions over Christmas will ""almost inevitably"" lead to an increase in transmission, but that the celebration may still be what is needed to âmake it through the rest of winterâ. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, said: âThe issue is whether that increased risk is tolerable in relation to the benefits. At that time schools will be closed so there would naturally be some downward pressure on transmission."" He said if the new tier system is working well ""there will be a downward pressure on transmission before and after the Christmas break"", so any increase in cases ""could be relatively short-lived"". ""After Christmas we will still have to live through a few more months of restrictions at least,"" the professor said. This video can not be played Gove: ""Three households can have a Christmas bubble"" Cabinet minister Michael Gove says people will be able to ""enjoy something closer to a normal Christmas"" after the four nations reached an agreement. But the bubbles, of up to three households, must be exclusive and people have to comply with hospitality rules in place in their area, depending which tier they're in. Mr Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said it was a chance to ""meet close friends and family in a very restricted fashion"". Three households can meet over a five-day
period (23 - 27 December) in the UK. However, those in Northern Ireland have been granted a bigger window (22 - 28 December) to allow for any additional travel time to and from the region. Sam says she wants to get together ""even if it's just for one day"" Families are now facing a big choice about whether to take advantage of the freedom to meet up at Christmas - or whether to play it safe. Sam in Devon is building a grotto in her garden ready for a small family gathering. She told the BBC: ""Itâs the only time of the year I get everybody together, it's very important, it's special. ""Itâs not the presents or anything else, itâs having my family. Even if itâs just for one day."" But she said people ""have to be sensible otherwise weâre going to have a really rotten January"". But others said they would not be travelling. Father and daughter Naomi and Roy said they would not be making the trip between Devon and South Wales this year. ""I would love to do it, but no,"" Naomi said. ""Especially with the vaccine development, it just seems like too high risk regardless of what we're allowed to do."" ""The only thing thatâs missing is the physical contact,"" said Roy, adding that he missed the grandchildren, ""If that has to be, I would rather miss out in 2020 if it means we can do what we normally do in 2021.""  This year, Naomi and dad Roy will spend Christmas apart We've had some more detail about what the Christmas announcements will mean for different groups: In a joint statement from all four governments, the leaders say 2020 ""has been an incredibly difficult year for us all"". ""We have all had to make significant sacrifices in our everyday lives, and many
religious and community groups have already had to change or forgo their
customary celebrations to slow the spread of coronavirus and save lives. ""This cannot be
a ânormalâ Christmas but as we approach the festive period, we have been
working closely together to find a way for family and friends to see each
other, even if it is for a short time, and recognising that it must be both
limited and cautious."" They urge people to use ""personal judgement"" and be ""mindful of the risks"" particularly when meeting those
who are vulnerable. ""We urge the consideration of alternative approaches such as the use of
technology or meeting outside,"" the statement adds. NI First Minister Arlene Foster said she hoped the announcement gave people time to plan First Minister Arlene Foster welcomed the announcement of Christmas arrangements and said she hoped it would give people space to plan. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was a ""message of hope"" but urged people to be responsible, safe and mindful of healthcare workers. âThink, can you meet up differently, can you go for a walk, for example, with a family member?â she said. Arlene Foster said the relaxations would apply in people's homes, in non-essential retail and places of worship but not in hospitality. She said people should stick to the regulations on hospitality concerning the number of households allowed to meet together at the time. Northern Ireland is due to begin a two-week lockdown from this Friday until 11 December, in a bid to curb the spread of the virus before Christmas.  Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said the approach to Christmas was ""not a choice between relaxation or no relaxation"" but a plan to allow celebrations ""in a controlled way"". He stressed this is ""not an instruction to travel"" and ""not an instruction to meet with other people"". Asked if he had any concerns about relaxing the restrictions, he said ""misgivings happen either way"". Mr Drakeford said: ""It is having a form of relaxation where there are rules that people will recognise, that will allow people to enjoy Christmas, but will do it in a controlled way."" He admitted he had ""hesitation"" - because of the state of the virus in Wales and the UK as a whole - but added: ""It is better that we have a common set of arrangements that give people a framework that they can manage within and act responsibly within as well."" Asked about what plans and preparations are being made for the opening months of 2021, he replied: ""What I am keen on is that we don't, on a four nation basis, simply think about five days of Christmas. ""We think of a common approach to Christmas and a common approach to dealing with the consequences of Christmas as well."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the relaxation would not apply to Hogmanay Talking about the plans, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged people to try to limit their interaction. She said there would be some people who felt the need to come
together over Christmas and âwe want to allow thatâ but âjust because this can
be doneâ, it is not the case that people should feel âthey should do it if they
donât have toâ. Ms Sturgeon also confirmed that travel restrictions would be lifted
to allow people to visit families in other parts of the UK within the three-household bubble. She said the three-household bubble was a âfixed bubble for
that five-day period - you canât see two households one day and another two
households the next dayâ. The first minister confirmed the relaxation would not apply
to Hogmanay, saying âwe canât do everything hereâ. ""The last thing we want to do right now is set our
progress back,â she added. On the matter of hugs, she cautioned people against doing things that allow the virus to spread. Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove says he is
""very pleased"" to have reached an agreement with the other four
regions. However he warns that a ""balance has to be struck""
between relaxing the restrictions over Christmas and beating back the virus. He says the progress on vaccines means there is ""light at the end of the tunnel"" but he adds ""it is important we don't let things get too loose over Christmas."" ""I know that people will use these freedoms responsibly."" He said this was an opportunity
for people to ""meet close friends and family in a very restricted fashion,
in order to ensure that those we love can be with us at this special season,
but only for a limited period, but not in hospitality venues and not in any
locations where the virus might spread fast"". Mr Gove said he now planned to
spend Christmas with his mother and father in Aberdeen.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,4.1910065e-05
"A deal to allow families to meet over Christmas has been reached by the leaders of all four UK nations. A source told the BBC that details on how Covid restrictions will be relaxed will be announced shortly. Scotland's first minister said she would ""continue to ask people to err on the side of caution"". BBC Scotland's chief political correspondent said three households will be allowed to meet indoors over five days between 23-27 December. Glenn Campbell said they will be able to meet in each other's homes, at a place of worship and in an outdoor public space. But the groupings must be ""exclusive"", meaning you cannot get together with people from more than two other households. He added the leaders of the nations are expected to urge Britons to use any new flexibility sparingly because public health officials are worried Christmas get-togethers could cause a January spike in Covid cases. Speaking ahead of a meeting of the UK government's emergency committee Cobra,Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford cautioned any extra freedoms would not be an instruction to do ""risky things"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also stressed any changes would be ""temporary"" and ""limited"". She said that the ""details"" may differ ""to reflect different circumstances in each nation"", such as what the definition of a ""household"" might be. She added: ""I know everyone has a desire to see loved ones over the festive period. ""However, there is also a very real and a very legitimate anxiety that doing so could put those we love at risk, set back our progress as a country and result in unnecessary deaths and suffering."" Where will mass testing be available? What will England's new lockdown rules be? Travellers can cut quarantine if they pay for test Act responsibly over Christmas, asks Drakeford Meanwhile, the government has recorded another 608 deaths of people in the UK who have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test. There were also a further 11,299 cases of people testing positive for coronavirus. What to do about Christmas divides opinion. Increased mixing indoors will certainly mean there is greater transmission of the virus. But, as chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty said on Monday, there is a balance to be struck between the harm the virus can cause and the societal and economic impacts of trying to control it. He called for a ""public-spirited approach"". By that he means adhering to the restrictions in the lead up to Christmas, being responsible with the opportunity the relaxation gives people and then immediately switching back to compliance. If that happens any impact could be minimised - and, of course, it will be up to individuals to decide just how much they mix within the rules. These are very fine judgement calls by ministers. They hope Christmas will provide respite and help steel the public for what is clearly going to be a long, hard winter. They also feel they have little choice, believing large numbers of people would ignore pleas not to mix and this way they can provide advice on how to enjoy Christmas as safely as possible. But there is also the risk by sanctioning it there will be more mixing than there would have otherwise been. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has acknowledged there would be risks of letting people meet over Christmas but said families should have the chance to reunite. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps earlier said Christmas travellers should plan journeys carefully and prepare for restrictions on passenger numbers. This video can not be played Grant Shapps: People will have to ""think about the routes they are taking"" Referring to domestic travel during the festive period, Mr Shapps urged those travelling on public transport to pre-book tickets as the capacity of services remains reduced to allow for social distancing and as a result of staff self-isolating. Mr Shapps also highlightedNetwork Rail's plans for a series of upgrades and routine maintenance,externalacross Britain between 23 December to 4 January. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I would appeal to people to think very carefully about their travel plans and consider where they are going to travel and look at the various alternatives available."" Coronavirus restrictions and work from home guidance have led to a sharp reduction in train passenger numbers Mr Shapps added that people who live in areas placed in the highest tier of restrictions in England should avoid leaving their region entirely. Mr Shapps said confirmation of the exact rules would come by Thursday - when people find out which tier their local area will be in - or potentially before then. It comes after the prime minister confirmed tougher tier curbs once England's lockdown ends. Gyms and non-essential shops in all parts of England will be allowed to reopen from 2 Decemberunder a strengthened three-tiered system. Areas will not find out which tier they are in until Thursday - and the decision will be based on a number of factors including case numbers, the reproduction rate - or R number - and pressure on local NHS services. At a Downing Street news conference on Monday to outlinea ""Covid-19 winter plan"",external, Mr Johnson admitted Christmas this year would be very different to normal. ""I can't say that Christmas will be normal this year, but in a period of adversity time spent with loved ones is even more precious for people of all faiths and none,"" he said. ""We all want some kind of Christmas; we need it; we certainly feel we deserve it. ""But this virus obviously is not going to grant a Christmas truceâ¦ and families will need to make a careful judgement about the risks of visiting elderly relatives."" SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Meanwhile, Mr Shapps announced people arriving in England from many countrieswill be soon able to reduce their quarantine period by more than halfif they pay for a coronavirus test after five days. The rules will come into force from 15 December and the tests from private firms will cost between Â£65 and Â£120. Elsewhere, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs the UK's new mass testing capacity could be used after the pandemic to diagnose a wider range of illnesses. He said a British culture of ""soldiering on"" and going to work despite having symptoms of illnesses, including flu, ""should change"". ""In fact, I want to have a change in the British way of doing things where 'if in doubt, get a test' doesn't just refer to coronavirus, but refers to any illness you might have,"" he said. Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the total number of deaths occurring in the UKis nearly a fifth above normal levels.

"This video can not be played Students from Knowsley on Merseyside say they feel extra stressed in the lead up to exams this year More than one in five secondary pupils in England missed school last week, with worsening Covid disruption. The latest attendance figures show 22% of secondary pupils were missing, based on who was in school last Thursday - up from 17% the previous week. The biggest teachers' union warned of a ""collapse"" in attendance, with almost three quarters of secondary schools sending home pupils. The Department for Education says keeping schools open is a ""priority"". ""The situation has reached a crisis point and the government cannot let coronavirus run riot in schools any longer,"" said Mary Bousted, co-leader of the National Education Union, with almost 900,000 pupils out of school because of Covid incidents. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, backed the principle of keeping schools open, but said it was time for schools to be allowed to operate rota systems. ""The reality behind these figures is that many schools are experiencing disruption on a monumental scale and are desperately trying to cling on to the end of term,"" said the heads' leader. Pupils sent home in half of England's secondary schools More secondary pupils missing lessons during pandemic Almost one in five secondary schools sending pupils home ""The other parents and I have a WhatsApp group and our phones ping and we're all filled with dread over which year group is told to isolate next,"" says Josephine Abbott Millar, a parent from Rugby. Her two sons have faced school being disrupted - and she says they have missed the social life as well as lessons at school. Not every family has the technology to allow children to switch to learning online ""As my eldest has started a new school I think he's really suffered as he's not been allowed to settled in properly,"" she told the BBC. ""Every time he starts to feel a bit settled he has to isolate again for two weeks and he's home again. It's the back and forth that is really disruptive."" There have been concerns about how exams will go ahead next summer when so many pupils have been missing lessons. Russell Hobby, chief executive of Teach First, said being out of school would be most disruptive for the most disadvantaged. ""Studying from home is difficult for all pupils. But our research has found it's pupils from the poorest backgrounds who are the least likely to have laptops and internet while self-isolating, making it nearly impossible for them,"" he said. ""These children will not recover from this if we don't acknowledge the barriers they face,"" says Matthew Martin, head of department in a south London secondary school. He says some pupils have missed a month already this term and only a limited number will really be able continue learning online at home. This is not because of an unwillingness to keep studying, he says, but because families do not have the computer equipment at home to make it possible. England's Department for Education has been committed to keeping schools open, but the weekly figures show rising numbers of pupils missing from the classroom. Overall attendance is down to 83% of pupils, below 86% in the previous week - and although the way figures were gathered changed in October, they show attendance dipping since half term. This fall is particularly concentrated in secondary schools, with 78% in class last Thursday, down from 87% on 5 November. Across both primary and secondary schools, the figures show about one in 10 pupils were out of school because of Covid-related concerns. The great majority of pupils being sent home are because of potential contacts - rather than pupils having caught coronavirus, with only 0.2% of pupils recorded as confirmed cases. Primary schools have so far been less disrupted, with 87% of pupils attending - but the number of schools sending home one more pupils has risen to 29%, compared with 22% the week before. There have been worries about how exams will go ahead next summer Among secondary schools, 73% were sending home pupils, compared with 64% the week before. A Department for Education spokeswoman said almost all schools had remained open this term - and there was online learning for those pupils who were self-isolating. ""It is a national priority to keep education settings open full-time, and that remains equally as important in the weeks up to the end of term as it was when young people returned for the new school year,"" said the DFE spokeswoman.

"The four nations of the UK have agreed UK-wide rules to allow families to meet over Christmas Three households will be allowed to meet in each other's homes over five days between 23-27 December Earlier, Matt Hancock took questions at a joint session of the Health and Social Care Committee and Science and Technology Committee He defended NHS test-and-trace, saying it was not to blame for the second lockdown The health secretary also said the UK should be ""getting back to normal"" after Easter People arriving in England will be soon able to reduce their quarantine period if they pay for a Covid test Globally, the world's most vulnerable must not be ""trampled in the stampede"" for vaccines, the World Health Organization warns The developers of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine say it is proving to be up to 95% effective Edited by Emma Owen We will be back with more coronavirus coverage on our live page tomorrow. Today's updates have been brought to you by: Hugo Bachega, George Bowden, Marie Jackson, Joseph Lee, Emma Owen, Georgina Rannard, Alex Therrien, Lauren Turner and Kate Whannel. Rules will be relaxed for Christmas across the UK We are bringing our live page coverage to an end shortly. Before we do, here's a summary of today's headlines from the UK: Health officials advised people in the US to stay at home for Thanksgiving There are over 30,000 people in hospital - but cases are falling sharply With another 458 deaths reported today, France has become the latest European country to record more than 50,000 deaths during the pandemic. Italy and the UK had already passed that milestone. But France's death toll of 50,237 comes against a background of falling cases, with 9,155 infections today - compared to 45,522 last Tuesday. The number of people in hospital fell by 859 to 30,622, the sharpest fall since the country's lockdown began on 30 October. French President Emmanuel Macron announced a phased end to the lockdown, with shops allowed to reopen on Saturday. Other restrictions will remain in place. Canada's eastern provinces are dissolving their ""bubble"" that has been in effect throughout most of the pandemic. New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island (PEI), Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had restricted domestic travel from outside of their group. Outsiders were expected to quarantine for 14 days, while insiders could move freely. The bubble has been credited with keeping cases low. But on Monday, Newfoundland and Labrador and PEI said they would temporarily end the agreement, as cases in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are on the rise. PEI will also ban non-essential travel until 7 December.  A 10-year-old boy was among those who died in hospital as the UK recorded its highest daily death toll for over five months. The 608 people reported to have died within 28 days of a positive test is the largest total since 12 May, when 614 deaths were recorded. The daily death figures have begun to flatten in recent days, however, following the fall in the number of reported infections. The parents of Fehzan Jamil, who lived in Bradford and is one of the virus's youngest UK victims, told Channel 4 News of their âindescribableâ pain. Tayyaba and Mohammed Jamil said their son, who had epilepsy and other health problems, was a âreally brave fighterâ and a âsoldierâ, who was always cheerful.    Ghislaine Maxwell is due to go on trial in 2021 Ghislaine Maxwell has been quarantined after staff tested positive for Covid-19 at the jail in New York where she is awaiting trial, US prosecutors say. Maxwell is accused of helping her former boyfriend, late financier Jeffrey Epstein, traffic and sexually abuse underage girls and of perjury for denying involvement in such a scheme when she gave her deposition under oath. She has pleaded not guilty. The staff tested positive last week and Maxwell, 58, was checked for the virus on 18 November using a rapid test which was negative, the prosecutors said in a letter to US District Judge Alison Nathan. She will go on trial next year, and is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. The mutations observed in coronavirus isolates from mink have also been observed in ferrets, according to the latestminutes from the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage),external. Sage said preliminary evidence suggested ferrets could pose a risk to those who are most
vulnerable to the virus, but were low risk otherwise. Unlike mink, they are normally not kept in high-intensity farms. Sage said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is currently assessing the risk to people in the UK and is developing messaging for ferret owners. There are fears mutations of the virus in animals could hamper the effectiveness of coronavirus vaccines. Earlier this month,Denmark culled all its mink - up to 17 million animals - because of the spread of coronavirus in the animal. Sage said coordination was needed across academic groups  and relevant bodies on the risks of human to animal transmission and the intensive rearing of
animals. The Sage minutes said the UK's vaccine taskforce would note potential implications for vaccine targeting of variants
including those that are mink-adapted. What's the science behind mink and coronavirus? We take a look here Theo LeggettBBC business correspondent The global airline industry will make a net loss of $118bn (Â£88bn) this year, according to the International Air Transport Association (Iata), and a further loss of $38bn is expected next year. The figures are much higher than previous estimates, and reflect the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, and continued restrictions on travel. Iata's Director General Alexandre de Juniac explained that 2020 had been the worst financial year in the industry's history. Without financial support from governments, he said, there would have been bankruptcies on ""a massive scale"". According to Iata, airlines have been able to cut their costs collectively by $365bn this year, a reduction of nearly 46%. But this has been outweighed by a drop in revenues of more than 60%. The organisation says it does expect the situation to improve next year, with some opening of borders, either through improved testing or a vaccine. But it still expects losses to be greater than any the industry has ever suffered, with the exception of 2020. Passenger numbers are expected to drop to 1.8 billion thisyear from 4.5 billion in 2019, and will recover only partially to 2.8 billion next year, according to the association. Alistair ColemanBBC Disinformation unit Signs like this have wrongly suggested that a royal charter from 1215 gives business owners the right to refuse to close In the UK,a Yorkshire hairdresser is facing fines totalling Â£27,000($36,000) for refusing to close her salon during lockdown. Sinead Quinn has a sign in her shop window saying that she ""does not consent"" to coronavirus laws, claiming her right to do so is set out in the Magna Carta, a royal charter from more than 800 years ago that was England's first form of a written constitution. However, no such right exists and she's been fined multiple times for staying open. She's one of several traders including a tattoo artist in Bristol, and aNottinghamshire bookshop, who claim that ""Article 61"" of the Magna Carta signed by King John in 1215 gives them the right to ignore ""unjust"" laws. But Article 61 was removed from Magna Carta within a year of its signing, andonly three clauses of the document remain law today.,external That's not stopped anti-lockdown social media accounts offering a downloadable notice for businesses to place in their windows. This notice also refers to a""Freeman on the Land"" defence, which claims citizens have had their identities ""stolen"" by the state, and by asserting their rights as ""sovereign citizens"" they are only bound by laws to which they consent. No ""Freeman on the Land"" defence has ever prevailed in court. One scientific expert said the relaxation of restrictions over Christmas will ""almost inevitably"" lead to an increase in transmission, but that the celebration may still be what is needed to âmake it through the rest of winterâ. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, said: âThe issue is whether that increased risk is tolerable in relation to the benefits. At that time schools will be closed so there would naturally be some downward pressure on transmission."" He said if the new tier system is working well ""there will be a downward pressure on transmission before and after the Christmas break"", so any increase in cases ""could be relatively short-lived"". ""After Christmas we will still have to live through a few more months of restrictions at least,"" the professor said. This video can not be played Gove: ""Three households can have a Christmas bubble"" Cabinet minister Michael Gove says people will be able to ""enjoy something closer to a normal Christmas"" after the four nations reached an agreement. But the bubbles, of up to three households, must be exclusive and people have to comply with hospitality rules in place in their area, depending which tier they're in. Mr Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said it was a chance to ""meet close friends and family in a very restricted fashion"". Three households can meet over a five-day
period (23 - 27 December) in the UK. However, those in Northern Ireland have been granted a bigger window (22 - 28 December) to allow for any additional travel time to and from the region. Sam says she wants to get together ""even if it's just for one day"" Families are now facing a big choice about whether to take advantage of the freedom to meet up at Christmas - or whether to play it safe. Sam in Devon is building a grotto in her garden ready for a small family gathering. She told the BBC: ""Itâs the only time of the year I get everybody together, it's very important, it's special. ""Itâs not the presents or anything else, itâs having my family. Even if itâs just for one day."" But she said people ""have to be sensible otherwise weâre going to have a really rotten January"". But others said they would not be travelling. Father and daughter Naomi and Roy said they would not be making the trip between Devon and South Wales this year. ""I would love to do it, but no,"" Naomi said. ""Especially with the vaccine development, it just seems like too high risk regardless of what we're allowed to do."" ""The only thing thatâs missing is the physical contact,"" said Roy, adding that he missed the grandchildren, ""If that has to be, I would rather miss out in 2020 if it means we can do what we normally do in 2021.""  This year, Naomi and dad Roy will spend Christmas apart We've had some more detail about what the Christmas announcements will mean for different groups: In a joint statement from all four governments, the leaders say 2020 ""has been an incredibly difficult year for us all"". ""We have all had to make significant sacrifices in our everyday lives, and many
religious and community groups have already had to change or forgo their
customary celebrations to slow the spread of coronavirus and save lives. ""This cannot be
a ânormalâ Christmas but as we approach the festive period, we have been
working closely together to find a way for family and friends to see each
other, even if it is for a short time, and recognising that it must be both
limited and cautious."" They urge people to use ""personal judgement"" and be ""mindful of the risks"" particularly when meeting those
who are vulnerable. ""We urge the consideration of alternative approaches such as the use of
technology or meeting outside,"" the statement adds. NI First Minister Arlene Foster said she hoped the announcement gave people time to plan First Minister Arlene Foster welcomed the announcement of Christmas arrangements and said she hoped it would give people space to plan. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was a ""message of hope"" but urged people to be responsible, safe and mindful of healthcare workers. âThink, can you meet up differently, can you go for a walk, for example, with a family member?â she said. Arlene Foster said the relaxations would apply in people's homes, in non-essential retail and places of worship but not in hospitality. She said people should stick to the regulations on hospitality concerning the number of households allowed to meet together at the time. Northern Ireland is due to begin a two-week lockdown from this Friday until 11 December, in a bid to curb the spread of the virus before Christmas.  Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said the approach to Christmas was ""not a choice between relaxation or no relaxation"" but a plan to allow celebrations ""in a controlled way"". He stressed this is ""not an instruction to travel"" and ""not an instruction to meet with other people"". Asked if he had any concerns about relaxing the restrictions, he said ""misgivings happen either way"". Mr Drakeford said: ""It is having a form of relaxation where there are rules that people will recognise, that will allow people to enjoy Christmas, but will do it in a controlled way."" He admitted he had ""hesitation"" - because of the state of the virus in Wales and the UK as a whole - but added: ""It is better that we have a common set of arrangements that give people a framework that they can manage within and act responsibly within as well."" Asked about what plans and preparations are being made for the opening months of 2021, he replied: ""What I am keen on is that we don't, on a four nation basis, simply think about five days of Christmas. ""We think of a common approach to Christmas and a common approach to dealing with the consequences of Christmas as well."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the relaxation would not apply to Hogmanay Talking about the plans, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged people to try to limit their interaction. She said there would be some people who felt the need to come
together over Christmas and âwe want to allow thatâ but âjust because this can
be doneâ, it is not the case that people should feel âthey should do it if they
donât have toâ. Ms Sturgeon also confirmed that travel restrictions would be lifted
to allow people to visit families in other parts of the UK within the three-household bubble. She said the three-household bubble was a âfixed bubble for
that five-day period - you canât see two households one day and another two
households the next dayâ. The first minister confirmed the relaxation would not apply
to Hogmanay, saying âwe canât do everything hereâ. ""The last thing we want to do right now is set our
progress back,â she added. On the matter of hugs, she cautioned people against doing things that allow the virus to spread. Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove says he is
""very pleased"" to have reached an agreement with the other four
regions. However he warns that a ""balance has to be struck""
between relaxing the restrictions over Christmas and beating back the virus. He says the progress on vaccines means there is ""light at the end of the tunnel"" but he adds ""it is important we don't let things get too loose over Christmas."" ""I know that people will use these freedoms responsibly."" He said this was an opportunity
for people to ""meet close friends and family in a very restricted fashion,
in order to ensure that those we love can be with us at this special season,
but only for a limited period, but not in hospitality venues and not in any
locations where the virus might spread fast"". Mr Gove said he now planned to
spend Christmas with his mother and father in Aberdeen.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.5426552
"The total number of deaths occurring in the UK is nearly a fifth above normal levels, latest figures show. Data from national statisticians show there were almost 14,000 deaths in the week ending 13 November. Some 2,838 of the deaths involved Covid - 600 more than the preceding week, according to the analysis of death certificates. The North West and Yorkshire have seen the most excess deaths. The number of deaths in both regions were more than a third above expected levels. By comparison, the number of deaths in the South East was just 2% above the five-year average. But there is hope the rise in the number deaths may soon start slowing. The daily figures published by government - which rely on positive tests - show deaths are not rising as quickly as they were, and may be levelling off. And unlike in the first wave, when the lack of testing meant the government figures underestimated the number of Covid deaths, the two sets of data are mirroring each other. Sarah Scobie, of the Nuffield Trust health think tank, said: ""Despite the end of the second national lockdown in England coming into focus, today's figures are a sobering reminder of the dreadful impact of this virus. She said the high number of deaths was ""piling on the pressure"" on the NHS. ""For some hospitals, particularly in Covid hotspot areas, it will feel as if they are in the depths of winter already.""

"The four nations of the UK have agreed UK-wide rules to allow families to meet over Christmas Three households will be allowed to meet in each other's homes over five days between 23-27 December Earlier, Matt Hancock took questions at a joint session of the Health and Social Care Committee and Science and Technology Committee He defended NHS test-and-trace, saying it was not to blame for the second lockdown The health secretary also said the UK should be ""getting back to normal"" after Easter People arriving in England will be soon able to reduce their quarantine period if they pay for a Covid test Globally, the world's most vulnerable must not be ""trampled in the stampede"" for vaccines, the World Health Organization warns The developers of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine say it is proving to be up to 95% effective Edited by Emma Owen We will be back with more coronavirus coverage on our live page tomorrow. Today's updates have been brought to you by: Hugo Bachega, George Bowden, Marie Jackson, Joseph Lee, Emma Owen, Georgina Rannard, Alex Therrien, Lauren Turner and Kate Whannel. Rules will be relaxed for Christmas across the UK We are bringing our live page coverage to an end shortly. Before we do, here's a summary of today's headlines from the UK: Health officials advised people in the US to stay at home for Thanksgiving There are over 30,000 people in hospital - but cases are falling sharply With another 458 deaths reported today, France has become the latest European country to record more than 50,000 deaths during the pandemic. Italy and the UK had already passed that milestone. But France's death toll of 50,237 comes against a background of falling cases, with 9,155 infections today - compared to 45,522 last Tuesday. The number of people in hospital fell by 859 to 30,622, the sharpest fall since the country's lockdown began on 30 October. French President Emmanuel Macron announced a phased end to the lockdown, with shops allowed to reopen on Saturday. Other restrictions will remain in place. Canada's eastern provinces are dissolving their ""bubble"" that has been in effect throughout most of the pandemic. New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island (PEI), Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had restricted domestic travel from outside of their group. Outsiders were expected to quarantine for 14 days, while insiders could move freely. The bubble has been credited with keeping cases low. But on Monday, Newfoundland and Labrador and PEI said they would temporarily end the agreement, as cases in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are on the rise. PEI will also ban non-essential travel until 7 December.  A 10-year-old boy was among those who died in hospital as the UK recorded its highest daily death toll for over five months. The 608 people reported to have died within 28 days of a positive test is the largest total since 12 May, when 614 deaths were recorded. The daily death figures have begun to flatten in recent days, however, following the fall in the number of reported infections. The parents of Fehzan Jamil, who lived in Bradford and is one of the virus's youngest UK victims, told Channel 4 News of their âindescribableâ pain. Tayyaba and Mohammed Jamil said their son, who had epilepsy and other health problems, was a âreally brave fighterâ and a âsoldierâ, who was always cheerful.    Ghislaine Maxwell is due to go on trial in 2021 Ghislaine Maxwell has been quarantined after staff tested positive for Covid-19 at the jail in New York where she is awaiting trial, US prosecutors say. Maxwell is accused of helping her former boyfriend, late financier Jeffrey Epstein, traffic and sexually abuse underage girls and of perjury for denying involvement in such a scheme when she gave her deposition under oath. She has pleaded not guilty. The staff tested positive last week and Maxwell, 58, was checked for the virus on 18 November using a rapid test which was negative, the prosecutors said in a letter to US District Judge Alison Nathan. She will go on trial next year, and is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. The mutations observed in coronavirus isolates from mink have also been observed in ferrets, according to the latestminutes from the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage),external. Sage said preliminary evidence suggested ferrets could pose a risk to those who are most
vulnerable to the virus, but were low risk otherwise. Unlike mink, they are normally not kept in high-intensity farms. Sage said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is currently assessing the risk to people in the UK and is developing messaging for ferret owners. There are fears mutations of the virus in animals could hamper the effectiveness of coronavirus vaccines. Earlier this month,Denmark culled all its mink - up to 17 million animals - because of the spread of coronavirus in the animal. Sage said coordination was needed across academic groups  and relevant bodies on the risks of human to animal transmission and the intensive rearing of
animals. The Sage minutes said the UK's vaccine taskforce would note potential implications for vaccine targeting of variants
including those that are mink-adapted. What's the science behind mink and coronavirus? We take a look here Theo LeggettBBC business correspondent The global airline industry will make a net loss of $118bn (Â£88bn) this year, according to the International Air Transport Association (Iata), and a further loss of $38bn is expected next year. The figures are much higher than previous estimates, and reflect the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, and continued restrictions on travel. Iata's Director General Alexandre de Juniac explained that 2020 had been the worst financial year in the industry's history. Without financial support from governments, he said, there would have been bankruptcies on ""a massive scale"". According to Iata, airlines have been able to cut their costs collectively by $365bn this year, a reduction of nearly 46%. But this has been outweighed by a drop in revenues of more than 60%. The organisation says it does expect the situation to improve next year, with some opening of borders, either through improved testing or a vaccine. But it still expects losses to be greater than any the industry has ever suffered, with the exception of 2020. Passenger numbers are expected to drop to 1.8 billion thisyear from 4.5 billion in 2019, and will recover only partially to 2.8 billion next year, according to the association. Alistair ColemanBBC Disinformation unit Signs like this have wrongly suggested that a royal charter from 1215 gives business owners the right to refuse to close In the UK,a Yorkshire hairdresser is facing fines totalling Â£27,000($36,000) for refusing to close her salon during lockdown. Sinead Quinn has a sign in her shop window saying that she ""does not consent"" to coronavirus laws, claiming her right to do so is set out in the Magna Carta, a royal charter from more than 800 years ago that was England's first form of a written constitution. However, no such right exists and she's been fined multiple times for staying open. She's one of several traders including a tattoo artist in Bristol, and aNottinghamshire bookshop, who claim that ""Article 61"" of the Magna Carta signed by King John in 1215 gives them the right to ignore ""unjust"" laws. But Article 61 was removed from Magna Carta within a year of its signing, andonly three clauses of the document remain law today.,external That's not stopped anti-lockdown social media accounts offering a downloadable notice for businesses to place in their windows. This notice also refers to a""Freeman on the Land"" defence, which claims citizens have had their identities ""stolen"" by the state, and by asserting their rights as ""sovereign citizens"" they are only bound by laws to which they consent. No ""Freeman on the Land"" defence has ever prevailed in court. One scientific expert said the relaxation of restrictions over Christmas will ""almost inevitably"" lead to an increase in transmission, but that the celebration may still be what is needed to âmake it through the rest of winterâ. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, said: âThe issue is whether that increased risk is tolerable in relation to the benefits. At that time schools will be closed so there would naturally be some downward pressure on transmission."" He said if the new tier system is working well ""there will be a downward pressure on transmission before and after the Christmas break"", so any increase in cases ""could be relatively short-lived"". ""After Christmas we will still have to live through a few more months of restrictions at least,"" the professor said. This video can not be played Gove: ""Three households can have a Christmas bubble"" Cabinet minister Michael Gove says people will be able to ""enjoy something closer to a normal Christmas"" after the four nations reached an agreement. But the bubbles, of up to three households, must be exclusive and people have to comply with hospitality rules in place in their area, depending which tier they're in. Mr Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said it was a chance to ""meet close friends and family in a very restricted fashion"". Three households can meet over a five-day
period (23 - 27 December) in the UK. However, those in Northern Ireland have been granted a bigger window (22 - 28 December) to allow for any additional travel time to and from the region. Sam says she wants to get together ""even if it's just for one day"" Families are now facing a big choice about whether to take advantage of the freedom to meet up at Christmas - or whether to play it safe. Sam in Devon is building a grotto in her garden ready for a small family gathering. She told the BBC: ""Itâs the only time of the year I get everybody together, it's very important, it's special. ""Itâs not the presents or anything else, itâs having my family. Even if itâs just for one day."" But she said people ""have to be sensible otherwise weâre going to have a really rotten January"". But others said they would not be travelling. Father and daughter Naomi and Roy said they would not be making the trip between Devon and South Wales this year. ""I would love to do it, but no,"" Naomi said. ""Especially with the vaccine development, it just seems like too high risk regardless of what we're allowed to do."" ""The only thing thatâs missing is the physical contact,"" said Roy, adding that he missed the grandchildren, ""If that has to be, I would rather miss out in 2020 if it means we can do what we normally do in 2021.""  This year, Naomi and dad Roy will spend Christmas apart We've had some more detail about what the Christmas announcements will mean for different groups: In a joint statement from all four governments, the leaders say 2020 ""has been an incredibly difficult year for us all"". ""We have all had to make significant sacrifices in our everyday lives, and many
religious and community groups have already had to change or forgo their
customary celebrations to slow the spread of coronavirus and save lives. ""This cannot be
a ânormalâ Christmas but as we approach the festive period, we have been
working closely together to find a way for family and friends to see each
other, even if it is for a short time, and recognising that it must be both
limited and cautious."" They urge people to use ""personal judgement"" and be ""mindful of the risks"" particularly when meeting those
who are vulnerable. ""We urge the consideration of alternative approaches such as the use of
technology or meeting outside,"" the statement adds. NI First Minister Arlene Foster said she hoped the announcement gave people time to plan First Minister Arlene Foster welcomed the announcement of Christmas arrangements and said she hoped it would give people space to plan. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was a ""message of hope"" but urged people to be responsible, safe and mindful of healthcare workers. âThink, can you meet up differently, can you go for a walk, for example, with a family member?â she said. Arlene Foster said the relaxations would apply in people's homes, in non-essential retail and places of worship but not in hospitality. She said people should stick to the regulations on hospitality concerning the number of households allowed to meet together at the time. Northern Ireland is due to begin a two-week lockdown from this Friday until 11 December, in a bid to curb the spread of the virus before Christmas.  Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said the approach to Christmas was ""not a choice between relaxation or no relaxation"" but a plan to allow celebrations ""in a controlled way"". He stressed this is ""not an instruction to travel"" and ""not an instruction to meet with other people"". Asked if he had any concerns about relaxing the restrictions, he said ""misgivings happen either way"". Mr Drakeford said: ""It is having a form of relaxation where there are rules that people will recognise, that will allow people to enjoy Christmas, but will do it in a controlled way."" He admitted he had ""hesitation"" - because of the state of the virus in Wales and the UK as a whole - but added: ""It is better that we have a common set of arrangements that give people a framework that they can manage within and act responsibly within as well."" Asked about what plans and preparations are being made for the opening months of 2021, he replied: ""What I am keen on is that we don't, on a four nation basis, simply think about five days of Christmas. ""We think of a common approach to Christmas and a common approach to dealing with the consequences of Christmas as well."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the relaxation would not apply to Hogmanay Talking about the plans, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged people to try to limit their interaction. She said there would be some people who felt the need to come
together over Christmas and âwe want to allow thatâ but âjust because this can
be doneâ, it is not the case that people should feel âthey should do it if they
donât have toâ. Ms Sturgeon also confirmed that travel restrictions would be lifted
to allow people to visit families in other parts of the UK within the three-household bubble. She said the three-household bubble was a âfixed bubble for
that five-day period - you canât see two households one day and another two
households the next dayâ. The first minister confirmed the relaxation would not apply
to Hogmanay, saying âwe canât do everything hereâ. ""The last thing we want to do right now is set our
progress back,â she added. On the matter of hugs, she cautioned people against doing things that allow the virus to spread. Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove says he is
""very pleased"" to have reached an agreement with the other four
regions. However he warns that a ""balance has to be struck""
between relaxing the restrictions over Christmas and beating back the virus. He says the progress on vaccines means there is ""light at the end of the tunnel"" but he adds ""it is important we don't let things get too loose over Christmas."" ""I know that people will use these freedoms responsibly."" He said this was an opportunity
for people to ""meet close friends and family in a very restricted fashion,
in order to ensure that those we love can be with us at this special season,
but only for a limited period, but not in hospitality venues and not in any
locations where the virus might spread fast"". Mr Gove said he now planned to
spend Christmas with his mother and father in Aberdeen.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,2.848102e-07
"A deal to allow families to meet over Christmas has been reached by the leaders of all four UK nations. A source told the BBC that details on how Covid restrictions will be relaxed will be announced shortly. Scotland's first minister said she would ""continue to ask people to err on the side of caution"". BBC Scotland's chief political correspondent said three households will be allowed to meet indoors over five days between 23-27 December. Glenn Campbell said they will be able to meet in each other's homes, at a place of worship and in an outdoor public space. But the groupings must be ""exclusive"", meaning you cannot get together with people from more than two other households. He added the leaders of the nations are expected to urge Britons to use any new flexibility sparingly because public health officials are worried Christmas get-togethers could cause a January spike in Covid cases. Speaking ahead of a meeting of the UK government's emergency committee Cobra,Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford cautioned any extra freedoms would not be an instruction to do ""risky things"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also stressed any changes would be ""temporary"" and ""limited"". She said that the ""details"" may differ ""to reflect different circumstances in each nation"", such as what the definition of a ""household"" might be. She added: ""I know everyone has a desire to see loved ones over the festive period. ""However, there is also a very real and a very legitimate anxiety that doing so could put those we love at risk, set back our progress as a country and result in unnecessary deaths and suffering."" Where will mass testing be available? What will England's new lockdown rules be? Travellers can cut quarantine if they pay for test Act responsibly over Christmas, asks Drakeford Meanwhile, the government has recorded another 608 deaths of people in the UK who have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test. There were also a further 11,299 cases of people testing positive for coronavirus. What to do about Christmas divides opinion. Increased mixing indoors will certainly mean there is greater transmission of the virus. But, as chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty said on Monday, there is a balance to be struck between the harm the virus can cause and the societal and economic impacts of trying to control it. He called for a ""public-spirited approach"". By that he means adhering to the restrictions in the lead up to Christmas, being responsible with the opportunity the relaxation gives people and then immediately switching back to compliance. If that happens any impact could be minimised - and, of course, it will be up to individuals to decide just how much they mix within the rules. These are very fine judgement calls by ministers. They hope Christmas will provide respite and help steel the public for what is clearly going to be a long, hard winter. They also feel they have little choice, believing large numbers of people would ignore pleas not to mix and this way they can provide advice on how to enjoy Christmas as safely as possible. But there is also the risk by sanctioning it there will be more mixing than there would have otherwise been. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has acknowledged there would be risks of letting people meet over Christmas but said families should have the chance to reunite. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps earlier said Christmas travellers should plan journeys carefully and prepare for restrictions on passenger numbers. This video can not be played Grant Shapps: People will have to ""think about the routes they are taking"" Referring to domestic travel during the festive period, Mr Shapps urged those travelling on public transport to pre-book tickets as the capacity of services remains reduced to allow for social distancing and as a result of staff self-isolating. Mr Shapps also highlightedNetwork Rail's plans for a series of upgrades and routine maintenance,externalacross Britain between 23 December to 4 January. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I would appeal to people to think very carefully about their travel plans and consider where they are going to travel and look at the various alternatives available."" Coronavirus restrictions and work from home guidance have led to a sharp reduction in train passenger numbers Mr Shapps added that people who live in areas placed in the highest tier of restrictions in England should avoid leaving their region entirely. Mr Shapps said confirmation of the exact rules would come by Thursday - when people find out which tier their local area will be in - or potentially before then. It comes after the prime minister confirmed tougher tier curbs once England's lockdown ends. Gyms and non-essential shops in all parts of England will be allowed to reopen from 2 Decemberunder a strengthened three-tiered system. Areas will not find out which tier they are in until Thursday - and the decision will be based on a number of factors including case numbers, the reproduction rate - or R number - and pressure on local NHS services. At a Downing Street news conference on Monday to outlinea ""Covid-19 winter plan"",external, Mr Johnson admitted Christmas this year would be very different to normal. ""I can't say that Christmas will be normal this year, but in a period of adversity time spent with loved ones is even more precious for people of all faiths and none,"" he said. ""We all want some kind of Christmas; we need it; we certainly feel we deserve it. ""But this virus obviously is not going to grant a Christmas truceâ¦ and families will need to make a careful judgement about the risks of visiting elderly relatives."" SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Meanwhile, Mr Shapps announced people arriving in England from many countrieswill be soon able to reduce their quarantine period by more than halfif they pay for a coronavirus test after five days. The rules will come into force from 15 December and the tests from private firms will cost between Â£65 and Â£120. Elsewhere, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs the UK's new mass testing capacity could be used after the pandemic to diagnose a wider range of illnesses. He said a British culture of ""soldiering on"" and going to work despite having symptoms of illnesses, including flu, ""should change"". ""In fact, I want to have a change in the British way of doing things where 'if in doubt, get a test' doesn't just refer to coronavirus, but refers to any illness you might have,"" he said.

It came as Mr Biden's victory in the state of Michigan was officially certified, a major blow to Mr Trump. The GSA announcement means the president-elect now has access to top security briefings, office space and government officials as he prepares to take office on 20 January. His transition website has now changed to a US government domain,external. He will begin announcing the people he wants in the top jobs in his cabinet on Tuesday. What Biden's new foreign policy team tells us Biden to pick 'first US female treasury secretary' Why does the US presidential transition matter? It welcomed the start of the transition process as the Democratic president-elect gears up to be sworn in. Joe Biden has been elected America's 46th president ""Today's decision is a needed step to begin tackling the challenges facing our nation, including getting the pandemic under control and our economy back on track,"" a team statement said. Earlier, Mr Biden unveiled his nominations for his foreign policy and national security team, consisting of old colleagues from his years in the Obama administration. He is set to appoint Anthony Blinken as secretary of state and John Kerry as climate envoy, while Janet Yellen is tipped to be the first female US treasury secretary. The list of selections came ahead of a formal announcement Tuesday. Most of the appointments will require Senate confirmation. Mr Trump tweeted as the GSA, which is tasked with formally beginning presidential changeovers, informed the Biden camp that it would start the transition process. GSA administrator Emily Murphy said she was making $6.3m (Â£4.7m) in funds available to the president-elect. Mr Trump said: ""In the best interest of our Country, I am recommending that Emily and her team do what needs to be done,externalwith regard to initial protocols, and have told my team to do the same."" He did not concede, however, and went on to repeat unsubstantiated claims of corruption, pledging to keep up the ""good fight"". It is worth noting that Mr Trump does not have to concede for Mr Biden to be sworn in as the 46th US president. GSA chief Emily Murphy wrote in a letter to Mr Biden on Monday that he could begin to prepare to take the reins of power Ms Murphy, a Trump appointee, cited ""recent developments involving legal challenges and certifications of election results"" in her decision to start the transition process. She said she had received no pressure from the White House over the timing of the move. ""I did, however, receive threats online, by phone, and by mail directed at my safety, my family, my staff, and even my pets in an effort to coerce me into making this determination prematurely,"" Ms Murphy said in a letter to Mr Biden. ""Even in the face of thousands of threats I have remained committed to upholding the law."" She had faced criticism from both political sides for failing to begin the transition process sooner, usually a routine step between the election and the inauguration. Although most of Mr Trump's fellow Republicans have united behind his refusal to accept defeat until now, some have increasingly been breaking rank. Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander, who is retiring, said the president should ""put the country first"" and help Mr Biden succeed. ""When you are in public life, people remember the last thing you do.""

More than 160 business leaders had also urged Ms Murphy in an open letter to immediately recognise Mr Biden as president-elect. ""Withholding resources and vital information from an incoming administration puts the public and economic health and security of America at risk,â³ they wrote. Michigan is the latest hotly contested state to certify its election result, despite disputes from Mr Trump's campaign. Mr Biden won in Michigan by more than 154,000 votes. However, Mr Trump claimed voter fraud swayed the outcome, without offering evidence. The president's Republican allies had called for the certification - which finalises the outcome of a state's popular vote - to be delayed for two weeks to audit ballots in a heavily Democratic county. However, the Michigan Board of State Canvassers voted to certify the result on Monday. One of two Republicans on the Michigan State Board of Canvassers joined the two Democrats to finalise the outcome. The other Republican board member, Norman Shinkle, abstained, suggesting delaying the certification over irregularities affecting a few hundred votes in one county. Can Trump overturn the election result? 'Overvoting' and other US fraud claims fact-checked This video can not be played How to move on after the US election Mr Biden will now receive all 16 of the state's votes in the US Electoral College, which is expected to approve Mr Biden's victory on 14 December. Mr Trump's legal team said they would still challenge Michigan's results. Mr Trump and his allies have suffered a string of court defeats in key states as they race to challenge the results. InPennsylvania, a Republican judge on Saturday ruled that the Trump campaign had tried to ""disenfranchise almost seven million voters"" with no real evidence. The president's lawyers have appealed now to the Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. The president's other legal efforts in the state have failed to change Mr Biden's lead of some 80,000 votes. The Trump campaign has also called for another recount inGeorgia, after an earlier recount by hand confirmed Mr Biden's win in the state. InWisconsin, a partial recount is under way by request of the Trump campaign. Election officials have accused Trump supporters of obstructing the state's recount of votes. They said observers for Mr Trump were in some cases challenging every single ballot to deliberately slow down proceedings. Who will be the next US president?

"The government is planning to pass new laws to cut Britain's overseas aid budget, the BBC has learned. It has raised fears among MPs that the reduction could be permanent. There had been speculation the chancellor was proposing a temporary, one-off cut to help pay down the government's record deficit. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK is ""a leading, if not one of the leading, countries on aid"" and ""that will continue"". The idea behind a temporary cut was to reduce aid spending next year to just 0.5% of national income, down from the legally binding target of 0.7%. But the BBC understands that Rishi Sunak's reforms will require new legislation to be passed by Parliament, which MPs believe implies a permanent cut to the aid target or even its abolition. The issue is that the 0.7% baseline for Britain's aid budget is enshrined in law by the International Development (Official Development Assistance Target) Act. Archbishop Welby warns against foreign aid cuts Cameron and Blair warn against aid budget cut Cut to UK's foreign aid budget 'not ruled out' This does allow the government to miss the target in certain circumstances, such as if there is a substantial change in the country's national income. Foreign and Development Secretary Dominic Raab is simply required to lay a report before Parliament explaining why he has missed the target. But there is a growing belief at Westminster that this exemption can apply only retrospectively. The act places a duty on Mr Raab to ensure the 0.7% target is met. If he misses it, the act requires him to describe what steps he has taken to ensure the target is met the following year. Some MPs and charities believe these two provisions mean the government cannot declare in advance its intention to miss the target without breaking the law. To cut the aid budget without fresh legislation might lay the decision open to judicial review. MPs also believe that a one-off cut to the aid target - a saving of about Â£4bn - would hardly touch the sides of the Â£350bn deficit projected for this year. They say it only makes sense for the Treasury if the cut is permanent. They also believe that if the government is going to reduce aid spending and face significant political and international criticism, ministers will be tempted to go the whole hog and scrap the target entirely. Almost 200 charities,two former prime ministers, opposition parties, church leaders, ex-heads of the armed forces, global philanthropists have all come out against the cuts. TheArchbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson not to go ahead with cuts, saying that ""helping the world's poorest is one of the great moral and ethical achievements of our country"". The risk for the government is that passing new legislation would give critics of the aid cut the chance to oppose and potentially block the changes in Parliament. Although the government has a working majority of more than 80, it has seen a number of rebellions of late. One senior Tory MP said defeating the government on this ""would be entirely doable"". Such is the scale of the reforms to the aid target that Mr Raab is expected to make a statement to MPs about it on Thursday.

"As much as Â£1bn in benefit fraud has been prevented from being paid to organised-crime groups in recent months, BBC News has learned. But before the scam was spotted, officials unwittingly confirmed thousands of stolen identities. Fraudsters took advantage of looser rules introduced to cope with a surge of universal credit claims during the pandemic. BBC News has asked the Department for Work and Pensions for a response. In May, a junior civil servant working with High Street banks noticed dozens of claims for universal credit had been made asking for money to be paid into the same bank account. Further investigation identified more than 100,000 fraudulent claims. And officials admit they had confirmed thousands of people's identities to the gangs that had stolen them - and passed on their National Insurance numbers. The Department for Work and Pensions wants to write to those whose data has been compromised. But BBC News has learned it is struggling to identify many of them and is wary of sending out letters to last known addresses in case they end up in the wrong hands, exacerbating the data breach. Claimants whose identities have been stolen can face real hardship, as it can be months before their accurate benefits are paid. Currently, 5.7 million people receive universal credit, almost double the figure for March. To cope with the surge, identity checks were processed online, rather than face-to-face, and information such as the cost of rent and whether someone had been self-employed taken on trust. Criminal gangs have attacked several government Covid-19 schemes. In May, officials told BBC Newsabout Â£1.5bn may already have been lost in fraudulent universal credit payments Last month, a National Audit Office report foundas much as Â£3bn may have been lost through the furlough scheme DWP officials have asked the Treasury for Â£200m over three years, in this spending round, calculating it would enable it to prevent such mass scams and save taxpayers about Â£500m each year. It is estimated more than a million claims for universal credit have still to be properly checked, with additional rising concerns tens of thousands of people may have claimed the benefit without declaring they had received government grants to help the self-employed. However, the Treasury has turned down the request. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"'Janet' was pinned to the ground and punched when she was arrested in May. Eight officers are under investigation after a black woman was pinned to the ground and punched during an arrest, the Metropolitan Police has confirmed. The woman has told the BBC she feared for her life, and says police subjected her to further violence in custody. Two of the officers under investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) have been placed on restricted duties. Details into the probe have been made public after a Newsnight investigation. Mobile phone footage of the woman's arrest, which happened on 9 May after officers pulled over a car in south-east London, shows how several police officers physically restrained the young woman - who is a student in her 20s and had been a passenger in the car. One female officer can be seen repeatedly striking the woman. In a statement the IOPC said: ""Eight officers have been served with notices advising them they are subject to investigation, with six officers at misconduct level and two officers at gross misconduct level."" Details of the IOPC probe into the treatment of the woman have been made public after an investigation by BBC Newsnight into the way she was handled during her arrest. Janet - not her real name - told the programme she had been working on an essay and went to get a takeaway, where she met an old friend with whom she ended up driving to a cash machine. While she was a passenger in the man's car, it was pulled over after officers allegedly noticed he had been driving erratically. The driver has since been convicted of drink-driving. Janet, who wished not to be identified, described the incident as ""dehumanising"" Janet told BBC Newsnight she was pulled out of the car by an officer before it had come to a complete stop: ""I just remember things turning like they looked a bit radioactive to me because I couldn't... I knew that I was losing consciousness."" She says she told the female police officer who punched her that the officer holding her down was killing her. She says the female officer ""smirked"" and responded: 'If you can talk, you can breathe."" Janet was arrested on suspicion of obstructing a drug search. She says she was lifted up from the street by her handcuffs and her hair braids, causing hair to be ripped out of her scalp, and was carried to the police van. This video can not be played Mobile phone footage showing the arrest of the woman. Inside Lewisham police station, she was subjected to further violence during a strip search which happened in the presence of male as well as female officers - something against police regulations. ""They didn't even tell me they were going to strip-search me. It literally just happened when in the presence of the male and female officers with my cell door wide open, so people were passing."" She claims this was done to ""humiliate me more - dehumanise me more"". Once stripped naked, Janet says she was subjected to more violence, during which one police officer punched her repeatedly ""very, very, very, very hard - there was a lot of intensity in her"". Janet said she resisted as she had recently had surgery on her stomach, and was worried about the pressure they were applying to her while she was on the floor. The tactics used in this arrest such as handcuffing, restraint and hitting, are known as Use of Force, and are all measures officers are permitted to take under certain circumstances. However, senior police figures who have seen the video of the detention of the woman told BBC Newsnight the level of force and the number of officers applying it in this case, seem unusual. BBC Newsnight has obtained Use of Force data from 37 out of the 44 police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. During the lockdown months of April and May, 27 out of the 37 police forces saw a rise in Use of Force, compared with the same months in 2019. The Metropolitan Police - the UK's biggest force - saw a rise of 26% from 25,993 Use of Force incidents recorded in April and May 2019, to 32,705 in the same months in 2020. Home Office figures for England and Wales show black people are approximately six times more likely to be subjected to Use of Force than white people - a disparity that does not apply to other ethnic minorities. The woman whose story features in BBC Newsnight's report has not received an apology from the police. All charges against her have been dropped. Police are required to record each time they use force The Metropolitan Police said: ""All police officers are fully aware that they will be asked to account for their actions. Officers are not exempt from the law, and nor would we wish to be. ""The Met continues to co-operate with the IOPC's investigation team to ensure that all the facts are established. ""Eight officers are under investigation in relation to this incident; two of whom have been placed on restricted duties."" The IOPC said: ""Use of Force is an essential policing tool and like all police powers must be used properly, proportionately and responsibly. ""We are examining the circumstances of the woman's arrest and the Use of Force on her. ""Our investigation is also looking at the woman's subsequent treatment in custody. As part of the investigation, we have already taken a statement from the woman."" It added: ""To uphold public confidence in the police complaints system, we are investigating the use of stop-and-search tactics in this incident and whether the actions of those officers were appropriate and proportionate and followed approved police policies. ""We are also investigating if racial profiling or discrimination played a part in the incident. ""This incident took place in public view late at night and was probably witnessed by passers-by and members of the public. We would ask anybody who was in the area that evening and saw police activity to get in touch with us."" Regarding the Use of Force figures, the Home Office told BBC Newsnight: ""We are clear that all Use of Force must be reasonable, proportionate and necessary - and no-one should be subject to it based on their race or ethnicity."" And responding to the rise in Use of Force incidents, the National Police Chiefs Council said the fall in crime during lockdown gave police ""breathing space to carry out pro-active operations against known criminals"". In a statement, it added: ""We have also seen a notable increase in assaults against emergency services workers since the beginning of the pandemic, and officers have accordingly had to use non-verbal tactics against offenders. ""Any action of this kind would necessitate that a Use of Force form is completed, which would therefore show an increase of overall force used.""

"President Trump has yet to concede to Joe Biden but has accepted that the formal transition process should begin, even as his team's legal challenges continue. So what is involved in the transition and why is it so important? It's the handover of important information and duties from one administration to the next - ensuring the president-elect and their team are up-to-speed when they get to the White House. The incoming administration is assisted by a government agency known as the General Services Administration (GSA), which provides funding and helps with things like office space, equipment, and technology. A transition typically lasts about 11 weeks, normally from when it's clear who the winner is, up to 20 January when the next president officially takes over. It's not just one job that's being handed over - the new president has to fill around 4,000 political positions, according to the Center for Presidential Transition. Three main things take place - staffing, briefings, and organising the president-elect's packed schedule. Once the handover officially begins, it's run by the president-elect's transition team which has been preparing throughout the campaign. One of the most important elements is the daily security briefing. All major presidential candidates receive some national security information before the election, but these briefings are not as frequent or detailed as the ones received by the president-elect. Mr Biden will now get daily briefings with classified US intelligence information, ensuring the new administration is prepared for anything that might come its way. The transition from Bill Clinton to George W Bush was delayed by a dispute over votes in Florida The commission into the 11 September attacks carried out in 2001 found that the delayed transition after the 2000 election could have contributed to the then Bush administration's failure to prevent them. The incoming administration is also allocated additional office space and equipment as it prepares for life in the White House. Meetings would usually be arranged with the current members of government agencies to help with staffing and policy changes, and key team members will often shadow outgoing staff to prepare for their new roles. Mr Biden has already begun appointing key staff members, but the transition process helps the heads of each government agency identify the roles they need to fill. Of the 4,000 political positions the incoming administration fills, about 1,200 require Senate confirmation - with the government helping to provide background checks during the transition. This year, there's also the coronavirus pandemic, and Mr Biden has said he wants more contact with top health agency officials and access to full public health information. Mr Biden has set up a Covid-19 advisory team but says his access to crucial information has been limited As well as meetings with government officials, the transition team usually co-ordinates with the State Department to organise calls between the president-elect and foreign leaders. Until now, Mr Biden's team has had to communicate through unofficial channels. It will now be able to use government e-mail and have access to secure channels. Following previous elections, the president-elect and their spouse have been given a tour of the White House and asked about their preferred decor as they prepare to move in - although this is more of a convention than a legal requirement. It usually starts when a letter is issued by the GSA recognising who the next president is. But this year, the GSA had refused to issue a letter recognising Mr Biden as the winner until 23 November - almost three weeks after the election was held. This blocked the release of funds and other resources for the Biden team. The legal requirements on when a transition has to begin are vague, giving the Trump administration some leeway to seek a delay as it disputes the election result. Under US law, the GSA has to trigger the transition once there's an ""apparent winner"", although there's no firm date set for when this has to be. It's been delayed before - in 2000 the transition period was half its usual length as the election result was being contested in court, although that was a much tighter race than this year. By contrast, Mr Trump was recognised as the winner by the GSA the day after the 2016 election - long before the results were made official - and he visited President Obama in the White House the day after that. The cost of the transition is covered by a combination of government money and private funds. Once the president-elect is recognised by the GSA, about $7m of federal funding is released. This is usually topped up by funds raised by the president-elect. The New York Times reported,externalthat Mr Biden had raised around $7m for his transition effort in early November, and he has sinceappealed for further funds,externalfrom his supporters. This all goes towards paying the millions of dollars of expenses built up by the presidential transition. A simple guide to the US election Where does Donald Trump stand on key issues?

"Ambassador Greenfield-Thomas pictured with Tanzania's former president in 2014 The three people chosen by US President-elect Joe Biden to lead his foreign policy team will bring decades of diplomatic experience to the White House, but they also face criticism from those who object to the baggage that comes along with years of serving the US government. Here's a little on who they are and then what the experts say about the message Mr Biden is sending with his choice of top US diplomats. The three people who will be advising Mr Biden on issues beyond America's borders are not well known beyond Washington. Antony Blinken, Linda Thomas-Greenfield and Jake Sullivan are all alumni of the Barack Obama White House, and are considered Biden loyalists and foreign policy centrists. Mr Blinken, 58 - whose work with Mr Biden goes back nearly 20 years - has been picked to serve as secretary of state, the nation's top diplomat. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, one of the most high-profile black female US diplomats who worked for years on African affairs, has been nominated to serve as US Ambassador to the United Nations. Jake Sullivan is a former state department official and Hillary Clinton aide who played a key role in negotiating the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal. He served as Mr Biden's national security adviser when he was vice-president. How will Biden change US foreign policy? Mr Blinken's work with Mr Biden dates back to his tenure on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as a Delaware lawmaker. Some critics have blamed him for Mr Biden's vote to invade Iraq in 2003. That personal connection will serve the team well, say several former US diplomats, but it could also mean a lack of diversity in opinion. And their wealth of Washington experience as foreign policy veterans will not endear them to all. It does, however, mark a break with Trump's war on the so-called ""deep state"" - individuals in government he regarded as working against his own agenda. This is not a team of rivals. While they have a history of working well together, they will also bring complementary perspectives to the Situation Room, with hands-on experience in global conflicts. The value of strategic coherence will outweigh any potential for groupthink. They are not card-carrying members of a deep state, but will help lead a more effective American state focused on shared interests and values. They are pragmatists, not ideologues.PJ Crowley, former US assistant secretary of state The appointments represent a return to normalcy and an end to an erratic approach to policy. But the question is whether a return to normalcy is enough. This team has a belief in American supremacy which could lead them to recklessness in their use of American military power.Andrew Bacevich, president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft As a longtime foreign service officer, Mrs Thomas-Greenfield in particular, represents the ""deep state"" that Donald Trump was so dismissive of. For Donald Trump, foreign service officers were the foot soldiers of the liberal internationalism that he wanted to take down. This is partly the reason for why morale is so low at the State Department right now.Charles Kupchan, former member of the White House National Security Council Jake Sullivan consults with former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during a congressional hearing Top of the agenda for the Biden team will be re-joining organisations, alliances and treaties that Mr Trump worked to weaken or dissolve over the past four years. They will be tasked with bringing the US back into the Paris climate agreement and keeping the US in the World Health Organization. They will also seek to revise the Iran nuclear deal, bolster ties with Nato and seek trade agreements as a means to counter China's rising influence. One of the reasons that Trump was elected was because a large number of Americans judged American foreign policy as having failed. The question is whether this team has learned enough to bring about the changes that we actually need including reducing the military budget and greater restraint in the use of military forces.Andrew Bacevich Donald Trump never really built a national security team. Instead, he played the Lone Ranger while surrounding himself with independent contractors he could hire and fire by tweet. All three of these officials have served at the Department of State and will place renewed value on international diplomacy and collaboration to solve urgent challenges from the global pandemic to climate change to the China challenge.PJ Crowley A big challenge is going to be persuading foreign audiences, even partners and allies, that the US is credible in terms of its staying power - that ""America is back"" as the president-elect has said. This will be the second 180-degree shift in foreign policy in the past four years. The incoming administration has a determination to restore the frayed alliances that the US has relied on for more than seven decades. But they have their work cut out for them.Stewart Patrick, Council on Foreign Relations director of the International Institutions and Global Governance programme Blinken (centre left) participates in a White House presidential briefing Most experts agree that the team Mr Biden is putting in place is more experienced than those appointed by Mr Trump, such as his first Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was a former Exxon Mobil executive. But Mr Trump's legacy at the State Department - which has seen scores of disillusioned diplomats retire early under Mr Tillerson and his replacement Mike Pompeo - run deep and cannot be swiftly overdone overnight. There has been a significant departure of expertise and experience under both Tillerson and Pompeo. The foreign service bureaucracy has felt generally out of the loop. Normally policy comes up from below, and is filtered through several agencies before reaching the president. That has not been happening under Trump.Charles Kupchan They have a consistent world view. They are strong believers in American leadership and international alliances. All three have served at the Department of State and will place renewed value on international diplomacy and collaboration to solve urgent challenges from the global pandemic to climate change to the China challenge.PJ Crowley Reporting by Tara McKelvey and Max Matza Read more: John Kerry named as Biden's 'climate tsar' Biden to pick 'first US female treasury secretary' How will Biden change US foreign policy?

"The total number of deaths occurring in the UK is nearly a fifth above normal levels, latest figures show. Data from national statisticians show there were almost 14,000 deaths in the week ending 13 November. Some 2,838 of the deaths involved Covid - 600 more than the preceding week, according to the analysis of death certificates. The North West and Yorkshire have seen the most excess deaths. The number of deaths in both regions were more than a third above expected levels. By comparison, the number of deaths in the South East was just 2% above the five-year average. But there is hope the rise in the number deaths may soon start slowing. The daily figures published by government - which rely on positive tests - show deaths are not rising as quickly as they were, and may be levelling off. And unlike in the first wave, when the lack of testing meant the government figures underestimated the number of Covid deaths, the two sets of data are mirroring each other. Sarah Scobie, of the Nuffield Trust health think tank, said: ""Despite the end of the second national lockdown in England coming into focus, today's figures are a sobering reminder of the dreadful impact of this virus. She said the high number of deaths was ""piling on the pressure"" on the NHS. ""For some hospitals, particularly in Covid hotspot areas, it will feel as if they are in the depths of winter already.""

"The four nations of the UK have agreed UK-wide rules to allow families to meet over Christmas Three households will be allowed to meet in each other's homes over five days between 23-27 December Earlier, Matt Hancock took questions at a joint session of the Health and Social Care Committee and Science and Technology Committee He defended NHS test-and-trace, saying it was not to blame for the second lockdown The health secretary also said the UK should be ""getting back to normal"" after Easter People arriving in England will be soon able to reduce their quarantine period if they pay for a Covid test Globally, the world's most vulnerable must not be ""trampled in the stampede"" for vaccines, the World Health Organization warns The developers of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine say it is proving to be up to 95% effective Edited by Emma Owen We will be back with more coronavirus coverage on our live page tomorrow. Today's updates have been brought to you by: Hugo Bachega, George Bowden, Marie Jackson, Joseph Lee, Emma Owen, Georgina Rannard, Alex Therrien, Lauren Turner and Kate Whannel. Rules will be relaxed for Christmas across the UK We are bringing our live page coverage to an end shortly. Before we do, here's a summary of today's headlines from the UK: Health officials advised people in the US to stay at home for Thanksgiving There are over 30,000 people in hospital - but cases are falling sharply With another 458 deaths reported today, France has become the latest European country to record more than 50,000 deaths during the pandemic. Italy and the UK had already passed that milestone. But France's death toll of 50,237 comes against a background of falling cases, with 9,155 infections today - compared to 45,522 last Tuesday. The number of people in hospital fell by 859 to 30,622, the sharpest fall since the country's lockdown began on 30 October. French President Emmanuel Macron announced a phased end to the lockdown, with shops allowed to reopen on Saturday. Other restrictions will remain in place. Canada's eastern provinces are dissolving their ""bubble"" that has been in effect throughout most of the pandemic. New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island (PEI), Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had restricted domestic travel from outside of their group. Outsiders were expected to quarantine for 14 days, while insiders could move freely. The bubble has been credited with keeping cases low. But on Monday, Newfoundland and Labrador and PEI said they would temporarily end the agreement, as cases in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are on the rise. PEI will also ban non-essential travel until 7 December.  A 10-year-old boy was among those who died in hospital as the UK recorded its highest daily death toll for over five months. The 608 people reported to have died within 28 days of a positive test is the largest total since 12 May, when 614 deaths were recorded. The daily death figures have begun to flatten in recent days, however, following the fall in the number of reported infections. The parents of Fehzan Jamil, who lived in Bradford and is one of the virus's youngest UK victims, told Channel 4 News of their âindescribableâ pain. Tayyaba and Mohammed Jamil said their son, who had epilepsy and other health problems, was a âreally brave fighterâ and a âsoldierâ, who was always cheerful.    Ghislaine Maxwell is due to go on trial in 2021 Ghislaine Maxwell has been quarantined after staff tested positive for Covid-19 at the jail in New York where she is awaiting trial, US prosecutors say. Maxwell is accused of helping her former boyfriend, late financier Jeffrey Epstein, traffic and sexually abuse underage girls and of perjury for denying involvement in such a scheme when she gave her deposition under oath. She has pleaded not guilty. The staff tested positive last week and Maxwell, 58, was checked for the virus on 18 November using a rapid test which was negative, the prosecutors said in a letter to US District Judge Alison Nathan. She will go on trial next year, and is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. The mutations observed in coronavirus isolates from mink have also been observed in ferrets, according to the latestminutes from the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage),external. Sage said preliminary evidence suggested ferrets could pose a risk to those who are most
vulnerable to the virus, but were low risk otherwise. Unlike mink, they are normally not kept in high-intensity farms. Sage said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is currently assessing the risk to people in the UK and is developing messaging for ferret owners. There are fears mutations of the virus in animals could hamper the effectiveness of coronavirus vaccines. Earlier this month,Denmark culled all its mink - up to 17 million animals - because of the spread of coronavirus in the animal. Sage said coordination was needed across academic groups  and relevant bodies on the risks of human to animal transmission and the intensive rearing of
animals. The Sage minutes said the UK's vaccine taskforce would note potential implications for vaccine targeting of variants
including those that are mink-adapted. What's the science behind mink and coronavirus? We take a look here Theo LeggettBBC business correspondent The global airline industry will make a net loss of $118bn (Â£88bn) this year, according to the International Air Transport Association (Iata), and a further loss of $38bn is expected next year. The figures are much higher than previous estimates, and reflect the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, and continued restrictions on travel. Iata's Director General Alexandre de Juniac explained that 2020 had been the worst financial year in the industry's history. Without financial support from governments, he said, there would have been bankruptcies on ""a massive scale"". According to Iata, airlines have been able to cut their costs collectively by $365bn this year, a reduction of nearly 46%. But this has been outweighed by a drop in revenues of more than 60%. The organisation says it does expect the situation to improve next year, with some opening of borders, either through improved testing or a vaccine. But it still expects losses to be greater than any the industry has ever suffered, with the exception of 2020. Passenger numbers are expected to drop to 1.8 billion thisyear from 4.5 billion in 2019, and will recover only partially to 2.8 billion next year, according to the association. Alistair ColemanBBC Disinformation unit Signs like this have wrongly suggested that a royal charter from 1215 gives business owners the right to refuse to close In the UK,a Yorkshire hairdresser is facing fines totalling Â£27,000($36,000) for refusing to close her salon during lockdown. Sinead Quinn has a sign in her shop window saying that she ""does not consent"" to coronavirus laws, claiming her right to do so is set out in the Magna Carta, a royal charter from more than 800 years ago that was England's first form of a written constitution. However, no such right exists and she's been fined multiple times for staying open. She's one of several traders including a tattoo artist in Bristol, and aNottinghamshire bookshop, who claim that ""Article 61"" of the Magna Carta signed by King John in 1215 gives them the right to ignore ""unjust"" laws. But Article 61 was removed from Magna Carta within a year of its signing, andonly three clauses of the document remain law today.,external That's not stopped anti-lockdown social media accounts offering a downloadable notice for businesses to place in their windows. This notice also refers to a""Freeman on the Land"" defence, which claims citizens have had their identities ""stolen"" by the state, and by asserting their rights as ""sovereign citizens"" they are only bound by laws to which they consent. No ""Freeman on the Land"" defence has ever prevailed in court. One scientific expert said the relaxation of restrictions over Christmas will ""almost inevitably"" lead to an increase in transmission, but that the celebration may still be what is needed to âmake it through the rest of winterâ. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, said: âThe issue is whether that increased risk is tolerable in relation to the benefits. At that time schools will be closed so there would naturally be some downward pressure on transmission."" He said if the new tier system is working well ""there will be a downward pressure on transmission before and after the Christmas break"", so any increase in cases ""could be relatively short-lived"". ""After Christmas we will still have to live through a few more months of restrictions at least,"" the professor said. This video can not be played Gove: ""Three households can have a Christmas bubble"" Cabinet minister Michael Gove says people will be able to ""enjoy something closer to a normal Christmas"" after the four nations reached an agreement. But the bubbles, of up to three households, must be exclusive and people have to comply with hospitality rules in place in their area, depending which tier they're in. Mr Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said it was a chance to ""meet close friends and family in a very restricted fashion"". Three households can meet over a five-day
period (23 - 27 December) in the UK. However, those in Northern Ireland have been granted a bigger window (22 - 28 December) to allow for any additional travel time to and from the region. Sam says she wants to get together ""even if it's just for one day"" Families are now facing a big choice about whether to take advantage of the freedom to meet up at Christmas - or whether to play it safe. Sam in Devon is building a grotto in her garden ready for a small family gathering. She told the BBC: ""Itâs the only time of the year I get everybody together, it's very important, it's special. ""Itâs not the presents or anything else, itâs having my family. Even if itâs just for one day."" But she said people ""have to be sensible otherwise weâre going to have a really rotten January"". But others said they would not be travelling. Father and daughter Naomi and Roy said they would not be making the trip between Devon and South Wales this year. ""I would love to do it, but no,"" Naomi said. ""Especially with the vaccine development, it just seems like too high risk regardless of what we're allowed to do."" ""The only thing thatâs missing is the physical contact,"" said Roy, adding that he missed the grandchildren, ""If that has to be, I would rather miss out in 2020 if it means we can do what we normally do in 2021.""  This year, Naomi and dad Roy will spend Christmas apart We've had some more detail about what the Christmas announcements will mean for different groups: In a joint statement from all four governments, the leaders say 2020 ""has been an incredibly difficult year for us all"". ""We have all had to make significant sacrifices in our everyday lives, and many
religious and community groups have already had to change or forgo their
customary celebrations to slow the spread of coronavirus and save lives. ""This cannot be
a ânormalâ Christmas but as we approach the festive period, we have been
working closely together to find a way for family and friends to see each
other, even if it is for a short time, and recognising that it must be both
limited and cautious."" They urge people to use ""personal judgement"" and be ""mindful of the risks"" particularly when meeting those
who are vulnerable. ""We urge the consideration of alternative approaches such as the use of
technology or meeting outside,"" the statement adds. NI First Minister Arlene Foster said she hoped the announcement gave people time to plan First Minister Arlene Foster welcomed the announcement of Christmas arrangements and said she hoped it would give people space to plan. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was a ""message of hope"" but urged people to be responsible, safe and mindful of healthcare workers. âThink, can you meet up differently, can you go for a walk, for example, with a family member?â she said. Arlene Foster said the relaxations would apply in people's homes, in non-essential retail and places of worship but not in hospitality. She said people should stick to the regulations on hospitality concerning the number of households allowed to meet together at the time. Northern Ireland is due to begin a two-week lockdown from this Friday until 11 December, in a bid to curb the spread of the virus before Christmas.  Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said the approach to Christmas was ""not a choice between relaxation or no relaxation"" but a plan to allow celebrations ""in a controlled way"". He stressed this is ""not an instruction to travel"" and ""not an instruction to meet with other people"". Asked if he had any concerns about relaxing the restrictions, he said ""misgivings happen either way"". Mr Drakeford said: ""It is having a form of relaxation where there are rules that people will recognise, that will allow people to enjoy Christmas, but will do it in a controlled way."" He admitted he had ""hesitation"" - because of the state of the virus in Wales and the UK as a whole - but added: ""It is better that we have a common set of arrangements that give people a framework that they can manage within and act responsibly within as well."" Asked about what plans and preparations are being made for the opening months of 2021, he replied: ""What I am keen on is that we don't, on a four nation basis, simply think about five days of Christmas. ""We think of a common approach to Christmas and a common approach to dealing with the consequences of Christmas as well."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the relaxation would not apply to Hogmanay Talking about the plans, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged people to try to limit their interaction. She said there would be some people who felt the need to come
together over Christmas and âwe want to allow thatâ but âjust because this can
be doneâ, it is not the case that people should feel âthey should do it if they
donât have toâ. Ms Sturgeon also confirmed that travel restrictions would be lifted
to allow people to visit families in other parts of the UK within the three-household bubble. She said the three-household bubble was a âfixed bubble for
that five-day period - you canât see two households one day and another two
households the next dayâ. The first minister confirmed the relaxation would not apply
to Hogmanay, saying âwe canât do everything hereâ. ""The last thing we want to do right now is set our
progress back,â she added. On the matter of hugs, she cautioned people against doing things that allow the virus to spread. Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove says he is
""very pleased"" to have reached an agreement with the other four
regions. However he warns that a ""balance has to be struck""
between relaxing the restrictions over Christmas and beating back the virus. He says the progress on vaccines means there is ""light at the end of the tunnel"" but he adds ""it is important we don't let things get too loose over Christmas."" ""I know that people will use these freedoms responsibly."" He said this was an opportunity
for people to ""meet close friends and family in a very restricted fashion,
in order to ensure that those we love can be with us at this special season,
but only for a limited period, but not in hospitality venues and not in any
locations where the virus might spread fast"". Mr Gove said he now planned to
spend Christmas with his mother and father in Aberdeen.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9997309
"The encounter between Tristram Shapeero (pictured, left, in 2013) and Lukas Gage took place in August Director Tristram Shapeero has apologised after unwittingly commenting on an actor's ""tiny apartment"" without realising he could be heard. Euphoria actor Lukas Gage was auditioning for a role via Zoom earlier this year when an unmuted Shapeero began making comments about his home. Gage uploaded the video of the encounter to Twitter this week. Shapeero apologised to Gage at the time and has now written an open letter to him about his ""unacceptable"" remarks. Shapeero is a well-known producer and director in Hollywood and has worked on The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Never Have I Ever. In the video, which includes bad language andwas posted on Twitter,externalby Gage on Saturday, the actor can be seen in his apartment about to audition on Zoom for a screen role. An unseen Shapeero can then be heard saying: ""These poor people live in these tiny apartments. Like I'm looking at his, you know, background and he's got his TV..."" But Shapeero doesn't get any further before Gage interjects: ""I know it's a [rubbish] apartment that's why [you should] give me this job so I can get a better one."" Realising his previous comment was audible, Shapeero immediately apologises, telling Gage: ""Oh my god, I am so, so sorry... I am absolutely mortified."" With a smile, Gage responds: ""It's totally... Listen, I'm living in a four-by-four box, just give me the job and we'll be fine."" When he posted the video on Twitter, Gage captioned it: ""Public service announcement: If you're a [trash] talking director, make sure to mute [yourself] on Zoom meetings."" The audition took place in August 2020, so it is not clear why Gage has only now decided to share the footage on social media. But after posting it on Twitter on Saturday, the video went viral - it was viewed more than 9 million times and has now received nearly 300,000 likes and more than 30,000 retweets. Gage received support from major figures in the film and TV industry, including Judd Apatow, Seth MacFarlane and Billy Eichner. Gage, pictured with Pitch Perfect star Anna Camp, has also appeared in American Vandal and Love, Victor Fans immediately began speculating as to who the director could be - as Gage's tweet did not identify him by name. On Tuesday morning, Tristram Shapeero came forward to confirm he was the unseen director and apologise to Gage again, this time viaan open letter published in Deadline.,external ""First and foremost I offer Mr Gage a sincere and unvarnished apology for my offensive words, my unprofessional behaviour during the audition and for not giving him the focus and attention he deserved,"" he wrote. ""My job is to evaluate performers against the part I am trying to cast. Lukas deserved better."" Shapeero also clarified his meaning particularly around the use of the word ""poor"". ""I was using the word 'poor' in the sense of deserving sympathy, as opposed to any economic judgment,"" he explained. ""My words were being spoken from a genuine place of appreciation for what the actors were having to endure, stuck in confined spaces, finding it within themselves to give a role-winning performance under these conditions."" He concludes: ""As I say on the video, I'm mortified about what happened. While I can't put the proverbial toothpaste back in the tube, I move forward from this incident a more empathetic man; a more focused director and I promise, an even better partner to actors from the audition process to the final cut.""

"This video can not be played Testing is due to start in two weeks according to the port's owners Hauliers have claimed there will be ""mayhem"" at Holyhead port when the Brexit transition period ends. Holyhead is the second biggest ""roll-on roll-off"" port in the UK after Dover, carrying 1,200 lorries and trailers a day across the Irish Sea. The Irish Road Haulage Association (IRHA) said the first six months of 2021 would be ""terrible"" as the port is not ready to cope with the change. But the port's owner, Stena Line, has said the process would be smooth. The IRHA remain unconvinced as the deadline to agree a new UK-EU deal approaches and the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. It is concerned border-ready pre-boarding IT systems have not been tested for outbound travel. The European Union is planning to enforce border controls on the Irish side from 1 January but inbound lorries into Wales will not face any checks by UK authorities until July 2021. ""We're very concerned,"" said IRHA president Eugene Drennan. Eugene Drennan claims there has been no transition ""After the deadline and UK 'Brexiting', the decisions still won't be made. They'll unfold as the problems appear. ""That leads to a certain degree of mayhem. You will have time delay, you'll have a lot of anxious moments. ""You'll have a lot of truck people getting a little hot under the collar. You'll have ferry times delayed and you'll have a general upset. Businesses facing Covid and Brexit 'curveballs' Time 'desperately short' on Brexit Irish Sea trade Ports 'chaos' warning over customs controls ""Even though it's called a transition period, there has been no transition. ""It's a rush now these last few weeks to try and get systems together, to try and get things up and running and though the Irish side has a reasonable degree of preparedness done, some of it is very cumbersome. ""And none of it links up with Her Majesty systems. England and on that side, on the Holyhead side, they're not ready at all."" Ian Davies is confident everything will be ready in time despite the tight schedule Ian Davies, Stena Line's head of UK Port Authorities, said he was confident despite ""very, very tight"" timescales. He said: ""We are live testing in the next two weeks. We're starting to educate our staff on the new checking processes. ""We have always planned on the worst case scenario of 'no deal' because that's the only thing you can base your preparations on and so we are now confident that we are in the right place for that. ""Trader preparation is a big question. That's been hanging over everyone, but I believe that most of the guys now are fully engaged in the process."" ""There should be a clear flow through Holyhead port for inward goods from Ireland."" Stena Line confirmed the decision had been made to develop an inland custom checks facility away from Holyhead port. It is believed those will be sites in Warrington and Birmingham. Anglesey council leader Llinos Medi Huws, who is also a member of the North Wales Economic Ambition Board, has called for any checkpoint to be as close to Holyhead port as possible. ""The main concern we have is the impact that's going to have on the use of this port and the loss of jobs,"" she said. ""So the sooner we have any clarification on that we can make sure that the jobs here are safeguarded and that the people of Holyhead don't have to worry."" Llinos Medi Huws wants to see jobs protected on Anglesey Dr Edward Jones, from Bangor Business School, added: ""We seem to be getting the headache of Brexit here in that we could see parts of the island becoming a car park for the trucks, but we don't seem to be getting any of the benefits of those customs jobs. They seem to be going elsewhere."" There are fears that supply chains could be disrupted if documentation and congestion lead to delays and businesses decide to use alternative routes. A new ferry route has been set up between France and Ireland. Chris Yarsley from Logistics UK, which represents freight businesses, said the automotive manufacturing industry relies on vehicles delivering spare parts with hours to spare. ""Any break in that supply chain will cause manufacturing issues, therefore people will look to other places to source their goods and that could impact on the economic viability of the UK,"" he added. A UK government spokesman said: ""The government is working closely with the devolved administrations and ports, right across the United Kingdom, to plan for the end of the transition period and beyond. ""The delivery of IT systems necessary for the end of the transition period is on track.""

"Rhondda Cynon Taf now has the second highest death rate in England and Wales after Tameside, Greater Manchester Deaths involving Covid-19 have risen again in Wales to the highest weekly total since early May. A total of 190 deaths were registered in the week ending 13 November,according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).,external This is 24 more than the previous week and account for a quarter of all deaths in Wales. Meanwhile, 19 more deaths have been reported linked to hospital infections at Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board. Deaths reported up to 23 November 66Royal Glamorgan Hospital, Llantrisant 38Prince Charles Hospital, Merthyr Tydfil 67Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend 6Maesteg Hospital There have been 10 more deaths at the Princess of Wales hospital, Bridgend, five at the Royal Glamorgan hospital and four deaths at Prince Charles Hospital in the last week. It takes the total deaths to 177. That includes six deaths at Maesteg hospital reported a few weeks ago. The number of cases linked to the outbreaks has slowed down, rising from 597 to 628. The ONS figures show deaths in care homes involving the virus have also risen to their highest total - 36 - for five months. The proportion of Covid deaths compared to all deaths is higher in Wales than in England in this latest week. There were 56 deaths registered across the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board area, which covers Rhondda Cynon Taf, Bridgend and Merthyr. Of those, 44 were in hospital. There were also 51 deaths in the Aneurin Bevan health board area, across all settings, 29 deaths in Swansea Bay, 27 in Betsi Cadwaladr and 14 in Cardiff and Vale. There were 10 deaths in Hywel Dda and three hospital deaths involving Powys residents. The figures show: Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) with 465 deaths and Cardiff (442) have seen the most deaths in Wales so far in the pandemic. RCT has 193.6 deaths per 100,000 people - now the second highest rate across all local authorities in England and Wales. There were 36 deaths in care homes involving Covid-19 - the highest number since 22 May. The total number of Covid deaths in Wales registered by 13 November was 3,240. When deaths registered over the following few days are also counted, there is a total of 3,329 deaths occurring up to 13 November. So-called 'excess deaths', which compare all registered deaths with previous years, are above the five-year average. Comparing current figures with the number of deaths normally seen at this point in the year is regarded as a useful measure of how the pandemic is progressing. UK deaths 'a fifth higher than normal levels' What do you wonder about Covid in Wales? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Covid-19 deaths pass 3,000 in Wales In Wales, the number of deaths fell to 742 in the latest week, but this was still 84 deaths (12.8%) higher than the five-year average.

"The total number of deaths occurring in the UK is nearly a fifth above normal levels, latest figures show. Data from national statisticians show there were almost 14,000 deaths in the week ending 13 November. Some 2,838 of the deaths involved Covid - 600 more than the preceding week, according to the analysis of death certificates. The North West and Yorkshire have seen the most excess deaths. The number of deaths in both regions were more than a third above expected levels. By comparison, the number of deaths in the South East was just 2% above the five-year average. But there is hope the rise in the number deaths may soon start slowing. The daily figures published by government - which rely on positive tests - show deaths are not rising as quickly as they were, and may be levelling off. And unlike in the first wave, when the lack of testing meant the government figures underestimated the number of Covid deaths, the two sets of data are mirroring each other. Sarah Scobie, of the Nuffield Trust health think tank, said: ""Despite the end of the second national lockdown in England coming into focus, today's figures are a sobering reminder of the dreadful impact of this virus. She said the high number of deaths was ""piling on the pressure"" on the NHS. ""For some hospitals, particularly in Covid hotspot areas, it will feel as if they are in the depths of winter already.""

"Animals have been ""a lifesaver"" for people struggling during Covid lockdown, according to retailer Pets at Home which has seen sales rise sharply. Chief executive Peter Pritchard said pets had played ""an incredibly important role"" through a period of ""social loneliness"". He added that during the early days of lockdown one of the few reasons people could go out ""was to walk your dog"". In the six months to 8 October, Pets at Home saw revenues rise by 5.1%. Mr Pritchard told the BBC's Today programme: ""The pet care market has been incredibly strong throughout and I think that tells you an awful lot about people's relationships with their pets and the roles that pets play in people's lives. Covid: Lockdown had 'major impact' on mental health Spending Review: Chancellor to announce Â£500m for mental health ""It has been a lifesaver for many through this incredibly challenging period for everybody in the country."" He added that the change in more people working from home had allowed them to get a dog or a cat. ""More people have considered having a pet because their lives have changed and they are at home more often,"" he said. The company sells some small animals and fish but does not sell cats or dogs. It said, however, that membership of its Puppy & Kitten Club for new owners had risen by 25% during the six-month period. Pets at Home said the first half of its financial year, which runs between April and 8 October, reflected the entire period since the week after national lockdown was implemented. Restrictions on households weighed on trade in the first quarter before a 12.7% jump in like-for-like sales in the second three months. Pets at Home is classed as an essential retailer and has been allowed to stay open during lockdown. Total sales over the six months rose to Â£574.4m while pre-tax profit grew by more than 14% to Â£38.9m. The company did not place any employees on furlough and said that it has actually been recruiting more staff. However,Pets at Home's share pricedropped by 7.3% to 388p in early trading. The company warned of uncertainty because of the pandemic and said: ""At this stage, absent any escalation of restrictions, or other significant disruption to our operations, we now anticipate full-year underlying pre-tax profit to be in line with the prior year."" Julie Palmer, partner at professional services firm Begbies Traynor, said: ""Looking ahead, with the value of the resilient UK pet market set to hit Â£7bn next year and the nation's love affair with pet ownership showing little sign of abating, chief executive Peter Prichard's optimism for the future appears well justified."" However, she added that the retailer would be ""mindful of the dampening effect of social distancing measures in store, which may impact margins over the all-important Christmas period and into the first quarter of 2021"".

"As president of the United States, Donald Trump enjoyed unique protection from legal action, be it criminal or civil. Now, after losing the 2020 presidential election, Mr Trump will soon become a private citizen again. That means he will lose his presidential privileges, putting him in the crosshairs of litigators and prosecutors. ""Once he is out of office, the atmosphere will change,"" Daniel R Alonso, a former US federal and New York state prosecutor, told the BBC. ""He will no longer have the reality or the threat of presidential power to thwart investigations."" A wide-ranging criminal investigation in New York is the most serious legal concern for Mr Trump and his real-estate company, the Trump Organization. On top of that, there is an array of lawsuits ranging from allegations of fraud by a family member to sexual harassment by an advice columnist. A legal storm is brewing. Here, we consider how the six biggest legal battles may develop. What we know:Playboy model Karen McDougal, adult film actress Stormy Daniels and claims of a conspiracy of silence. This was the gist of the so-called hush-money scandal. Both women said they had had sexual relationships with Mr Trump and had received payments to keep them quiet, ahead of the 2016 presidential election. When they spoke out in 2018, they threw political dynamite under Mr Trump's presidency, lighting the fuse of two criminal investigations. Stormy Daniels, real name Stephanie Clifford, says she had sex with Mr Trump in 2006 The first focused on violations of federal, or national, laws and the role of Michael Cohen, Mr Trump's former personal lawyer and ""fixer"". Under investigation, Cohen admitted to arranging payments to the two women. The payments were prosecuted as campaign-finance violations and Cohen was sentenced to three years in jail in 2018. This video can not be played Five things Cohen said about Trump Cohen alleged that Mr Trump had ""directed"" him to make the payments, yet no charges were brought against the president. Why? Firstly, to charge Mr Trump, prosecutors would have needed to prove that he had indeed directed Cohen to make those payments. Secondly, even if prosecutors did have sufficient evidence, it is against US government policy to indict a sitting president on federal criminal charges, legal experts say. Case closed, right? Well, not exactly. This is where it gets technical. Karen McDougal apologised to Melania Trump for the affair she says she had with her husband Put simply, a second criminal investigation into the payments is still under way in New York. We know that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance is examining whether the Trump Organization falsified business records related to the payoffs. What we don't know is whether Mr Vance has any evidence to file criminal charges. That matters. What might happen next:Falsifying business records is a misdemeanour under New York law. A misdemeanour is a minor crime that can be punishable by a jail term of up to a year. Now, here's the tricky part for Mr Vance. Trump accused of directing hush money Will Trump remain bulletproof after Cohen? There is a two-year time limit for filing criminal charges for a misdemeanour in New York. ""So, because those payments happened over two years ago, it looks like [prosecutors] are out of luck,"" Mr Alonso said. That said, there are other possibilities. Cyrus Vance has been leading a criminal investigation into the Trump Organization since 2018 In New York, falsifying business records can be charged as a felony if it is done to conceal other crimes, such as tax fraud. Felonies are more serious crimes that can be prosecuted over a longer period and are punishable by tougher jail sentences. Still, the route to prosecution is uncertain. It is not clear if Mr Trump can be prosecuted under New York law for campaign-finance violations - the federal crime Cohen was jailed for. This is where the other strands of Mr Vance's investigation come in. What we know:It's a ""political hit job"", a Trump Organization lawyer said of Mr Vance's inquiry in August 2019. The lawyer's statement was seething. Mr Vance had just issued a request for documents, known as a subpoena. He demanded to see years of financial records, including the Holy Grail - Mr Trump's tax returns, eight years of them. This video can not be played Trump describes allegations he avoided taxes as ""fake news"" Since then, Mr Trump has tried to block the subpoena, arguing in courts that it amounts to political harassment. In October, a federal appeals court disagreed, putting his tax returns within touching distance of prosecutors. Indeed, Mr Vance has stressed the significance of Mr Trump's tax returns in court papers. When requesting the returns in August, Mr Vance referred to ""public reports of possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization"", including allegations of possible insurance and bank fraud. Another court filing in September mentioned tax fraud as a hypothetical crime that could be established, should evidence be found to support it. In New York, some types of tax fraud can be charged as felonies, which can carry lengthy prison sentences. At the moment, though, the ""public reports"" of possible crimes cited by Mr Vance's office are merely grounds for investigation, nothing else. What might happen next:Mr Trump is expected to appeal against the demand to hand over his tax returns in the Supreme Court. There, the matter may be settled. For Mr Trump, the stakes are high. Can Trump release his tax returns? Trump's taxes: What you need to know ""The most significant criminal investigations are those exploring his tax and bank filings,"" Jonathan Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University, told the BBC. ""But whether there's a criminal case has yet to become evident."" If Mr Vance does obtain Mr Trump's tax returns, a criminal case may or may not become evident. Either way, Mr Vance needs those tax returns to move his investigation forward. What we know:New York Attorney General Letitia James has been another thorn in Mr Trump's side. Since March 2019, Ms James has been leading a civil investigation into whether the Trump Organization committed real-estate fraud. Again, the roots of this investigation lead back to Cohen who, in February 2019, told Congress that Mr Trump had inflated the value of his property assets to secure loans and understated them to reduce his taxes. Michael Cohen, fixer for Mr Trump, was called to testified before the House Oversight Committee in February 2019 Cohen's testimony gave Ms James grounds to seek information about Mr Trump's property empire. Like Mr Vance, Ms James has had to fight for that information in the courts. Eric Trump, the executive vice-president of the Trump Organization and the president's son, has accused her of waging a ""political vendetta"". Despite this, he complied with a request to sit for testimony with her office in October. What might happen next:Ms James needs more testimony and information to take the investigation forward. In office, Mr Trump argued that he was too busy to deal with lawsuits. Now, he cannot use that excuse. Ms James can treat Mr Trump with less deference, pressing him to sit for questioning under oath, just like his son. Letitia James has taken testimony from Mr Trump's son, Eric ""Most courts would be very indulgent with a president-defendant on things like scheduling, for instance. Not so with a private citizen,"" Mr Alonso said. Civil investigations like this can result in financial penalties, if evidence of wrongdoing is found. If it is, another criminal inquiry cannot be ruled out. What we know:Emolument is an archaic word that is seldom used today, except in legal contexts. The definition is contested, but it is generally understood to mean gain, profit or advantage from employment or holding public office. So what does this have to do with Mr Trump? He has been accused of breaking rules against ""emoluments"" during his presidency. These rules, known as the emoluments clauses, were written into the country's bedrock legal text, the US Constitution. Mr Trump's hotel in Washington was often the site of protests during his presidency One clause requires all federal officials, including the president, to seek the consent of Congress before accepting any benefits from foreign states. Three separate civil lawsuits alleged that Mr Trump had not sought that consent. One cited the hosting of foreign officials at the Trump International Hotel in Washington DC as a possible violation. Mr Trump has derided ""this phony emoluments clause"", suggesting other sitting presidents have made money. What might happen next:Regardless, the emoluments lawsuits will probably be dismissed or dropped, legal experts say. One brought by congressional Democrats has already been rejected by the Supreme Court. ""Emoluments are not likely to be the basis of any criminal action,"" said Mr Turley, an expert on constitutional law. ""The emoluments cases relate to Trump holding office, so once he leaves office, the controversy becomes largely academic."" What we know:Mr Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women whose allegations span decades. Mr Trump has denied all the allegations, dismissing them as ""fake news"", political smears and conspiracies. What are the sexual allegations against Trump? Many of the accusers came forward ahead of Mr Trump's election win in 2016. Mr Trump vowed to sue them all but, as yet, has not done so. Instead, some of the accusers have sued Mr Trump. Two of those women have filed defamation lawsuits against Mr Trump for calling them liars. E Jean Carroll has accused Mr Trump of raping her in the 1990s E Jean Carroll, a long-time columnist for Elle magazine, is one of them. She has accused Mr Trump of raping her in a dressing room at a luxury Manhattan department store in the 1990s. Mr Trump denies it and is contesting the defamation claim. In her lawsuit, Ms Carroll argues Mr Trump defamed her by saying he could not have raped her because ""she's not my type"". Her lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and a retraction of Mr Trump's statements. Ms Carroll v Mr Trump seemed straightforward enough until September, when the US Department of Justice weighed in. This video can not be played Jessica Leeds, one of Mr Trump's accusers, has demanded action The department took the unusual step of trying to replace Mr Trump with the United States as a defendant in the case. In the end, a federal judge ruled against the department's intervention, arguing ""the allegations have no relationship to the official business of the United States"". What might happen next:The case can now proceed, allowing Ms Carroll's lawyers to gather evidence. For example, they could press on by attempting to verify if Mr Trump's DNA is on a dress Ms Carroll says she was wearing at the time of the alleged assault. For that, they would need a DNA sample from Mr Trump. A similar but separate defamation lawsuit filed by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Mr Trump's television show The Apprentice, may go the same way. Summer Zervos (left) was one of several women to accuse Mr Trump of sexual misconduct ahead of the 2016 election Ms Zervos alleged that Mr Trump had sexually assaulted her during a meeting to discuss job opportunities at a Beverly Hills hotel in 2007. Mr Trump dismissed the allegation as ""phony"", accusing Ms Zervos of fabricating it for fame. Ms Zervos then sued him for defamation in 2017, seeking damages of at least $3,000. Mr Trump tried to get the case dismissed during his presidency. His lawyers suggested that, as president, he should be immune to lawsuits in state courts. ""That argument completely evaporates on 20 January,"" Barbara L McQuade, professor of law at the University of Michigan, told the BBC. ""Once that happens, we move to the discovery phase of the case and there could be some movement there."" What we know:""Fraud was not just the family business - it was a way of life,"" reads the first line of Mary Trump's lawsuit against her uncle Donald. As an opening salvo, it could hardly be more contemptuous. It mirrors the animosity of Ms Trump's newly released memoir, in which she chastises her uncle as a ""narcissist"" who threatens the life of every American. In her book, Mary Trump calls her uncle the ""the world's most dangerous man"" The family beef is as personal as it gets and Ms Trump's lawsuit, filed in September, reflects that acrimony. In it, she accuses Mr Trump and two of his siblings of cheating her out of an inheritance while pressuring her to give up interests in the family business. Mary Trump and the most shocking family secrets Ms Trump inherited valuable interests in the family business when Fred Trump Jr - her father and the president's older brother - died in 1981 at the age of 42. Ms Trump was 16 at the time. Mr Trump and his siblings ""committed to watch over"" Ms Trump's interests, the lawsuit says. ""They lied,"" the lawsuit says. ""Rather than protect Mary's interests, they designed and carried out a complex scheme to siphon funds away from her interests, conceal their grift [fraud], and deceive her about the true value of what she had inherited."" The lawsuit seeks at least $500,000 in damages. What might happen next:The White House said Ms Trump's book was full of ""falsehoods"", but Mr Trump is yet to reply to the lawsuit. If requests for documents and testimony come, Mr Trump cannot cite his presidential duties as a reason to deny them. No American citizen, not even the president, is categorically above the law.

"The Playhouse in Londonderry had been given an indicative reopening date of 1 September More than one-third of jobs in arts, culture and heritage are vulnerable as a result of coronavirus restrictions. That is according to a new study from Ulster University's Economic Policy Centre (UUEPC). The report suggests a high proportion of jobs in museums, galleries, theatres and music are particularly at risk. In general, the creative sector is ""more exposed to the challenges arising from Covid-19 than other sectors and occupations."" The main factors for that are social distancing measures limiting capacity and a reluctance among audiences to return even when venues can re-open. The UUEPC report estimated that there are 39,100 people employed in the arts, creative, culture and heritage sector in Northern Ireland. Socially-distanced concerts were trialled in England However, the type of occupation that figure includes is very wide. It ranges from people working in Information Technology (IT) and architecture to those employed in music, crafts, the performing arts, museums, galleries and libraries. Emergency fund of Â£13m for NI arts and heritage Arts sector money finally agreed in Covid package The study said that while a high proportion of jobs in areas such as IT were not vulnerable, jobs in the other sectors were ""much more at risk."" It estimated that more than 60% of jobs in museums, galleries and libraries were vulnerable, along with almost half of jobs in music, theatre and visual art. A significant number of jobs in film and TV production were also at risk. ""The pandemic has caused the immediate closure of non-essential business including the Arts, Culture and Heritage industries resulting in cancelled work and events such as large music events like Belfast Vital and Belsonic which attracted thousands of people to Belfast annually,"" the report said. ""The healthcare situation in NI will be more important in this sector than in the average NI occupation, given the interactive nature of work and a dependence on discretionary consumer spending."" The authors of the report also make a number of suggestions on how venues and visitor attractions could be helped to recover from the impact of the pandemic. They include ""visitor vouchers,"" which would subsidise 30-50% of the cost of tickets to venues to encourage audiences to return. Venues would also be compensated if they had to cancel events at short notice due to new or changing restrictions. The authors of the study also suggest a bursary of Â£1,000 a month for arts workers who have not been able to benefit from other job support schemes. Northern Irish artists could also be commissioned to create new public art, the UUEPC report said. A number ofemergency funding schemes for arts and heritagehave been opened by the Department for Communities. The Northern Ireland executive received Â£33m from Westminster in Julyas part of a UK-wide support package for arts and culture.

"This video can not be played Just one month into his new role as consul general, Stephen Ellison saves a university student from drowning A British diplomat who dived into a river to save a woman's life has been presented with a red velvet banner - a sign of gratitude in China. The banner was given to Stephen Ellison, consul-general in Chongqing, by the 24-year-old university student he pulled from the river last week. It reads ""righteous and courageous, saving people from water"". The 61-year-old was met with widespread praise and was hailed as a hero in China for his actions. ""This is the first banner I have ever received in my life, it is of great significance to me,"" Mr Ellison said, according to a post by the British Consulate General Chongqing on China's micro-blogging site Weibo last Friday. Big red banners, known in China as jinqi, are typically given as a means of expressing gratitude - and it is not uncommon for the recipient to display it, like one would an award. Stephen Ellison saved a university student from drowning earlier this month Mr Ellison, originally from Newcastle, is head of the British mission in Chongqing, where his role is primarily to support bilateral trade links between Britain and China. However, it was his bravery rather than his profession which thrust him into the spotlight, after he was filmed jumping into a river to rescue the unnamed woman who had slipped into the water from some rocks. The footage shows her struggle and disappear under a footbridge before emerging face down - apparently unconscious. Mr Ellison is seen throwing off his shoes before launching into the water himself, turning her over and bringing her to safety. He then swam round to shallower rocks and climbed out.

"Animals have been ""a lifesaver"" for people struggling during Covid lockdown, according to retailer Pets at Home which has seen sales rise sharply. Chief executive Peter Pritchard said pets had played ""an incredibly important role"" through a period of ""social loneliness"". He added that during the early days of lockdown one of the few reasons people could go out ""was to walk your dog"". In the six months to 8 October, Pets at Home saw revenues rise by 5.1%. Mr Pritchard told the BBC's Today programme: ""The pet care market has been incredibly strong throughout and I think that tells you an awful lot about people's relationships with their pets and the roles that pets play in people's lives. Covid: Lockdown had 'major impact' on mental health Spending Review: Chancellor to announce Â£500m for mental health ""It has been a lifesaver for many through this incredibly challenging period for everybody in the country."" He added that the change in more people working from home had allowed them to get a dog or a cat. ""More people have considered having a pet because their lives have changed and they are at home more often,"" he said. The company sells some small animals and fish but does not sell cats or dogs. It said, however, that membership of its Puppy & Kitten Club for new owners had risen by 25% during the six-month period. Pets at Home said the first half of its financial year, which runs between April and 8 October, reflected the entire period since the week after national lockdown was implemented. Restrictions on households weighed on trade in the first quarter before a 12.7% jump in like-for-like sales in the second three months. Pets at Home is classed as an essential retailer and has been allowed to stay open during lockdown. Total sales over the six months rose to Â£574.4m while pre-tax profit grew by more than 14% to Â£38.9m. The company did not place any employees on furlough and said that it has actually been recruiting more staff. However,Pets at Home's share pricedropped by 7.3% to 388p in early trading. The company warned of uncertainty because of the pandemic and said: ""At this stage, absent any escalation of restrictions, or other significant disruption to our operations, we now anticipate full-year underlying pre-tax profit to be in line with the prior year."" Julie Palmer, partner at professional services firm Begbies Traynor, said: ""Looking ahead, with the value of the resilient UK pet market set to hit Â£7bn next year and the nation's love affair with pet ownership showing little sign of abating, chief executive Peter Prichard's optimism for the future appears well justified."" However, she added that the retailer would be ""mindful of the dampening effect of social distancing measures in store, which may impact margins over the all-important Christmas period and into the first quarter of 2021"".

"'Janet' was pinned to the ground and punched when she was arrested in May. Eight officers are under investigation after a black woman was pinned to the ground and punched during an arrest, the Metropolitan Police has confirmed. The woman has told the BBC she feared for her life, and says police subjected her to further violence in custody. Two of the officers under investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) have been placed on restricted duties. Details into the probe have been made public after a Newsnight investigation. Mobile phone footage of the woman's arrest, which happened on 9 May after officers pulled over a car in south-east London, shows how several police officers physically restrained the young woman - who is a student in her 20s and had been a passenger in the car. One female officer can be seen repeatedly striking the woman. In a statement the IOPC said: ""Eight officers have been served with notices advising them they are subject to investigation, with six officers at misconduct level and two officers at gross misconduct level."" Details of the IOPC probe into the treatment of the woman have been made public after an investigation by BBC Newsnight into the way she was handled during her arrest. Janet - not her real name - told the programme she had been working on an essay and went to get a takeaway, where she met an old friend with whom she ended up driving to a cash machine. While she was a passenger in the man's car, it was pulled over after officers allegedly noticed he had been driving erratically. The driver has since been convicted of drink-driving. Janet, who wished not to be identified, described the incident as ""dehumanising"" Janet told BBC Newsnight she was pulled out of the car by an officer before it had come to a complete stop: ""I just remember things turning like they looked a bit radioactive to me because I couldn't... I knew that I was losing consciousness."" She says she told the female police officer who punched her that the officer holding her down was killing her. She says the female officer ""smirked"" and responded: 'If you can talk, you can breathe."" Janet was arrested on suspicion of obstructing a drug search. She says she was lifted up from the street by her handcuffs and her hair braids, causing hair to be ripped out of her scalp, and was carried to the police van. This video can not be played Mobile phone footage showing the arrest of the woman. Inside Lewisham police station, she was subjected to further violence during a strip search which happened in the presence of male as well as female officers - something against police regulations. ""They didn't even tell me they were going to strip-search me. It literally just happened when in the presence of the male and female officers with my cell door wide open, so people were passing."" She claims this was done to ""humiliate me more - dehumanise me more"". Once stripped naked, Janet says she was subjected to more violence, during which one police officer punched her repeatedly ""very, very, very, very hard - there was a lot of intensity in her"". Janet said she resisted as she had recently had surgery on her stomach, and was worried about the pressure they were applying to her while she was on the floor. The tactics used in this arrest such as handcuffing, restraint and hitting, are known as Use of Force, and are all measures officers are permitted to take under certain circumstances. However, senior police figures who have seen the video of the detention of the woman told BBC Newsnight the level of force and the number of officers applying it in this case, seem unusual. BBC Newsnight has obtained Use of Force data from 37 out of the 44 police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. During the lockdown months of April and May, 27 out of the 37 police forces saw a rise in Use of Force, compared with the same months in 2019. The Metropolitan Police - the UK's biggest force - saw a rise of 26% from 25,993 Use of Force incidents recorded in April and May 2019, to 32,705 in the same months in 2020. Home Office figures for England and Wales show black people are approximately six times more likely to be subjected to Use of Force than white people - a disparity that does not apply to other ethnic minorities. The woman whose story features in BBC Newsnight's report has not received an apology from the police. All charges against her have been dropped. Police are required to record each time they use force The Metropolitan Police said: ""All police officers are fully aware that they will be asked to account for their actions. Officers are not exempt from the law, and nor would we wish to be. ""The Met continues to co-operate with the IOPC's investigation team to ensure that all the facts are established. ""Eight officers are under investigation in relation to this incident; two of whom have been placed on restricted duties."" The IOPC said: ""Use of Force is an essential policing tool and like all police powers must be used properly, proportionately and responsibly. ""We are examining the circumstances of the woman's arrest and the Use of Force on her. ""Our investigation is also looking at the woman's subsequent treatment in custody. As part of the investigation, we have already taken a statement from the woman."" It added: ""To uphold public confidence in the police complaints system, we are investigating the use of stop-and-search tactics in this incident and whether the actions of those officers were appropriate and proportionate and followed approved police policies. ""We are also investigating if racial profiling or discrimination played a part in the incident. ""This incident took place in public view late at night and was probably witnessed by passers-by and members of the public. We would ask anybody who was in the area that evening and saw police activity to get in touch with us."" Regarding the Use of Force figures, the Home Office told BBC Newsnight: ""We are clear that all Use of Force must be reasonable, proportionate and necessary - and no-one should be subject to it based on their race or ethnicity."" And responding to the rise in Use of Force incidents, the National Police Chiefs Council said the fall in crime during lockdown gave police ""breathing space to carry out pro-active operations against known criminals"". In a statement, it added: ""We have also seen a notable increase in assaults against emergency services workers since the beginning of the pandemic, and officers have accordingly had to use non-verbal tactics against offenders. ""Any action of this kind would necessitate that a Use of Force form is completed, which would therefore show an increase of overall force used.""

"Harry Dunn died in a crash outside RAF Croughton last year Harry Dunn's parents have lost their High Court battle against the Foreign Office over whether their son's alleged killer had diplomatic immunity. Mr Dunn, 19, died when his motorbike was in a crash with a car near RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire, in 2019. The suspect, 43-year-old Anne Sacoolas, later left for the United States citing diplomatic immunity. Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said the High Court ruling was ""just a blip along the way"". Mrs Sacoolas, whose husband Jonathan worked as a technical assistant at the RAF base, was charged with causing death by dangerous driving in December, but an extradition request was denied in January. This video can not be played 'It's just another hurdle', Harry Dunn's parents say The legal challenge by Mrs Charles and Mr Dunn's father Tim Dunnclaimed Mrs Sacoolas should not have been granted immunity. But Lord Justice Flaux and Mr Justice Saini concluded ""that Mrs Sacoolas enjoyed immunity from UK criminal jurisdiction at the time of Harry's death"". Mrs Charles said: ""The government and Mrs Sacoolas need to understand that this court ruling is just a blip along the way. ""I promised my boy I would get him justice and that is just what we are going to do. No-one is going to stand in our way."" She added: ""It's obviously disappointing that this court did not find in our favour but we are more focused now than ever on fulfilling our promise."" Family spokesman Radd Seiger said Mr Dunn and Mrs Charles would be appealing against the ruling. Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003, cited diplomatic immunity after the crash and returned to the US Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: ""While this judgment makes clear the Foreign Office acted properly and lawfully throughout, I appreciate that won't provide any solace to the family in their search for justice. ""We stand with them, we're clear that Anne Sacoolas needs to face justice in the UK, and we will support the family with their legal claim in the US."" The High Court judges also rejected a claim by Mr Dunn's parents that the Foreign Office had ""usurped"" Northamptonshire Police's investigation into their son's death. Lord Justice Flaux and Mr Justice Saini found officials had ""sought to assist rather than obstruct Northamptonshire Police in their investigation"". This video can not be played Dominic Raab: 'We continue to offer the Dunn family support' The family's case centred on a 1995 agreement between the UK and the US, granting immunity to administrative and technical staff at the RAF base, which the US waived in relation to ""acts performed outside the course of their duties"". Lawyers for Mr Dunn and Mrs Charles argued that the Foreign Office ""took upon itself the authority to resolve the question of immunity and ultimately and unlawfully decided to accept the US embassy's decision that Anne Sacoolas had immunity"". In written submissions, the Foreign Office argued its officials had ""objected in strong terms"" to Mrs Sacoolas leaving the UK, and ""repeatedly emphasised"" that the department ""wanted the Sacoolas family to co-operate with the UK authorities"". Lord Justice Flaux and Mr Justice Saini ruled that Mrs Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity ""on arrival in the UK"" under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. As this had not been ""expressly waived"", it meant Mrs Sacoolas ""had immunity at the time of Harry's death"" on 27 August, they said. Mr Dunn said: ""It's bad enough feeling the horrible pain of not having Harry around and missing him, but I can't believe the governments are putting us through this. ""It all seems so cruel and needless and I am just as angry today as I ever have been but so determined to see it all through until we have justice.""

"The four nations of the UK have agreed UK-wide rules to allow families to meet over Christmas Three households will be allowed to meet in each other's homes over five days between 23-27 December Earlier, Matt Hancock took questions at a joint session of the Health and Social Care Committee and Science and Technology Committee He defended NHS test-and-trace, saying it was not to blame for the second lockdown The health secretary also said the UK should be ""getting back to normal"" after Easter People arriving in England will be soon able to reduce their quarantine period if they pay for a Covid test Globally, the world's most vulnerable must not be ""trampled in the stampede"" for vaccines, the World Health Organization warns The developers of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine say it is proving to be up to 95% effective Edited by Emma Owen We will be back with more coronavirus coverage on our live page tomorrow. Today's updates have been brought to you by: Hugo Bachega, George Bowden, Marie Jackson, Joseph Lee, Emma Owen, Georgina Rannard, Alex Therrien, Lauren Turner and Kate Whannel. Rules will be relaxed for Christmas across the UK We are bringing our live page coverage to an end shortly. Before we do, here's a summary of today's headlines from the UK: Health officials advised people in the US to stay at home for Thanksgiving There are over 30,000 people in hospital - but cases are falling sharply With another 458 deaths reported today, France has become the latest European country to record more than 50,000 deaths during the pandemic. Italy and the UK had already passed that milestone. But France's death toll of 50,237 comes against a background of falling cases, with 9,155 infections today - compared to 45,522 last Tuesday. The number of people in hospital fell by 859 to 30,622, the sharpest fall since the country's lockdown began on 30 October. French President Emmanuel Macron announced a phased end to the lockdown, with shops allowed to reopen on Saturday. Other restrictions will remain in place. Canada's eastern provinces are dissolving their ""bubble"" that has been in effect throughout most of the pandemic. New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island (PEI), Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had restricted domestic travel from outside of their group. Outsiders were expected to quarantine for 14 days, while insiders could move freely. The bubble has been credited with keeping cases low. But on Monday, Newfoundland and Labrador and PEI said they would temporarily end the agreement, as cases in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are on the rise. PEI will also ban non-essential travel until 7 December.  A 10-year-old boy was among those who died in hospital as the UK recorded its highest daily death toll for over five months. The 608 people reported to have died within 28 days of a positive test is the largest total since 12 May, when 614 deaths were recorded. The daily death figures have begun to flatten in recent days, however, following the fall in the number of reported infections. The parents of Fehzan Jamil, who lived in Bradford and is one of the virus's youngest UK victims, told Channel 4 News of their âindescribableâ pain. Tayyaba and Mohammed Jamil said their son, who had epilepsy and other health problems, was a âreally brave fighterâ and a âsoldierâ, who was always cheerful.    Ghislaine Maxwell is due to go on trial in 2021 Ghislaine Maxwell has been quarantined after staff tested positive for Covid-19 at the jail in New York where she is awaiting trial, US prosecutors say. Maxwell is accused of helping her former boyfriend, late financier Jeffrey Epstein, traffic and sexually abuse underage girls and of perjury for denying involvement in such a scheme when she gave her deposition under oath. She has pleaded not guilty. The staff tested positive last week and Maxwell, 58, was checked for the virus on 18 November using a rapid test which was negative, the prosecutors said in a letter to US District Judge Alison Nathan. She will go on trial next year, and is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. The mutations observed in coronavirus isolates from mink have also been observed in ferrets, according to the latestminutes from the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage),external. Sage said preliminary evidence suggested ferrets could pose a risk to those who are most
vulnerable to the virus, but were low risk otherwise. Unlike mink, they are normally not kept in high-intensity farms. Sage said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is currently assessing the risk to people in the UK and is developing messaging for ferret owners. There are fears mutations of the virus in animals could hamper the effectiveness of coronavirus vaccines. Earlier this month,Denmark culled all its mink - up to 17 million animals - because of the spread of coronavirus in the animal. Sage said coordination was needed across academic groups  and relevant bodies on the risks of human to animal transmission and the intensive rearing of
animals. The Sage minutes said the UK's vaccine taskforce would note potential implications for vaccine targeting of variants
including those that are mink-adapted. What's the science behind mink and coronavirus? We take a look here Theo LeggettBBC business correspondent The global airline industry will make a net loss of $118bn (Â£88bn) this year, according to the International Air Transport Association (Iata), and a further loss of $38bn is expected next year. The figures are much higher than previous estimates, and reflect the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, and continued restrictions on travel. Iata's Director General Alexandre de Juniac explained that 2020 had been the worst financial year in the industry's history. Without financial support from governments, he said, there would have been bankruptcies on ""a massive scale"". According to Iata, airlines have been able to cut their costs collectively by $365bn this year, a reduction of nearly 46%. But this has been outweighed by a drop in revenues of more than 60%. The organisation says it does expect the situation to improve next year, with some opening of borders, either through improved testing or a vaccine. But it still expects losses to be greater than any the industry has ever suffered, with the exception of 2020. Passenger numbers are expected to drop to 1.8 billion thisyear from 4.5 billion in 2019, and will recover only partially to 2.8 billion next year, according to the association. Alistair ColemanBBC Disinformation unit Signs like this have wrongly suggested that a royal charter from 1215 gives business owners the right to refuse to close In the UK,a Yorkshire hairdresser is facing fines totalling Â£27,000($36,000) for refusing to close her salon during lockdown. Sinead Quinn has a sign in her shop window saying that she ""does not consent"" to coronavirus laws, claiming her right to do so is set out in the Magna Carta, a royal charter from more than 800 years ago that was England's first form of a written constitution. However, no such right exists and she's been fined multiple times for staying open. She's one of several traders including a tattoo artist in Bristol, and aNottinghamshire bookshop, who claim that ""Article 61"" of the Magna Carta signed by King John in 1215 gives them the right to ignore ""unjust"" laws. But Article 61 was removed from Magna Carta within a year of its signing, andonly three clauses of the document remain law today.,external That's not stopped anti-lockdown social media accounts offering a downloadable notice for businesses to place in their windows. This notice also refers to a""Freeman on the Land"" defence, which claims citizens have had their identities ""stolen"" by the state, and by asserting their rights as ""sovereign citizens"" they are only bound by laws to which they consent. No ""Freeman on the Land"" defence has ever prevailed in court. One scientific expert said the relaxation of restrictions over Christmas will ""almost inevitably"" lead to an increase in transmission, but that the celebration may still be what is needed to âmake it through the rest of winterâ. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, said: âThe issue is whether that increased risk is tolerable in relation to the benefits. At that time schools will be closed so there would naturally be some downward pressure on transmission."" He said if the new tier system is working well ""there will be a downward pressure on transmission before and after the Christmas break"", so any increase in cases ""could be relatively short-lived"". ""After Christmas we will still have to live through a few more months of restrictions at least,"" the professor said. This video can not be played Gove: ""Three households can have a Christmas bubble"" Cabinet minister Michael Gove says people will be able to ""enjoy something closer to a normal Christmas"" after the four nations reached an agreement. But the bubbles, of up to three households, must be exclusive and people have to comply with hospitality rules in place in their area, depending which tier they're in. Mr Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said it was a chance to ""meet close friends and family in a very restricted fashion"". Three households can meet over a five-day
period (23 - 27 December) in the UK. However, those in Northern Ireland have been granted a bigger window (22 - 28 December) to allow for any additional travel time to and from the region. Sam says she wants to get together ""even if it's just for one day"" Families are now facing a big choice about whether to take advantage of the freedom to meet up at Christmas - or whether to play it safe. Sam in Devon is building a grotto in her garden ready for a small family gathering. She told the BBC: ""Itâs the only time of the year I get everybody together, it's very important, it's special. ""Itâs not the presents or anything else, itâs having my family. Even if itâs just for one day."" But she said people ""have to be sensible otherwise weâre going to have a really rotten January"". But others said they would not be travelling. Father and daughter Naomi and Roy said they would not be making the trip between Devon and South Wales this year. ""I would love to do it, but no,"" Naomi said. ""Especially with the vaccine development, it just seems like too high risk regardless of what we're allowed to do."" ""The only thing thatâs missing is the physical contact,"" said Roy, adding that he missed the grandchildren, ""If that has to be, I would rather miss out in 2020 if it means we can do what we normally do in 2021.""  This year, Naomi and dad Roy will spend Christmas apart We've had some more detail about what the Christmas announcements will mean for different groups: In a joint statement from all four governments, the leaders say 2020 ""has been an incredibly difficult year for us all"". ""We have all had to make significant sacrifices in our everyday lives, and many
religious and community groups have already had to change or forgo their
customary celebrations to slow the spread of coronavirus and save lives. ""This cannot be
a ânormalâ Christmas but as we approach the festive period, we have been
working closely together to find a way for family and friends to see each
other, even if it is for a short time, and recognising that it must be both
limited and cautious."" They urge people to use ""personal judgement"" and be ""mindful of the risks"" particularly when meeting those
who are vulnerable. ""We urge the consideration of alternative approaches such as the use of
technology or meeting outside,"" the statement adds. NI First Minister Arlene Foster said she hoped the announcement gave people time to plan First Minister Arlene Foster welcomed the announcement of Christmas arrangements and said she hoped it would give people space to plan. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was a ""message of hope"" but urged people to be responsible, safe and mindful of healthcare workers. âThink, can you meet up differently, can you go for a walk, for example, with a family member?â she said. Arlene Foster said the relaxations would apply in people's homes, in non-essential retail and places of worship but not in hospitality. She said people should stick to the regulations on hospitality concerning the number of households allowed to meet together at the time. Northern Ireland is due to begin a two-week lockdown from this Friday until 11 December, in a bid to curb the spread of the virus before Christmas.  Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said the approach to Christmas was ""not a choice between relaxation or no relaxation"" but a plan to allow celebrations ""in a controlled way"". He stressed this is ""not an instruction to travel"" and ""not an instruction to meet with other people"". Asked if he had any concerns about relaxing the restrictions, he said ""misgivings happen either way"". Mr Drakeford said: ""It is having a form of relaxation where there are rules that people will recognise, that will allow people to enjoy Christmas, but will do it in a controlled way."" He admitted he had ""hesitation"" - because of the state of the virus in Wales and the UK as a whole - but added: ""It is better that we have a common set of arrangements that give people a framework that they can manage within and act responsibly within as well."" Asked about what plans and preparations are being made for the opening months of 2021, he replied: ""What I am keen on is that we don't, on a four nation basis, simply think about five days of Christmas. ""We think of a common approach to Christmas and a common approach to dealing with the consequences of Christmas as well."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the relaxation would not apply to Hogmanay Talking about the plans, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged people to try to limit their interaction. She said there would be some people who felt the need to come
together over Christmas and âwe want to allow thatâ but âjust because this can
be doneâ, it is not the case that people should feel âthey should do it if they
donât have toâ. Ms Sturgeon also confirmed that travel restrictions would be lifted
to allow people to visit families in other parts of the UK within the three-household bubble. She said the three-household bubble was a âfixed bubble for
that five-day period - you canât see two households one day and another two
households the next dayâ. The first minister confirmed the relaxation would not apply
to Hogmanay, saying âwe canât do everything hereâ. ""The last thing we want to do right now is set our
progress back,â she added. On the matter of hugs, she cautioned people against doing things that allow the virus to spread. Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove says he is
""very pleased"" to have reached an agreement with the other four
regions. However he warns that a ""balance has to be struck""
between relaxing the restrictions over Christmas and beating back the virus. He says the progress on vaccines means there is ""light at the end of the tunnel"" but he adds ""it is important we don't let things get too loose over Christmas."" ""I know that people will use these freedoms responsibly."" He said this was an opportunity
for people to ""meet close friends and family in a very restricted fashion,
in order to ensure that those we love can be with us at this special season,
but only for a limited period, but not in hospitality venues and not in any
locations where the virus might spread fast"". Mr Gove said he now planned to
spend Christmas with his mother and father in Aberdeen.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,6.159249e-07
"John Kerry was joined by his granddaughter when he signed the Paris climate agreement in 2016 US President-elect Joe Biden is to nominate one of the leading architects of the Paris climate agreement as his climate envoy. Ex-US Secretary of State John Kerry was one of several named for top positions by the Biden transition team on Monday. It marks a big break with the climate policy under the Trump administration as Mr Biden makes goodon his campaign pledge to tackle climate change. Other key picks include long-time aide Antony Blinken as secretary of state. Reports say former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen will be the choice for treasury secretary. The nomination comes as calls are growing for President Donald Trump to concede the election. He has made unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud and is continuing to pursue legal challenges over the result. While Mr Trump has not conceded, he has however agreed to allowthe formal transition process to begin, to allow Mr Biden to prepare to take office. How big are Biden's climate change ambitions? Can Trump overturn the election result? Mr Biden is projected to beat President Trump by 306 votes to 232 when the US electoral college meets to formally confirm the winner on 14 December. This is far above the 270 votes he needs. In a statement following the cabinet announcement on Monday, Mr Biden said: ""I need a team ready on day one to help me reclaim America's seat at the head of the table, rally the world to meet the biggest challenges we face, and advance our security, prosperity, and values. This is the crux of that team."" Some of the positions require confirmation in the US Senate. Mr Kerry was chosen for the role of special presidential envoy for climate. The Biden transition team said the position would see him ""fight climate change full-time"". He is also set to be the first official dedicated to climate change to sit on the National Security Council. Mr Kerry signed the Paris climate agreement on behalf of the US in 2016. The deal committed countries to working to limit the global temperature rise. Under Mr Trump, the US recently became the first country toformally withdraw from the agreement. But Mr Biden has said he plans to rejoin the accord as soon as possible. This video can not be played What is climate change? In 2019, Mr Kerry launched a coalition of world leaders and celebrities - dubbed World War Zero - to call for climate change action and net zero carbon emissions. Following news of his new role on Monday, he tweeted: ""America will soon have a government that treats the climate crisis as the urgent national security threat it is."" Covid pandemic has little impact on rise in CO2 Mr Kerry previously served as secretary of state during Barack Obama's second term as president. A veteran Democratic politician, he lost to incumbent Republican George W Bush in the 2004 presidential election. He was a senator for 28 years and chairman of the foreign relations committee. Heendorsed Mr Biden to be the Democratic Party's candidate in the 2020 raceand joined him on the campaign trail. Mr Blinken was nominated as secretary of state - the most important foreign policy position. The 58-year-old was deputy secretary of state and deputy national security adviser during the Obama administration, in which Mr Biden served as vice-president. Allow Twitter content?

He is expected to manage a Biden foreign policy agenda that will emphasise re-engaging with Western allies. Biden has chosen Jake Sullivan, Linda Thomas-Greenfield and Antony Blinken for key roles Avril Haineswas nominated as the first female director of national intelligence. Ms Haines is a former deputy director of the CIA and deputy national security adviser. Alejandro Mayorkaswas the first Latino nominated to serve as secretary of homeland security. He previously served as deputy secretary of homeland security under President Obama. Jake Sullivanwas named White House national security adviser. Mr Sullivan served as Mr Biden's national security adviser during Mr Obama's second term. Long-time diplomatLinda Thomas-Greenfieldwas nominated US ambassador to the UN. She also served under President Obama, including as assistant secretary of state for African affairs between 2013 and 2017. In his choice of a national security team, Joe Biden has signalled that the US is resuming its conventional international role, after four turbulent years of Donald Trump's America First. He's appointing Obama administration veterans to top positions and elevating a long-serving career diplomat sidelined by the Trump administration. His pick for secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, is an advocate of global alliances. Mr Blinken will lead the charge to re-establish ties with allies and rejoin agreements and institutions rejected by Trump. And there's no doubt that he'll be speaking for the man in the White House: Mr Blinken has advised Biden on foreign policy for so long he's been described as an alter ego. Another familiar face is former Secretary of State John Kerry. The president-elect's decision to give him a new cabinet-level position as climate envoy shows he's treating the issue as a significant national security threat. But even with the old team this is not going to be Obama 2.0: the landscape has shifted in both America and the world during the last four years. Still, Mr Biden is projecting stability and familiarity, and international leaders know what they will be getting Donald Trump has now accepted that a formal transition should begin for President-elect Joe Biden to take office. But the president vowed to keep contesting his election defeat and has been pursuing so-far fruitless legal challenges in several states to try to overturn his loss. His latest legal setback came on Saturday whena judge dismissed his attempt to have millions of postal votes in Pennsylvania invalidated. It comes as calls are growing for him to accept defeat. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a prominent Trump ally,called the president's legal team a ""national embarrassment"". ""I have been a supporter of the president's. I voted for him twice. But elections have consequences, and we cannot continue to act as if something happened here that didn't happen,"" he told ABC. How is President Trump challenging the result? 'Overvoting' and other US fraud claims fact-checked High-profile Trump supporter Stephen Schwarzman, the CEO of investment company Blackstone, also said it was time for Mr Trump to accept he lost. ""Like many in the business community, I am ready to help President-elect Biden and his team as they confront the significant challenges of rebuilding our post-Covid economy,"" he said in a statement reported by US media.

"A deal to allow families to meet over Christmas has been reached by the leaders of all four UK nations. A source told the BBC that details on how Covid restrictions will be relaxed will be announced shortly. Scotland's first minister said she would ""continue to ask people to err on the side of caution"". BBC Scotland's chief political correspondent said three households will be allowed to meet indoors over five days between 23-27 December. Glenn Campbell said they will be able to meet in each other's homes, at a place of worship and in an outdoor public space. But the groupings must be ""exclusive"", meaning you cannot get together with people from more than two other households. He added the leaders of the nations are expected to urge Britons to use any new flexibility sparingly because public health officials are worried Christmas get-togethers could cause a January spike in Covid cases. Speaking ahead of a meeting of the UK government's emergency committee Cobra,Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford cautioned any extra freedoms would not be an instruction to do ""risky things"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also stressed any changes would be ""temporary"" and ""limited"". She said that the ""details"" may differ ""to reflect different circumstances in each nation"", such as what the definition of a ""household"" might be. She added: ""I know everyone has a desire to see loved ones over the festive period. ""However, there is also a very real and a very legitimate anxiety that doing so could put those we love at risk, set back our progress as a country and result in unnecessary deaths and suffering."" Where will mass testing be available? What will England's new lockdown rules be? Travellers can cut quarantine if they pay for test Act responsibly over Christmas, asks Drakeford Meanwhile, the government has recorded another 608 deaths of people in the UK who have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test. There were also a further 11,299 cases of people testing positive for coronavirus. What to do about Christmas divides opinion. Increased mixing indoors will certainly mean there is greater transmission of the virus. But, as chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty said on Monday, there is a balance to be struck between the harm the virus can cause and the societal and economic impacts of trying to control it. He called for a ""public-spirited approach"". By that he means adhering to the restrictions in the lead up to Christmas, being responsible with the opportunity the relaxation gives people and then immediately switching back to compliance. If that happens any impact could be minimised - and, of course, it will be up to individuals to decide just how much they mix within the rules. These are very fine judgement calls by ministers. They hope Christmas will provide respite and help steel the public for what is clearly going to be a long, hard winter. They also feel they have little choice, believing large numbers of people would ignore pleas not to mix and this way they can provide advice on how to enjoy Christmas as safely as possible. But there is also the risk by sanctioning it there will be more mixing than there would have otherwise been. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has acknowledged there would be risks of letting people meet over Christmas but said families should have the chance to reunite. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps earlier said Christmas travellers should plan journeys carefully and prepare for restrictions on passenger numbers. This video can not be played Grant Shapps: People will have to ""think about the routes they are taking"" Referring to domestic travel during the festive period, Mr Shapps urged those travelling on public transport to pre-book tickets as the capacity of services remains reduced to allow for social distancing and as a result of staff self-isolating. Mr Shapps also highlightedNetwork Rail's plans for a series of upgrades and routine maintenance,externalacross Britain between 23 December to 4 January. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I would appeal to people to think very carefully about their travel plans and consider where they are going to travel and look at the various alternatives available."" Coronavirus restrictions and work from home guidance have led to a sharp reduction in train passenger numbers Mr Shapps added that people who live in areas placed in the highest tier of restrictions in England should avoid leaving their region entirely. Mr Shapps said confirmation of the exact rules would come by Thursday - when people find out which tier their local area will be in - or potentially before then. It comes after the prime minister confirmed tougher tier curbs once England's lockdown ends. Gyms and non-essential shops in all parts of England will be allowed to reopen from 2 Decemberunder a strengthened three-tiered system. Areas will not find out which tier they are in until Thursday - and the decision will be based on a number of factors including case numbers, the reproduction rate - or R number - and pressure on local NHS services. At a Downing Street news conference on Monday to outlinea ""Covid-19 winter plan"",external, Mr Johnson admitted Christmas this year would be very different to normal. ""I can't say that Christmas will be normal this year, but in a period of adversity time spent with loved ones is even more precious for people of all faiths and none,"" he said. ""We all want some kind of Christmas; we need it; we certainly feel we deserve it. ""But this virus obviously is not going to grant a Christmas truceâ¦ and families will need to make a careful judgement about the risks of visiting elderly relatives."" SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Meanwhile, Mr Shapps announced people arriving in England from many countrieswill be soon able to reduce their quarantine period by more than halfif they pay for a coronavirus test after five days. The rules will come into force from 15 December and the tests from private firms will cost between Â£65 and Â£120. Elsewhere, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs the UK's new mass testing capacity could be used after the pandemic to diagnose a wider range of illnesses. He said a British culture of ""soldiering on"" and going to work despite having symptoms of illnesses, including flu, ""should change"". ""In fact, I want to have a change in the British way of doing things where 'if in doubt, get a test' doesn't just refer to coronavirus, but refers to any illness you might have,"" he said. Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the total number of deaths occurring in the UKis nearly a fifth above normal levels.

Rules will be relaxed for Christmas across the UK We are bringing our live page coverage to an end shortly. Before we do, here's a summary of today's headlines from the UK: Health officials advised people in the US to stay at home for Thanksgiving There are over 30,000 people in hospital - but cases are falling sharply With another 458 deaths reported today, France has become the latest European country to record more than 50,000 deaths during the pandemic. Italy and the UK had already passed that milestone. But France's death toll of 50,237 comes against a background of falling cases, with 9,155 infections today - compared to 45,522 last Tuesday. The number of people in hospital fell by 859 to 30,622, the sharpest fall since the country's lockdown began on 30 October. French President Emmanuel Macron announced a phased end to the lockdown, with shops allowed to reopen on Saturday. Other restrictions will remain in place. Canada's eastern provinces are dissolving their ""bubble"" that has been in effect throughout most of the pandemic. New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island (PEI), Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had restricted domestic travel from outside of their group. Outsiders were expected to quarantine for 14 days, while insiders could move freely. The bubble has been credited with keeping cases low. But on Monday, Newfoundland and Labrador and PEI said they would temporarily end the agreement, as cases in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are on the rise. PEI will also ban non-essential travel until 7 December.  A 10-year-old boy was among those who died in hospital as the UK recorded its highest daily death toll for over five months. The 608 people reported to have died within 28 days of a positive test is the largest total since 12 May, when 614 deaths were recorded. The daily death figures have begun to flatten in recent days, however, following the fall in the number of reported infections. The parents of Fehzan Jamil, who lived in Bradford and is one of the virus's youngest UK victims, told Channel 4 News of their âindescribableâ pain. Tayyaba and Mohammed Jamil said their son, who had epilepsy and other health problems, was a âreally brave fighterâ and a âsoldierâ, who was always cheerful.    Ghislaine Maxwell is due to go on trial in 2021 Ghislaine Maxwell has been quarantined after staff tested positive for Covid-19 at the jail in New York where she is awaiting trial, US prosecutors say. Maxwell is accused of helping her former boyfriend, late financier Jeffrey Epstein, traffic and sexually abuse underage girls and of perjury for denying involvement in such a scheme when she gave her deposition under oath. She has pleaded not guilty. The staff tested positive last week and Maxwell, 58, was checked for the virus on 18 November using a rapid test which was negative, the prosecutors said in a letter to US District Judge Alison Nathan. She will go on trial next year, and is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. The mutations observed in coronavirus isolates from mink have also been observed in ferrets, according to the latestminutes from the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage),external. Sage said preliminary evidence suggested ferrets could pose a risk to those who are most
vulnerable to the virus, but were low risk otherwise. Unlike mink, they are normally not kept in high-intensity farms. Sage said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is currently assessing the risk to people in the UK and is developing messaging for ferret owners. There are fears mutations of the virus in animals could hamper the effectiveness of coronavirus vaccines. Earlier this month,Denmark culled all its mink - up to 17 million animals - because of the spread of coronavirus in the animal. Sage said coordination was needed across academic groups  and relevant bodies on the risks of human to animal transmission and the intensive rearing of
animals. The Sage minutes said the UK's vaccine taskforce would note potential implications for vaccine targeting of variants
including those that are mink-adapted. What's the science behind mink and coronavirus? We take a look here Theo LeggettBBC business correspondent The global airline industry will make a net loss of $118bn (Â£88bn) this year, according to the International Air Transport Association (Iata), and a further loss of $38bn is expected next year. The figures are much higher than previous estimates, and reflect the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, and continued restrictions on travel. Iata's Director General Alexandre de Juniac explained that 2020 had been the worst financial year in the industry's history. Without financial support from governments, he said, there would have been bankruptcies on ""a massive scale"". According to Iata, airlines have been able to cut their costs collectively by $365bn this year, a reduction of nearly 46%. But this has been outweighed by a drop in revenues of more than 60%. The organisation says it does expect the situation to improve next year, with some opening of borders, either through improved testing or a vaccine. But it still expects losses to be greater than any the industry has ever suffered, with the exception of 2020. Passenger numbers are expected to drop to 1.8 billion thisyear from 4.5 billion in 2019, and will recover only partially to 2.8 billion next year, according to the association. Alistair ColemanBBC Disinformation unit Signs like this have wrongly suggested that a royal charter from 1215 gives business owners the right to refuse to close In the UK,a Yorkshire hairdresser is facing fines totalling Â£27,000($36,000) for refusing to close her salon during lockdown. Sinead Quinn has a sign in her shop window saying that she ""does not consent"" to coronavirus laws, claiming her right to do so is set out in the Magna Carta, a royal charter from more than 800 years ago that was England's first form of a written constitution. However, no such right exists and she's been fined multiple times for staying open. She's one of several traders including a tattoo artist in Bristol, and aNottinghamshire bookshop, who claim that ""Article 61"" of the Magna Carta signed by King John in 1215 gives them the right to ignore ""unjust"" laws. But Article 61 was removed from Magna Carta within a year of its signing, andonly three clauses of the document remain law today.,external That's not stopped anti-lockdown social media accounts offering a downloadable notice for businesses to place in their windows. This notice also refers to a""Freeman on the Land"" defence, which claims citizens have had their identities ""stolen"" by the state, and by asserting their rights as ""sovereign citizens"" they are only bound by laws to which they consent. No ""Freeman on the Land"" defence has ever prevailed in court. One scientific expert said the relaxation of restrictions over Christmas will ""almost inevitably"" lead to an increase in transmission, but that the celebration may still be what is needed to âmake it through the rest of winterâ. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, said: âThe issue is whether that increased risk is tolerable in relation to the benefits. At that time schools will be closed so there would naturally be some downward pressure on transmission."" He said if the new tier system is working well ""there will be a downward pressure on transmission before and after the Christmas break"", so any increase in cases ""could be relatively short-lived"". ""After Christmas we will still have to live through a few more months of restrictions at least,"" the professor said. This video can not be played Gove: ""Three households can have a Christmas bubble"" Cabinet minister Michael Gove says people will be able to ""enjoy something closer to a normal Christmas"" after the four nations reached an agreement. But the bubbles, of up to three households, must be exclusive and people have to comply with hospitality rules in place in their area, depending which tier they're in. Mr Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said it was a chance to ""meet close friends and family in a very restricted fashion"". Three households can meet over a five-day
period (23 - 27 December) in the UK. However, those in Northern Ireland have been granted a bigger window (22 - 28 December) to allow for any additional travel time to and from the region. Sam says she wants to get together ""even if it's just for one day"" Families are now facing a big choice about whether to take advantage of the freedom to meet up at Christmas - or whether to play it safe. Sam in Devon is building a grotto in her garden ready for a small family gathering. She told the BBC: ""Itâs the only time of the year I get everybody together, it's very important, it's special. ""Itâs not the presents or anything else, itâs having my family. Even if itâs just for one day."" But she said people ""have to be sensible otherwise weâre going to have a really rotten January"". But others said they would not be travelling. Father and daughter Naomi and Roy said they would not be making the trip between Devon and South Wales this year. ""I would love to do it, but no,"" Naomi said. ""Especially with the vaccine development, it just seems like too high risk regardless of what we're allowed to do."" ""The only thing thatâs missing is the physical contact,"" said Roy, adding that he missed the grandchildren, ""If that has to be, I would rather miss out in 2020 if it means we can do what we normally do in 2021.""  This year, Naomi and dad Roy will spend Christmas apart We've had some more detail about what the Christmas announcements will mean for different groups: In a joint statement from all four governments, the leaders say 2020 ""has been an incredibly difficult year for us all"". ""We have all had to make significant sacrifices in our everyday lives, and many
religious and community groups have already had to change or forgo their
customary celebrations to slow the spread of coronavirus and save lives. ""This cannot be
a ânormalâ Christmas but as we approach the festive period, we have been
working closely together to find a way for family and friends to see each
other, even if it is for a short time, and recognising that it must be both
limited and cautious."" They urge people to use ""personal judgement"" and be ""mindful of the risks"" particularly when meeting those
who are vulnerable. ""We urge the consideration of alternative approaches such as the use of
technology or meeting outside,"" the statement adds. NI First Minister Arlene Foster said she hoped the announcement gave people time to plan First Minister Arlene Foster welcomed the announcement of Christmas arrangements and said she hoped it would give people space to plan. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was a ""message of hope"" but urged people to be responsible, safe and mindful of healthcare workers. âThink, can you meet up differently, can you go for a walk, for example, with a family member?â she said. Arlene Foster said the relaxations would apply in people's homes, in non-essential retail and places of worship but not in hospitality. She said people should stick to the regulations on hospitality concerning the number of households allowed to meet together at the time. Northern Ireland is due to begin a two-week lockdown from this Friday until 11 December, in a bid to curb the spread of the virus before Christmas.  Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said the approach to Christmas was ""not a choice between relaxation or no relaxation"" but a plan to allow celebrations ""in a controlled way"". He stressed this is ""not an instruction to travel"" and ""not an instruction to meet with other people"". Asked if he had any concerns about relaxing the restrictions, he said ""misgivings happen either way"". Mr Drakeford said: ""It is having a form of relaxation where there are rules that people will recognise, that will allow people to enjoy Christmas, but will do it in a controlled way."" He admitted he had ""hesitation"" - because of the state of the virus in Wales and the UK as a whole - but added: ""It is better that we have a common set of arrangements that give people a framework that they can manage within and act responsibly within as well."" Asked about what plans and preparations are being made for the opening months of 2021, he replied: ""What I am keen on is that we don't, on a four nation basis, simply think about five days of Christmas. ""We think of a common approach to Christmas and a common approach to dealing with the consequences of Christmas as well."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the relaxation would not apply to Hogmanay Talking about the plans, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged people to try to limit their interaction. She said there would be some people who felt the need to come
together over Christmas and âwe want to allow thatâ but âjust because this can
be doneâ, it is not the case that people should feel âthey should do it if they
donât have toâ. Ms Sturgeon also confirmed that travel restrictions would be lifted
to allow people to visit families in other parts of the UK within the three-household bubble. She said the three-household bubble was a âfixed bubble for
that five-day period - you canât see two households one day and another two
households the next dayâ. The first minister confirmed the relaxation would not apply
to Hogmanay, saying âwe canât do everything hereâ. ""The last thing we want to do right now is set our
progress back,â she added. On the matter of hugs, she cautioned people against doing things that allow the virus to spread. Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove says he is
""very pleased"" to have reached an agreement with the other four
regions. However he warns that a ""balance has to be struck""
between relaxing the restrictions over Christmas and beating back the virus. He says the progress on vaccines means there is ""light at the end of the tunnel"" but he adds ""it is important we don't let things get too loose over Christmas."" ""I know that people will use these freedoms responsibly."" He said this was an opportunity
for people to ""meet close friends and family in a very restricted fashion,
in order to ensure that those we love can be with us at this special season,
but only for a limited period, but not in hospitality venues and not in any
locations where the virus might spread fast"". Mr Gove said he now planned to
spend Christmas with his mother and father in Aberdeen.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"Charles Darwin's work on evolution theory by natural selection changed the way we think about the natural world Cambridge University Library has announced that two notebooks written by Charles Darwin, worth many millions of pounds, have been missing for 20 years. One of them contains the 19th Century scientist's famous Tree of Life sketch, exploring the evolutionary relationship between species. Following an ""extensive search"", curators have now concluded they have probably been stolen. They are launching a public appeal for help in trying to find them. ""This is heartbreaking,"" Dr Jessica Gardner, the university's librarian, tells the BBC. ""We will leave no stone unturned,"" in trying to discover what has happened, she adds. Charles Darwin's hunch about early life was probably right The notebooks were last seen in November 2000 after ""an internal request"" to remove them from a special manuscripts storeroom to be photographed. They were taken to a temporary studio, which at the time was in a temporary building in the grounds of the university library because building work was taking place. It was only during ""a routine check"" two months later that it was discovered they were missing. ""We know they were photographed in November,"" says Dr Gardner. ""But we do not know what happened between then and the time in January 2001, when it was determined they were not in their proper place on the shelves. ""And I'm afraid there isn't anything on the remaining record which tells us anything more."" His Tree of Life sketch is among the missing notes Initially librarians thought they might have been put back in the wrong place. ""My predecessors genuinely believed they had been misfiled and they would find them,"" adds Dr Gardner, who became director of library services in 2017. There were a number of ""intense"" searches over the years. They all drew a blank. Perhaps it is not that surprising given the size of the library. It is vast, containing more than 200km of shelving, roughly the distance from Cambridge to Southampton by road. It is home to more than 10 million maps and manuscripts and other objects. At the beginning of this year, Dr Gardner arranged a new search. Specialist staff combed through specific zones of the library's storage facilities. They conducted a ""fingertip"" check through 189 boxes which contain Darwin's books, drawings and letters. But still no notebooks. A new approach was needed, according to Dr Gardner. She says she was ""not willing to accept"" the notebooks would just ""turn up"". So she and her team ""completely reviewed what happened at the time and critically we took a big step back from what had become a common understanding that they had been mis-shelved. ""Reluctantly I have decided that was not the right conclusion."" Instead, she believes: ""These notebooks have probably been stolen."" Theft, she says, ""should be ruled in as a possibility from the start and that wasn't"". Security procedures, she explains, have been ""revised and reviewed"" and ""tightened"" over the last two decades. ""Now if anything of this scale and significance was not found we would be going to the police."" Cambridgeshire Police have now been informed and the disappearance of the notebooks has been recorded on the national Art Loss Register for missing cultural artefacts. The police have also added the missing notebooks to Interpol's database of stolen artworks. Cambridge University Library have appealed for the notebooks to be returned In July 1837, Charles Darwin was a young man of 28. At his home in London, he wrote at the top of the page of one of his red leather notebooks, ""I think"". Then he drew a spindly sketch of a tree. He had recently returned from the Galapagos Islands aboard HMS Beagle and was working through scientific ideas inspired by his trip. ""These notebooks really are Darwin's attempt to pose to himself the question about where do species come from, what is the origin of species?"" explains Jim Secord, emeritus professor of history and philosophy of science at Cambridge University. More than 20 years later, on 24 November 1859, Darwin published a more fully developed tree of life in On the Origin of Species. ""It's almost like being inside Darwin's head when you're looking at these notebooks,"" says Professor Secord. ""They're jottings of all sorts of information that he's writing down. ""You have the sense of him working through these ideas at great speed and that kind of intellectual energy which I think the notebooks really convey. ""I'm a fan of James Joyce and it's always struck me that it's a bit like Leopold Bloom on steroids. You just get the sense of scientific imagination running really deep."" Although the notebooks have been digitised, Professor Secord says the scans can never replace the real thing. ""To have such an iconic object go missing is really a tragedy."" Darwin produced two groundbreaking works - On the Origin of Species and The Descent of Man The notebooks themselves are small, no bigger than a postcard. They were kept in a bespoke blue box, about the size of a paperback. It is still possible the notebooks might be found. ""We won't stop looking,"" says Dr Gardner. But it will take another five years to complete a full search of the remaining shelves and storage rooms. In the meantime, the library is asking the public for help. ""There are good examples where things have been found, thanks to the help of the public,"" says Dr Gardner. ""So I would really appeal to members of the public, former staff, researchers, anyone who might have information which would shed light. But Dr Gardner is reluctant to speculate where the notebooks might be. ""It's possible they are under a bed, that's the best case scenario, someone has found they can't sell them or they're just holding on to them,"" she says. ""This is the time to just safely, even anonymously, get in touch. ""It's those new leads we're looking for, with the help of the police, in order to help recover these for the nation.""

"The four nations of the UK have agreed UK-wide rules to allow families to meet over Christmas Three households will be allowed to meet in each other's homes over five days between 23-27 December Earlier, Matt Hancock took questions at a joint session of the Health and Social Care Committee and Science and Technology Committee He defended NHS test-and-trace, saying it was not to blame for the second lockdown The health secretary also said the UK should be ""getting back to normal"" after Easter People arriving in England will be soon able to reduce their quarantine period if they pay for a Covid test Globally, the world's most vulnerable must not be ""trampled in the stampede"" for vaccines, the World Health Organization warns The developers of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine say it is proving to be up to 95% effective Edited by Emma Owen We will be back with more coronavirus coverage on our live page tomorrow. Today's updates have been brought to you by: Hugo Bachega, George Bowden, Marie Jackson, Joseph Lee, Emma Owen, Georgina Rannard, Alex Therrien, Lauren Turner and Kate Whannel. Rules will be relaxed for Christmas across the UK We are bringing our live page coverage to an end shortly. Before we do, here's a summary of today's headlines from the UK: Health officials advised people in the US to stay at home for Thanksgiving There are over 30,000 people in hospital - but cases are falling sharply With another 458 deaths reported today, France has become the latest European country to record more than 50,000 deaths during the pandemic. Italy and the UK had already passed that milestone. But France's death toll of 50,237 comes against a background of falling cases, with 9,155 infections today - compared to 45,522 last Tuesday. The number of people in hospital fell by 859 to 30,622, the sharpest fall since the country's lockdown began on 30 October. French President Emmanuel Macron announced a phased end to the lockdown, with shops allowed to reopen on Saturday. Other restrictions will remain in place. Canada's eastern provinces are dissolving their ""bubble"" that has been in effect throughout most of the pandemic. New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island (PEI), Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador had restricted domestic travel from outside of their group. Outsiders were expected to quarantine for 14 days, while insiders could move freely. The bubble has been credited with keeping cases low. But on Monday, Newfoundland and Labrador and PEI said they would temporarily end the agreement, as cases in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are on the rise. PEI will also ban non-essential travel until 7 December.  A 10-year-old boy was among those who died in hospital as the UK recorded its highest daily death toll for over five months. The 608 people reported to have died within 28 days of a positive test is the largest total since 12 May, when 614 deaths were recorded. The daily death figures have begun to flatten in recent days, however, following the fall in the number of reported infections. The parents of Fehzan Jamil, who lived in Bradford and is one of the virus's youngest UK victims, told Channel 4 News of their âindescribableâ pain. Tayyaba and Mohammed Jamil said their son, who had epilepsy and other health problems, was a âreally brave fighterâ and a âsoldierâ, who was always cheerful.    Ghislaine Maxwell is due to go on trial in 2021 Ghislaine Maxwell has been quarantined after staff tested positive for Covid-19 at the jail in New York where she is awaiting trial, US prosecutors say. Maxwell is accused of helping her former boyfriend, late financier Jeffrey Epstein, traffic and sexually abuse underage girls and of perjury for denying involvement in such a scheme when she gave her deposition under oath. She has pleaded not guilty. The staff tested positive last week and Maxwell, 58, was checked for the virus on 18 November using a rapid test which was negative, the prosecutors said in a letter to US District Judge Alison Nathan. She will go on trial next year, and is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. The mutations observed in coronavirus isolates from mink have also been observed in ferrets, according to the latestminutes from the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage),external. Sage said preliminary evidence suggested ferrets could pose a risk to those who are most
vulnerable to the virus, but were low risk otherwise. Unlike mink, they are normally not kept in high-intensity farms. Sage said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is currently assessing the risk to people in the UK and is developing messaging for ferret owners. There are fears mutations of the virus in animals could hamper the effectiveness of coronavirus vaccines. Earlier this month,Denmark culled all its mink - up to 17 million animals - because of the spread of coronavirus in the animal. Sage said coordination was needed across academic groups  and relevant bodies on the risks of human to animal transmission and the intensive rearing of
animals. The Sage minutes said the UK's vaccine taskforce would note potential implications for vaccine targeting of variants
including those that are mink-adapted. What's the science behind mink and coronavirus? We take a look here Theo LeggettBBC business correspondent The global airline industry will make a net loss of $118bn (Â£88bn) this year, according to the International Air Transport Association (Iata), and a further loss of $38bn is expected next year. The figures are much higher than previous estimates, and reflect the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, and continued restrictions on travel. Iata's Director General Alexandre de Juniac explained that 2020 had been the worst financial year in the industry's history. Without financial support from governments, he said, there would have been bankruptcies on ""a massive scale"". According to Iata, airlines have been able to cut their costs collectively by $365bn this year, a reduction of nearly 46%. But this has been outweighed by a drop in revenues of more than 60%. The organisation says it does expect the situation to improve next year, with some opening of borders, either through improved testing or a vaccine. But it still expects losses to be greater than any the industry has ever suffered, with the exception of 2020. Passenger numbers are expected to drop to 1.8 billion thisyear from 4.5 billion in 2019, and will recover only partially to 2.8 billion next year, according to the association. Alistair ColemanBBC Disinformation unit Signs like this have wrongly suggested that a royal charter from 1215 gives business owners the right to refuse to close In the UK,a Yorkshire hairdresser is facing fines totalling Â£27,000($36,000) for refusing to close her salon during lockdown. Sinead Quinn has a sign in her shop window saying that she ""does not consent"" to coronavirus laws, claiming her right to do so is set out in the Magna Carta, a royal charter from more than 800 years ago that was England's first form of a written constitution. However, no such right exists and she's been fined multiple times for staying open. She's one of several traders including a tattoo artist in Bristol, and aNottinghamshire bookshop, who claim that ""Article 61"" of the Magna Carta signed by King John in 1215 gives them the right to ignore ""unjust"" laws. But Article 61 was removed from Magna Carta within a year of its signing, andonly three clauses of the document remain law today.,external That's not stopped anti-lockdown social media accounts offering a downloadable notice for businesses to place in their windows. This notice also refers to a""Freeman on the Land"" defence, which claims citizens have had their identities ""stolen"" by the state, and by asserting their rights as ""sovereign citizens"" they are only bound by laws to which they consent. No ""Freeman on the Land"" defence has ever prevailed in court. One scientific expert said the relaxation of restrictions over Christmas will ""almost inevitably"" lead to an increase in transmission, but that the celebration may still be what is needed to âmake it through the rest of winterâ. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, said: âThe issue is whether that increased risk is tolerable in relation to the benefits. At that time schools will be closed so there would naturally be some downward pressure on transmission."" He said if the new tier system is working well ""there will be a downward pressure on transmission before and after the Christmas break"", so any increase in cases ""could be relatively short-lived"". ""After Christmas we will still have to live through a few more months of restrictions at least,"" the professor said. This video can not be played Gove: ""Three households can have a Christmas bubble"" Cabinet minister Michael Gove says people will be able to ""enjoy something closer to a normal Christmas"" after the four nations reached an agreement. But the bubbles, of up to three households, must be exclusive and people have to comply with hospitality rules in place in their area, depending which tier they're in. Mr Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said it was a chance to ""meet close friends and family in a very restricted fashion"". Three households can meet over a five-day
period (23 - 27 December) in the UK. However, those in Northern Ireland have been granted a bigger window (22 - 28 December) to allow for any additional travel time to and from the region. Sam says she wants to get together ""even if it's just for one day"" Families are now facing a big choice about whether to take advantage of the freedom to meet up at Christmas - or whether to play it safe. Sam in Devon is building a grotto in her garden ready for a small family gathering. She told the BBC: ""Itâs the only time of the year I get everybody together, it's very important, it's special. ""Itâs not the presents or anything else, itâs having my family. Even if itâs just for one day."" But she said people ""have to be sensible otherwise weâre going to have a really rotten January"". But others said they would not be travelling. Father and daughter Naomi and Roy said they would not be making the trip between Devon and South Wales this year. ""I would love to do it, but no,"" Naomi said. ""Especially with the vaccine development, it just seems like too high risk regardless of what we're allowed to do."" ""The only thing thatâs missing is the physical contact,"" said Roy, adding that he missed the grandchildren, ""If that has to be, I would rather miss out in 2020 if it means we can do what we normally do in 2021.""  This year, Naomi and dad Roy will spend Christmas apart We've had some more detail about what the Christmas announcements will mean for different groups: In a joint statement from all four governments, the leaders say 2020 ""has been an incredibly difficult year for us all"". ""We have all had to make significant sacrifices in our everyday lives, and many
religious and community groups have already had to change or forgo their
customary celebrations to slow the spread of coronavirus and save lives. ""This cannot be
a ânormalâ Christmas but as we approach the festive period, we have been
working closely together to find a way for family and friends to see each
other, even if it is for a short time, and recognising that it must be both
limited and cautious."" They urge people to use ""personal judgement"" and be ""mindful of the risks"" particularly when meeting those
who are vulnerable. ""We urge the consideration of alternative approaches such as the use of
technology or meeting outside,"" the statement adds. NI First Minister Arlene Foster said she hoped the announcement gave people time to plan First Minister Arlene Foster welcomed the announcement of Christmas arrangements and said she hoped it would give people space to plan. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was a ""message of hope"" but urged people to be responsible, safe and mindful of healthcare workers. âThink, can you meet up differently, can you go for a walk, for example, with a family member?â she said. Arlene Foster said the relaxations would apply in people's homes, in non-essential retail and places of worship but not in hospitality. She said people should stick to the regulations on hospitality concerning the number of households allowed to meet together at the time. Northern Ireland is due to begin a two-week lockdown from this Friday until 11 December, in a bid to curb the spread of the virus before Christmas.  Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said the approach to Christmas was ""not a choice between relaxation or no relaxation"" but a plan to allow celebrations ""in a controlled way"". He stressed this is ""not an instruction to travel"" and ""not an instruction to meet with other people"". Asked if he had any concerns about relaxing the restrictions, he said ""misgivings happen either way"". Mr Drakeford said: ""It is having a form of relaxation where there are rules that people will recognise, that will allow people to enjoy Christmas, but will do it in a controlled way."" He admitted he had ""hesitation"" - because of the state of the virus in Wales and the UK as a whole - but added: ""It is better that we have a common set of arrangements that give people a framework that they can manage within and act responsibly within as well."" Asked about what plans and preparations are being made for the opening months of 2021, he replied: ""What I am keen on is that we don't, on a four nation basis, simply think about five days of Christmas. ""We think of a common approach to Christmas and a common approach to dealing with the consequences of Christmas as well."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the relaxation would not apply to Hogmanay Talking about the plans, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged people to try to limit their interaction. She said there would be some people who felt the need to come
together over Christmas and âwe want to allow thatâ but âjust because this can
be doneâ, it is not the case that people should feel âthey should do it if they
donât have toâ. Ms Sturgeon also confirmed that travel restrictions would be lifted
to allow people to visit families in other parts of the UK within the three-household bubble. She said the three-household bubble was a âfixed bubble for
that five-day period - you canât see two households one day and another two
households the next dayâ. The first minister confirmed the relaxation would not apply
to Hogmanay, saying âwe canât do everything hereâ. ""The last thing we want to do right now is set our
progress back,â she added. On the matter of hugs, she cautioned people against doing things that allow the virus to spread. Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove says he is
""very pleased"" to have reached an agreement with the other four
regions. However he warns that a ""balance has to be struck""
between relaxing the restrictions over Christmas and beating back the virus. He says the progress on vaccines means there is ""light at the end of the tunnel"" but he adds ""it is important we don't let things get too loose over Christmas."" ""I know that people will use these freedoms responsibly."" He said this was an opportunity
for people to ""meet close friends and family in a very restricted fashion,
in order to ensure that those we love can be with us at this special season,
but only for a limited period, but not in hospitality venues and not in any
locations where the virus might spread fast"". Mr Gove said he now planned to
spend Christmas with his mother and father in Aberdeen.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,9.530479e-05
"Apple's head of global security has been charged with bribery. Thomas Moyer is accused of offering bribes in the form of iPads worth $70,000 in order to obtain concealed firearms licenses. The charges were brought by a California grand jury on Monday. Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Two police officers from Santa Clara County, California, have also been charged. County Undersheriff Rick Sung and Sheriff's Captain James Jenson are accused of requesting bribes for concealed firearms licenses. Mr Moyer is accused of offering bribes to get them. Under state law, it is a crime to carry a concealed firearm without a concealed weapon license. Santa Clara County alleges that Mr Sung held back issuing concealed weapons permits to Apple's security team, until Mr Moyer agreed to donate $70,000 worth of iPads to the sheriff's office. The charge sheet states that the plan was scuttled at the eleventh hour in August, 2019, when Mr Sung and Mr Moyer learned of a search warrant to seize the police's concealed weapon license records. The two-year investigation concludes that Mr Sung, aided by Mr Jensen in one instance, would hold back on issuing permits, refusing to release them until the applicants gave something of value. If found guilty those charged could face prison time. Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said: ""Call this quid pro quo. Call it pay-to-play. Call it give to get. It is illegal and deeply erodes public confidence in the criminal justice system,"" ""When high-ranking members of a law enforcement agency are at the heart of a bribery scheme, it tarnishes the badge, the honour, the reputations and - tragically - the effectiveness of all law enforcement agencies.""

"Ministers have said they cannot rule out leaseholders in England having to meet some of the costs of removing flammable cladding from their homes. While Â£1.6bn had been made available, Chris Pincher told MPs the government would not write an ""open cheque"". It was up to developers and building owners to ""step up"" and take primary responsibility for repairs, he added. MPs say delays to the process and uncertainty over who will pay are causing ""unimaginable anxiety"". Raising the issue in the Commons, Labour's Clive Betts said government support was ""totally inadequate"" given the cost of removal aluminium composite and other dangerous materials could be as much as Â£15bn. After the 2017 Grenfell fire, the government pledged safe alternatives to dangerous cladding would be provided on all buildings in England taller than 18 metres by last June. Cladding red tape 'stops people selling homes' Imprisoned by cladding: The flat owners who cannot sell Building safety rules failing, says review But a report in September found that only 155 out of 455 high-rise buildings with similar cladding to Grenfell have had it replaced. To speed up the process, the Commons Housing Committee said the government should foot the bill for the work in the short term, looking to recover costs from those responsible for historic construction failures at a later date. Mr Betts, the committee's chair, said the issue had dragged on for too long and urgent action was needed. ""Leaseholders should not have to pay any of the costs. They bought their properties in good faith, they have not done anything wrong and they should not be financially distressed,"" he said. ""Without assurances on these points, many people are going to have a very miserable Christmas, trapped in properties they can't sell, often they can't insure...and wondering how on earth they are going to pay for the bills that could arrive on their doormats at any time."" He was backed by Conservative Sir Peter Bottomley, the longest-serving MP in the Commons, who said delays to fixing high-rise and other affected buildings had effectively ""frozen"" parts of the leasehold property market. Those affected had been lumbered with ""unimaginable anxiety and costs beyond the possible chance of paying"". It has been estimated that replacing unsafe cladding on buildings will cost Â£4bn in London alone. Mr Pincher said the government was looking at a range of innovative solutions to help minimise the costs borne by individuals but he said he could not guarantee that all leaseholders would not have to contribute. ""We cannot write an open cheque on behalf of the taxpayer. That would send the wrong signal to developers and those who are responsible for these buildings that they don't have to pay because the taxpayer will. ""I am clear that public funding does not absolve the industry from taking responsibility. We expect investors, developers and building owners who have the means to pay to cover remediation costs themselves."" Ministers have said two new pieces of legislation, the Fire Safety Bill and Building Safety Bill,combined with a separate proposed law on building and fire safety,external- will deliver the biggest changes to building safety for nearly 40 years, ensuring greater accountability in law for the upkeep of buildings and enforcement of safety obligations. Mr Betts said the proposals were ""welcome"" but more safeguards were needed, including a central register of building safety managers and more rigorous regulation of construction products.

"John Kerry was joined by his granddaughter when he signed the Paris climate agreement in 2016 US President-elect Joe Biden is to nominate one of the leading architects of the Paris climate agreement as his climate envoy. Ex-US Secretary of State John Kerry was one of several named for top positions by the Biden transition team on Monday. It marks a big break with the climate policy under the Trump administration as Mr Biden makes goodon his campaign pledge to tackle climate change. Other key picks include long-time aide Antony Blinken as secretary of state. Reports say former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen will be the choice for treasury secretary. The nomination comes as calls are growing for President Donald Trump to concede the election. He has made unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud and is continuing to pursue legal challenges over the result. While Mr Trump has not conceded, he has however agreed to allowthe formal transition process to begin, to allow Mr Biden to prepare to take office. How big are Biden's climate change ambitions? Can Trump overturn the election result? Mr Biden is projected to beat President Trump by 306 votes to 232 when the US electoral college meets to formally confirm the winner on 14 December. This is far above the 270 votes he needs. In a statement following the cabinet announcement on Monday, Mr Biden said: ""I need a team ready on day one to help me reclaim America's seat at the head of the table, rally the world to meet the biggest challenges we face, and advance our security, prosperity, and values. This is the crux of that team."" Some of the positions require confirmation in the US Senate. Mr Kerry was chosen for the role of special presidential envoy for climate. The Biden transition team said the position would see him ""fight climate change full-time"". He is also set to be the first official dedicated to climate change to sit on the National Security Council. Mr Kerry signed the Paris climate agreement on behalf of the US in 2016. The deal committed countries to working to limit the global temperature rise. Under Mr Trump, the US recently became the first country toformally withdraw from the agreement. But Mr Biden has said he plans to rejoin the accord as soon as possible. This video can not be played What is climate change? In 2019, Mr Kerry launched a coalition of world leaders and celebrities - dubbed World War Zero - to call for climate change action and net zero carbon emissions. Following news of his new role on Monday, he tweeted: ""America will soon have a government that treats the climate crisis as the urgent national security threat it is."" Covid pandemic has little impact on rise in CO2 Mr Kerry previously served as secretary of state during Barack Obama's second term as president. A veteran Democratic politician, he lost to incumbent Republican George W Bush in the 2004 presidential election. He was a senator for 28 years and chairman of the foreign relations committee. Heendorsed Mr Biden to be the Democratic Party's candidate in the 2020 raceand joined him on the campaign trail. Mr Blinken was nominated as secretary of state - the most important foreign policy position. The 58-year-old was deputy secretary of state and deputy national security adviser during the Obama administration, in which Mr Biden served as vice-president. Allow Twitter content?

He is expected to manage a Biden foreign policy agenda that will emphasise re-engaging with Western allies. Biden has chosen Jake Sullivan, Linda Thomas-Greenfield and Antony Blinken for key roles Avril Haineswas nominated as the first female director of national intelligence. Ms Haines is a former deputy director of the CIA and deputy national security adviser. Alejandro Mayorkaswas the first Latino nominated to serve as secretary of homeland security. He previously served as deputy secretary of homeland security under President Obama. Jake Sullivanwas named White House national security adviser. Mr Sullivan served as Mr Biden's national security adviser during Mr Obama's second term. Long-time diplomatLinda Thomas-Greenfieldwas nominated US ambassador to the UN. She also served under President Obama, including as assistant secretary of state for African affairs between 2013 and 2017. In his choice of a national security team, Joe Biden has signalled that the US is resuming its conventional international role, after four turbulent years of Donald Trump's America First. He's appointing Obama administration veterans to top positions and elevating a long-serving career diplomat sidelined by the Trump administration. His pick for secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, is an advocate of global alliances. Mr Blinken will lead the charge to re-establish ties with allies and rejoin agreements and institutions rejected by Trump. And there's no doubt that he'll be speaking for the man in the White House: Mr Blinken has advised Biden on foreign policy for so long he's been described as an alter ego. Another familiar face is former Secretary of State John Kerry. The president-elect's decision to give him a new cabinet-level position as climate envoy shows he's treating the issue as a significant national security threat. But even with the old team this is not going to be Obama 2.0: the landscape has shifted in both America and the world during the last four years. Still, Mr Biden is projecting stability and familiarity, and international leaders know what they will be getting Donald Trump has now accepted that a formal transition should begin for President-elect Joe Biden to take office. But the president vowed to keep contesting his election defeat and has been pursuing so-far fruitless legal challenges in several states to try to overturn his loss. His latest legal setback came on Saturday whena judge dismissed his attempt to have millions of postal votes in Pennsylvania invalidated. It comes as calls are growing for him to accept defeat. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a prominent Trump ally,called the president's legal team a ""national embarrassment"". ""I have been a supporter of the president's. I voted for him twice. But elections have consequences, and we cannot continue to act as if something happened here that didn't happen,"" he told ABC. How is President Trump challenging the result? 'Overvoting' and other US fraud claims fact-checked High-profile Trump supporter Stephen Schwarzman, the CEO of investment company Blackstone, also said it was time for Mr Trump to accept he lost. ""Like many in the business community, I am ready to help President-elect Biden and his team as they confront the significant challenges of rebuilding our post-Covid economy,"" he said in a statement reported by US media.

"This video can not be played ""People will be able to leave their home for any purpose,"" says Prime Minister Boris Johnson Gyms and non-essential shops in all parts of England will be allowed to reopen when lockdown ends next month, the prime minister has announced. Boris Johnson told the Commons that the three-tiered regional measures will return from 2 December, but he added that each tier will be toughened. Spectators will be allowed to return to some sporting events, and weddings and collective worship will resume. Regions will not find out which tier they are in until Thursday. The allocation of tiers will be dependent on a number of factors, including each area's case numbers, the reproduction rate - or R number - and the current and projected pressure on the NHS locally. Tier allocations will be reviewed every 14 days, and the regional approach will last until March. Fans set to be allowed at outdoor sports Where will mass testing be available? New Covid rules 'rub salt in the wounds', say pubs What will England's new lockdown rules be? The PM, who is self-isolating after meeting an MP who later tested positive for coronavirus, told MPs via video link he expected ""more regions will fall - at least temporarily - into higher levels than before"". He said he was ""very sorry"" for the ""hardship"" that such restrictions would cause business owners. Speaking later at a Downing Street briefing, Mr Johnson added that ""things will look and feel very different"" after Easter, with a vaccine and mass testing. He warned the months ahead ""will be hard, they will be cold"" - but added that with a ""favourable wind"" the majority of people most in need of a vaccination might be able to get one by Easter. Until then, the PM said, there would be a three-pronged approach of ""tough tiering, mass community testing, and [the] roll-out of vaccines"". Describing how the tiers had become tougher, the PM said: In tier one, people should continue to work from home where possible In tier two, only pubs serving substantial meals can serve alcohol In tier three, hospitality will close except for delivery and takeaway, and indoor entertainment venues must also close. Where pubs and restaurants are allowed to open, last orders will now be at 10pm, with drinkers allowed a further hour to finish their drinks. Indoor performances - such as those at the theatre - will also return in the lower two tiers, although with reduced capacity. In terms of households mixing, in tier one a maximum of six people can meet indoors or outdoors; in tier two, there is no mixing of households indoors, and a maximum of six people can meet outdoors; and in tier three - the toughest tier - household mixing is not allowed indoors, or in most outdoor places. In all tiers, exceptions apply for support bubbles. From 2 December, parents with babies under the age of one can form a support bubble with another household. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains the new three tier system for England Mr Johnson said the tiers would now be auniform set of rules,external, with no negotiations on additional measures for any particular region. Measures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland continue to be decided by the devolved administrations, but a joint approach to Christmas, involving all four nations, will be set out later in the week. The prime minister said: ""I can't say that Christmas will be normal this year, but in a period of adversity time spent with loved ones is even more precious for people of all faiths and none. ""We all want some kind of Christmas; we need it; we certainly feel we deserve it. ""But this virus obviously is not going to grant a Christmas truceâ¦ and families will need to make a careful judgement about the risks of visiting elderly relatives."" For the third week running we have had some positive vaccine news, but the announcement about the toughened tiers is a reminder, if we needed any, that the next few months will be tough. Ministers and advisers have been hinting for the past week that the tiers will be toughened - and that is exactly what has happened. Attention will now naturally turn to which areas will be in which tiers. Deciding that is a complex equation that will take into account whether the cases are going up or down, the percentage of tests that are positive, hospital pressures and infection rates among older age groups. To give a flavour of how complex this is places in the North West and Yorkshire have some of the highest rates but they are falling the fastest. London and the South East have lower rates and more hospital capacity but cases are going up. Fine judgements will have to be made. We will find out on Thursday. Mr Johnson also announced changes to sport for both spectators and participants. While elite sport has continued behind closed doors during the lockdown, grassroots and amateur sport has been halted since 5 November. From 2 December, outdoor sports can resume, while spectators will be allowed to return in limited numbers. Some organised indoor sports can also resume. In the lowest risk areas, a maximum of 50% occupancy of a stadium, or 4,000 fans - whichever is smaller - will be allowed to return. In tier two, that drops to 2,000 fans or 50% capacity, whichever is smaller. In tier three, fans will continue to be barred from grounds. In tiers one and two, business events can also resume inside and outside with tight capacity limits and social distancing, as can indoor performances in theatres and concert halls, the government's plan says. This video can not be played ""This is the red-hot question"": Kier Starmer asks the PM which tiers each local area will be in Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the government's return to the regional system as ""risky... because the previous three-tier system didn't work"". He added that decisions on which areas will belong to each tier must be taken without delay - ""I just can't emphasise how important it is that these decisions are taken very quickly and very clearly so everybody can plan. ""That is obviously particularly important for the millions who were in restrictions before the national lockdown, because the message to them today seems to be 'you will almost certainly be back where you were before the national lockdown - probably in even stricter restrictions'."" Helen Dickinson, of the British Retail Consortium, said shops would be ""relieved"" at the decision to allow them to reopen.

"Spain's King Felipe VI has begun ten days of quarantine after coming into contact with a person who tested positive for coronavirus. Palace sources say the king, 52, was in ""close contact"" with the individual on Sunday, but gave no further details.

"Many businesses in Northern Ireland will be forced to close for two weeks from Friday Stormont ministers have agreed a multi-million pound support package to help people hit by tightened Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. From Friday, non-essential shops and businesses will close for two weeks, as part of tougher measures across NI. The executive had pledged to provide additional financial support to businesses forced to close. The immediate package will be worth about Â£338m, while Â£150m is being set aside for longer-term rates relief. Finance Minister Conor Murphy set out full details of the plan in the assembly on Monday afternoon. It comes as three more Covid-19 related deaths were recorded by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland on Monday, bringing the total to 936. A further 280 people tested positive. Among the measures agreed by the executive are: A Â£95m voucher scheme to encourage shoppers to support local traders by giving them a pre-paid card to spend on the High Street Â£44.3m to allow one-off heating payments of Â£200 to disabled people on higher rate allowances and older people in receipt of pension credit Â£20m for company directors, a group that has been excluded from previous support Â£20m to extend a 12-months rates holiday to manufacturing businesses, bringing the sector into line with what has been offered to hospitality, tourism, leisure and retail Â£10.6m to support about 1,000 drink-only pubs that have been shut since 16 October Â£10m for councils Â£10m for sports clubs hit by the restrictions Â£5m to top up the tourism and hospitality grants scheme Â£4.1m for about 953 bed and breakfast accommodation businesses excluded from previous support Â£3m to help local businesses grow online sales The pre-paid card issued through the voucher scheme will be worth about Â£200 per household, said Mr Murphy. He said the Department for the Economy will roll out the plan in early 2021, as it takes about six weeks to develop. ""It's not meant to support households, it's meant to stimulate growth on the High Street,"" he told assembly members. Other allocations include Â£26.3m to the Department for Infrastructure to replace lost income for Translink, the Crumlin Road Gaol, Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and the Rathlin Ferry, and Â£1.2m to support the City of Derry Airport. There is also Â£5m to support the scheme for charities, to run until the end of March 2021, and Â£2.3m to top up the social enterprise grant scheme. The finance minister also confirmed previously announced plans to extend free school meals payments until 2022, with Â£26.4m allocated to this. Shopping vouchers may be 'too late' for businesses What support is there for my business? What NI's new restrictions mean for you What is a circuit-breaker and can one fight Covid? Mr Murphy said uncertainty with the virus and not knowing how much Stormont would receive from the Treasury had made planning difficult. He said the financial support package he was announcing was as a result of an additional Â£400m provided from Westminster two weeks ago to support the executive's response. ""Had we as an Executive allocated this funding immediately, we wouldn't have been able to take into account the new restrictions agreed by the Executive last week,"" he said. ""In my view it was right to have a plan in place to take us to the New Year, before making these allocations."" Mr Murphy and Economy Minister Diane Dodds are understood to have spent the weekend working on plans, with their departmental officials. In Northern Ireland, three more coronavirus-related deaths were announced by the department of health on Monday, bringing its total to 936. A further 280 positive tests were recorded, meaning there have been 50,064 cases of Covid-19. There were no additional deaths documented in the Republic of Ireland, where the total stands at 2,022. There have been 70,711 confirmed cases after 252 more were reported. There was a cautious welcome in the assembly for Mr Murphy's announcement, but as one MLA remarked: ""The devil will be in the detail."" Officials worked at pace over the weekend to draw up a support plan, using a mix of schemes already in place and some new grants. The proposal grabbing most headlines is the voucher scheme for households to support the High Street, and some have questioned why every family will receive it, when some will obviously need more support than others. But Mr Murphy defended the plan and said its purpose is to boost the High Street in the early New Year. There are also concerns about how quickly payments will be made: Some businesses have been waiting more than five weeks for their grants promised during the first round of restrictions, implemented in October. The executive will have to work at rapid speed to ensure people across Northern Ireland aren't left waiting, given Christmas is just around the corner. The executive had faced criticism for not having new financial support in place before it announced the lockdown measures last Thursday evening. But Mr Murphy said his officials were working as quickly as possible to process payments to those who need them. The Belfast Chamber of Commerce has outlined a number of proposals to the executive about increasing assistance to businesses. The organisation's chief executive Simon Hamilton welcomed the measures announced in the assembly. He said he was particularly pleased by the voucher scheme, which his organisation had lobbied for.

This video can not be played 'We'd gladly have taken a full lockdown in October' The lockdown measures will last until 11 December, with ministers saying the new restrictions represented the ""best chance"" of getting to Christmas and new year without further regulations being needed. Meanwhile, Health Minister Robin Swann has called on his executive colleagues to show ""unity"" and he has called for an end to ""party-political point scoring"". He was speaking in the assembly on Monday as he gave details of the latest Covid-19 restrictions. The minister said the executive needs to ""put the last few weeks behind it"", and that the leaking of executive discussions to the media were not helpful. Mr Swann and the first and deputy first ministers are also expected to continue discussions with the Westminster government and other devolved administrations this week about a coordinated approach to Christmas. Ulster Unionist MLA Alan Chambers told the assembly the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in had ""undermined"" efforts to tackle Covid-19. He said there was a ""sense of outrage"" at the behaviour of Sinn FÃ©in figures who attended thefuneral of republican Bobby Storeyin June, while DUP politicians undermined the ""vital message"" of wearing masks by not doing so or by speaking out against the restrictions. SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly also attacked Sinn FÃ©in for the party's actions around Mr Storey's funeral. She said the health message had been ""disregarded"". Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill took part in talks over the weekend, whereleaders backed plans to allow some household mixing ""for a small number of days"" over Christmas. Belfast's Castle Lane was busy with shoppers on Sunday In respect of Northern Ireland, ministers have also ""recognised that people will want to see family and friends across the island of Ireland, and this is the subject of discussions with the Irish government"", the Cabinet Office said. The government said work is continuing to finalise the arrangements, including on travel.

"The Playhouse in Londonderry had been given an indicative reopening date of 1 September More than one-third of jobs in arts, culture and heritage are vulnerable as a result of coronavirus restrictions. That is according to a new study from Ulster University's Economic Policy Centre (UUEPC). The report suggests a high proportion of jobs in museums, galleries, theatres and music are particularly at risk. In general, the creative sector is ""more exposed to the challenges arising from Covid-19 than other sectors and occupations."" The main factors for that are social distancing measures limiting capacity and a reluctance among audiences to return even when venues can re-open. The UUEPC report estimated that there are 39,100 people employed in the arts, creative, culture and heritage sector in Northern Ireland. Socially-distanced concerts were trialled in England However, the type of occupation that figure includes is very wide. It ranges from people working in Information Technology (IT) and architecture to those employed in music, crafts, the performing arts, museums, galleries and libraries. Emergency fund of Â£13m for NI arts and heritage Arts sector money finally agreed in Covid package The study said that while a high proportion of jobs in areas such as IT were not vulnerable, jobs in the other sectors were ""much more at risk."" It estimated that more than 60% of jobs in museums, galleries and libraries were vulnerable, along with almost half of jobs in music, theatre and visual art. A significant number of jobs in film and TV production were also at risk. ""The pandemic has caused the immediate closure of non-essential business including the Arts, Culture and Heritage industries resulting in cancelled work and events such as large music events like Belfast Vital and Belsonic which attracted thousands of people to Belfast annually,"" the report said. ""The healthcare situation in NI will be more important in this sector than in the average NI occupation, given the interactive nature of work and a dependence on discretionary consumer spending."" The authors of the report also make a number of suggestions on how venues and visitor attractions could be helped to recover from the impact of the pandemic. They include ""visitor vouchers,"" which would subsidise 30-50% of the cost of tickets to venues to encourage audiences to return. Venues would also be compensated if they had to cancel events at short notice due to new or changing restrictions. The authors of the study also suggest a bursary of Â£1,000 a month for arts workers who have not been able to benefit from other job support schemes. Northern Irish artists could also be commissioned to create new public art, the UUEPC report said. A number ofemergency funding schemes for arts and heritagehave been opened by the Department for Communities. The Northern Ireland executive received Â£33m from Westminster in Julyas part of a UK-wide support package for arts and culture.

"This video can not be played Testing is due to start in two weeks according to the port's owners Hauliers have claimed there will be ""mayhem"" at Holyhead port when the Brexit transition period ends. Holyhead is the second biggest ""roll-on roll-off"" port in the UK after Dover, carrying 1,200 lorries and trailers a day across the Irish Sea. The Irish Road Haulage Association (IRHA) said the first six months of 2021 would be ""terrible"" as the port is not ready to cope with the change. But the port's owner, Stena Line, has said the process would be smooth. The IRHA remain unconvinced as the deadline to agree a new UK-EU deal approaches and the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. It is concerned border-ready pre-boarding IT systems have not been tested for outbound travel. The European Union is planning to enforce border controls on the Irish side from 1 January but inbound lorries into Wales will not face any checks by UK authorities until July 2021. ""We're very concerned,"" said IRHA president Eugene Drennan. Eugene Drennan claims there has been no transition ""After the deadline and UK 'Brexiting', the decisions still won't be made. They'll unfold as the problems appear. ""That leads to a certain degree of mayhem. You will have time delay, you'll have a lot of anxious moments. ""You'll have a lot of truck people getting a little hot under the collar. You'll have ferry times delayed and you'll have a general upset. Businesses facing Covid and Brexit 'curveballs' Time 'desperately short' on Brexit Irish Sea trade Ports 'chaos' warning over customs controls ""Even though it's called a transition period, there has been no transition. ""It's a rush now these last few weeks to try and get systems together, to try and get things up and running and though the Irish side has a reasonable degree of preparedness done, some of it is very cumbersome. ""And none of it links up with Her Majesty systems. England and on that side, on the Holyhead side, they're not ready at all."" Ian Davies is confident everything will be ready in time despite the tight schedule Ian Davies, Stena Line's head of UK Port Authorities, said he was confident despite ""very, very tight"" timescales. He said: ""We are live testing in the next two weeks. We're starting to educate our staff on the new checking processes. ""We have always planned on the worst case scenario of 'no deal' because that's the only thing you can base your preparations on and so we are now confident that we are in the right place for that. ""Trader preparation is a big question. That's been hanging over everyone, but I believe that most of the guys now are fully engaged in the process."" ""There should be a clear flow through Holyhead port for inward goods from Ireland."" Stena Line confirmed the decision had been made to develop an inland custom checks facility away from Holyhead port. It is believed those will be sites in Warrington and Birmingham. Anglesey council leader Llinos Medi Huws, who is also a member of the North Wales Economic Ambition Board, has called for any checkpoint to be as close to Holyhead port as possible. ""The main concern we have is the impact that's going to have on the use of this port and the loss of jobs,"" she said. ""So the sooner we have any clarification on that we can make sure that the jobs here are safeguarded and that the people of Holyhead don't have to worry."" Llinos Medi Huws wants to see jobs protected on Anglesey Dr Edward Jones, from Bangor Business School, added: ""We seem to be getting the headache of Brexit here in that we could see parts of the island becoming a car park for the trucks, but we don't seem to be getting any of the benefits of those customs jobs. They seem to be going elsewhere."" There are fears that supply chains could be disrupted if documentation and congestion lead to delays and businesses decide to use alternative routes. A new ferry route has been set up between France and Ireland. Chris Yarsley from Logistics UK, which represents freight businesses, said the automotive manufacturing industry relies on vehicles delivering spare parts with hours to spare. ""Any break in that supply chain will cause manufacturing issues, therefore people will look to other places to source their goods and that could impact on the economic viability of the UK,"" he added. A UK government spokesman said: ""The government is working closely with the devolved administrations and ports, right across the United Kingdom, to plan for the end of the transition period and beyond.

"The Welsh Government had offered support to help development businesses hit by the Covid-19 pandemic The process of applying for a Welsh Government coronavirus grant has been described as ""unfair"" and ""shambolic"" by businesses who tried to access it. The Â£100m available from the third phase of the Economic Resilience Fund (ERF) opened on 28 October but closed the next day. While many firms were still chasing quotes and bank statements at the time, others could apply without them. The Welsh Government said it had worked hard to support businesses. But the Welsh Conservative economy spokesman, Russell George, said businesses had been ""let down by lack of communication; let down by a lack of clarity; let down by the Welsh Labour Government"". While Plaid Cymru's spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones said targeted support was needed for businesses unable to resume trading until the coronavirus pandemic was over. Applicants were allowed 20 minutes to complete the questions on each page and asked to provide supporting documents for their application, including three months of bank statements, proof that they could match-fund 10% of the grant and quotes for work to be carried out. The guidance notes for the application stated the documents were ""required as part of the application process"" and that ""if application forms are sent without the required additional documents, your application will be declined"". Despite this, some businesses were allowed to provide these documents after submitting their application form with an extended cut-off date of 2 November, according to evidence seen by BBC Wales. On 30 October, less than 48 hours after the fund opened, the Welsh Government stated that ""more than 5,500 businesses"" had applied for the grant and it was now""fully subscribed"". One firm said the grant would have allowed them to take employees back on Jamie Williams, who runs North Wales Active in Betws y Coed, missed the grant ""by a few hours"" and said the process was ""shambolic"". After taking a couple of days to gather supporting evidence, Mr Williams thought they would ""fly through"" the process. ""But as we tried to apply for it the next day, it had obviously gone, which is just ridiculous,"" he said. The Â£10,000 grant was ""hugely important"", Mr William added. ""Nobody's booking our activities because either they are in lockdown or we are in lockdown."" Natalie Isaac said two of her restaurants had two different responses Natalie Isaac and her family run five restaurants including two in Cardiff - Assador 44 and Bar 44. Applications were made for both. Bar 44 was turned down for not attaching bank statements, which Ms Issac said they did. But for the other, the business was given an opportunity to submit information to a case officer. ""So that's two establishments with two completely different approaches,"" said Ms Issac, who is contesting the claim regarding Bar 44. ""It should be a fair and reasonable process. We don't believe that everyone's being treated equally."" Ms Isaac said their business was currently ""Â£3.7m down on sales"", with staff numbers across their five restaurants down from 120 to 52 since March. She said some of the staff that were let go could have been brought back had she got the ERF. Tourism 'needs four nations approach to lockdowns' Businesses facing Covid and Brexit 'curveballs' Group of four rule for Welsh pubs after lockdown Kerry DeCaux, who runs Rolfe's florist in Cardiff, was also rejected for not uploading enough supporting documents. ""The application was timed, I wasn't expecting that, I read the guide notes as best as I could as I completed each step, then sent it."" She said she felt ""quite pressurised"", adding: ""I did it the best I could."" Ms DeCaux said when she received the rejection email she asked for ""an opportunity to fix the elements I failed on, but was told there was no appeal process"". ""I honestly felt broken. I sat on the floor of my shop and sobbed my heart out,"" she added. Jim Jones said businesses that did not get support cannot be left in limbo North Wales Tourism surveyed 111 members on their experiences of applying for the Â£100m fund - 44 had managed to make an application and were awaiting an outcome. Of the 67 who had not made an application, 29 referred to a ""very complex process"" and ""time constraints"". The Chief Executive of North Wales Tourism, Jim Jones, said the grant ""did not provide the help that is so desperately needed."" He added firms that did not get the support ""can't just be left in complete limbo"" without help into 2021. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We've worked hard to support businesses through this incredibly difficult year and we've already provided businesses with Â£100m from the third phase of the Economic Resilience Fund since it was launched last month. ""We also ring-fenced funding in third phase for tourism and hospitality businesses. ""This is in addition to the hundreds of millions of pounds provided to firms through the first two phases of the ERF and our Covid-19 business rates based grants."" He said to date, 80% of recipient firms of the ERF, including phases one and two, had been micro businesses accessing support through the digital application process. The Welsh Government said it had launched its eligibility checker three weeks before ERF3 ""to give businesses plenty of time to prepare their applications"" and asked them to provide necessary supporting documentation ""to ensure necessary due diligence"". ""We recognise that some businesses missed out on this round of funding and we are exploring options for how we might allocate any future support,"" the spokesman added. He said the finance minister had set aside funding for a fourth phase of the ERF and was currently developing proposals.

"Call the Midwife filmed its Christmas special under coronavirus restrictions Doctor Who, Call the Midwife and Mrs Brown's Boys are among the shows that will be in this year's Christmas TV schedule, the BBC has revealed. It has been ""a real struggle"" to make the usual range of festive shows during Covid, the BBC's Charlotte Moore said. But, she added, the stars and crews ""pulled out all the stops"". ""Some of the big talent and the production teams have rallied together, and we feel it's really important to have a good Christmas."" The Vicar of Dibley will return in three 10-minute lockdown-inspired episodes The BBC's Christmas TV line-up includes special episodesThe Goes Wrong Show,Ghosts,Not Going Out,King Gary,Motherlandand the return ofThe Vicar of Dibley. Miranda Hartwill host a one-off celebrity game show, and there will be Christmas editions of shows ranging fromThe Repair ShopandThe Great British Sewing BeetoThe Hit List,The WallandMortimer & Whitehouse: Gone Fishing. The Goes Wrong Show will tackle the nativity story The vast majority have been filmed under Covid restrictions. ""Trying to work out what we could actually manage to pull off for Christmas... I can't pretend it's been relaxing or without its challenges,"" said Moore, who is the BBC's chief content officer. The Doctor Who Christmas episode was filmed before coronavirus struck. Doctor Who: Revolution of the Daleks, in which John Barrowman returns as Captain Jack Harkness to help the Doctor battle her age-old enemies, was one of the few to have been filmed before coronavirus struck. Executive producer Chris Chibnall promised ""an epic and emotional feature-length episode"". Call the Midwife, another perennial favourite, was among the shows that had to be shot after the first UK lockdown.

"Labour's chief whip has asked ex-party leader Jeremy Corbyn to ""unequivocally"" apologise for saying the scale of anti-Semitism in the party had been ""overstated for political reasons"". Mr Corbyn was suspended from the party following his comments but later readmitted as a member after saying he regretted any ""pain"" caused. But, Sir Keir Starmer blocked Mr Corbyn from returning as a Labour MP. The Labour leader said he would keep the decision under review. The row between the former and current leader was triggered when the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) published a report, saying Labour had broken the law over its handling of anti-Jewish racism complaints by party members . Corbyn lawyers challenge Labour over MP suspension Starmer: Corbyn will not return as Labour MP What does the Labour anti-Semitism report say? In a letter to his former boss, Nick Brown, Labour's chief whip, said Mr Corbyn's response to the report caused ""distress and pain"" to the Jewish community. The chief whip is responsible for organising a party's MPs in Parliament so they vote the way the party wants them to, and can discipline any who do not follow the party line. Mr Brown asked the Islington North MP to ""unequivocally, unambiguously and without reservation apologise for your comments"". He also sought confirmation that Mr Corbyn would remove or edit his response on Facebook - and that he would cooperate fully with the party's efforts to implement the EHRC's recommendations. The tone of Nick Brown's letter suggests that without making an unequivocal apology, Mr Corbyn is unlikely to have the Labour whip restored. But allies of Mr Corbyn have accused the current Labour leader of acting in bad faith. They claim an agreement was reached with party officials and members of Sir Keir's staff that would have seen Mr Corbyn readmitted without an apology. They now fear his suspension could be indefinite, and that the dispute between a former and current leader will end up in the courts. Labour sources deny that any such deal was reached. Following publication of the EHRC report in October Mr Corbyn said he was ""always determined to eliminate all forms of racism"" and insisted his team had ""acted to speed up"" the complaints process. He also said the scale of anti-Semitism within Labour had been ""dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party"". His comments prompted the party to suspend its former leader. Three weeks later Mr Corbyn sought to clarify his words saying: ""To be clear, concerns about anti-Semitism are neither 'exaggerated' nor 'overstated'. ""The point I wished to make was that the vast majority of Labour Party members were and remain committed anti-racists deeply opposed to anti-Semitism."" He was subsequently readmitted to the party as a member; however Sir Keir did not allow him back into the Parliamentary Labour Party - a decisionMr Corbyn's lawyers have challenged. Corbyn lawyers challenge Labour over MP suspension Starmer: Corbyn will not return as Labour MP What does the Labour anti-Semitism report say?

"Nicola Sturgeon says progress is being made in talks on easing Covid rules at Christmas - but does not expect a similar relaxation at Hogmanay. Scotland's first minister said a deal on a UK-wide approach to Christmas would be announced later in the week. She said the plans would need to be ""sensible and careful"" to prevent a fresh wave of new cases in January. And she added: ""I do not expect that we will be announcing any particular relaxation over the new year period."" On Monday night Ms Sturgeon confirmedplans to move Midlothian from level three to level two had been postponeddue to an increase in case numbers. But an improving picture in East Lothian will see the local authority move to level two from 06:00 on Tuesday. Earlier, responding to a question at her daily briefing, the first minister addressed the intense speculation surrounding the festive period. Ms Sturgeon said: ""We can't do everything. The Christmas thing is hard enough. ""Why Christmas and not new year? Well, maybe Christmas is a more important time for the kids. ""I think for most of us, even if we value new year, Christmas is still the time when families are more likely to not have someone on their own. So we can't do everything right now."" This video can not be played FM: No plans to relax restrictions for Hogmanay The easing of rules at Christmas is expected to see ""a small number of households"" allowed to meet up over ""a small number of days"". Talks on the issue were held between ministers from Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the UK government on Saturday. The Cabinet Office said the ministers had endorsed a""shared objective of facilitating some limited additional household bubbling for a small number of days"". The BBC understands that one option under consideration is that three households could be allowed to meet up for five days over the festive period. Seven things that may be different this Christmas What are the Covid regulations where you live? Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been hoping to announce arrangements for the Christmas period on Monday, but this has been delayed until at least Tuesday to allow the Scottish and Welsh cabinets to agree the plans. Any announcement is also expected to include rules on travelling between nations. Ms Sturgeon said talks were ""making progress"", but stressed that ""details of this approach are still to be finalised"". Edinburgh's traditional Hogmanay street party has been cancelled this year She said: ""This is a particularly difficult balance to strike. If my email inbox is anything to go by, public opinion on this is quite mixed, as you would perhaps expect. ""There is an obvious desire to see loved ones at Christmas, but there is also a lot of anxiety about the potential risks associated with that - particularly at a time when we are perhaps starting to see the end of this pandemic loom on the horizon."" The first minister said the deal would likely see ""some households able to form slightly larger bubbles over a short period"". However, she said this ""has to be on a very limited basis"" - focusing on gatherings in people's homes rather than in hospitality settings. Experts have raised concerns about relaxing restrictions over Christmas Ms Sturgeon said isolation and loneliness could ""hit people particularly hard over the Christmas period"". But she said people should ""think very carefully"" about whether they need to travel or meet up indoors. She added: ""The virus won't take Christmas off. If you provide it with opportunities to spread from household to household, it will take them. ""Just because you might be able to mix a bit more doesn't mean you have to do that if you don't think it's necessary, or if you can get though Christmas without it."" Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, told BBC Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that she was against restrictions being eased ""simply because it's Christmas"". She added: ""It certainly sounds as if that it's a trade-off - that you behave now, keep transmission low, then we might be able to do something over Christmas that resembles something familiar to us. ""The best Christmas present we can give to people is to keep them safe - it really is the bottom line. ""The best way to keep safe is to try and avoid the risk as much as possible and if you must meet family, which most of us are longing to do, try to do it outdoors if you possibly can - and fingers crossed we get a dry and less windy and wet Christmas time."" Ministers are considering allowing some household mixing over Christmas Last month John Keenan, the bishop of Paisley, called for aChristmas ""truce"" - a 24-hour lifting of restrictions- to give people a ""moment of joy in the midst of so much despair"". Reacting to news of the four-nations discussions, he told BBC Scotland he was glad politicians were considering some way of accommodating Christmas during the pandemic. But he admitted he was ""conflicted"". ""The thought of my mum - who's a widow - being on her own all through Christmas day is an awful thought for me,"" he said. ""On the other hand the thought that I might go there and pass on a virus to her is equally awful so I think we're all conflicted about it. "" LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"People arriving in England from abroad will be soon able to reduce their quarantine by more than half if they pay for a Covid test after five days, the transport secretary has announced. The rules will come into force from 15 December and the tests from private firms will cost between Â£65 and Â£120. Grant Shapps said the scheme would ""bolster international travel while keeping the public safe"". The travel industry welcomed the policy but described it as ""long overdue"". It follows Boris Johnson's announcement thatEngland will come under ""toughened"" three-tiered regional restrictionswhen the lockdown ends on 2 December. Under the new travel rules, passengers who arrive from a foreign destination not on the government's travel corridors list will still need to enter self-isolation. However, if they pay for a test after five days and it comes back negative, they will no longer need to self-isolate. Results will normally be issued in 24 to 48 hours. This means people could be released from quarantine six days after arrival. Mr Shapps said: ""Our new testing strategy will allow us to travel more freely, see loved ones and drive international business. By giving people the choice to test on day five, we are also supporting the travel industry as it continues to rebuild out of the pandemic."" Who has to quarantine when arriving in the UK? Can I take a winter holiday after lockdown? Scotland and Northern Ireland are considering a similar scheme while Wales said it was ""supportive in principle of the proposals for a Test and Release scheme"". A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We will need to consider the data and evidence underpinning this scheme before making any decisions on changing international travel restrictions in Wales."" Scotland said it was working with the main commercial airports in Scotland and clinical advisers to understand the risks and benefits of the scheme as well as the capacity of private sector labs to conduct testing to a minimum standard. A spokesperson added: ""It is important that any travellers arriving in the UK understand, and respect, the different restrictions in place in the different nations."" That means that if someone is flying into England but their final destination is an address in Scotland, it would not be possible for passengers to take the test in England. Northern Ireland's Department of Health said: ""Consideration is currently being given to the implementation of testing scheme which could potentially allow those who have arrived in Northern Ireland from a non-exempt country to end their self-isolation following receipt of a negative test, which would be privately provided."" A step in the right direction - that's how airlines are describing the government's decision to ease the quarantine regime. The industry is in survival mode, desperate for money so anything that could open up routes and bring in much-needed cash is being welcomed. And this does raise the prospect of Christmas holiday ticket sales. But they say the new plan is still far from perfect. Passengers will still have to go into quarantine, and realistically, a test on day five is still likely to leave them in isolation for the best part of a week in total, as they wait for the results to come through. There's also the cost. The test has to be done privately, and typical prices range from Â£100-150. For a family of four, for example, that's a sizeable extra chunk on the cost of a winter holiday. What airlines are calling for is something more radical. They want a pre-departure testing regime, or a system of quick, regular and cheap tests - which would allow quarantine to be avoided altogether, until a vaccine is ready. But they say this announcement means there is, at least, some light at the end of the tunnel. This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, the industry association representing UK-registered carriers, said the announcement provided ""light at the end of the tunnel"" for the aviation industry and people wanting to go on holiday. He predicted demand for air travel will ""tentatively return"" following the decision but said a pre-departure testing regime that can completely remove the need to self-isolate is ""the only way we're going to comprehensively reopen the market"". Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme quarantine for arrivals was a ""fig leaf that doesn't work"" and that testing for travellers coming to England should happen before departure, rather than after arrival. He also ruled out requiring proof of vaccination for passengers on short-haul routes after Australian carrier Qantassaid it would require it for travellers. Mike and Lucy Hansford When Mike Hansford, 27, travels to the Canary Islands for Christmas next month, he and his family will already have paid a private company Â£120 each for a Covid test. The Spanish island insists that visitors produce a negative Covid test done within the previous 72 hours when they reach its shores. ""We have looked into the NHS's service,"" said Mr Hansford. ""However, what we were explicitly told by the Foreign Office was: 'Do not go to the NHS for your Covid test. You must have one done privately'."" Mr Hansford, who is travelling with his wife Lucy, her parents and two friends, said he assumed they were told to go private to keep tests free for people who are not well, as well as guaranteeing the results arrive in time. On the way back, Mr Hansford said it was highly unlikely he and his wife would pay a further Â£120 for another private test as both work from home and are happy to quarantine for 14 days. ""But I'm not sure how my friends who I'm travelling with will feel,"" he said. ""One of them is a builder and a carpenter by trade so I think it is safe to say he'd rather probably avoid a two-week quarantine."" SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

"As president of the United States, Donald Trump enjoyed unique protection from legal action, be it criminal or civil. Now, after losing the 2020 presidential election, Mr Trump will soon become a private citizen again. That means he will lose his presidential privileges, putting him in the crosshairs of litigators and prosecutors. ""Once he is out of office, the atmosphere will change,"" Daniel R Alonso, a former US federal and New York state prosecutor, told the BBC. ""He will no longer have the reality or the threat of presidential power to thwart investigations."" A wide-ranging criminal investigation in New York is the most serious legal concern for Mr Trump and his real-estate company, the Trump Organization. On top of that, there is an array of lawsuits ranging from allegations of fraud by a family member to sexual harassment by an advice columnist. A legal storm is brewing. Here, we consider how the six biggest legal battles may develop. What we know:Playboy model Karen McDougal, adult film actress Stormy Daniels and claims of a conspiracy of silence. This was the gist of the so-called hush-money scandal. Both women said they had had sexual relationships with Mr Trump and had received payments to keep them quiet, ahead of the 2016 presidential election. When they spoke out in 2018, they threw political dynamite under Mr Trump's presidency, lighting the fuse of two criminal investigations. Stormy Daniels, real name Stephanie Clifford, says she had sex with Mr Trump in 2006 The first focused on violations of federal, or national, laws and the role of Michael Cohen, Mr Trump's former personal lawyer and ""fixer"". Under investigation, Cohen admitted to arranging payments to the two women. The payments were prosecuted as campaign-finance violations and Cohen was sentenced to three years in jail in 2018. This video can not be played Five things Cohen said about Trump Cohen alleged that Mr Trump had ""directed"" him to make the payments, yet no charges were brought against the president. Why? Firstly, to charge Mr Trump, prosecutors would have needed to prove that he had indeed directed Cohen to make those payments. Secondly, even if prosecutors did have sufficient evidence, it is against US government policy to indict a sitting president on federal criminal charges, legal experts say. Case closed, right? Well, not exactly. This is where it gets technical. Karen McDougal apologised to Melania Trump for the affair she says she had with her husband Put simply, a second criminal investigation into the payments is still under way in New York. We know that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance is examining whether the Trump Organization falsified business records related to the payoffs. What we don't know is whether Mr Vance has any evidence to file criminal charges. That matters. What might happen next:Falsifying business records is a misdemeanour under New York law. A misdemeanour is a minor crime that can be punishable by a jail term of up to a year. Now, here's the tricky part for Mr Vance. Trump accused of directing hush money Will Trump remain bulletproof after Cohen? There is a two-year time limit for filing criminal charges for a misdemeanour in New York. ""So, because those payments happened over two years ago, it looks like [prosecutors] are out of luck,"" Mr Alonso said. That said, there are other possibilities. Cyrus Vance has been leading a criminal investigation into the Trump Organization since 2018 In New York, falsifying business records can be charged as a felony if it is done to conceal other crimes, such as tax fraud. Felonies are more serious crimes that can be prosecuted over a longer period and are punishable by tougher jail sentences. Still, the route to prosecution is uncertain. It is not clear if Mr Trump can be prosecuted under New York law for campaign-finance violations - the federal crime Cohen was jailed for. This is where the other strands of Mr Vance's investigation come in. What we know:It's a ""political hit job"", a Trump Organization lawyer said of Mr Vance's inquiry in August 2019. The lawyer's statement was seething. Mr Vance had just issued a request for documents, known as a subpoena. He demanded to see years of financial records, including the Holy Grail - Mr Trump's tax returns, eight years of them. This video can not be played Trump describes allegations he avoided taxes as ""fake news"" Since then, Mr Trump has tried to block the subpoena, arguing in courts that it amounts to political harassment. In October, a federal appeals court disagreed, putting his tax returns within touching distance of prosecutors. Indeed, Mr Vance has stressed the significance of Mr Trump's tax returns in court papers. When requesting the returns in August, Mr Vance referred to ""public reports of possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization"", including allegations of possible insurance and bank fraud. Another court filing in September mentioned tax fraud as a hypothetical crime that could be established, should evidence be found to support it. In New York, some types of tax fraud can be charged as felonies, which can carry lengthy prison sentences. At the moment, though, the ""public reports"" of possible crimes cited by Mr Vance's office are merely grounds for investigation, nothing else. What might happen next:Mr Trump is expected to appeal against the demand to hand over his tax returns in the Supreme Court. There, the matter may be settled. For Mr Trump, the stakes are high. Can Trump release his tax returns? Trump's taxes: What you need to know ""The most significant criminal investigations are those exploring his tax and bank filings,"" Jonathan Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University, told the BBC. ""But whether there's a criminal case has yet to become evident."" If Mr Vance does obtain Mr Trump's tax returns, a criminal case may or may not become evident. Either way, Mr Vance needs those tax returns to move his investigation forward. What we know:New York Attorney General Letitia James has been another thorn in Mr Trump's side. Since March 2019, Ms James has been leading a civil investigation into whether the Trump Organization committed real-estate fraud. Again, the roots of this investigation lead back to Cohen who, in February 2019, told Congress that Mr Trump had inflated the value of his property assets to secure loans and understated them to reduce his taxes. Michael Cohen, fixer for Mr Trump, was called to testified before the House Oversight Committee in February 2019 Cohen's testimony gave Ms James grounds to seek information about Mr Trump's property empire. Like Mr Vance, Ms James has had to fight for that information in the courts. Eric Trump, the executive vice-president of the Trump Organization and the president's son, has accused her of waging a ""political vendetta"". Despite this, he complied with a request to sit for testimony with her office in October. What might happen next:Ms James needs more testimony and information to take the investigation forward. In office, Mr Trump argued that he was too busy to deal with lawsuits. Now, he cannot use that excuse. Ms James can treat Mr Trump with less deference, pressing him to sit for questioning under oath, just like his son. Letitia James has taken testimony from Mr Trump's son, Eric ""Most courts would be very indulgent with a president-defendant on things like scheduling, for instance. Not so with a private citizen,"" Mr Alonso said. Civil investigations like this can result in financial penalties, if evidence of wrongdoing is found. If it is, another criminal inquiry cannot be ruled out. What we know:Emolument is an archaic word that is seldom used today, except in legal contexts. The definition is contested, but it is generally understood to mean gain, profit or advantage from employment or holding public office. So what does this have to do with Mr Trump? He has been accused of breaking rules against ""emoluments"" during his presidency. These rules, known as the emoluments clauses, were written into the country's bedrock legal text, the US Constitution. Mr Trump's hotel in Washington was often the site of protests during his presidency One clause requires all federal officials, including the president, to seek the consent of Congress before accepting any benefits from foreign states. Three separate civil lawsuits alleged that Mr Trump had not sought that consent. One cited the hosting of foreign officials at the Trump International Hotel in Washington DC as a possible violation. Mr Trump has derided ""this phony emoluments clause"", suggesting other sitting presidents have made money. What might happen next:Regardless, the emoluments lawsuits will probably be dismissed or dropped, legal experts say. One brought by congressional Democrats has already been rejected by the Supreme Court. ""Emoluments are not likely to be the basis of any criminal action,"" said Mr Turley, an expert on constitutional law. ""The emoluments cases relate to Trump holding office, so once he leaves office, the controversy becomes largely academic."" What we know:Mr Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women whose allegations span decades. Mr Trump has denied all the allegations, dismissing them as ""fake news"", political smears and conspiracies. What are the sexual allegations against Trump? Many of the accusers came forward ahead of Mr Trump's election win in 2016. Mr Trump vowed to sue them all but, as yet, has not done so. Instead, some of the accusers have sued Mr Trump. Two of those women have filed defamation lawsuits against Mr Trump for calling them liars. E Jean Carroll has accused Mr Trump of raping her in the 1990s E Jean Carroll, a long-time columnist for Elle magazine, is one of them. She has accused Mr Trump of raping her in a dressing room at a luxury Manhattan department store in the 1990s. Mr Trump denies it and is contesting the defamation claim. In her lawsuit, Ms Carroll argues Mr Trump defamed her by saying he could not have raped her because ""she's not my type"". Her lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and a retraction of Mr Trump's statements. Ms Carroll v Mr Trump seemed straightforward enough until September, when the US Department of Justice weighed in. This video can not be played Jessica Leeds, one of Mr Trump's accusers, has demanded action The department took the unusual step of trying to replace Mr Trump with the United States as a defendant in the case. In the end, a federal judge ruled against the department's intervention, arguing ""the allegations have no relationship to the official business of the United States"". What might happen next:The case can now proceed, allowing Ms Carroll's lawyers to gather evidence. For example, they could press on by attempting to verify if Mr Trump's DNA is on a dress Ms Carroll says she was wearing at the time of the alleged assault. For that, they would need a DNA sample from Mr Trump. A similar but separate defamation lawsuit filed by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Mr Trump's television show The Apprentice, may go the same way. Summer Zervos (left) was one of several women to accuse Mr Trump of sexual misconduct ahead of the 2016 election Ms Zervos alleged that Mr Trump had sexually assaulted her during a meeting to discuss job opportunities at a Beverly Hills hotel in 2007. Mr Trump dismissed the allegation as ""phony"", accusing Ms Zervos of fabricating it for fame. Ms Zervos then sued him for defamation in 2017, seeking damages of at least $3,000. Mr Trump tried to get the case dismissed during his presidency. His lawyers suggested that, as president, he should be immune to lawsuits in state courts. ""That argument completely evaporates on 20 January,"" Barbara L McQuade, professor of law at the University of Michigan, told the BBC. ""Once that happens, we move to the discovery phase of the case and there could be some movement there."" What we know:""Fraud was not just the family business - it was a way of life,"" reads the first line of Mary Trump's lawsuit against her uncle Donald. As an opening salvo, it could hardly be more contemptuous. It mirrors the animosity of Ms Trump's newly released memoir, in which she chastises her uncle as a ""narcissist"" who threatens the life of every American. In her book, Mary Trump calls her uncle the ""the world's most dangerous man"" The family beef is as personal as it gets and Ms Trump's lawsuit, filed in September, reflects that acrimony. In it, she accuses Mr Trump and two of his siblings of cheating her out of an inheritance while pressuring her to give up interests in the family business. Mary Trump and the most shocking family secrets Ms Trump inherited valuable interests in the family business when Fred Trump Jr - her father and the president's older brother - died in 1981 at the age of 42. Ms Trump was 16 at the time. Mr Trump and his siblings ""committed to watch over"" Ms Trump's interests, the lawsuit says. ""They lied,"" the lawsuit says. ""Rather than protect Mary's interests, they designed and carried out a complex scheme to siphon funds away from her interests, conceal their grift [fraud], and deceive her about the true value of what she had inherited."" The lawsuit seeks at least $500,000 in damages. What might happen next:The White House said Ms Trump's book was full of ""falsehoods"", but Mr Trump is yet to reply to the lawsuit. If requests for documents and testimony come, Mr Trump cannot cite his presidential duties as a reason to deny them. No American citizen, not even the president, is categorically above the law.

"Ambassador Greenfield-Thomas pictured with Tanzania's former president in 2014 The three people chosen by US President-elect Joe Biden to lead his foreign policy team will bring decades of diplomatic experience to the White House, but they also face criticism from those who object to the baggage that comes along with years of serving the US government. Here's a little on who they are and then what the experts say about the message Mr Biden is sending with his choice of top US diplomats. The three people who will be advising Mr Biden on issues beyond America's borders are not well known beyond Washington. Antony Blinken, Linda Thomas-Greenfield and Jake Sullivan are all alumni of the Barack Obama White House, and are considered Biden loyalists and foreign policy centrists. Mr Blinken, 58 - whose work with Mr Biden goes back nearly 20 years - has been picked to serve as secretary of state, the nation's top diplomat. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, one of the most high-profile black female US diplomats who worked for years on African affairs, has been nominated to serve as US Ambassador to the United Nations. Jake Sullivan is a former state department official and Hillary Clinton aide who played a key role in negotiating the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal. He served as Mr Biden's national security adviser when he was vice-president. How will Biden change US foreign policy? Mr Blinken's work with Mr Biden dates back to his tenure on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as a Delaware lawmaker. Some critics have blamed him for Mr Biden's vote to invade Iraq in 2003. That personal connection will serve the team well, say several former US diplomats, but it could also mean a lack of diversity in opinion. And their wealth of Washington experience as foreign policy veterans will not endear them to all. It does, however, mark a break with Trump's war on the so-called ""deep state"" - individuals in government he regarded as working against his own agenda. This is not a team of rivals. While they have a history of working well together, they will also bring complementary perspectives to the Situation Room, with hands-on experience in global conflicts. The value of strategic coherence will outweigh any potential for groupthink. They are not card-carrying members of a deep state, but will help lead a more effective American state focused on shared interests and values. They are pragmatists, not ideologues.PJ Crowley, former US assistant secretary of state The appointments represent a return to normalcy and an end to an erratic approach to policy. But the question is whether a return to normalcy is enough. This team has a belief in American supremacy which could lead them to recklessness in their use of American military power.Andrew Bacevich, president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft As a longtime foreign service officer, Mrs Thomas-Greenfield in particular, represents the ""deep state"" that Donald Trump was so dismissive of. For Donald Trump, foreign service officers were the foot soldiers of the liberal internationalism that he wanted to take down. This is partly the reason for why morale is so low at the State Department right now.Charles Kupchan, former member of the White House National Security Council Jake Sullivan consults with former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during a congressional hearing Top of the agenda for the Biden team will be re-joining organisations, alliances and treaties that Mr Trump worked to weaken or dissolve over the past four years. They will be tasked with bringing the US back into the Paris climate agreement and keeping the US in the World Health Organization. They will also seek to revise the Iran nuclear deal, bolster ties with Nato and seek trade agreements as a means to counter China's rising influence. One of the reasons that Trump was elected was because a large number of Americans judged American foreign policy as having failed. The question is whether this team has learned enough to bring about the changes that we actually need including reducing the military budget and greater restraint in the use of military forces.Andrew Bacevich Donald Trump never really built a national security team. Instead, he played the Lone Ranger while surrounding himself with independent contractors he could hire and fire by tweet. All three of these officials have served at the Department of State and will place renewed value on international diplomacy and collaboration to solve urgent challenges from the global pandemic to climate change to the China challenge.PJ Crowley A big challenge is going to be persuading foreign audiences, even partners and allies, that the US is credible in terms of its staying power - that ""America is back"" as the president-elect has said. This will be the second 180-degree shift in foreign policy in the past four years. The incoming administration has a determination to restore the frayed alliances that the US has relied on for more than seven decades. But they have their work cut out for them.Stewart Patrick, Council on Foreign Relations director of the International Institutions and Global Governance programme Blinken (centre left) participates in a White House presidential briefing Most experts agree that the team Mr Biden is putting in place is more experienced than those appointed by Mr Trump, such as his first Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was a former Exxon Mobil executive. But Mr Trump's legacy at the State Department - which has seen scores of disillusioned diplomats retire early under Mr Tillerson and his replacement Mike Pompeo - run deep and cannot be swiftly overdone overnight. There has been a significant departure of expertise and experience under both Tillerson and Pompeo. The foreign service bureaucracy has felt generally out of the loop. Normally policy comes up from below, and is filtered through several agencies before reaching the president. That has not been happening under Trump.Charles Kupchan They have a consistent world view. They are strong believers in American leadership and international alliances. All three have served at the Department of State and will place renewed value on international diplomacy and collaboration to solve urgent challenges from the global pandemic to climate change to the China challenge.PJ Crowley Reporting by Tara McKelvey and Max Matza Read more: John Kerry named as Biden's 'climate tsar' Biden to pick 'first US female treasury secretary' How will Biden change US foreign policy?

"Biden's choice of Kamala Harris as a running mate, helped keep centrist voters on-side After nearly 50 years in public office, and a lifetime of presidential ambitions, Joe Biden has captured the White House. It was not the campaign anyone predicted. It took place amidst a once-in-a-century pandemic and unprecedented social unrest. He was running against an unconventional, precedent-defying incumbent. But in his third try for the presidency, Biden and his team found a way to navigate the political obstacles and claim a victory that, while narrow in the electoral college tally, is projected to surpass Trump's overall national total by millions of votes. Latest updates and analysis US election results in maps and charts Why Donald Trump lost These are the five reasons the son of a car salesman from Delaware finally won the presidency. Perhaps the biggest reason Biden won the presidency was something entirely out of his control. The coronavirus pandemic, as well as claiming more than 230,000 lives, also transformed American life and politics in 2020. And in the final days of the general election campaign, Donald Trump himself seemed to acknowledge this. ""With the fake news, everything is Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid,"" the president said at a rally last week in Wisconsin, where cases have spiked in recent days. The media focus on Covid, however, was a reflection rather than a driver of the public's concern about the pandemic - which translated into unfavourable polling on the president's handling of the crisis. A poll last month by Pew Research, suggested Biden held a 17 percentage point lead over Trump when it came to confidence about their handling of the Covid outbreak. This video can not be played How much is Covid-19 an election issue? The pandemic and the subsequent economic decline knocked Trump off his preferred campaign message of growth and prosperity. It also highlighted concerns that many Americans had about his presidency, over its occasional lack of focus, penchant for questioning science, haphazard handling of policies large and small, and prioritisation of the partisan. The pandemic was a lead weight on Trump's approval ratings, which,according to Gallup, dipped to 38% at one point,externalin the summer - one that the Biden campaign exploited. Over the course of his political career, Biden established a well-earned reputation for talking himself into trouble. His propensity for gaffes derailed his first presidential campaign in 1987, and helped ensure that he never had much of a shot when he ran again in 2007. Joe Biden - 40 years of political ambition In his third try for the Oval Office, Biden still had his share of verbal stumbles, but they were sufficiently infrequent that they never became more than a short-term issue. Part of the explanation for this, of course, is that the president himself was an unrelenting source of news cycle churn. Another factor was that there were bigger stories - the coronavirus pandemic, protests after the death of George Floyd and economic disruption - dominating national attention. This video can not be played A tale of two rallies: Trump and Biden stage duelling events in Florida But at least some credit should be given to a concerted strategy by the Biden campaign to limit their candidate's exposure, keeping a measured pace in the campaign, and minimising the chances that fatigue or carelessness could create problems. Perhaps in a normal election, when most Americans weren't worried about limiting their own exposure to a virus, this strategy would have backfired. Maybe then Trump's derisive ""hidin' Biden"" jabs would have taken their toll. The campaign sought to stay out of the way and let Trump be the one whose mouth betrayed him - and, in the end, it paid off. The week before election day, the Biden campaign unveiled its final television adverts with a message that was remarkably similar to the one offered in his campaign kickoff last year, and his nomination acceptance speech in August. The election was a ""battle for the soul of America"", he said, and a chance for the national to put what he characterised as the divisiveness and chaos of the past four years behind it. The election became a referendum on Trump Beneath that slogan, however, was a simple calculation. Biden bet his political fortunes on the contention that Trump was too polarising and too inflammatory, and what the American people wanted was calmer, steadier leadership. ""I'm just exhausted by Trump's attitude as a person,"" says Thierry Adams, a native of France who after 18 years living in Florida cast his first vote in a presidential election in Miami last week. Democrats succeeded in making this election a referendum on Trump, not a binary choice between the two candidates. Biden's winning message was simply that he was ""not Trump"". A common refrain from Democrats was that a Biden victory meant Americans could go for weeks without thinking about politics. It was meant as a joke, but it contained a kernel of truth. During the campaign to be the Democratic candidate, Biden's competition came from his left, with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren who ran well-financed and organised campaigns that generated rock-concert sized crowds. Despite this pressure from his liberal flank, Biden stuck with a centrist strategy, refusing to back universal government-run healthcare, free college education, or a wealth tax. This allowed him maximise his appeal to moderates and disaffected Republicans during the general election campaign. This strategy was reflected in Biden's choice of Kamala Harris as his running mate when he could have opted for someone with stronger support from the party's left wing. This video can not be played Biden was not first choice for most young Democrats, but he listened to their priorities The one place where Biden moved closer to Sanders and Warren was on the environment and climate-change - perhaps calculating that the benefits of appealing to younger voters for whom the issue is a priority was worth the risk of alienating voters in energy-dependent swing-state industries. It was the exception, however, that proved the rule. ""It's no secret that we've been critical of Vice-President's Biden's plans and commitments in the past,"" said Varshini Prakash, co-founder of the environmental activist group the Sunrise Movement in July. ""He's responded to many of those criticisms: dramatically increasing the scale and urgency of investments, filling in details on how he'd achieve environmental justice and create good union jobs, and promising immediate action."" Earlier this year, Biden's campaign coffers were running on empty. He entered the general election campaign at a decided disadvantage to Trump, who had spent virtually his entire presidency amassing a campaign war chest that approached a billion dollars. From April onward, however, the Biden campaign transformed itself into a fundraising juggernaut, and - in part because of profligacy on the part of the Trump campaign - ended up in a much stronger financial position than his opponent. At the beginning of October, the Biden campaign had $144m more cash on hand than the Trump operation, allowing it to bury the Republicans in a torrent of television advertising in almost every key battleground state. A Biden supporter in Texas, where a cash advantage enabled him to spend campaign money Money isn't everything, of course. Four years ago, the Clinton campaign had a sizeable monetary lead over Trump's shoestring operation. But in 2020, when in-person campaigning was curtailed by coronavirus and Americans across the country spent considerably more time consuming media in their homes, Biden's cash advantage let him reach voters and push his message out until the very end. It allowed him to expand the electoral map, putting money into what once seemed to be longshot states like Texas, Georgia, Ohio and Iowa. Most of those bets didn't pay off, but he put Trump on the defence, flipping what was once reliably conservative Arizona and staying highly competitive in Georgia. Money gives a campaign options and initiative - and Biden put his advantage to good use. What happens now?

"This video can not be played Watch the moment the Chang'e-5 mission launches China has launched a mission to try to retrieve rock samples from the Moon. Its robotic Chang'e-5 spacecraft departed the Wenchang launch complex on a Long March 5 rocket early on Tuesday morning local time, and if successful should return to Earth in mid-December. It's more than 40 years since the Americans and the Soviets brought home lunar rock and ""soil"" for analysis. China aims to be only the third country to achieve this feat, which will be an extremely complex endeavour. It's a multi-step process that involves an orbiter, a lander-ascender and finally a return component that uses a capsule to survive a fast and hot entry into Earth's atmosphere at the end of the mission. But confidence should be high after a series of well-executed lunar missions that started just over a decade ago with a couple satellites. These were followed up by lander-rover combinations - with the most recent, Chang'e-4, making a soft touch down on the Moon's farside, something no spacefaring nation had previously accomplished. Nasa's new 'megarocket' set for critical tests Water on the Moon could sustain a lunar base Artemis: To the Moon and Beyond A moment of joy for the Chang'e-5 launch team as the mission gets under way Chang'e-5 is going to target a nearside location called Mons RÃ¼mker, a high volcanic complex in a region known as Oceanus Procellarum. The rocks in this location are thought to be very young compared with those sampled by the US Apollo astronauts and the Soviet Luna robots - something like perhaps 1.3 billion years old versus the 3-4-billion-year-old rocks picked up on those earlier missions. This will give scientists another data point for the method they use to age events in the inner Solar System. Essentially, researchers count craters - the older the surface, the more craters it has; the younger the surface, the fewer it has. ""The Moon is the chronometer of the Solar System, as far as we're concerned,"" explained Dr Neil Bowles at Oxford University. ""The samples returned by the Apollo and Luna missions came from known locations and were dated radiometrically very accurately, and we've been able to tie that information to the cratering rate and extrapolate ages to other surfaces in the Solar System."" Artwork: This mission is the next step up in complexity The new Chang'e-5 samples should also improve our understanding of the Moon's volcanic history, said Dr Katie Joy from the University of Manchester. ""The mission is being sent to an area where we know there were volcanoes erupting in the past. We want to know precisely when that was,"" she told BBC News. ""This will tells us about the Moon's magmatic and thermal history through time, and from that we can start to answer questions more widely about when volcanism and magmatism was occurring on all of the inner Solar System planets, and why the Moon could have run out of energy to produce volcanoes earlier than some of those other bodies."" The Chang'e-4 mission touched down on the Moon's farside When Chang'e-5 arrives at the Moon it will go into orbit. A lander will then detach and make a powered descent. Once down, instruments will characterise the surroundings before scooping up some surface material. The lander has the capacity also to drill into the soil, or regolith. An ascent vehicle will carry the samples back up to rendezvous with the orbiter. It's at this stage that a complicated transfer must be undertaken, packaging the rock and soil into a capsule for despatch back to Earth. A shepherding craft will direct the capsule to enter the atmosphere over Inner Mongolia. Every phase is difficult, but the architecture will be very familiar - it's very similar to how human missions to the Moon were conducted in the 1960/70s. China is building towards that goal. ""You can certainly see the analogy between what's being done on the Chang'e-5 mission - in terms of the different elements and their interaction with each other - and what would be required for a human mission,"" said Dr James Carpenter, exploration science coordinator for human and robotic exploration at the European Space Agency. ""We're seeing right now an extraordinary expansion in lunar activity. We've got the US-led Artemis programme (to return astronauts to the Moon) and the partnerships around that; the Chinese with their very ambitious exploration programme; but also many more new actors as well.""

"Students in England will be urged to take two Covid tests three days apart, to cut the risk of spreading infection when they travel home for Christmas. These are lateral flow tests with rapid results - with those testing negative expected to leave university within the following 24 hours, according to the latest guidelines seen by the BBC. The pre-Christmas testing will start in many universities early next week. But testing will remain voluntary - and not all universities will offer tests. The National Union of Students said there should be capacity for all students who wanted a test to get one before Christmas. More than a million students in England will leave their university addresses to spend the Christmas holidays in another part of the country - and plans for testing are intended to stop this migration from spreading coronavirus. Testing for Christmas holidays to start from 30 November Universities to oversee exodus of students at end of term Rapid mass testing plan to get students home at Christmas It is understood that most universities, but not all, are taking part in the government's plans for the mass testing of students using lateral flow tests, starting on 30 November. Students will be encouraged to take two tests Durham University, which has piloted testing, says about 2,000 students have already booked tests ahead of the Christmas departures. The government guidelines recommend a double test to increase accuracy, three days apart, in the form of swab tests administered by the students themselves, at centres being set up by universities. The results will be sent by text or email - with students who are not infected expected to leave their term-time accommodation ""immediately"", which is defined as within 24 hours of the second negative test. Getting students to leave soon after they get results is intended to cut the risk of infections post-testing. ""The closer to your travel time the better,"" says Professor Jacqui Ramagge, who is leading on testing for Durham University. And at her university, the two tests will be seven days apart rather than three. Ministers are urging students to take Covid tests before travelling, as a way of protecting their families, but it is not compulsory and not all universities will offer the testing. Those who do not take tests, or only have one test, will still be able to leave at the same time - with an encouragement to ""travel home as safely as possible"" during the ""travel window"" of 3 to 9 December, which the government has identified as when it expects most students to leave university for Christmas. This will be after the current lockdown ends on 2 December, and ahead of universities switching to online teaching for the end of term. Students who test positive will be directed towards taking another type of test - a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test to confirm whether they are infected - and will have to stay and self-isolate while waiting for the result. But those who test positive from this PCR test will be required to stay in their term-time accommodation for 10 days of self-isolation - which should still leave enough time to get back before Christmas. The ""window"" for students to travel home begins from 3 December Teesside University is among those opening testing centres from 30 November - and is encouraging students to book for two lateral flow tests at its Middlesbrough campus. Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Mark Simpson said it would provide a ""quick and easy testing option to our students and enable them to make an informed decision about returning home for the upcoming Christmas break"". He said it would help to address the ""considerable anxiety and a need for reassurance"" about the safety of travel ahead of the end of term. Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said: ""Testing will offer further assurances that students can keep their families safe this winter, and I urge all students who can to take the tests on offer."" â¨ Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Joe Biden has been elected America's 46th president ""Today's decision is a needed step to begin tackling the challenges facing our nation, including getting the pandemic under control and our economy back on track,"" a team statement said. Earlier, Mr Biden unveiled his nominations for his foreign policy and national security team, consisting of old colleagues from his years in the Obama administration. He is set to appoint Anthony Blinken as secretary of state and John Kerry as climate envoy, while Janet Yellen is tipped to be the first female US treasury secretary. The list of selections came ahead of a formal announcement Tuesday. Most of the appointments will require Senate confirmation. Mr Trump tweeted as the GSA, which is tasked with formally beginning presidential changeovers, informed the Biden camp that it would start the transition process. GSA administrator Emily Murphy said she was making $6.3m (Â£4.7m) in funds available to the president-elect. Mr Trump said: ""In the best interest of our Country, I am recommending that Emily and her team do what needs to be done,externalwith regard to initial protocols, and have told my team to do the same."" He did not concede, however, and went on to repeat unsubstantiated claims of corruption, pledging to keep up the ""good fight"". It is worth noting that Mr Trump does not have to concede for Mr Biden to be sworn in as the 46th US president. GSA chief Emily Murphy wrote in a letter to Mr Biden on Monday that he could begin to prepare to take the reins of power Ms Murphy, a Trump appointee, cited ""recent developments involving legal challenges and certifications of election results"" in her decision to start the transition process. She said she had received no pressure from the White House over the timing of the move. ""I did, however, receive threats online, by phone, and by mail directed at my safety, my family, my staff, and even my pets in an effort to coerce me into making this determination prematurely,"" Ms Murphy said in a letter to Mr Biden. ""Even in the face of thousands of threats I have remained committed to upholding the law."" She had faced criticism from both political sides for failing to begin the transition process sooner, usually a routine step between the election and the inauguration. Although most of Mr Trump's fellow Republicans have united behind his refusal to accept defeat until now, some have increasingly been breaking rank. Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander, who is retiring, said the president should ""put the country first"" and help Mr Biden succeed.

More than 160 business leaders had also urged Ms Murphy in an open letter to immediately recognise Mr Biden as president-elect. ""Withholding resources and vital information from an incoming administration puts the public and economic health and security of America at risk,â³ they wrote. Michigan is the latest hotly contested state to certify its election result, despite disputes from Mr Trump's campaign. Mr Biden won in Michigan by more than 154,000 votes. However, Mr Trump claimed voter fraud swayed the outcome, without offering evidence. The president's Republican allies had called for the certification - which finalises the outcome of a state's popular vote - to be delayed for two weeks to audit ballots in a heavily Democratic county. However, the Michigan Board of State Canvassers voted to certify the result on Monday. One of two Republicans on the Michigan State Board of Canvassers joined the two Democrats to finalise the outcome. The other Republican board member, Norman Shinkle, abstained, suggesting delaying the certification over irregularities affecting a few hundred votes in one county.

Mr Trump's legal team said they would still challenge Michigan's results. Mr Trump and his allies have suffered a string of court defeats in key states as they race to challenge the results. InPennsylvania, a Republican judge on Saturday ruled that the Trump campaign had tried to ""disenfranchise almost seven million voters"" with no real evidence. The president's lawyers have appealed now to the Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. The president's other legal efforts in the state have failed to change Mr Biden's lead of some 80,000 votes. The Trump campaign has also called for another recount inGeorgia, after an earlier recount by hand confirmed Mr Biden's win in the state. InWisconsin, a partial recount is under way by request of the Trump campaign. Election officials have accused Trump supporters of obstructing the state's recount of votes. They said observers for Mr Trump were in some cases challenging every single ballot to deliberately slow down proceedings. Who will be the next US president?
