"Brookes viewed the abuse from an online chat room, Bristol Crown Court heard A primary school teacher who watched a live stream of a six-year-old boy being raped has been jailed. Wayne Brookes joined 45 other paedophiles online to watch the abuse being streamed live from America. Bristol Crown Court heard he also used the site to watch a recording of a six-month-old baby being abused. Brookes, 43, from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, admitted four charges of making indecent images of children and was jailed for 20 months. The court heard the former teacher accessed the online chat room after being given a 10-digit code by another paedophile. The rapist who broadcast the attack was arrested in the US in February and jailed for up to 30 years. Brookes, who had worked as a teacher for 10 years, was identified by officers after using a profile named Bear to access the chat room. He was found to have downloaded more than 200 indecent images of children, including dozens in the highest category. Judge Martin Picton said he had kept his interest in young children a secret from his partner, viewing the indecent material ""late at night"". ""One of the pieces of footage depicted the live streaming of a rape of a little boy,"" he added. ""I do give you the benefit of doubt with the issue of whether you understood that you were watching a live event."" The judge said although there was ""no suggestion"" that Brookes accessed indecent images at work or ""offended against any of the children"" in his care, his offences would have caused ""alarm and distress"" at the school where he worked. Defence barrister Virginia Cornwall said Brookes had ""demonstrated remorse and understanding for his criminality"" and was ""a broken man"". Brookes is the second of four men to be sentenced following an investigation into the chat room by the National Crime Agency. Last month, youth workerDarren Williams, 44, was jailed for 11 yearsfor his part in the live stream of the rape. Philip Crabtree, 35, of Newcastle-Under-Lyme, and Christian Johnson Lueking, 36, of Raynes Park, London, are currently awaiting sentencing.

"This video can not be played Rex Tillerson: We don't seek regime change in North Korea The US government is not seeking a regime change in North Korea, the secretary of state says, amid tensions over Pyongyang's weapons programme. ""We're not your enemy,"" Rex Tillerson said, adding that the US wanted a dialogue at some point. But a Republican senator said President Donald Trump had told him there would be a war with North Korea if its missile programme continued. Pyongyang claimed its latest missile could hit the US west coast. The second test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Friday, celebrated by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was the latest to be conducted in defiance of a United Nations ban. ""We do not seek a regime change, we do not seek the collapse of the regime, we do not seek an accelerated reunification of the peninsula, we do not seek an excuse to send our military north of the 38th parallel,"" said Mr Tillerson, referring to the border between the Koreas. ""We're not your enemy, we're not your threat but you're presenting an unacceptable threat to us and we have to respond."" Barbara Plett Usher, US state department correspondent North Korea's recent long-range missile tests have deepened concern about the threat Pyongyang poses to the US mainland, and strengthened determination here to prevent any strike. That's what the president had in mind in his war talk with Senator Lindsey Graham. The Pentagon has updated military options, but at the same time says a confrontation would be catastrophic. In light of that, Mr Tillerson repeated at length that the US wasn't seeking regime change and said the goal was dialogue, but one not based on the assumption that North Korea could keep its nuclear weapons. Pyongyang has categorically refused such terms. The strategy, said Mr Tillerson, is a sustained campaign of peaceful but intensifying economic pressure to change its mind. But given the advances in ballistic technology demonstrated by the recent ICBM tests, there's growing doubt that denuclearisation is a realistic possibility. As always, there are no good options when it comes to North Korea, but less time to pursue them. How the US might defend itself How dangerous are North Korea's missiles? President Trump has repeatedly criticised China, which shares a land border with North Korea and is its closest economic ally, for not doing enough to stop Pyongyang's weapons programme. However, Mr Tillerson took a more diplomatic approach, saying that ""only the North Koreans are to blame for this situation"". ""But,"" he added, ""we do believe China has a special and unique relationship, because of this significant economic activity, to influence the North Korean regime in ways that no one else can."" This video can not be played Why does North Korea want nukes? In a separate development, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said that Mr Trump told him that there would be a military conflict between the two countries if Pyongyang continued with its aim to develop a missile programme with the US in its range. What the outside world can do ""There will be a war with North Korea over their missile programme if they continue to try to hit America with an ICBM,"" Mr Graham said. ""He [Trump] has told me that, I believe him, and if I were China I would believe him too, and do something about it,"" he said in an interview withNBC's Today programme.,external Mr Graham added: ""If there's going to be a war... it will be over there. If thousands die, they're going to die over there. They're not going to die here. And he [Trump] has told me that to my face."" Despite the ongoing tests, most experts believe Pyongyang does not yet have the capability to miniaturise a nuclear warhead, fit it on to a long-range missile, and ensure it is protected until delivery to the target. They say many of North Korea's missiles cannot accurately hit targets. Others, however,believe that,externalat the rate it is going, Pyongyang may overcome these challenges and develop a nuclear weapon within five to 10 years that could strike the US.

"Mr Mackenzie had been the AA's executive chairman since June 2014 The AA has fired its executive chairman, Bob Mackenzie, for ""gross misconduct"", with immediate effect. Its statement,externalgave no further details as to the reasons for his departure, but an AA spokeswoman said it was ""a personal conduct matter"". But Mr Mackenzie's son said his father had ""tendered his resignation this morning... due to acute ill health"". Peter Mackenzie said: ""This is an extremely distressing mental health issue."" He said his father had been suffering symptoms of the ill health ""for some time"". ""A consultant clinical psychologist advised him last week that he needed to take at least six months leave. He is very unwell and has been admitted to hospital."" Shares in the AA closed 14% lower after the roadside recovery firm also said trading had been affected by ""erratic workload patterns"". Mr Mackenzie had been the AA's executive chairman since June 2014. The company said he would be replaced by non-executive chairman John Leach, while Simon Breakwell - who was a founder of Expedia - has been named as acting chief executive. Mr Mackenzie had led the AA since overseeing a management buy-in of the company in June 2014, which led to its shares being listed on the stock market. Before that, the company had been owned by private equity firms Permira, Charterhouse and CVC. The AA's share price plummeted after the announcement was made: Mr Mackenzie's departure had ""created some concern and a lot of uncertainty. Sellers/shorters are seeing this as a potential opportunity to put more pressure on the shares,"" said Berenberg analyst, Ned Hammond. ""Obviously the circumstance of his departure is particularly bizarre and unforeseeable,"" he said. Shareholders and people who were thinking of buying AA shares didn't really know what to make of the development, he added. The AA said it would release its half-year results at the end of September. It said these would be hit by the ""erratic workload"" issue, particularly in June and July, when the company had not had enough patrol vehicles to meet demand and had had to buy in last-minute cover. The company has also made changes to the way it accounts for certain products. One example is that the commission paid on the sale of breakdown cover is paid upfront to third parties, whereas the benefit to the AA is booked later. The company said its full-year performance would now be broadly in line with last year's. It added: ""We remain confident in the resilience and long-term prospects of the AA.""

"Laboratory testing found traces of fentanyl and carfentanyl in batches of heroin At least 60 people have died in the UK in the last eight months after taking the strong painkiller fentanyl. Tests on heroin seized by police since November found traces of the synthetic drug, with more than 70 further deaths pending toxicology reports, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. Some contained carfentanyl, which is 10,000 times stronger than morphine and often used to tranquillize elephants. Health officials and police have warned heroin users to be ""extra careful"". Most of the deaths were in the police force areas of West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, North Yorkshire, Humberside and Cleveland, the NCA said. They were predominantly men and a range of ages, with none younger than 18. Live updates and more stories from Yorkshire Fentanyl, which hit the headlines after it was linked to the death of US singer Prince, is considered to be 50 times more potent than heroin according to America's Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). While it can be legally prescribed, sometimes in the form of a patch or nasal spray, carfentanyl is only used as an anaesthetic for large animals, the NCA said. Recent NCA investigations found that fentanyl and its analogues are being both supplied in and exported from the UK. Fentanyl is an extremely strong painkiller, prescribed for severe chronic pain, or breakthrough pain which does not respond to regular painkillers. It is an opioid painkiller which means it works by mimicking the body's natural painkillers, called endorphins, which block pain messages to the brain. The risk of harm is higher if the wrong dose or strength is used. Typical symptoms of a fentanyl overdose include slow and difficult breathing, nausea and vomiting, dizziness and increased blood pressure. Officers have warned drug users that heroin and other class A drugs were being laced with synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Det Supt Pat Twiggs, of West Yorkshire Police, said: ""People are playing Russian roulette with their lives by taking this stuff, that's why we would strongly recommend to the drug-using community to stay away from it. ""The business is not done under lab conditions, it's not done by scientists, it's done in a very uncontrolled way by people seeking out profit - this is why we're concerned when you're dealing with such toxic chemicals."" Fentanyl is considered to be 50 times more potent than heroin A national alert was issued in April by Public Health England to warn medical and drugs services of the need to be vigilant. Richard Sykes, principal analyst at West Yorkshire Analytical Services, said: ""If you look at normal street heroin probably something like a quarter of a sugarcube would be a normal dose, but with carfentanyl a single grain of salt would probably be enough to kill a person, so it's extremely dangerous."" On Monday a 25-year-old man from Gwent was charged in connection with investigations into the supply of synthetic opioids. Three men arrested in April in Leeds have also been charged.

"The hacker shared emails on Twitter that he sent while pretending to be Reince Priebus, the recently sacked White House chief of staff A UK hacker reportedly fooled top White House officials into engaging in fake email exchanges. The self-proclaimed ""email prankster"" convinced a senior cyber security adviser he was the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, CNN says. He also goaded the then media chief, Anthony Scaramucci, in the guise of ex-chief of staff Reince Priebus. Concerns about cyber security are running high amid claims hackers interfered in the US election. The White Housetold CNN,externalit was investigating the latest incident and took the issue very seriously. The prankster postedsome of the email exchanges on Twitter,external, where he describes himself as a ""lazy anarchist"", and said he was doing it for fun. On Tuesday he promised not to target the White House again, but said ""you need to tighten up IT policy"". Here are three of the most memorable parts of the hoax: Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert was apparently tricked into believing Mr Kushner had invited him to a party and gave out his personal email address unsolicited. ""Tom, we are arranging a bit of a soirÃ©e towards the end of August,"" the fake Mr Kushner wrote in emails shared with CNN. ""It would be great if you could make it, I promise food of at least comparible [sic] quality to that which we ate in Iraq. Should be a great evening."" Mr Bossert replied: ""Thanks, Jared. With a promise like that, I can't refuse. Also, if you ever need it, my personal email is [redacted].""

A day after Mr Priebus was removed as White House chief of staff, the hacker emailed then-White House media chief Mr Scaramucci pretending to be his adversary.

Tricked by the fake emails on Saturday, the real Mr Scaramucci said: ""You know what you did. We all do. Even today. But rest assured we were prepared. A Man would apologize.""

This video can not be played Technology explained: What is phishing? Experts told CNN the incidents showed how even the most powerful people in America remained vulnerable to phishing attacks, where hackers send fake emails to induce individuals to reveal personal information. Concern about politicians being targeted is particularly high after the attack on theDemocratic National Committee during the US presidential election. US authorities attributed that incident to Russia and said that a significant component of the attack involved phishing. More recently, the electoral campaign of President Emmanuel Macron in France wastargeted by a similar campaign. Analysis:'All they do is spoof the email' Chris Baraniuk, BBC News technology reporter If you think your email address is proof of who you are, think again. It's long been a feature of the technology that someone can set up a mail server to send emails that look as though they have come from another person. Say ""reince.priebus@whitehouse.gov"". But in such cases, any reply to that message will go to the real ""reince.priebus@whitehouse.gov"". The email prankster was able to receive the replies, of course, because he or she published them. How? While we don't know the details, it's possible that an email address was set up at a domain name that was very similar to ""whitehouse.gov"". It's a well-known problem, says cyber security expert Prof Alan Woodward at the University of Surrey. He points out that scammers in the UK have been known to email house buyers with an apparent message from their solicitor. It asks them to transfer payment to the scammer's account. ""All they do is they spoof the email by changing one character,"" says Prof Woodward. The recipient's eye hastily skims over the altered or missing letter, and the message is simply taken as legitimate.

"Police searched a landfill site for missing Corrie Mckeague for 20 weeks Material found at an incinerator plant needs ""further examination"" to establish whether it is linked to missing RAF airman Corrie Mckeague, police said. The 23-year-old was last seen alive on a night out in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 24 September. Police said they would search the facility at Great Blakenham, near Ipswich, after they ended their 20-week probe of a landfill site. They said his family has been updated. Updates on this story and other Suffolk news The tortuous search for Corrie Mckeague A Suffolk Constabulary spokesman said: ""Police searching incinerated waste at the Great Blakenham energy-from-waste facility have recovered some material that requires further examination in order to establish whether it is in any way connected to the Corrie Mckeague missing person inquiry. ""At this stage it cannot be confirmed whether or not this material is in any way linked to Corrie and so it will be subject to specialist examination and forensic analysis in the coming weeks. ""Police expected that it would be necessary to take items recovered from the search away from the site in order to examine them more carefully."" He said the search of the incinerated waste was now complete. Waste from the Great Blakenham incinerator is being taken away to be examined Mr Mckeague, from Fife, was last seen entering a bin loading bay in the Suffolk town. Suffolk Police said he was known to ""sleep in rubbish on a night out"". Det Supt Katie Elliott said the landfill search for Mr Mckeague had been ""systematic, comprehensive and thorough"". The force said no more rubbish will be added to the search area at the landfill site at Milton, near Cambridge, until an independent review into the case has been carried out. It has not yet been determined who will carry out the review.

"As White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci isfired after just 10 days in the job, we look at other examples of short-lived jobs from throughout history and around the world. John Paul I is remembered as the ""smiling pope"" for his easygoing nature and personal warmth. Just 33 days after becoming pope,he died in his bed,externalin 1978. The Vatican doctor ruled that the cause of death was a heart attack, but rumours that he was poisoned persist to this day. The year of the three popes,external However, the shortest papacy in history was occupied by Urban VII in 1590. He started to make great strides in helping the poor of Rome, for instance ordering bakers to sell their loaves more cheaply and covering the shortfall from his own pocket. He died of illness just 13 days after being appointed, and his coronation never took place. The ninth president of the USA may have contracted the illness that killed him in the course of his duties. In 1841, Mr Harrison gavethe longest inauguration speech ever,external, in cold March weather without wearing a coat or a hat. In it he pledged ""to discharge all the high duties of my exalted station according to the best of my ability"". But he caught a cold on the day, developed pneumonia and, the following month, became the first US president to die in office. Aged 68, he held the record for oldest president right up until Ronald Reagan, nearly a century and a half later. A competing theory,externalholds that he actually died of enteric fever that he got from the White House water, which at the time was vulnerable to Washington's untreated sewage. Mr Fishman was hired in September 2008 to head up the savings bank holdings company Washington Mutual. ""Like everyone else in the business, WaMu is facing very significant pressures,"" he said when he took the job. ""I need to hit the ground running and I am prepared to do that."" But that running became a sprint, not a marathon. He had been in the job for a matter of weeks when a run on the bank prompted the government to step in and force its sale to JP Morgan. It was the biggest bank failure in US history. Before Mr Scaramucci, the shortest-lived communications director at the White House was Jack Koehler. He was appointed in the communications director role for President Ronald Reagan in 1987, but resigned after it came out that he had been part of a Nazi youth group as a 10-year-old in his native Germany. He said this was not the reason for his departure, though, calling Jungfolk ""the boy scouts run by the Nazi party"", and inhis resignation letter,externalhe wrote only that he wanted to make space for a new team. At the age of 16, Lady Jane Grey fell victim to sectarian turmoil across England in the 16th Century. Sandwiched between her cousin Edward VI and her other cousin Mary I, she was given the crown of England and Ireland when Edward VI died because she was a Protestant like him. But as public opinion turned against Lady Jane, the monarch's advisers switched their allegiance to Mary I instead, proclaiming her queen. Lady Jane was eventually beheaded for treason. Mary I had a five-year reign in which hundreds of non-Catholics were killed, and became known as Bloody Mary. Emperor Duc Duc ruled between 20 July and 23 July 1883. He had a reputation for decadence and flouted the rules of mourning for his own father by inviting gamblers and entertainers to his coronation. It was enough to cost him his throne, and after a tussle over succession in the court, he was deposed and sentenced to be executed by poisoning. Historians believe he may have been allowed to die in captivity instead. After South Africa's President Jacob Zuma sacked Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene in 2015, he put Mr van Rooyen in his place. The ANC MP vowed to ""simplify issues of public finance"" but the country at large did not judge him to be up to the job. His lack of experience prompted the South African Council of Churches to call the appointment ""bordering on financially irresponsible"". Less than a week later, Mr Zuma backtracked - bringing in the former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, who had five years' previous experience in the job and continueduntil this year. South Africa's finance minister fiasco Adolf Hitler wrote in his will that the role of chancellor should go to his propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels. As the war drew to a close and Nazi defeat became certain, Hitler committed suicide. Goebbels served just one day in the position before he and his wife murdered their children and took their own lives. On 2 August 1830, Louis-Antoine's father Charles X abdicated after a week of protests against him. Louis-Antoine automatically became King Louis XIX but he, too, abdicated, feeling unable to overcome the dynasty's unpopularity. Some sources say he spend the 20 minutes of his reign humming and hawing over whether to sign the papers or not, and listening to his wife who wanted him to stay on as king. He passed the throne to his nephew, the Duke of Orleans, and lived out the rest of his days in Scotland. Remember this name for pub quizzes. Mr Rosenior's spectacularly short tenure may never be beaten, inside or outside the world of football. He had previously been a manager at Torquay United for years, and got tapped to take the post up again in 2007. But just 10 minutes after his inaugural press conference, a local consortium took the team over and Mr Rosenior got the sack. He has since moved in to punditry and said: ""In the media, the most important thing is that people remember you, and people remember that.""

"The priests saw the funny side of the misunderstanding Pub bosses have apologised after asking a group of trainee priests to leave their Cardiff venue, mistaking them for a stag party in fancy dress. Theseven Roman Catholic seminarians,externalhad gone to The City Arms to toast Father Peter McClaren's ordination when they were asked to move on. But assistant manager Matt Morgan said they received a free round of drinks when the situation was explained. ""They were all dressed in their black and white clothes,"" he said. ""The staff thought they were a stag. We do have quite a few issues on the weekends with parties wearing fancy dress so it is our policy to turn them away."" The priests enjoyed a few pints in the pub in the end Father Michael Doyle, who knows the group, said the seven went to the pub in Quay Street to celebrate the ordination at Cardiff Metropolitan Cathedral of St David in nearby Charles Street. He added the pub was a favourite of his colleagues including the Archbishop of Cardiff, George Stack. ""They arrived at The City Arms and they were dressed wearing the clerical collar,"" he said. ""The doorman basically said something along the lines of, 'sorry gents, we have a policy of no fancy dress and no stag dos'."" The students had started to leave when they were approached by the bar manager. ""He basically said, 'you're real, aren't you?',"" said Fr Doyle. ""He invited them back in and when they walked back in the entire pub burst into a round of applause, and they had a free round off The City Arms."" Six of the priests who were turned away from the pub Fr Doyle said the group stayed at the pub most of the afternoon chatting to customers. Mr Morgan said the priests were ""all great sports and saw the funny side of the situation"".

"TradeRoute has seen its illegal listings rise following the demise of AlphaBay Trade on several of the dark web's illegal markets has boomed since two major players were shut by the authorities last month, according to research carried out for the BBC. The US and Dutch authorities forced AlphaBay and Hansa offline to prevent the sale of drugs, weapons and malware. But over the last week of July, other sites saw their number of listings rise by as much as 28%, the study indicates. Sales of some goods do, however, appear to have been reduced. ""There is growing evidence that when one illegal dark web marketplace is closed, the illicit business quickly starts to be redirected to other sites which are still active,"" commented Elad Ben-Meir, marketing chief at the Israeli cyber-security firm Cyberint, which carried out the research. ""However, there is also evidence that continuing crackdowns by international law enforcement operations, are having the effect of forcing illicit traders away from those sites selling firearms or child pornography."" This video can not be played Technology explained: What is the dark web? The markets are given the ""dark web"" moniker because they cannot be accessed via a normal internet browser without using a workaround, and their listings are hidden from mainstream search engines. The closure of AlphaBay and Hansa was revealed on 20 July. Cyberint looked at what change in activity there had been on five other leading dark web markets between 24 July and 31 July. According to its numbers, Dream Market is now the biggest illegal store with a total of 98,844 listings at the end of the month. The authorities revealed their closure of AlphaBay and Hansa last month The site was launched in late 2013 and is now one of the oldest dark web markets in existence. Its number of listings rose by 3,818 over the course of the week. While that was the biggest increase of the surveyed sites in numerical terms, it represented a relatively modest increase of 3.9%. ""There is some interesting buzz around Dream Market potentially being compromised and/or under law enforcement control, which is feeding fear and uncertainty amongst vendors and buyers,"" said Mr Ben-Meir. ""That is probably why Dream Market has not grown substantially in the wake of the takedowns."" Europol and the FBI have promised ""hundreds"" of follow-up investigations off the back of their initial takedowns. Dream Market vendors are aware that Hansa was seized and covertly monitored for about a month after AlphaBay was deactivated. That has led tounverified speculation on several online forums,externalthat Dream Market's servers have also been hijacked. The next biggest site is TradeRoute, which rose from 14,914 listings to 17,816 over the period - a 16.3% gain. It includes forged documents and black market tobacco and alcohol among its wares. ""TradeRoute is actively touting for new business with threads welcoming vendors displaced from AlphaBay,"" said Cyberint's report. The Tochka marketplace is believed to be of Russian origin In percentage terms, Tochka can claim the biggest boost. Its listings rose by 28.1% to 2,390. The site specialises in illegal and prescription drugs among other products. Wall Street Market, a relatively new platform with a more polished design than is the norm for such sites, experienced a similar lift. Its number of listings grew by 25.4% over the week to 2,216. Of the markets covered, only one experienced a drop-off in activity. RsClub Market is the only one of the five sites to sell guns - its only restriction on weapons listings is that they must not offer ""weapons of mass destruction"". The site's listing count dropped by 638 to 1,689 over the week - a 37.8% fall-off. RsClub Market lists weapons as well as drugs and other illegal goods Cyberint suggested that this might be linked to the fact the Rand Corporation think tank and the University of Manchester had jointly published a report into the size and scope of thedark web's illegal arms trade,externalon 19 July. It said that 60% of the weapons put on sale had been sourced from the US, and that terrorists were among suspected buyers. Cyberint believes those looking to buy and sell other illegal goods might now be steering clear of RsClub Market because it was likely to be a focus of follow-up investigations. One adviser to Europol said the findings were of interest but only told half the story. ""The takedowns have certainly not discouraged the vendors but it's still not totally clear if it has put off the buyers,"" said Alan Woodward. ""The sellers believe they are relatively immune - they don't use their real details so are hard to track down even if a site is commandeered - but the users have to give delivery addresses and the like. ""That's why the emphasis is on taking the markets down and that's exactly what law enforcement wants to do."" Huge dark web drug sites shut down What is the dark web?

"Lightwater Valley theme park in North Yorkshire says it has decided to close its Eagle's Claw ride as a precaution Six high-speed theme park rides have been shut across the UK after a death on a similar attraction in the US. An 18-year-old man died and three others were critically injured after being flung from the ride at the Ohio State Fair on Wednesday. The ride, known as the KMG Afterburner, swings at high speed from side-to-side while also spinning passengers. The Health and Safety Executive ordered the re-inspection and temporary closure of similar rides in the UK. Three of the rides closed are in theme parks, Pleasurewood Hills in Suffolk, Coney Beach in South Wales and Brean Theme Park in Somerset. The other two rides are owned by Ryan Crow Amusements in the North East of England and by Joseph Manning in Hertfordshire. Lightwater Valley in North Yorkshire has voluntarily closed its pendulum-style ride until the HSE has deemed the KMG Afterburner safe. Following the accident in Ohio, Thorpe Park in Surrey closed one of its pendulum rides, Vortex, as a precaution, but it has since reopened. A spokeswoman said: ""We reopened the ride on Saturday with the endorsement of both manufacturer and the HSE."" This video can not be played A witness said ""several people came flying out"" from the ride Unverified footage from Wednesday's accident in Columbus shows one passenger carriage breaking loose near the bottom of its pendulum swing, tossing passengers into the air as it rose again. An HSE spokeswoman said all five rides in the UK had been ""thoroughly inspected within the last 12 months"", but there was no ""verified information"" on the cause of the fatal accident in the US. As a result the body had served an enforcement notice on the machines, which takes them out of use. ""HSE will ensure operators are kept abreast of information as it arrives and will take such action as is necessary to ensure the rides are inspected and tested as necessary to ensure safety,"" the spokeswoman added. Ripon-based theme park Lightwater Valley is telling customers that its ride, called the Eagle's Claw, is closed ""due to circumstances beyond our control"". A spokesman said: ""We were deeply saddened and shocked to hear of the tragic accident in the US and our thoughts go out to the families of those concerned."" He added that although there are ""fundamental and significant differences"" between the ride at Lightwater and the one in Ohio, the park ""entirely supported"" the HSE's decision to close similar rides. The theme park would keep the ride closed as a ""precaution"" until HSE had completed its safety checks. 'People came flying out' of Ohio fair ride.

"Facebook has been experimenting with AIs that negotiate with each other The newspapers have a scoop today - it seems that artificial intelligence (AI) could be out to get us. ""'Robot intelligence is dangerous': Expert's warning after Facebook AI 'develop their own language'"",says the Mirror,external. Similar stories have appeared in the Sun, the Independent, the Telegraph and in other online publications. It sounds like something from a science fiction film - the Sun even includeda few pictures of scary-looking androids,external. So, is it time to panic and start preparing for apocalypse at the hands of machines? Probably not. While some great minds -including Stephen Hawking- are concerned that one day AI could threaten humanity, the Facebook story is nothing to be worried about. Way back in June, Facebook publisheda blog post about interesting research,externalon chatbot programs - which have short, text-based conversations with humans or other bots. The story wascovered by New Scientist,externaland others at the time. Facebook had been experimenting with bots that negotiated with each other over the ownership of virtual items. It was an effort to understand how linguistics played a role in the way such discussions played out for negotiating parties, and crucially the bots were programmed to experiment with language in order to see how that affected their dominance in the discussion. A few days later,some coverage picked up on the fact,externalthat in a few cases the exchanges had become - at first glance - nonsensical: Bob: ""I can can I I everything else"" Alice: ""Balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to"" Although some reports insinuate that the bots had at this point invented a new language in order to elude their human masters, a better explanation is that the neural networks were simply trying to modify human language for the purposes of more successful interactions - whether their approach worked or not was another matter. Astechnology news site Gizmodo said:,external""In their attempts to learn from each other, the bots thus began chatting back and forth in a derived shorthand - but while it might look creepy, that's all it was."" Unlike in the movies, humans and machines aren't trying to kill each other. AIs that rework English as we know it in order to better compute a task are not new. Google reported that its translation software had done this during development. ""The network must be encoding something about the semantics of the sentence""Google said in a blog,external. And earlier this year,Wired reported on a researcher at OpenAI,externalwho is working on a system in which AIs invent their own language, improving their ability to process information quickly and therefore tackle difficult problems more effectively. The story seems to have had a second wind in recent days, perhaps because ofa verbal scrap over the potential dangers of AIbetween Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and technology entrepreneur Elon Musk. But the way the story has been reported says more about cultural fears and representations of machines than it does about the facts of this particular case. Plus, let's face it, robots just make for great villains on the big screen. In the real world, though, AI is a huge area of research at the moment and the systems currently being designed and tested are increasingly complicated. One result of this is that it'soften unclear how neural networks come to produce the output,externalthat they do - especially when two are set up to interact with each other without much human intervention, as in the Facebook experiment. That's why some argue that putting AI in systemssuch as autonomous weapons is dangerous,external. It's also whyethics for AI is a rapidly developing field,external- the technology will surely be touching our lives ever more directly in the future. Most chatbots are designed to carry out a pretty limited set of functions - and are therefore fairly boring But Facebook's system was being used for research, not public-facing applications, and it was shut down because it was doing something the team wasn't interested in studying - not because they thought they had stumbled on an existential threat to mankind. It's important to remember, too, that chatbots in general are very difficult to develop. In fact, Facebook recently decided to limit the rollout of its Messenger chatbot platform after it found many of the bots on it wereunable to address 70%,externalof users' queries. Chatbots can, of course,be programmed to seem very humanlikeand may even dupe us in certain situations - but it's quite a stretch to think they are also capable of plotting a rebellion. At least, the ones at Facebook certainly aren't. Stephen Hawking - will AI kill or save?

"Fifty years ago, gay sex between men in private was decriminalised in England and Wales. Despite this, hate crimes against gay people have persisted, and the number of attacks recorded by police has been rising. There were 7,194 in England and Wales in the year to April 2016. Campaigners say this isn't the full picture, though, as many victims still don't report assaults.  Six people affected by hate crimes share their stories. Warning: This story contains details of violence and images which some readers might find upsetting. James and Dain were enjoying a night out together in Brighton in May 2016 when they were followed out of a nightclub and attacked on the seafront. The assault has left physical and emotional scars. James:We were at the bar and we got this look from a couple of guys from across the dance floor. It takes a lot to make me feel uncomfortable but it was just such a weird look they gave us. Dain had his arm around me. I don't think they liked that. Then they started shouting at us. I told Dain we needed to get out of the club into a taxi the quickest way possible. Dain:We left the bar. No-one was about. All of a sudden I heard running behind us. There was no way we were going to outrun them. They grabbed us from behind and chucked us to the floor. I was lying on the pavement and all I could see was James but the next thing I saw was a shoe coming towards my face. That knocked me completely unconscious. James:One of the boys started kicking Dain's face really rapidly. There was a lot of aggression and shouting of ""gay boys"". Every time I tried to crawl closer to Dain, I was dragged along the pavement. At that point, a taxi drove past and called the police. I remember standing up for the first time and Dain looked at me and said, ""I can't see."" Dain:My eye socket was completely shattered. I had haemorrhages in both my eyes and fractures on my cheeks. My tooth was chipped and my nose was broken as well. I remember being in hospital and kept asking, ""Am I going to be able to see again?"" They said, ""We can't tell you because everything is so swollen."" They couldn't even open my eyes. Dain in hospital after the attack James and I were very close anyway but spending that much time with each other really proved to me how strong our relationship is. I'm a very resilient person and I'm not going to live my life how someone else wants me to. I'm not going to let anyone change that. If anything, this has made me want to be who I am even more. James:It's made him stronger and it's made him not care about what other people think and to go out there and be himself even more, whereas it's done the opposite to me. It's changed me. I've changed my thought process and mindset, how I think, how I look, how I speak, who I'm with, where we go and it's sad because I remember how we were before it happened and I look at us now and it's upsetting because it's them who made this happen. That's what's hard to accept. It's a year since it happened and I thought things would probably get easier but they haven't. When we're out and about he wants us to look like we're together obviously but I'm scared of something similar happening again. It wasn't like that a year ago. We didn't go down the street holding hands but I wasn't fully aware of us making sure that we weren't seen as a couple. I couldn't ever forgive the people who attacked us or forget what happened. It will stay with me and I'm sure it will stay with them for the rest of their lives. Both attackers, Gage Vye-Parminter and Matthew Howes, pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm and assault and were sentenced to seven years in prison. Becky and Alex were attacked on a night out in Croydon in August 2016. One man was convicted but he left the country before he could be sentenced, leaving the couple feeling angry and frustrated. Alex:I'm angry about everything that's happened - the fact that I had a black eye to explain to a six-year-old, why Mummy was hurt, why Becky had bruises. It's not something I want to explain to my child, that there's hatred in this world. It's odd that it still happens just because of who we choose to love. For once we had a babysitter and got out of the house and that happened. We haven't been out since. Becky:The first thing he said was, ""I like lesbians"" and I thought ""Oh God, not one of these."" Alex:He had a South African accent, all seemed quite pleasant and he seemed quite tipsy but I'm never really rude to anyone. He asked our friends to kiss, to which they said ""No"" and I said, ""It's not for your pleasure."" Becky:He said something like ""dyke"" which offended one of my mates. You don't say that. We went to the kebab shop to get a bit of food. I didn't think it was going to get violent. Alex:Another guy that had begun joining in then started circling us as a group and focused his attention on me. Becky:That's when he started getting touchy-feely, groping Alex's breasts and really hanging on her arm. He called us ""fat dykes"" and she pushed him away. The other guy saw her do it. He swung for her. James, Dain, Becky, Alex and Jenny tell their stories in the TV programme Is it safe to  be gay in the UK? Viewers in the UK can watch it at 21:00 on Tuesday 1 August on BBC Oneor catch up later online. The documentary is part ofGay Britannia- a season of programming across the BBC to mark the 50th anniversary of The Sexual Offences Act 1967, which partially decriminalised gay sex between men in England and Wales. Alex:I got groped, kicked and slammed into a street light. My wife got punched and our two friends got punched too. To hit a woman is wrong but do that just because we didn't want them is disgusting and vile. I am so angry I have been violated for loving my wife. The next day I had to wear glasses as I couldn't cover up the darkness around my eye. I feel guilty because I have chosen to love Becky which in turn has brought this crap into my son's life. Just me and him, we look completely normal. We wouldn't attract attention but being with Becky does because she is so obviously gay. I'm disappointed, upset and angry with my attacker, at the court, the justice system. I just hope and pray it doesn't happen to someone else. A South African man, Sazi Tutani, was found guilty of assault but he couldn't be sentenced because he had left the UK and returned home. There is a warrant out for his arrest. Another man was found not guilty of all charges. Ian Baynham died after being punched and kicked on a September night in 2009 in Trafalgar Square, central London. His sister Jenny, who is also gay, talks about the loss of her ""inseparable link"". Ian was the first born in the family and he was four years older than I was. He had this amazing smile, he just loved life really. When things were tough, he'd be there and he'd never judge you. As we grew up, we went our separate ways. In our early 20s, I went to a gay party with a girl. It was packed. I looked across the room and I thought: ""That's Ian."" He spotted me. He came up to me, put his arm around me and he said, ""What are you doing here?"" and from that moment we realised we were both gay. That really forged this inseparable link. On the night he was attacked, he was walking down the street with his friend, Philip. He'd just had his first week at work so he was going out to have a drink. Someone shouted, ""Faggots."" My brother turned round and said, ""I may be gay butâ¦"" And then there was some kind of altercation. He was kicked in the groin and punched. They were kicking him, stamping on him and shouting at him. It's shocking, absolutely shocking. I couldn't believe it. There was a crowd of people around him, which you can see on the CCTV footage. How could you leave somebody in that state? Why didn't they go back to him and check he was OK? Those questions still nag at the back of my mind. To walk away, how could you do that? Ian and Jenny together Ian was in hospital for 18 days. When I got there he was unconscious with two big black eyes. His breathing was changing. My experience told me that this was the final breath. He struggled a bit and then he stopped breathing. And so he died. We were with him. It was very sad. Thousands of people with lights attended an extraordinary coming together of gay and straight people in Trafalgar Square because of what had happened. It was magic really and such a fitting event for Ian. Just across the road was where he was last conscious. I went there a couple of times to look. It really is significant. That tree, I know it very well. He's part of Trafalgar Square now. We always used to say, ""We can always live together when we get older and retire. We'll be like Darby and Joan and have a few tea parties."" We'd laugh about it. I probably miss him more and more as I get older. You can't have hate and I think hate is a very divisive thing to hold on to. I'm starting the restorative justice programme and hoping that will give me some sense of closure and also that it will help the offenders. I'd like to meet them all. They're still alive and they have a life. I do care what happens to people and I know some people don't have the same advantages as others. I actually think he would support me doing this and this really will be a bit like a springboard in helping me move on. I'm hopeful. Ruby Thomas and Joel Alexander were found guilty of manslaughter. Thomas was sentenced to seven years in prison and Alexander was sentenced to six years. Over the past 12 years, Paul Harfleet has planted hundreds of pansies across the world at spots where gay people have been subjected to homophobic abuse - including locations in Austria, Sweden, Turkey and the US. It started in Manchester in 2005 when I experienced three separate instances of homophobia in one day.  People were really shocked that I had these experiences all the time and I thought, ""I have to do something about this."" I began to plant pansies wherever I'd experienced abuse. I wanted to do something that changed the location. I never wanted there to be any signage, it had to be something that was subtle but noticeable, in the way that I am in the street. A pansy is a pansy, you kind of understand and read what it's about just by knowing it's there. Quite quickly, people started telling me where they had experienced abuse and I started planting for them too. If I plant a flower for someone who's been murdered I usually dedicate it to them. I take photographs and add them tomy website,external. Westminster Bridge, London I often name the pansy after the abuse that has happened. The first one I planted was called: ""I think it's about time we went gay bashing again."" Two builders sitting on a wall said that directly to my face and I was so shocked I really didn't know what to do. When you have that experience you're forced to think about what it is you can do. Do you react, do you close up? The ritual of digging into the ground, kneeling on the ground, feels solemn and slightly healing. I'm subverting this terrible thing that's happened and turning it into something more positive. It also raises awareness. Oxford Road, Manchester When someone's been violently attacked, the location is so loaded that they can't stop thinking about it when they go past. What I witness when I go back with them is their experience and healing of that location. They can then think: ""This isn't only the place where I was beaten up but also somewhere a pansy was planted."" It's almost like sticking a plaster over the violence. I plant pansies wherever I am. Unfortunately everywhere I go there's usually a place where someone has experienced homophobia. If I mark a location for someone I don't know, I'll contact them using social media saying, ""I've done this for you."" Every single pansy marks a story of someone who has experienced homophobia on the streets. I don't think it will end. I will always plant them.

"This video can not be played The Afghan women who want to be called by their names, not their husbands' In Afghan society it is the custom that women's names should not be uttered publicly.

"According to the regulator, Ofgem, it is possible to save about Â£300 a year if you switch your gas and electricity provider. The best savings involve taking out a ""dual fuel"" deal, where one provider supplies both forms of energy. Many people have been put off switching, but Ofgem maintains the process is very simple. Not everybody is able to switch their supplier. If you are in debt to a supplier, you might not be able to. If you have a pre-payment meter and you owe more than Â£500 for gas or electricity, you might not be able to switch. There are two main types of energy deal, a fixed-term contract, typically lasting a year or 18 months, and a standard variable tariff. If you are one of the two-thirds of householders on a standard variable tariff, the potential for savings is larger. However, over the past few years the gap between standard variable tariffs and fixed rates has narrowed, as can be seen from the graph below. You will need: your postcode the name of your existing supplier the name of your existing energy deal an idea of how much gas or electricity you use, which should be shown on your bill The change should take no longer than 17 days. That includes a 14 day cooling-off period. Your supply will not be interrupted during that time. If you are on a fixed-rate deal and decide to switch before it ends, you may be charged an exit fee. But if you are within 49 days of the end of the deal, you should not be charged. You can contact your supplier directly, and ask if they can give you a better deal. But there will be a wider choice of deals through price comparison websites. Ofgem provides this list of approved sites: Quotezone, The Energy Shop, Runpath, Simply Switch, My Utility Genius, Switch Gas and Electric, Energylinx, Unravel It, Money Supermarket, Energy Helpline and Uswitch. These sites do not always point consumers in the direction of the cheapest deals. They tend to promote those that you can switch to straight away, and with whom the websites have made an agreement. ""To get the best deal when switching energy supplier, it's important that you make sure the site you are using shows the whole of the market and not just suppliers or deals that they earn a commission from,"" said Mike Rowe, fromSimply Switch,external. Better deals may be available if you are prepared to wait. However any site approved by Ofgem has to include a clickable option to see all tariffs available, not just preferred suppliers. Such sites have a ""whole of market"" button, allowing you to see all the deals on offer.

"Should you be taking statins? Research from Harvard University suggests if current guidelines were strictly applied, ""almost all"" men over 60 and women over 75 would be doing so in order to help prevent heart attack and stroke. But the Royal College of GPs has raised the alarm saying this could lead to some older people being prescribed the drug unnecessarily. Its chairwoman, Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard said: ""It is not clear that every 60-year-old man or 75-year-old woman is going to benefit from statin therapy."" Statins are a group of drugs designed to lower harmful cholesterol in the blood. Having too much low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood can lead to a build-up of fatty plaque in the arteries. This so-called ""bad cholesterol"" can cause blockages and lead to heart disease and stroke. Statins are tablets taken once a day, and, once prescribed, will usually be taken for life. The NHS says a review of scientific studies suggests one in 50 people who takes statins for five years, will avoid a ""serious event"" like a heart attack. In contrast, only one in 10,000 people taking statins will experience a ""potentially dangerous"" side-effect. And they are cheap - a commonly prescribed statin, atorvastatin, taken daily costs about Â£2 a month per person, according to a study in the medical journal, the Lancet. New guidelines for England published in 2014 recommended statins be prescribed to anyone with a one-in-10 chance or higher of developing cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years. A team of scientists at Harvard looked at how many of the population in England should therefore be eligible for the drug. The recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) significantly increased the number of people eligible for statins. Previous advice from the body, which provides national guidelines on health and care, said that only those with a higher than one-in-five chance of developing heart disease should be given them. The Harvard research, published in theBritish Journal of General Practice,external, found that the updated guidance meant almost all men over the age of 60, and almost all women over the age of 75, would be considered high risk and therefore be eligible to be given statins, regardless of whether they had any other risk factors. This is because age is one of the main factors when it comes to estimating risk of disease. The researchers estimated that, according to the guidelines, 11.8 million (37%) adults in England, aged 30-84, would be eligible for statin therapy. This would mean each GP treating almost 200 extra patients with statins. Of these, they found more than half were not already taking the drug. But the sample of the population the researchers used was taken from a survey from 2011, before the guidelines came into place. The researchers weren't looking at the uptake of the 2014 guidelines, but estimating what they meant for how many people would be eligible for the drug. The study acknowledges it is unlikely that all eligible adults will receive statins. But the guidelines recommend that someone falling into the high-risk category should be having ""an informed risk-benefit discussion"" with their doctor, the authors point out. A spokesman from the Royal College of GPs echoes this, saying that the NICE guidelines are, ""guidelines, not tramlines, and GPs will take these into account along with any other physical, psychological and social factors potentially affecting the patient's health - as well as patient choice."" Many patients don't want to take statins, he adds, and some people who would be eligible under NICE guidelines won't visit their GP at all. There were 67 million individual prescriptions in 2015-16, according to the NHS, but the health service does not collect data on how many individuals received the medicine.

"Marian received a large quantity of skin from her twin sister Mary Jane The 66-year-old Fields twins, from Missouri, have lived together all their lives - now they are even closer after sharing their skin. Marian Fields had an aggressive and very rare form of skin cancer, which left her with large, open wounds around her backbone following multiple operations and radiation treatments. She was beginning to lose all hope of recovery after plastic surgeons in the US refused to take on her case because of the size of the wound. But her identical twin sister Mary Jane provided the solution. ""There was never a moment of hesitation when the option to donate skin and tissue was a possibility,"" Mary Jane said. ""I had what she needed. We are two bodies with one soul. She is my other self."" Surgeons worked for 14 hours to remove Marian's skin cancer from her back Dr Jesse Selber, a plastic surgeon from the MD Anderson Cancer Centre at the University of Texas, who had previouslyperformed the first skull-scalp transplant, said the surgery was ""incredibly challenging and complex"". His team of five plastic surgeons removed skin, tissue and blood vessels from Mary Jane's abdomen and transplanted it to Marian's back, connecting eight different arteries and veins under a microscope during surgery. The hole in Marian's back was 21.5in by 8.5in (55cm x 22 cm), making it one of the largest tissue transplantations on record. By donating skin to her sister, Mary Jane - in effect - got a giant tummy tuck. Having an identical twin made the transplantation process more likely to succeed for Marian because no suppression of her immune system was required - but there were still huge risks. Surgeons said they were concerned about the donated skin being rejected and the possibility of the cancer recurring. Although the tumour in Marian's back was very aggressive, it was not a type that spreads to other parts of the body so receiving her sister's skin and tissue was a perfect fix. Mary Jane and Marian attend an appointment with Dr Selber Dr Selber said: ""Marian's wound was impossibly large - without her genetically identical sister, we would not have had enough tissue to reconstruct it."" The surgery took 14 hours and involved ""extensive resection through skin, muscle and bone"", followed by ""hours of meticulous microvascular work"". This involved re-connecting countless veins and arteries. The surgery was meticulously planned beforehand - and it paid off, according to Dr Selber. ""It went quite beautifully,"" he said. Before the transplant surgery, Marian was in horrible pain. She couldn't lie on her back or sit up in a chair properly. One month on from the surgery, the twins have been discharged, the stitches have been removed and they have returned home. Marian says: ""I'm looking forward to getting back to work, driving, running and sitting comfortably. ""I've never been sick before 2012 and am ready to get back to life.""

"Armed prisoners were understood to have taken over a wing of the category C men's prison Riot-trained staff have been sent to HMP The Mount in Hertfordshire for the second day running. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said armed prisoners took over Nash Wing and smashed windows, according to well-placed sources. The Ministry of Justice said order was restored shortly before 17:00 BST. About 30 inmates at Erlestoke prison in Wiltshire also became violent and four people were taken to hospital, the Prison Officers Association said. Live: Latest updates as trouble reported at HMP The Mount At Erlestoke a prison officer suffered a broken jaw, it added. The acting chairman of the association, Mark Fairhurst, told the BBC that more than 80 inmates were unlocked on a wing at the jail at the time - with ""a nucleus of about 30 prisoners being involved in the violence"". The MoJ has confirmed that some prison officers were taken to hospital but would not confirm the number or the nature of their injuries. This video can not be played HMP The Mount: Footage shows riot-trained staff at jail Following the end of the problems at The Mount, a Prison Service spokesperson said: ""Specially trained prison staff have successfully resolved an incident at HMP The Mount on 1 August. There were no injuries to staff or prisoners. ""We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and are clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and could spend longer behind bars."" HMP The Mount was designed as a category C training prison built on the site of a former RAF station on the outskirts of Bovingdon village, Hertfordshire The Mount Prison opened in 1987 as a young offenders institution. It was designed as a category C training prison built on the site of a former RAF station on the outskirts of Bovingdon village, Hertfordshire. A report in 2016 by the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) found ""all the ingredients were in place for The Mount to suffer disorder such as has been experienced in other prisons: Staff shortages, Readily available drugs Mounting violence The prison now has a population of more than 1,000 prisoners. The Nash wing is fairly new - it was completed in 2015 - with 94 double cells and 62 single cells. On Monday at least 50 cells are thought to have been damaged when violence broke out in two wings at The Mount. No-one was injured on that occasion. Riot officers entered HMP The Mount on Monday A Hertfordshire Constabulary spokeswoman said: ""Following [Monday's] incident we are working with the Ministry of Justice and are currently reviewing what, if any offences, have occurred."" The Mount, near Hemel Hempstead, opened in 1987 and is classed as a category C male prison. Nash wing is believed to hold between 200 and 250 inmates serving short sentences or with only three months left to serve of their sentence. HMP Erlestoke is also a category C men's prison, which the Prison Reform Trust describes as one where ""prison staff think [inmates] will not escape"", while acknowledging they ""cannot be trusted in an open prison"". Incidents take place in prisons all the time; it's usually problems with one or two individuals, and most go unreported. When an incident like this take place - when tornado (specialist riot) teams are involved - it takes it up to a new level. When you have prisoners rioting or barricading themselves in, with staff having to withdraw, that is very serious. Problems at the Mount have been brewing for some time. The independent inspectors that go into prisons were saying they were 25 staff short out of 136  - that is a significant shortfall. Last week the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) published its annual report into Erlestoke, and said that the smuggling of tobacco, which has been banned by the prison, had contributed to bullying. Before the violence broke out on Monday, the IMB also published itsannual review,externalinto conditions at The Mount and said it had ""struggled"" with staff shortages. There were 24 vacancies out of a total of 136 officers in February, it added. Riot officers with shields were called to attend HMP The Mount on Monday It also claimed violence ""grew considerably"" throughout the year and that drugs were readily available, in particular the synthetic cannabis substitute spice. The report said concerns raised last year had not been addressed by the MoJ. HMP Erlestoke is a Category C establishment holding adult male sentenced offenders. A 2017 IMB report on the prison found that lack of experienced officers was a concern. It found: Tobacco smuggling had become an issue since the prison became smoke free on 1 April 2016 Abuse of the drug Spice was an increasing concern A death from Spice was ""only a matter of time"" The prison has 388 prisoners with 115 of them serving a life sentence. About 60% of inmates are aged between 21 and 39.

"Promotional material showed some of the 125 miles (200km) of Saudi's western coastline that is due to be transformed Saudi Arabia has launched a massive tourism development project that will turn 50 islands and other sites on the Red Sea into luxury resorts. It hopes to attract both foreign tourists and domestic visitors as part of efforts to diversify the Saudi economy, as oil prices have fallen. Visa restrictions on foreigners are to be eased in the tourist zone. However, it is not clear whether dress codes and other restrictions in the conservative kingdom will be relaxed. Alcohol, cinemas and theatres are prohibited in Saudi Arabia. Women must wear loose-fitting, full-length robes known as ""abayas"" in public, as well as a headscarf if they are Muslim. They are not allowed to drive and often require a male guardian's permission to study or travel abroad. Construction of the new resorts is due to start in 2019. The first phase will include developing a new airport as well as luxury hotels and housing, and is expected to be complete in 2022. Time for change in Saudi Arabia? Saudi king ousts nephew for son Sebastian Usher, BBC News Arab affairs editor Saudi Arabia already plays host to millions of foreigners - for work and for theHajj pilgrimage to Mecca. But its austere religious and social codes, reflected in the ruggedness of the landscape, have hardly proved enticing to tourists - and until recently, that's how the Saudis liked it. Now, with oil revenues falling, fresh ways of earning income and providing jobs for Saudis have been urgently sought. Tourism has been earmarked as a key element of a new economic and social vision. This video can not be played Rocking out, Saudi-style - the BBC's Lyse Doucet reports on social changes The tourism project is part of a plan, known as Vision 2030, spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who was elevated to become the first in line to the Saudi throne in June. The Red Sea development will be built along 125 miles (200km) of Saudi's western coastline, according to the Vision 2030 fund. Among the attractions will be protected coral reefs, dormant volcanoes, and a nature reserve inhabited by rare wildlife like Arabian leopards and falcons. Visitors will also be able to take trips to the ancient ruins ofMadain Saleh, classified as a Unesco World Heritage site, and take part in activities such as parachuting, trekking and rock climbing.

"Loggerhead turtles are a threatened species Easyjet passengers were left stranded for two days on a Greek island after a relief flight was cancelled to protect a threatened turtle population. The flight from Zante to London Gatwick was cancelled on Sunday over technical issues, which continued through Monday. The airline apologised but blamed the relief plane not reaching the airport on the island's night flight curfew. Night flights are prohibited on Zante as planes pass over a beach where loggerhead turtles nest. The curfew is in place on the island, which is also known as Zakynthos, because the lights and noise can disturb the animals. Passengers were left waiting for around 55 hours About a quarter of passengers made it home on alternative flights, and the remaining passengers took off on Tuesday. A spokeswoman for Easyjet said: ""Engineers were immediately dispatched to Zante and believed that the technical issue was rectified yesterday [Monday], however it then reoccurred before boarding which meant the flight could not operate. ""The safety of our passengers and crew is our highest priority and we will only operate if it is safe to do so. ""We do all possible to try and minimise delays and as such planned to send a replacement aircraft. Unfortunately, due to the night curfew rule at the airport, we were unable to get the replacement aircraft into the airport yesterday [Monday]."" Hatchlings usually emerge at night and overhead flights can disorientate them One passenger, Rebecca Clark, tweeted Easyjet on Monday asking: ""Can you let us know what's going on? Day two stuck at Zante airport. Now replacement flight isn't going. No staff coming to see us!"" On Tuesday, Mark Longbottom tweeted: ""Day 3 - have given up on #easyjet and have been saved by Thompson's though and fly today."" A spokeswoman for Easyjet added: ""Passengers have been provided with hotel accommodation and expenses in line with EU regulations and will also be entitled to compensation.

"This video can not be played Teenagers appear to be posting pictures of stolen bikes and robberies on social media. A spray that links suspected moped criminals to a crime scene is being tested by the Metropolitan Police. The liquid would tag clothing or equipment with a unique chemical footprint only visible under ultraviolet light. The BBC has also learned that offenders are increasingly travelling into London from the Home Counties to commit thefts. The force says the average age of those carrying out crimes in London is 15. There has been a marked increase in the number of moped crime offences carried out in the capital in the last year. In the 12 months to the end of June 2017, the Met logged 16,158 crimes involving powered-two-wheel vehicles compared with 5,145 the year before. The moped crime wave that has swept London Police say phones, watches, bags and other mopeds and motorbikes are generally the target of thefts. The BBC has also seen social media messages where offenders brag about selling stolen bikes. One account called ""bristolbiketaker"" features photographs of motorbike riders with masked faces, ditched or hidden bikes and bolt-cutters. Avon and Somerset Police is investigating the account. It says posts often taunt the owners of stolen bikes. Other accounts feature video of police chases filmed by offenders themselves and appear to show them selling keys for unlocking stolen bikes. Avon and Somerset Police says it is aware of accounts bragging of moped crimes Social media accounts feature taunts to owners of stolen bikes Officers say they have developed new tactics - including the use of tyre-deflation devices - but now want to be able to track offenders. Det Supt Stuart Ryan, the force's lead on moped crime, said a tagging spray was being tested under Home Office guidelines. ""If delivered it will be a very exciting change because it does give us an opportunity to track them in a different way than we've been able to do before. ""We're trying to find a way we can deliver it safely both to the people on the bike and also the community and officers."" Det Supt Ryan said offenders were often travelling into London to carry out thefts. ""Mostly we're seeing it from Kent and Essex but we have had incidents from Surrey, Buckinghamshire, all round London coming in. ""It's quite stark that the average for these offenders is 15.""

"The incident took place as the suspects were being escorted in the building Three defendants have been killed in a court in the Russian capital, Moscow, after they tried to take the arms from officers in an attempt to escape, officials say. Five suspected gang members attacked two agents who were escorting them in a lift, the Investigative Committee said. The group was handcuffed and it was not immediately clear how they managed to free themselves to attack the guards. The two other suspects and three security officers were wounded. The suspects were accused of being part of a group known as GTA Gang, named after the violent game series Grand Theft Auto. The group of Central Asian nationals was suspected of killing 17 motorists in the Moscow area between 2012 and 2014. Cars were forced to stop on a main road and their drivers were killed for reasons as yet unknown; none of their possessions were stolen. In the court, one of the suspects attacked and tried to strangle an agent, as others attempted to seize the officers' weapons, Russia's Investigative Committee said in a statement. When the lift they were in opened on the third floor, Russian National Guard officers opened fire, killing three of the suspects as they tried to escape, the statement added. The fact that the suspects were in any position to assault security agents inside the court and even attempt an armed escape is likely to raise questions, BBC Russian's Oleg Boldyrev in Moscow reports. Suspects are usually brought into courtrooms handcuffed, with their arms crossed behind their backs, so this turn of events will probably be seen as bizarre, our correspondent adds. The building was evacuated following the shooting The security officers injured include a National Guard member, who had a gunshot wound and was taken to hospital, and two police officers, who sustained various injuries, according to the Interior Ministry. A lawyer who was at the building when the incident happened said that at least 20 shots were heard. The members of the gang are accused of murder, banditry and other crimes, the Investigative Committee said. One of them had fought for so-called Islamic State in Syria before returning to Russia, Russian television reported.

"Controversy surrounds Donald Trump Jr's meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya President Donald Trump personally dictated the statement his son gave on his talks with a Russian lawyer during the election campaign, US media report. It said Donald Trump Jr and the lawyer had mostly discussed the adoption of Russian children in June 2016. Mr Trump Jr later revealed he had agreed to meet her after being told he could receive damaging material on Hillary Clinton. President Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia. The Senate, House of Representatives and a special counsel are all investigating alleged Russian interference in the presidential election which took the form of attempts to undermine Mrs Clinton - a claim denied by the Kremlin. The reports about Mr Trump Jr's statement came in the midst of further turmoil at the White House. White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci was firedon Monday after fewer than 10 days in the post. The former Wall Street financier had drawn criticism after calling a reporter to give a profanity-laced tirade against his colleagues. This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation Reports that President Trump hadhimself dictated the statement,externalhis son issued about the meeting with lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya first emerged in the Washington Post. It cited multiple sources. The initial plan was that Mr Trump Jr fully disclose what he knew about the meeting, the Post says, but that decision was reversed and his first statement said they had discussed the adoption of Russian children, not campaign issues. Mr Trump Jr later acknowledged that he had agreed to meet after being told Kremlin-linked information about Mrs Clinton would be offered during the talks. He also released the email exchange that brought about the meeting. The Washington Post says some of the president's advisers fear the extent of the president's intervention could place him and some of his inner circle in legal jeopardy. Did Donald Trump Jr break the law? Four explosive lines in Trump Jr emails Key players in Trump Jr meeting scandal By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington According to the Washington Post, Donald Trump thinks that because he didn't do anything wrong, he can't obstruct the criminal investigation into Russian electoral meddling. The president's personal lawyers might want to tell him that's not how it works - and the president might want to listen. Even if misdirecting the media isn't a crime, the Post points out that it's enough to encourage special counsel Robert Mueller to take a closer look. And if the president, who it now appears had a deep involvement in crafting the response to the Donald Trump Jr email bombshell, did more than just help mislead the American public, he could be in legal jeopardy. At the very least the president is playing with political dynamite by not insulating himself from the investigation. It's a lesson President Richard Nixon learned the hard way during Watergate. But then Mr Trump is operating as president the way he did as a candidate - with a small, sometimes chaotic inner circle, where lines of authority are blurred, ""expert"" advise is often dismissed and all paths lead to Trump. If he - or new chief of staff John Kelly - doesn't change this structure soon, the president may come to regret it. Is Trump closer to obstruction of justice? Mr Trump Jr received an email from an intermediary, British music publicist Rob Goldstone, promising documents from Russia that would incriminate Mrs Clinton. At that time, his father was the presumptive Republican nominee and heading towards an election fight against his Democratic rival. The meeting was reportedly arranged by Russian businessman Aras Agalarov and his son Emin, a pop star who was managed for a time by Mr Goldstone. One email from Mr Goldstone said the information they had been promised was ""obviously very high-level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr Trump"". This video can not be played Donald Trump Jr maintains that there was nothing to tell his father President Trump Mr Trump Jr's response to it was: ""If it's what you say I love it."" Mr Trump Jr, his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and then campaign chairman Paul Manafort met Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in New York. It became apparent, Mr Trump Jr later said, that Ms Veselnitskaya wanted to discuss a suspended programme for Americans to adopt Russian children. Why was this British guy emailing Trump Jr? Trump Jr's email chain: Full text Who said what about Russia in Trump's team? Donald Trump Jr told Fox News' Sean Hannity in July that he did not tell his father about last year's meeting: ""It was such a nothing. There was nothing to tell. ""I mean, I wouldn't have even remembered it until you started scouring through this stuff. It was literally just a wasted 20 minutes, which was a shame."" In retrospect, he would have done things a little differently, Mr Trump Jr told Fox News, but he defended his actions. But the meeting went nowhere, he said, and it was apparent Mrs Clinton was not the subject. He could not vouch for the information he was sent, he said. ""Someone sent me an email. I can't help what someone sends me.  I read it, I responded accordingly, and if there was something interesting there, I think that's pretty common.""

"Palma Airport in Majorca is among those where passengers have faced delays, Abta says New checks at many EU airports have left holidaymakers facing long queues, an airline lobby group has warned. Rule changes brought in after recent terror attacks mean people entering and leaving the Schengen area, which allows passport-free movement across much of the EU, face more security checks. Airlines For Europe (A4E) said people were having to wait for up to four hours and some had missed flights. The European Commission said the delays were ""the price of security"". The new measures introduced in response to attacks in Paris and Brussels mean the details of passengers from non-Schengen countries, such as the UK, are run through databases to alert authorities if they are known to pose a threat. Practically it means that border staff in the affected countries have to swipe each passport through a reader, rather than waving British holidaymakers though as before. This has taken up to two minutes per passenger which has led to delays. A4E, which represents carriers including Easyjet, Ryanair and British Airways-owner IAG, said delays at some airports had increased by 300% compared with last year. Managing director Thomas Reynaert said: ""Travellers face long lines and can't get on their flights. Queuing for up to four hours has been the top record these days. ""Airports like Madrid, Palma de Mallorca, Lisbon, Lyon, Paris-Orly, Milan or Brussels are producing shameful pictures of devastated passengers in front of immigration booths, in lines stretching hundreds of metres."" A4E added that the situation could worsen in the coming weeks as the new regulations have not yet been fully implemented. A spokeswoman for travel trade organisation Abta said: ""New, stricter passport checks are resulting in longer queues at some airports, including Palma, which is already busy due to a significant increase in passenger numbers. ""Tour operators will ensure that customers get to the airport in plenty of time so that they are not in danger of missing their flights."" She urged independent travellers to check for delays with their airlines and ""ensure they factor these longer queuing times into their travel plans when flying"". Border check points should be kept ""sufficiently resourced"" to keep queuing times as short as possible, she added. The European Commission has defended the changes, spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said: ""More checks can lead to more delays and that is the price of security. ""We understand that there are concerns about EU rules leading to longer waiting periods, but let us be very clear - this is about the security of our citizens. ""All EU member states wanted to have the current rules. We cannot have on the one hand, a joint request from member states to have more checks and controls, to increase security, and at the same time have complaints about longer waiting periods."" She said it was the responsibility of member states to provide enough resources to make the checks ""as smooth as possible"", adding it was ""very clear that member states had time to prepare"". The BBC's Brussels reporter, Adam Fleming, said there were issues with smaller airports at the weekend. There were big queues at Malaga and Palma, Majorca as they were not geared up for the delays. Orly airport in Paris was able to draft in extra staff when the management realised there was a problem. He said the airlines were issuing this warning to let people know that any coming delays would not be their fault. The BBC has contacted several airlines and airports. They have said there was no sign of huge delays on Tuesday or any change in advice for passengers with regards to checking in earlier.

"Eight cannon were found during the dredging work More than 20,000 items ranging from a human skull to shoes and sea mines have been discovered during dredging work in Portsmouth Harbour. The work has been carried out to deepen and widen a four-mile (7km) channel to allow the the navy's new 65,000-tonne aircraft carriers to dock. It also uncovered eight cannon, an aircraft engine and 36 anchors. A German sea mine and five bombs uncovered caused major disruption to the area while each was made safe. The devices, found on the seabed, weretowed out to sea and detonatedby the Royal Navy's Explosive Ordnance Disposal team. This video can not be played A total of 36 anchors were found during the work, along with a skull More on this and other stories from across the South of England. A military aircraft engine was among the finds The human skull, which is thought to date back to the Napoleonic Wars, has been passed to police in Portsmouth. Capt Iain Greenlees, who is in charge of the dredging project said: ""There was a burial ground on one of the islands in the harbour and it was almost certainly washed away from there."" Other items included bottles, plates and ceramics - all of which have been passed to archaeologists at Wessex Archaeology for study. The dredging, which started in September 2015, was carried out to allow HMS Queen Elizabeth - due to arrive later this year - and its sister ship, Prince of Wales, to be based at Portsmouth Naval Base. The MoD said specialist dredging vessels have removed 3,200,000 cubic metres of sediment - the equivalent to 1,280 Olympic swimming pools.

"Loggerhead turtles are a threatened species Easyjet passengers were left stranded for two days on a Greek island after a relief flight was cancelled to protect a threatened turtle population. The flight from Zante to London Gatwick was cancelled on Sunday over technical issues, which continued through Monday. The airline apologised but blamed the relief plane not reaching the airport on the island's night flight curfew. Night flights are prohibited on Zante as planes pass over a beach where loggerhead turtles nest. The curfew is in place on the island, which is also known as Zakynthos, because the lights and noise can disturb the animals.

"This video can not be played Is Vogue still relevant today? Anna Murphy and Susie Lau discuss British Vogue's new editor Edward Enninful has officially started his new job. He's the first male editor in the magazine's history and takes over from Alexandra Shulman, whoannouncedher departure in January. She had spent 25 years in the role - a quarter of the magazine's lifetime. The fashion world will be watching with interest to see what Enninful does as editor - his first move on Tuesday was tolaunch Vogue on Snapchat,external. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Here are some of the key areas he's likely to work on: Vogue has been on our shelves for100 years. The magazine retains a loyal readership - the average issue sells 186,000 copies in the UK. But Colin Morrison, a media consultant who writes forFlashes & Flames,external, says that figure includes 26,000 ""multiple copy sales"", where copies are sold at a discounted price to be distributed in shops or airport lounges. ""So their traditional figure is about 160,000 - which is a fair bit lower than the 200,000 they've enjoyed for a long time,"" he says. Given the huge changes to the print industry in recent years, Vogue's sales have arguably held up relatively well. But the figures don't tell us anything about who is still buying the paper magazine - and many younger readers are likely to have migrated online. Alexandra Shulman has been Vogue's editor for the last 25 years Interestingly, the first thing Vogueannounced,externalon Tuesday as Enninful officially took the reins was that the magazine wasjoining Snapchat,external. It suggests Enninful is well aware of one of Vogue's biggest challenges, which is what the magazine's digital presence might be in the future. British Vogue sold 8,000 digital copies per month in the second half of last year - low compared with the physical sales. The online landscape is of course very different to print, with young consumers so used to getting so much content for free. Hannah Rochell, acting fashion editor at the London Evening Standard, says Vogue's online presence will likely get much stronger as it becomes more distinct from its paper counterpart. ""I think they have to make their online content really engaging and to offer something different to what you get in the physical magazine,"" she says. Edward Enninful has already hired Naomi Campbell ""Video content in particular is a very exciting thing for fashion because you can do so many different things with it - so there's huge potential for their online presence to grow."" It's worth bearing in mind thatTeen Vogue,externalhas been a huge success online, speaking in a totally different language to its parent publication. In recent years, publications like Vogue have arguably been overtaken by platforms such as Instagram as the gatekeepers of the fashion industry. Now, if a designer wants to reach the widest possible audience, Vogue is not necessarily the first platform they would choose. Advertisers are more likely to try and get Rihanna or GiGi Hadid to be seen wearing their clothes or posting about them on Twitter and Instagram. Similarly, vloggers and bloggers are now a regular fixture on the front rows of fashion shows - a symbol of their power and influence. Left-right: Stefano Tonchi, Claire Danes and Edward Enninful ""I think the fashion industry is changing all the time in so many ways, and it has indeed moved on to celebrity and digital influencers,"" Rochell says. ""But the fashion industry is good at adapting and keeping up with that sort of trend, so we could well see a change in editorial tone at Vogue to reflect that."" Morrison says that while many traditional media outlets have found a way to make money from online content, advertisers now have far more platforms to choose from. ""Magazines are now quite big digitally, but a huge amount of online advertising now just goes straight to Facebook and Google, so that's the competition that isn't easy for traditional publishers to contend with,"" he says. Enninful has hired Steve McQueen, Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell Enninful has already been busy making some changes at the top of Vogue in the last few months. For starters, he'shiredNaomi Campbell, Steve McQueen, Kate Moss and Adwoa Aboah as contributing editors - just a few names in thehuge overhaul,externalof the editorial team. But perhaps even more interesting than who he's hired is who has departed - a number of senior figures have left the magazine since his appointment was announced. Lucinda Chambers was Vogue's fashion director for 25 years under Shulman In what The Times described as a""posh girl exodus"", veterans such as Lucinda Chambers, Frances Bentley and Emily Sheffield all announced their departures. It wasn't initially clear whether they had jumped or been pushed, but last month Chambers toldVestoj,externalin no uncertain terms: ""I didn't leave. I was fired."" Enninful himself has put a slightly different spin on it. ""I'm really excited to see my vision for the British Vogue team come to fruition,""he said,external.  ""I'm very much looking forward to working with everyone on forthcoming issues."" Enninful (pictured with Naomi Campbell) was made an OBE last year As for how Vogue's new era could be reflected in its pages, Rochell thinks the signs point to a more diverse line-up of models and contributors. ""Diversity is something [Enninful] is very keen on championing, as we've seen in the past with his work, so I think that's definitely something that will be welcomed in the fashion industry as a whole,"" she says. The industry hasfaced criticism,externalrecently for its lack of diversity, but many designers have been trying to improve. The most recent New York Fashion Week attracted publicity for the inclusion ofplus-size models and a hijab catwalk showin its line-up. Rochell adds: ""Alexandra Shulman did a great job as editor, but I think this is a very exciting change and I'm really looking forward to seeing what direction Edward takes things in.""

"Anthony Grainger, PC Ian Terry and Jordan Begley were all killed in separate incidents Greater Manchester Police is facing new investigations by the police watchdog over three separate fatal firearms incidents, the Victoria Derbyshire programme has learned. It raises questions about the conduct of one of the UK's biggest firearms unit at a time when Manchester has recently been hit by a terror attack. A public inquiry into one of the deaths has heard about flawed intelligence, a senior officer destroying notes and employment of an officer disciplined for assault. Its former head of training, John Foxcroft, said he left the firearms unit due to its ""aggressive"" tactics. Many of the officers in the cases are still serving. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said its firearms officers ""volunteer for the role and do a very difficult job, quite rightly under the highest levels of scrutiny"". Here is the story of the three fatal incidents, with new findings uncovered by the Victoria Derbyshire programme's investigation. ""He was a beautiful person inside and out,"" Anthony Grainger's partner Gail says. The couple lived together with their two young children. ""I remember thinking, 'My life's perfect.' Then he nipped out - and he didn't come home."" Anthony Grainger was unarmed in a car when he was shot by police in Cheshire, in March 2012. Police intelligence had suggested he was going to carry out an armed robbery with two associates, also in the car. Mr Grainger had previously been found guilty of handling stolen cars, but had no convictions for violence. The two other men did have convictions for violence. Police saw one as very dangerous. Anthony Grainger was killed by a police marksman Mr Grainger was killed in a car park on a busy Saturday evening in the village of Culcheth. Armed officers said they saw him drop his hands in a move interpreted as him going to grab a gun - he was shot once, fatally. But another man in the car, David Totton, told the inquiry no warning was given before the shot was fired. All three men in the car were unarmed. This video can not be played Gail Hadfield-Grainger explains how she first heard her partner had been shot On the day of the operation, the firearms team had been on duty for 14 hours when it was told to move in. There were 16 firearms officers. Several had failed training courses and it was argued during the public inquiry they should not have been on the operation, which Greater Manchester Police disputed. One officer, known as X7 - who had directed the operation on the ground - had failed a firearms course with the Met Police, who removed him early as his performance was ""adversely affecting other students."" Another, known as Z15, had failed a safety course shortly before the operation after three extreme safety breaches in potentially life-threatening situations. A firearms expert told the inquiry these were so ""fundamental and inherently dangerous"" that it should have led to Z15's ""immediate suspension"". Martin Harding, a former superintendent and firearms officer with Greater Manchester Police, told the BBC: ""A force such as Manchester has got resilience, so there shouldn't be a reason why you would have someone on a job who wasn't trained to carry out their role."" It emerged during the public inquiry that the officer who fired the gun - referred to as Q9 - had seriously injured a suspect during a previous arrest. He had also been disciplined for assaulting two people. He was cleared of 10 other separate assault allegations - and remained a firearms officer. This was not the last serious case Q9 was involved in, we have discovered there was another incident where his conduct was called into question. All the firearms officers in the Grainger case were granted anonymity so will not talk about this other incident in detail. Questions over Mr Grainger's death go right to the top of Greater Manchester Police. During the public inquiry, an assistant chief constable apologised for changing his record of the operation leading up to Anthony Grainger's death, and it was discovered the head of the firearms unit had destroyed his notes when he retired - a year after the shooting. The police watchdog has launched a new investigation into the case. It is the second time the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has looked into the case - which is extremely rare. It told us it is examining evidence given at the public inquiry. Ian Terry was a firearms officer with Greater Manchester Police. In 2008, during a practice exercise at a disused factory, he volunteered to play the role of a criminal fleeing in a car. Unusually, the decision - made just that morning - had been taken to use live rounds to make the exercise more realistic. Mr Terry was shot by an officer using a shotgun loaded with a so-called Rip round cartridge - deadly at close range. He died within minutes. The father-of-two was not wearing body armour. His father, Roy Terry, said the family were told ""he had been involved in an accident at work"". ""We were allowed to believe it was some horrendous accident initially, which in the end it transpired it wasn't really."" Roy Terry said the exercise in which his son died had been made ""too dangerous"" The IPCC was scathing, calling the case ""a shocking wake-up call for Greater Manchester Police firearms unit"". An inquest jury in 2010 ruled Ian Terry had been unlawfully killed and that he ""would have been saved"" if the training had been properly prepared. His father Roy Terry said the exercise had been made ""too dangerous"". ""We got the impression that the firearms officers were more or less allowed just to get on and do their own thing,"" he added. John Foxcroft, who ran the firearms training unit at Greater Manchester Police until 2006, before retiring in 2008, told the programme he left the position believing that the force was ""getting a little bit too much into the aggressive tactics"". ""The more aggressive you get, the more likely you are to have people shot."" The Crown Prosecution Service said there was not enough evidence to bring criminal charges against any officers but Greater Manchester Police was fined for health and safety offences. John Foxcroft, ex-head of training at the firearms unit, claims tactics were becoming too ""aggressive"" In 2014, one of the officers who organised the training was fired from the force. The man who shot Ian Terry was disciplined but still works for the police. Roy Terry said this was ""not totally satisfactory, but all we were going to get"". The BBC has now discovered there is a new investigation by the IPCC into the case, nine years after Ian Terry was killed. The police watchdog said it has started an investigation looking at evidence given by a number of officers to the IPCC, to the inquest into PC Terry's death, and to a subsequent Health and Safety Executive (HSE) crown court trial. GMP's Det Ch Supt Paul Rumney said the force ""will consider any recommendations made"" by the the public inquiry. Jordan Begley was 23. He worked in an ice-cream factory near his home in Gorton in Manchester. On the night of his death, in July 2013, he had been involved in a drunken argument with his neighbours, and was threatening to attack them with a knife. His mother called the police. ""I need the police here. You need to get the police here. Jordan stay here, you're not going out,"" she can be heard saying in the recorded 999 call. A patrol officer calmed him down - then other officers arrived, 11 in total, including armed police. Mr Begley was Tasered and restrained by armed officers. He was punched while he was on the ground and died from heart failure. ""It was a shock. They didn't need that many officers for one person. He was harmless,"" his cousin Conor Turner explained. At a 2015 inquest the jury found police failings played a part in his death and said he had been unlawfully killed. It said the force ""inappropriately and unreasonably"" used the Taser for longer than was necessary, once he was on the floor,+ the firearms officers did not try to establish whether he was conscious, and that during restraint Mr Begley ""offered minimal resistance"" with ""no need"" to punch him twice. The police were initially cleared of any blame but after the inquest the police watchdog quashed its first report and started a new investigation - which had never been done before.

"Armed prisoners were understood to have taken over a wing of the category C men's prison Riot-trained staff have been sent to HMP The Mount in Hertfordshire for the second day running. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said armed prisoners took over Nash Wing and smashed windows, according to well-placed sources. The Ministry of Justice said order was restored shortly before 17:00 BST. About 30 inmates at Erlestoke prison in Wiltshire also became violent and four people were taken to hospital, the Prison Officers Association said. Live: Latest updates as trouble reported at HMP The Mount At Erlestoke a prison officer suffered a broken jaw, it added. The acting chairman of the association, Mark Fairhurst, told the BBC that more than 80 inmates were unlocked on a wing at the jail at the time - with ""a nucleus of about 30 prisoners being involved in the violence"". The MoJ has confirmed that some prison officers were taken to hospital but would not confirm the number or the nature of their injuries. This video can not be played HMP The Mount: Footage shows riot-trained staff at jail Following the end of the problems at The Mount, a Prison Service spokesperson said: ""Specially trained prison staff have successfully resolved an incident at HMP The Mount on 1 August. There were no injuries to staff or prisoners. ""We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and are clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and could spend longer behind bars."" HMP The Mount was designed as a category C training prison built on the site of a former RAF station on the outskirts of Bovingdon village, Hertfordshire The Mount Prison opened in 1987 as a young offenders institution. It was designed as a category C training prison built on the site of a former RAF station on the outskirts of Bovingdon village, Hertfordshire. A report in 2016 by the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) found ""all the ingredients were in place for The Mount to suffer disorder such as has been experienced in other prisons: Staff shortages, Readily available drugs Mounting violence The prison now has a population of more than 1,000 prisoners. The Nash wing is fairly new - it was completed in 2015 - with 94 double cells and 62 single cells. On Monday at least 50 cells are thought to have been damaged when violence broke out in two wings at The Mount. No-one was injured on that occasion. Riot officers entered HMP The Mount on Monday A Hertfordshire Constabulary spokeswoman said: ""Following [Monday's] incident we are working with the Ministry of Justice and are currently reviewing what, if any offences, have occurred."" The Mount, near Hemel Hempstead, opened in 1987 and is classed as a category C male prison. Nash wing is believed to hold between 200 and 250 inmates serving short sentences or with only three months left to serve of their sentence. HMP Erlestoke is also a category C men's prison, which the Prison Reform Trust describes as one where ""prison staff think [inmates] will not escape"", while acknowledging they ""cannot be trusted in an open prison"". Incidents take place in prisons all the time; it's usually problems with one or two individuals, and most go unreported. When an incident like this take place - when tornado (specialist riot) teams are involved - it takes it up to a new level. When you have prisoners rioting or barricading themselves in, with staff having to withdraw, that is very serious. Problems at the Mount have been brewing for some time. The independent inspectors that go into prisons were saying they were 25 staff short out of 136  - that is a significant shortfall. Last week the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) published its annual report into Erlestoke, and said that the smuggling of tobacco, which has been banned by the prison, had contributed to bullying. Before the violence broke out on Monday, the IMB also published itsannual review,externalinto conditions at The Mount and said it had ""struggled"" with staff shortages. There were 24 vacancies out of a total of 136 officers in February, it added. Riot officers with shields were called to attend HMP The Mount on Monday It also claimed violence ""grew considerably"" throughout the year and that drugs were readily available, in particular the synthetic cannabis substitute spice. The report said concerns raised last year had not been addressed by the MoJ. HMP Erlestoke is a Category C establishment holding adult male sentenced offenders. A 2017 IMB report on the prison found that lack of experienced officers was a concern. It found: Tobacco smuggling had become an issue since the prison became smoke free on 1 April 2016 Abuse of the drug Spice was an increasing concern A death from Spice was ""only a matter of time"" The prison has 388 prisoners with 115 of them serving a life sentence.

"It's no secret that Theresa May lost her majority in June's election and that Jeremy Corbyn won more seats than expected. But what was really behind the decisions made by the UK's voters? For the past three years the British Election Study has followed a panel of the same 30,000 voters - asking them hundreds of questions about their political views and choices on 13 occasions. It offers the most detailed look at the issues which most concerned the electorate - and the results are now in. Despite Mrs May's claim that her reason for calling an early election was to get a mandate for the Brexit negotiations, the issue of Brexit itself had a relatively low profile during campaigning. For much of the campaign, both the Conservatives and Labour focused on other issues. But in the minds of the voters at least, the 2017 election was - as it promised to be ever since the referendum of June 2016 - the Brexit election. Thiscan be seen in our data,externalin many different ways, but nowhere more clearly, perhaps, than in the answer to the question: ""As far as you're concerned, what is the single most important issue facing the country at the present time?"" More than one in three people chose Brexit or the EU, compared with fewer than one in 10 who mentioned the NHS and one in 20 who suggested the economy. Of course, actions speak louder than words, and voters were not only concerned by Brexit but actually voted accordingly. The issue cut across normal party loyalties and contributed to the revival of the Conservative and Labour parties at the expense of challenger parties - including UKIP, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Greens - which had done so well in 2015. Because the British Election Study tracked the same voters during the 2015 election, the EU referendum and the 2017 election, we can see for the first time how voters switched party allegiance depending on their referendum vote. The Conservatives' position on Brexit, coupled with the absence of Nigel Farage, saw the UKIP vote collapse and the majority of its support go to the Tories. More than half of UKIP's 2015 voters who voted again in 2017 switched to the Conservatives, compared with only 18% to Labour and a further 18% who stayed loyal. Labour picked up a few Leave voters, but lost roughly equal numbers to the Conservatives - undoubtedly the party of Leave. But which was the party of Remain? Despite having the clearest pro-EU position and a promise of a second referendum, the Liberal Democrats failed to pick up many more Remain voters than they lost. Instead, Labour, which was already the most popular party in 2015 among those who voted Remain in 2016, scooped the lion's share. Despite uncertainty over its position on the single market, Labour was seen as the best bet by those wanting to keep closer ties with Europe. Not only did it win over a large number of Remainers from the Conservatives, but also from the pro-EU Greens and Lib Dems. Overall, nearly two-thirds of 2015 Greens went to Labour, as well as about a quarter of Liberal Democrats. The results in maps and charts Six key lessons from a surprise result Which seats changed hands? One of the reasons Labour did so well among Remainers is that by the time the election was called, the Brexit debate was not so much about Leave or Remain but about how to leave. The tens of thousands of voters we surveyed were asked whether it was more important for the government to ""protect Britain's access to the single market, or to gain full control of immigration"". The results reveal a striking correlation between wanting to control immigration and voting Tory on one hand, and wanting access to the single market and voting Labour or Lib Dem on the other. For example, the Conservatives lead Labour by more than 40 percentage points among those most in favour of full control of immigration, with Labour having a similar lead among those wanting complete access to the single market. In effect this meant the Tories were the party of hard Brexit, while Labour was the party of soft Brexit. The Lib Dems were not the first choice for those favouring a soft Brexit - possibly because of the lingering effects of coalition government, a perception of ineffective leadership and a realisation that they could not win in most seats. Although this was a Brexit election, it would be clearly wrong to say the election outcome was determined back in June 2016. More than at any British election in recent memory, the election campaign really did matter. Our pre-election survey, carried out in April and May, found that the Conservatives enjoyed a healthy lead over Labour of 41% to 27%. But by the last three days of the campaign, our daily panel put the two main parties neck and neck. Overall, 19% of voters switched parties between the April/May survey and the election. This is similar to the amount of ""churn"" we saw in 2015, when 17% of voters switched parties, and slightly less than at the 2010 and 2005 elections. But the significant difference in 2017 was that the flow was overwhelmingly in one direction. In 2015, Labour and the Conservatives both won about a quarter of these late-switching voters - effectively cancelling each other out. However, in 2017 Labour won 54% of switchers, compared with 19% for the Conservatives. Additionally, Labour won more than half of those who hadn't made up their minds before the campaign. 10 ways the PM blew her majority The Corbyn factor Election delivers most diverse Parliament The main reason that Labour did so well during the campaign is the strong performance of Jeremy Corbyn, especially relative to Theresa May. At the start of the campaign, Mr Corbyn lagged far behind Mrs May in leader ""like scores"" - in which voters award a mark out of 10. Mr Corbyn's score of 3.5 was slightly worse than predecessor Ed Miliband's at a similar point in 2015. However, by the end of the campaign Mr Corbyn had caught up with Mrs May, with both on 4.4. And although Mrs May was still rated as the leader who would make the best prime minister, the gap had narrowed considerably. Mr Corbyn's strong performance - or perhaps Mrs May's poor campaign - also meant that Labour closed the gap with the Conservatives when voters were asked which party was best placed to handle the issue they considered the most important for the country. Over the course of the campaign Labour managed to broaden its appeal, winning over voters who were initially rather lukewarm about Mr Corbyn. Labour also widened its appeal to more moderate voters on a number of issues, dramatically narrowing the gap with the Conservatives. During the campaign, previously undecided left-leaning voters and supporters of a soft Brexit were most likely to switch to Labour. Many of these had previously voted Labour in 2010 and 2015 and so perhaps were ""coming home"". While this was undoubtedly the Brexit election, it was also a tale of two leaders and a campaign that mattered. The Conservative strategy to pin so much on their ""strong and stable"" leader appears to have been a spectacular mistake which ultimately cost them an overall majority.

"From Tuesday 1 August, most new students of areas such as nursing, midwifery and physiotherapy will no longer be able to apply for grants, and will have access instead to the student loans system. UCAS announced earlier this year that there had been a notable decrease in students from England applying to do at least one nursing course, saying it had fallen 23% to 33,810 in 2017. Chancellor Philip Hammond spoke last week about the ""very high numbers of foreign workers keeping our NHS going"". Looking at thefigures from NHS Digital,external, overall, 82% of NHS staff are UK nationals, with 5% from the European Economic Area (EEA, that's the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and 6% from the rest of the world. The remaining 7% are of unknown nationalities. The unknowns are relatively high because they come from electronic staff records, not HR information, and it is not compulsory for staff to declare their nationalities for those records. For doctors, it's 70% UK, 9% EEA, 16% from the rest of the world and 5% unknown. And for nurses and health visitors it is 78% UK, 7% EEA, 8% from the rest of the world and 6% unknown. To put that into context, according to thelatest labour market figures,externalfrom the Office for National Statistics (ONS), 7.3% of workers in the UK are EU nationals while 3.9% are from the rest of the world. Clearly, the unknowns throw comparisons out a bit, but the proportion of NHS staff from the EEA appears to be a bit below the workforce as a whole while there are considerably more from the rest of the world than the workforce average. For doctors, there are proportionally more foreign nationals than in the workforce as a whole, especially for those from the rest of the world. If you look at thefigures for where doctors earned their qualifications,external, the rest of the world comes even higher with 27%, compared with 64% from the UK and 9% from the EEA. Nurses from the EEA work in the NHS in the same proportion as the rest of the workforce while nurses from the rest of the world are overrepresented.

"The priests saw the funny side of the misunderstanding Pub bosses have apologised after asking a group of trainee priests to leave their Cardiff venue, mistaking them for a stag party in fancy dress. Theseven Roman Catholic seminarians,externalhad gone to The City Arms to toast Father Peter McClaren's ordination when they were asked to move on. But assistant manager Matt Morgan said they received a free round of drinks when the situation was explained. ""They were all dressed in their black and white clothes,"" he said. ""The staff thought they were a stag. We do have quite a few issues on the weekends with parties wearing fancy dress so it is our policy to turn them away."" The priests enjoyed a few pints in the pub in the end Father Michael Doyle, who knows the group, said the seven went to the pub in Quay Street to celebrate the ordination at Cardiff Metropolitan Cathedral of St David in nearby Charles Street. He added the pub was a favourite of his colleagues including the Archbishop of Cardiff, George Stack. ""They arrived at The City Arms and they were dressed wearing the clerical collar,"" he said. ""The doorman basically said something along the lines of, 'sorry gents, we have a policy of no fancy dress and no stag dos'."" The students had started to leave when they were approached by the bar manager. ""He basically said, 'you're real, aren't you?',"" said Fr Doyle. ""He invited them back in and when they walked back in the entire pub burst into a round of applause, and they had a free round off The City Arms."" Six of the priests who were turned away from the pub Fr Doyle said the group stayed at the pub most of the afternoon chatting to customers. Mr Morgan said the priests were ""all great sports and saw the funny side of the situation"".

"Armed prisoners were understood to have taken over a wing of the category C men's prison Riot-trained staff have been sent to HMP The Mount in Hertfordshire for the second day running. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said armed prisoners took over Nash Wing and smashed windows, according to well-placed sources. The Ministry of Justice said order was restored shortly before 17:00 BST. About 30 inmates at Erlestoke prison in Wiltshire also became violent and four people were taken to hospital, the Prison Officers Association said. Live: Latest updates as trouble reported at HMP The Mount At Erlestoke a prison officer suffered a broken jaw, it added. The acting chairman of the association, Mark Fairhurst, told the BBC that more than 80 inmates were unlocked on a wing at the jail at the time - with ""a nucleus of about 30 prisoners being involved in the violence"".

"Vanessa Feltz and Claudia Winkleman are among the BBC's highest-paid female stars A Sunday Times columnist has apologised to Vanessa Feltz and Claudia Winkleman after suggesting they earned high salaries because they were Jewish. Kevin Myers said he was ""very, very sorry"" for offending the broadcasters and said he was genuinely contrite. Mr Myers, whom the paper has said it would not commission again, told Irish broadcaster RTÃ he had ""uttered those words out of respect for the religion"". His article on BBC equal pay was in the paper's Irish edition and online. He said it was ""over for him professionally"", adding that he was both the author of the article and his own misfortunes. ""I'm the master of my soul and I must answer for what I have done,"" he said in a radio interview with presenter Sean O'Rourke. ""I cannot blame anybody else."" Mr Myers insisted he was neither anti-Semitic nor a misogynist. ""I've got serious professional flaws. I'm not sure that anyone is going to see those professional flaws in future, because I'm not sure I have a career in which to show them,"" he said. One of his flaws was to deal with major issues in throwaway lines, he added. ""The throwaway line is so often my pitfall,"" he said, blaming his own ""stupidity"". Mr Myers said his career was over and he was not trying to rescue it by apologising Asked if the Sunday Times was right to fire him, he replied: ""Yeah. I think so,"" although he felt that the manner in which the matter was handled could have been better. Mr Myers said he had made an error of judgement. Since it happened, he said, he had not slept, had lost his livelihood and was ""in a very bad way"". ""I'm not sure if there is any redemption for me now which will give a lot of people satisfaction,"" he added. Feltz described the article as""so obviously racist it's surprisingly hurtful"". The piece was taken down following anger on social media and a formal complaint from theCampaign Against Anti-Semitism,externalto press regulator Ipso. Mr Myers' column - entitled ""Sorry, ladies - equal pay has to be earned"" - was published last Sunday and centred on theBBC gender pay row. Commenting that two of the best-paid presenters, Winkleman and Feltz, were Jewish, Mr Myers wrote: ""Good for them. ""Jews are not generally noted for their insistence on selling their talent for the lowest possible price, which is the most useful measure there is of inveterate, lost-with-all-hands stupidity."" The article has been removed following outcry at its content In the article, he also argued that male presenters might earn more because they ""work harder, get sick less frequently and seldom get pregnant"". Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens said the piece should not have been published. Frank Fitzgibbon, editor of the Sunday Times Ireland, said he took ""full responsibility"", adding: ""This newspaper abhors anti-Semitism and did not intend to cause offence to Jewish people."" However, an Irish Jewish leader has defended Mr Myers. Maurice Cohen, from the Jewish Representative Council of Ireland, said Mr Myers ""inadvertently stumbled into an anti-Semitic trope"". ""More than any other Irish journalist he has written columns about details of the Holocaust over the last three decades that would not otherwise have been known by a substantial Irish audience,"" he said. ""We, who have been reading Kevin's work over many years and those who know him personally, know that while this was a real error of judgement on his part, also know that he is not an anti-Semite.""

"Cpl John Fernandez was a ""true tiger"", his commanding officer said A British soldier has been arrested following a car crash that killed an infantryman on a UK base in Cyprus. The Royal Military Police said it was investigating the death of Cpl John Fernandez, 32, of the 2nd Battalion the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, who died following an incident on Saturday. The Ministry of Defence said he died in a road traffic incident while walking at a UK military base in Dhekelia. ""A thorough investigation is now under way,"" a MoD spokesman said. ""British Forces Cyprus can confirm that a member of the British military has been arrested in connection to the road traffic incident on 29 July which resulted in the death of Corporal John Fernandez. ""It would be inappropriate to comment any further at this time."" Lt Col James Skelton, commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment - also known as the Tigers - said Cpl Fernandez was ""the finest of men and a true Tiger"". ""He stood out from his peers as an exemplary infantry soldier, a leader and a servant to his soldiers. ""His example of fitness, courage and personal discipline stand as a marker as to what we, as infantrymen, can all aspire to be. ""More importantly he was a great friend to so many in the battalion who sought the friendship of a kind, funny and genuinely good man. His loss is keenly felt by each and every one of us. ""Along with his family and friends, the Tigers mourn his loss, but at the same time we must celebrate his memory and follow his example in life."" Cpl Fernandez had recently been nominated for a commendation for his actions during an explosive attack at the base's police station in Dhekelia last month.

"The incident took place as the suspects were being escorted in the building Three defendants have been killed in a court in the Russian capital, Moscow, after they tried to take the arms from officers in an attempt to escape, officials say. Five suspected gang members attacked two agents who were escorting them in a lift, the Investigative Committee said. The group was handcuffed and it was not immediately clear how they managed to free themselves to attack the guards. The two other suspects and three security officers were wounded. The suspects were accused of being part of a group known as GTA Gang, named after the violent game series Grand Theft Auto. The group of Central Asian nationals was suspected of killing 17 motorists in the Moscow area between 2012 and 2014. Cars were forced to stop on a main road and their drivers were killed for reasons as yet unknown; none of their possessions were stolen. In the court, one of the suspects attacked and tried to strangle an agent, as others attempted to seize the officers' weapons, Russia's Investigative Committee said in a statement. When the lift they were in opened on the third floor, Russian National Guard officers opened fire, killing three of the suspects as they tried to escape, the statement added. The fact that the suspects were in any position to assault security agents inside the court and even attempt an armed escape is likely to raise questions, BBC Russian's Oleg Boldyrev in Moscow reports. Suspects are usually brought into courtrooms handcuffed, with their arms crossed behind their backs, so this turn of events will probably be seen as bizarre, our correspondent adds. The building was evacuated following the shooting The security officers injured include a National Guard member, who had a gunshot wound and was taken to hospital, and two police officers, who sustained various injuries, according to the Interior Ministry. A lawyer who was at the building when the incident happened said that at least 20 shots were heard. The members of the gang are accused of murder, banditry and other crimes, the Investigative Committee said.

"Author JK Rowling has apologised for incorrectly accusing Donald Trump of ignoring a disabled boy. A video emerged that appeared to show the US president refusing to shake the boy's hand at the White House. ""How stunning, and how horrible, that Trump cannot bring himself to shake the hand of a small boy who only wanted to touch the president,"" the author said. But Marjorie Kelly Weer, mother of Monty, said Rowling's interpretation of the clip was wrong. Rowling hits back over book burning threats How Harry Potter enchanted the world The Harry Potter author tweeted: ""Re: my tweets about the small boy in a wheelchair whose proffered hand the president appeared to ignore in press footage. ""Multiple sources have informed me that that was not a full or accurate representation of their interaction. ""I very clearly projected my own sensitivities around the issue of disabled people being overlooked or ignored onto the images I saw and if that caused any distress to that boy or his family, I apologise unreservedly.""

"This video can not be played David Hall was just 14 when he made the discovery A hoard of Roman silver discovered by a teenage metal detectorist in his ""first proper find"" is to go on display in Scotland. David Hall, from Livingston who is now 16, found the hacksilver in Fife when he was aged 14, in 2014. The silver was believed to have been used by Roman soldiers to bribe Picts while passing through Scotland. David said he did not initially realise the importance of the find and is excited to see how it now looks. The Dairsie hoard dates to the late 3rd century AD and is the earliest hacksilver from anywhere beyond the frontiers of the Roman Empire. The find has been hailed as ""internationally significant"" and will go on show for the first time in a new exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland in October. David told BBC Scotland he first became interested in metal detecting after watching an American TV programme. He then saved up and bought a ""low-end"" detector. Archaeologists think the silver came to Fife as a gift or payment He had only been using it for a few months when he came across the silver. ""It was quite a boring day,"" he said. ""I was at a rally with 103 metal detectorists and we were looking in three fields and nothing had come up. ""All of a sudden I found a few bits of silver and I showed it to a friend who said it was Roman and after that we found another 200 pieces on the first day."" Hacksilver consists of silver objects hacked into pieces to make raw bullion. Archaeologists think the silver came to Fife as a gift or payment from the Roman world. The Romans could not just rely on the strength of their army - they also used diplomatic efforts to secure the empire's borders by buying off surrounding tribes. As well as being hacked-up by the Romans, the hoard had been shattered by ploughing. Curators have been piecing the silver back together Curators have undertaken a daunting jigsaw puzzle, reconstructing four Roman vessels from more than 300 fragments, as well as examining how they had been cut into packages of bullion. David said: ""This was really my first proper find. ""I didn't realise how important it was at first, but it's been really exciting to be able to come and see what National Museums' curators and conservators have been able to do to clean it up and to examine it to work out what it is. ""It looks really different now. It's great to have unearthed a piece of history and I'm looking forward to seeing it on display at the museum."" David Hall had only been using his metal detector for a few months when he came across the silver The silver will go on display at the National Museum of Scotland in October Dr Fraser Hunter, principal curator at National Museums Scotland said: ""New archaeological evidence is rewriting our understanding of Roman frontier politics, and silver was a key part of this. ""It's a fascinatingly complex picture that shows interaction and realpolitik, with the Romans changing their approach to deal with different emerging problems, and local tribes taking advantage of Roman 'gifts'. The Dairsie hoard is internationally significant. ""It's the earliest evidence for a new phase of Roman policy in dealing with troublesome tribes, using bribes of silver bullion in the form of hacked silver vessels. ""It's been great to show David Hall, the finder, the next steps in translating a find like this from the field, through the laboratories and on to public display."" The exhibition, Scotland's Early Silver, will show for the first time how silver, not gold, became the most important precious metal in Scotland over the course of the first millennium AD. New research and recent archaeological discoveries will chart the first thousand years of silver in Scotland.

"British Gas will increase electricity prices by 12.5% from 15 September, its owner Centrica has said, in a move that will affect 3.1 million customers. Gas prices are unchanged, but the average annual dual-fuel bill for a typical household on a standard tariff will rise by Â£76 to Â£1,120, up by 7.3%. Centrica said the rise was a result of transmission and distribution costs and the costs of government policy. But the government said its policy costs ""could not explain"" the rises. Centrica said the price increase was its first since November 2013, adding that British Gas was one of the last suppliers to raise prices. The company said it would protect its most ""vulnerable customers"" against the rise and that British Gas would credit more than 200,000 people on the government's Warm Home Discount with Â£76. This video can not be played Centrica boss says the price rise is partly down to government policy Centrica chief executive Iain Conn told theBBC's Today programmethat wholesale costs had gone down and were not the reason for the price rise. ""We have seen our wholesale costs fall by about Â£36 on the typical bill since the beginning of 2014 and that is not the driver. It is transmission and distribution of electricity to the home and government policy costs that are driving our price increase."" How to switch energy supplier He added: ""We are selling electricity at a loss and that is not sustainable."" British Gas had frozen its gas and electricity prices for six months in February, saying at the time it was able to do so by cutting costs to offset higher wholesale prices. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""Energy firms should treat all their customers fairly and we're concerned this price rise will hit many people already on poor value tariffs. ""Government policy costs make up a relatively small proportion of household energy bills and cannot explain these price rises."" ""In response to a letter from the Business and Energy Secretary asking what action the regulator intended to take to safeguard customers on the poorest value tariffs and the future of the standard variable tariff, Ofgem has committed to taking prompt action, in consultation with consumer experts, to develop proposals including a safeguard tariff. ""We want to see rapid progress on this commitment."" Alex Neill of Which? magazine urged British Gas customers on the standard variable tariff deal to switch to another provider immediately. ""For the customers of British Gas, they won't really care about any of this squabbling about who's to blame for the costs or the price rises,"" she said. ""At the end of the day, these people are now paying another Â£76 on top of what is already more than Â£1,000 a year for a bill. And they're not really seeing the difference in value that they are getting from British Gas for that Â£76."" Centrica tried to land the blame for higher bills partly on the government's doormat, but the government wasn't having it. Renewable targets, smart meter rollout, subsidies for insulation and other social and environmental policies were a big factor driving prices higher. The government abandoned a manifesto promise to cap energy bills and instead threw this perennially hot potato to the regulator Ofgem, which is currently consulting on what action to take. Umpteen probes, competition reviews, promises or threats of caps or nationalisation - the problem of what to do about energy remains as thorny as ever. The government has reiterated its position that it is not ruling anything out - either by regulation or legislation. That means that although it's on the back-burner for now, an energy price cap is still officially an option. Shadow energy minister Alan Whitehead toldthe Today programmethat he believed the government should have acted on its pre-election promise of imposing a price cap on energy costs. ""It is really important now that energy prices are stabilised and we need a cap to do that,"" he said. ""We also need action on the make-up of the customer base of energy companies. It clearly is not sustainable as far as customers are concerned being on mainly these standard variable tariffs, which land the greatest cost on the customers who can least bear it on a regular basis."" This video can not be played Shadow energy minister Alan Whitehead urges the government to keep its pre-election promise of an energy price cap Former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: ""This is a colossal increase that will really hurt customers already struggling with rising prices due to the deteriorating economic situation. ""As a former public utility, British Gas has a huge number of customers who don't switch and is clearly treating these people like cash cows. ""We need to open up the market to more competition to drive down prices and take action to help lower income families. As things stand, there will be a lot of people in fuel poverty this winter shivering in homes they cannot afford to heat or even light."" Centrica Consumer chief executive Mark Hodges said: ""We held off increasing prices for many months longer than most suppliers in order to protect our customers from rising costs, so it is a difficult decision to have to announce an increase in electricity prices."" The company added that 5.3 million of its customers would be unaffected by the rise. The news came as Centrica's half-year results revealed that it lost 377,000 customer accounts in the first half of 2017, with its consumer earnings dropping by more than a quarter as a result. Underlying operating profits from its UK home energy supply arm fell 26% to Â£381m as the group said it was also hit by warmer than normal temperatures and the pre-payment tariff cap. Centrica's overall underlying operating profits were 4% lower at Â£816m for the six months to 30 June. Are you a British Gas electricity customer?

"Hundreds of people work for the US in Moscow and other Russian cities. What are they all doing there? Over the weekend Russia President Vladimir Putin said that the US had to reduce its diplomatic staff in the country by more than 750 people. It was a startling development in US-Russia relations, exposing tension between the two countries that arises from new sanctions imposed on Russia, and suspicions about meddling in the US election. For many it also raised a question: why are so many people working at the US embassy in Moscow and in other places around Russia? By some estimates, there are 1,200 US state employees in the country. The number seems high - at first glance. Yet it makes sense for those who are working at the White House and trying to manage a challenging, tumultuous relationship with Russia. How Trump's Russia trouble unfolded The US and Russia: An uncertain path Reality Check: What are the sanctions against Russia? Americans and Russians have important areas of co-operation: they're working together to combat militant groups, assure the security of nuclear weapons in both countries, and reduce violence in Syria. Besides that, the US exports billions of dollars worth of products to Russia every year. But they also fight about things: aside from the controversy over election meddling, they're trying to work out issues such Russia's territorial ambition and its expansion in the region. US officials say that monitoring Russia's activities and keeping abreast with the different aspects of the relationship requires a lot of support in Moscow. To that end, Americans in Russia are involved in a variety of undertakings - in different locations. Most work in Moscow, but some are employed in offices in Vladivostok, St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg. In Moscow and the other cities, Americans process visa applications for Russians who want to travel to the US. In addition, they write cables to officials in Washington about human rights, labour and other matters. Some of them work on agricultural, scientific and public-health initiatives that, for example, help to protect rare wildlife and combat infectious diseases. Some work in Russia for other government agencies, as the CIA and US intelligence agencies are euphemistically known. The number of people in Russia who are employed by the US intelligence agencies is substantial, although specifics are unavailable. Georgetown University's Angela Stent, who used to work as a national intelligence officer, laughed at the question. ""Nobody knows that,"" she said. Still most of the people who work at the embassy and in other US offices in Russia are not spies or spymasters; most, in fact, are not even US citizens. They're Russian. Of the 1,279 people who worked at the embassy in 2013, according to a 2013 inspector generalreport,external, 934 were locally hired. The Russian staff help to organise events, process visas, fix computers and otherwise keep the place running. For them, Putin's announcement was troubling. ""These people will lose their jobs,"" said Yuval Weber, a fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington. It also means that Russians will have a harder time getting visas for their trips to the US: at this point, he said, it takes two to five weeks for them to get a visa. With a reduced staff, it will take longer.

"Mary Berry said the series would ""encourage proper home cooking"" The BBC has announced a new TV cookery competition - with Mary Berry as the lead judge. Britain's Best Cook will be broadcast on BBC One and presented by Claudia Winkleman. The BBC said 10 contestants will compete across eight episodes, serving meals that reflect both the modern and classic dishes of British home cooking. Berry said: ""I am never more at home than when I have my judging hat on."" She continued: ""This series is going to encourage proper home cooking, which I have always championed and I cannot wait to start. Claudia, for me, is the icing on the cake."" The 82-year-old will be joined by a second judge - but their identity hasn't yet been revealed. Winkleman and Berry were pictured with Nigella Lawson at the BBC's factual launch in June Winkleman said: ""I am over the moon to be part of this show. Am slightly obsessed with Mary so will follow her around with my own moussaka for most of the filming. Apologies in advance."" The BBC announcement said contestants will have to prove they have the ""skills and repertoire, technical ability, resourcefulness and creativity"" to be crowned Britain's Best Cook.

"Tyne Cot is one of more than 150 cemeteries around Ypres Like most 20-somethings, soldier Edward Woolley was no stranger to heartbreak. His girlfriend, Bessie, had ended their engagement while he was on World War One's front line, near Ypres, in Belgium. ""If you see her again tell her I have got another girl, it makes no difference whether I have got one or not,"" 22-year-old Edward wrote to his sister, Rose, on 31 June 1917. Weeks later, on 22 August, he was killed in the now-infamous Battle of Passchendaele. A century on, his niece Ann Phillips has travelled from Somerset to Tyne Cot, a cemetery near Ypres, for a service to mark 100 years since the battle, which turned this region into a muddy wasteland. Passchendaele ceremony honours 'bravery' The untold army of women nurses The village that gave its men to war The shepherd poet of Passchendaele She wears a white dress decorated with poppies as she finds her Uncle Ted's name on the cemetery's Memorial to the Missing, listed alongside 35,000 other missing soldiers. ""Mum always said he was the favourite of her four brothers,"" says Ann, 70, whose uncle made bicycles and lived in Bath before the battle. ""She thought it was a pity no-one had been out to pay their respects, but now I think, 'Well, Mum, we've done our bit, we've done what you couldn't.' ""The extent of the cemeteries has hit home quite how disastrous the death toll was in World War One,"" she adds. Ann Phillips travelled to Ypres to remember her uncle, Edward Woolley It is clear that Uncle Ted's story is just one family's tragedy among thousands. Once a battlefield of mud, Tyne Cot is now an immaculately maintained cemetery. It is one of more than 150 cemeteries around Ypres, all of which are carefully kept by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Nearly 4,000 relatives of soldiers have travelled here for Monday's service, but their numbers are dwarfed by rows of pristine graves and the imposing stone Memorial to the Missing. A few miles away in Ypres, the city has hosted a weekend of song, poetry and plays, which told stories of heroism and sacrifice during battle. But today strikes a solemn, more contemplative tone. The service is reserved for Belgian and British royalty, and relatives of soldiers invited by the government in a public ballot to take part. ""Uncle Ted"" in his military uniform, and when he was a teenager living in Bath People are reading names on headstones before they take their seats. Some of those who died are startlingly young - two graves are for boys aged just 17, while the memorial lists three missing soldiers who were 16 and presumably lied about their ages to fight. Many were a similar age to student Daniel Fay, 20, who is here with his dad, Stephen, to remember his great great uncle, James McBarrons. James, 28, was a Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and worked as a labourer in Paisley, but never returned from Passchendaele. He died on 27 October 1917 from an abdominal wound, most likely from artillery. ""It's overwhelming to take in how much they gave,"" says Daniel, who studies illustration at Exeter University. Daniel Fay travelled to the memorial with his dad, Stephen ""When you think of the Pals battalions, it makes me think of my group of friends who would have been the same age."" This is not Daniel's first trip to Ypres. He first went to the cemeteries in Belgium aged seven with his father, and the pair will spend the next few days ""roaming around the different sites"" in Belgium. ""You'd never have guessed there was a four-year world war that raged here,"" he says. Daniel adds that his only wish is to learn more about James, whose brother Patrick also died in World War One. Many people attending Monday's service have only recently discovered their connection to Passchendaele. Cdr Fiona Shepherd, a Royal Navy logistics planner, has been piecing together the life and death of her great great uncle Harold Baker, from South Staffordshire, whose body was never found. But she says a number of unknown graves in nearby Polygon Wood - a cemetery near Ypres with 87 war dead - are marked with Harold's regiment and she believes one is his final resting place. Cdr Fiona Shepherd began her hunt for her great great uncle with a handful of photographs Remarkably, Fiona managed to plot Harold's final advance in Ypres using British army war diaries and concentration returns, which show the location of bodies buried where men fell in the battle. ""I used Google Maps and tracing paper to find the route he would have taken on his last day, physically through the fields,"" she says. ""I probably got to about 100 metres to the spot at Polygon Wood where he was killed and found a shell just lying in a ditch, it was really quite poignant - it had been raining."" Fiona started her search with a handful of photographs of a man they wrongly believed to be called Reginald, as well as his home address in Liverpool. She asked for help online and a woman in Liverpool, where Harold had lived, went to the local registry and found out his real name, leading to the discovery that he is remembered at Tyne Cot's memorial. ""It's hugely special to be here,"" says Fiona - who despite camping overnight in Ypres is wearing an immaculate military uniform. ""I wish anybody killed in those events could know that 100 years on all this effort is going in to commemorate what they did."" She says the photos are the only insight she has into what Harold was like as a person. ""We have no medal, diaries or letters,"" she says. ""One shows a vibrant and youthful young man at a family wedding. ""We have another of him in uniform - probably from 1914 or 1915 - and he looks weary. He looks like he's seen something.""

"This video can not be played Is Vogue still relevant today? Anna Murphy and Susie Lau discuss British Vogue's new editor Edward Enninful has officially started his new job. He's the first male editor in the magazine's history and takes over from Alexandra Shulman, whoannouncedher departure in January. She had spent 25 years in the role - a quarter of the magazine's lifetime. The fashion world will be watching with interest to see what Enninful does as editor - his first move on Tuesday was tolaunch Vogue on Snapchat,external. Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Here are some of the key areas he's likely to work on: Vogue has been on our shelves for100 years. The magazine retains a loyal readership - the average issue sells 186,000 copies in the UK. But Colin Morrison, a media consultant who writes forFlashes & Flames,external, says that figure includes 26,000 ""multiple copy sales"", where copies are sold at a discounted price to be distributed in shops or airport lounges. ""So their traditional figure is about 160,000 - which is a fair bit lower than the 200,000 they've enjoyed for a long time,"" he says. Given the huge changes to the print industry in recent years, Vogue's sales have arguably held up relatively well. But the figures don't tell us anything about who is still buying the paper magazine - and many younger readers are likely to have migrated online. Alexandra Shulman has been Vogue's editor for the last 25 years Interestingly, the first thing Vogueannounced,externalon Tuesday as Enninful officially took the reins was that the magazine wasjoining Snapchat,external. It suggests Enninful is well aware of one of Vogue's biggest challenges, which is what the magazine's digital presence might be in the future. British Vogue sold 8,000 digital copies per month in the second half of last year - low compared with the physical sales. The online landscape is of course very different to print, with young consumers so used to getting so much content for free. Hannah Rochell, acting fashion editor at the London Evening Standard, says Vogue's online presence will likely get much stronger as it becomes more distinct from its paper counterpart. ""I think they have to make their online content really engaging and to offer something different to what you get in the physical magazine,"" she says. Edward Enninful has already hired Naomi Campbell ""Video content in particular is a very exciting thing for fashion because you can do so many different things with it - so there's huge potential for their online presence to grow."" It's worth bearing in mind thatTeen Vogue,externalhas been a huge success online, speaking in a totally different language to its parent publication. In recent years, publications like Vogue have arguably been overtaken by platforms such as Instagram as the gatekeepers of the fashion industry. Now, if a designer wants to reach the widest possible audience, Vogue is not necessarily the first platform they would choose. Advertisers are more likely to try and get Rihanna or GiGi Hadid to be seen wearing their clothes or posting about them on Twitter and Instagram. Similarly, vloggers and bloggers are now a regular fixture on the front rows of fashion shows - a symbol of their power and influence. Left-right: Stefano Tonchi, Claire Danes and Edward Enninful ""I think the fashion industry is changing all the time in so many ways, and it has indeed moved on to celebrity and digital influencers,"" Rochell says. ""But the fashion industry is good at adapting and keeping up with that sort of trend, so we could well see a change in editorial tone at Vogue to reflect that."" Morrison says that while many traditional media outlets have found a way to make money from online content, advertisers now have far more platforms to choose from. ""Magazines are now quite big digitally, but a huge amount of online advertising now just goes straight to Facebook and Google, so that's the competition that isn't easy for traditional publishers to contend with,"" he says. Enninful has hired Steve McQueen, Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell Enninful has already been busy making some changes at the top of Vogue in the last few months. For starters, he'shiredNaomi Campbell, Steve McQueen, Kate Moss and Adwoa Aboah as contributing editors - just a few names in thehuge overhaul,externalof the editorial team. But perhaps even more interesting than who he's hired is who has departed - a number of senior figures have left the magazine since his appointment was announced. Lucinda Chambers was Vogue's fashion director for 25 years under Shulman In what The Times described as a""posh girl exodus"", veterans such as Lucinda Chambers, Frances Bentley and Emily Sheffield all announced their departures. It wasn't initially clear whether they had jumped or been pushed, but last month Chambers toldVestoj,externalin no uncertain terms: ""I didn't leave. I was fired."" Enninful himself has put a slightly different spin on it. ""I'm really excited to see my vision for the British Vogue team come to fruition,""he said,external.  ""I'm very much looking forward to working with everyone on forthcoming issues."" Enninful (pictured with Naomi Campbell) was made an OBE last year As for how Vogue's new era could be reflected in its pages, Rochell thinks the signs point to a more diverse line-up of models and contributors. ""Diversity is something [Enninful] is very keen on championing, as we've seen in the past with his work, so I think that's definitely something that will be welcomed in the fashion industry as a whole,"" she says. The industry hasfaced criticism,externalrecently for its lack of diversity, but many designers have been trying to improve. The most recent New York Fashion Week attracted publicity for the inclusion ofplus-size models and a hijab catwalk showin its line-up. Rochell adds: ""Alexandra Shulman did a great job as editor, but I think this is a very exciting change and I'm really looking forward to seeing what direction Edward takes things in.""

"Business leaders and politicians asked former Foreign Secretary William Hague how the UK would ""get round"" the EU referendum result, he has revealed. In the Daily Telegraph, Lord Hague said he was asked the question ""for months... everywhere I went abroad"" if ""we would lose heart"" about leaving. He said he explained to them that ""this really is a democracy"". Lord Hague also backed a ""transitional"" withdrawal from the EU saying it had ""immense"" attractions. Lord Hague - who campaigned to remain in the EU -stood down as foreign secretary in 2014, andleft the House of Commons in 2015. He wrote inTuesday's Telegraph,external: ""The electorate voted to leave the EU, and therefore we leave. ""What is more, the number of people who voted to do so was higher than the number of votes cast for any government in our history. ""To me and many of my former colleagues in government who preferred to remain, the argument was over. ""In the recent general election, both main parties were clear that they were committed to the referendum outcome. ""Globally, the message has now got through."" But Lord Hague added that ""just as the message was accepted, the voters pulled off another surprise and refused to give a majority to the ministers negotiating the exit"" [in the general election]. Brexit reduces UK's global clout - Hague Profile: William Hague He said there was the clear potential for Brexit to become the ""greatest economic, diplomatic and constitutional muddle in the modern history of the UK, with unknowable consequences for the country, the government and the Brexit project itself"". And he said the Chancellor Philip Hammond deserved ""great credit"" for putting forward a possible solution. Lord Hague said: ""He has evidently been trying to persuade his cabinet colleagues that we should be seeking to stay in the EU single market and customs union during a transition and 'implementation' phase lasting to 2022, followed by a free trade deal with our former partners after that. ""This is seen by longstanding advocates of leaving as a 'soft' position or a climbdown. ""But in reality it is a plan to rescue Brexit from an approaching disaster."" Mr Hammondhas said any transitional deal in the period after Brexitmust end by June 2022, the time of the next general election. But the chancellor said there must be ""business as usual, life as normal"" for Britons as the UK left the EU.

"It's no secret that Theresa May lost her majority in June's election and that Jeremy Corbyn won more seats than expected. But what was really behind the decisions made by the UK's voters? For the past three years the British Election Study has followed a panel of the same 30,000 voters - asking them hundreds of questions about their political views and choices on 13 occasions. It offers the most detailed look at the issues which most concerned the electorate - and the results are now in. Despite Mrs May's claim that her reason for calling an early election was to get a mandate for the Brexit negotiations, the issue of Brexit itself had a relatively low profile during campaigning. For much of the campaign, both the Conservatives and Labour focused on other issues. But in the minds of the voters at least, the 2017 election was - as it promised to be ever since the referendum of June 2016 - the Brexit election. Thiscan be seen in our data,externalin many different ways, but nowhere more clearly, perhaps, than in the answer to the question: ""As far as you're concerned, what is the single most important issue facing the country at the present time?"" More than one in three people chose Brexit or the EU, compared with fewer than one in 10 who mentioned the NHS and one in 20 who suggested the economy. Of course, actions speak louder than words, and voters were not only concerned by Brexit but actually voted accordingly. The issue cut across normal party loyalties and contributed to the revival of the Conservative and Labour parties at the expense of challenger parties - including UKIP, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Greens - which had done so well in 2015. Because the British Election Study tracked the same voters during the 2015 election, the EU referendum and the 2017 election, we can see for the first time how voters switched party allegiance depending on their referendum vote. The Conservatives' position on Brexit, coupled with the absence of Nigel Farage, saw the UKIP vote collapse and the majority of its support go to the Tories. More than half of UKIP's 2015 voters who voted again in 2017 switched to the Conservatives, compared with only 18% to Labour and a further 18% who stayed loyal. Labour picked up a few Leave voters, but lost roughly equal numbers to the Conservatives - undoubtedly the party of Leave. But which was the party of Remain? Despite having the clearest pro-EU position and a promise of a second referendum, the Liberal Democrats failed to pick up many more Remain voters than they lost. Instead, Labour, which was already the most popular party in 2015 among those who voted Remain in 2016, scooped the lion's share. Despite uncertainty over its position on the single market, Labour was seen as the best bet by those wanting to keep closer ties with Europe. Not only did it win over a large number of Remainers from the Conservatives, but also from the pro-EU Greens and Lib Dems. Overall, nearly two-thirds of 2015 Greens went to Labour, as well as about a quarter of Liberal Democrats. The results in maps and charts Six key lessons from a surprise result Which seats changed hands? One of the reasons Labour did so well among Remainers is that by the time the election was called, the Brexit debate was not so much about Leave or Remain but about how to leave. The tens of thousands of voters we surveyed were asked whether it was more important for the government to ""protect Britain's access to the single market, or to gain full control of immigration"". The results reveal a striking correlation between wanting to control immigration and voting Tory on one hand, and wanting access to the single market and voting Labour or Lib Dem on the other. For example, the Conservatives lead Labour by more than 40 percentage points among those most in favour of full control of immigration, with Labour having a similar lead among those wanting complete access to the single market. In effect this meant the Tories were the party of hard Brexit, while Labour was the party of soft Brexit. The Lib Dems were not the first choice for those favouring a soft Brexit - possibly because of the lingering effects of coalition government, a perception of ineffective leadership and a realisation that they could not win in most seats. Although this was a Brexit election, it would be clearly wrong to say the election outcome was determined back in June 2016. More than at any British election in recent memory, the election campaign really did matter. Our pre-election survey, carried out in April and May, found that the Conservatives enjoyed a healthy lead over Labour of 41% to 27%. But by the last three days of the campaign, our daily panel put the two main parties neck and neck. Overall, 19% of voters switched parties between the April/May survey and the election. This is similar to the amount of ""churn"" we saw in 2015, when 17% of voters switched parties, and slightly less than at the 2010 and 2005 elections. But the significant difference in 2017 was that the flow was overwhelmingly in one direction. In 2015, Labour and the Conservatives both won about a quarter of these late-switching voters - effectively cancelling each other out. However, in 2017 Labour won 54% of switchers, compared with 19% for the Conservatives. Additionally, Labour won more than half of those who hadn't made up their minds before the campaign. 10 ways the PM blew her majority The Corbyn factor Election delivers most diverse Parliament The main reason that Labour did so well during the campaign is the strong performance of Jeremy Corbyn, especially relative to Theresa May. At the start of the campaign, Mr Corbyn lagged far behind Mrs May in leader ""like scores"" - in which voters award a mark out of 10. Mr Corbyn's score of 3.5 was slightly worse than predecessor Ed Miliband's at a similar point in 2015. However, by the end of the campaign Mr Corbyn had caught up with Mrs May, with both on 4.4. And although Mrs May was still rated as the leader who would make the best prime minister, the gap had narrowed considerably. Mr Corbyn's strong performance - or perhaps Mrs May's poor campaign - also meant that Labour closed the gap with the Conservatives when voters were asked which party was best placed to handle the issue they considered the most important for the country. Over the course of the campaign Labour managed to broaden its appeal, winning over voters who were initially rather lukewarm about Mr Corbyn. Labour also widened its appeal to more moderate voters on a number of issues, dramatically narrowing the gap with the Conservatives. During the campaign, previously undecided left-leaning voters and supporters of a soft Brexit were most likely to switch to Labour. Many of these had previously voted Labour in 2010 and 2015 and so perhaps were ""coming home"". While this was undoubtedly the Brexit election, it was also a tale of two leaders and a campaign that mattered. The Conservative strategy to pin so much on their ""strong and stable"" leader appears to have been a spectacular mistake which ultimately cost them an overall majority.
