"Mr Conte hopes to form a new and stronger government after losing his majority in the Senate Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has resigned - and it is not clear if he will be able to form and lead a new coalition government. Parties are divided over spending in the coronavirus crisis, in which more than 85,000 Italians have died. Mr Conte met President Sergio Mattarella, who may ask him to form a stronger government. Last week he lost his Senate majority. But someone else could become Italy's PM, or a snap election could be called. The law professor, who has headed coalition governments since 2018, tendered his resignation to the president. And now Mr Conte is discussing the political crisis with Senate president Elisabetta Casellati. Italy political crisis erupts over Covid spending Italian PM wins crucial vote to stay in power President Mattarella is expected to spend two days in talks with party leaders, as it is up to the president to decide the next move. The centrist coalition government was plunged into crisis two weeks ago when former PM Matteo Renzi pulled his small, liberal Italia Viva party out of it. He said he would only return if Mr Conte accepted a list of demands. Mr Conte survived a vote of confidence in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, last week. He then won a Senate vote, but without an absolute majority. The lack of a majority would restrict government business - hence the political shake-up. Mr Renzi's main objection was to Mr Conte's plans for spending â¬209bn (Â£186bn; $254bn) of EU recovery funds - part of a â¬750bn EU rescue for the Covid crisis. This video can not be played How the lockdown last year left some Italians struggling to get food Mr Renzi says EU funds should be invested in promising sectors like digital and green technologies, and wants MPs, rather than technocrats, to decide on the allocations. But he also wants more investment in the embattled health service. Italy, now mired in recession, was at the epicentre of the pandemic in Europe last year. Mr Renzi governed Italy in 2014-2016, but currently his Italia Viva party is polling below 3%. And so Italy's 66th government since World War Two comes to a close. A country of seemingly perennial political crises has chosen the worst possible time to face another - in the grip of a pandemic that has killed more than 85,000 Italians and unleashed the worst economic collapse in decades. That's why Giuseppe Conte may manage to come back with a new revamped government, arguing the need to avoid the turmoil of fresh elections at such a difficult time. Added to that, polls suggest an early vote would be won by the far right. So Mr Conte is hoping that the threat of losing their seats might tempt enough centrist politicians to jump the opposition ship and join a reformed coalition. Italy's 29th prime minister since the war is hoping to return asâ¦ Italy's 29th prime minister since the war. But his opponents are circling. And he won't have much time to convince parliament that he can become the new, stronger comeback kid. There are several options: Mr Conte could be asked to stay on as PM, but he would need to revamp some of his policies and make some new appointments to win back a parliamentary majority He could persuade some non-aligned senators to join a new coalition if Mr Renzi refuses to support a Conte-led government The main parties in the outgoing coalition - anti-establishment Five Star (M5S) and the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) - could agree to serve under a new PM, perhaps with one or two other parties Mr Conte could persuade one or more right-wing parties to join a new coalition led by him. But that option is seen as unlikely, as right-wing parties are ahead in opinion polls, so a snap election would favour them. Mr Conte, an independent technocrat, has led two very different, successive governments. For 15 months he headed a coalition between M5S and the far-right League, whose leader Matteo Salvini pulled out in a failed bid to force elections. Since then he has led a four-party, centre-left coalition dominated by M5S and the PD. The Italians struggling to feed their families.

"After criticism that his original goal was not bold enough, US President Joe Biden has said he expects the US will soon be able to vaccinate 1.5 million people a day. He had announced last week that 1m vaccines would be administered daily in the first 100 days of his presidency. But some media noted the US had already nearly reached that target under the Trump administration. Mr Biden also renewed Trump-era Covid bans on Monday, adding South Africa. In the first time formally taking reporters' questions during his presidency, Mr Biden said on Monday that he hoped they would be able to get to 1.5 million vaccinations administered daily. ""I think with the grace of God... we'll be able to get that to 1.5 million a day,"" the Democrat said. He added: ""I hope we'll be able to increase as we go along so we'll get to 1.5 million. That's my hope."" Has US vaccine rollout been a 'dismal failure'? Moderna vaccine appears to work against variants 'First Dogs' arrive at the White House Some media had questioned whether the new president's target of one million shots per day was ambitious enough. Last week, at the tail-end of the Trump administration, the US had already reached an average of around 980,000 vaccine doses administered daily. When an Associated Press news agency reporter asked last Thursday why Mr Biden had not aimed higher, he shot back: ""You all said it's not possible. Come on, give me a break man."" But CNN rated,externalthe president's claim about the media as false. During Monday's press conference, a reporter suggested to Mr Biden that he had changed his tone on defeating the public health crisis, pointing out that as a candidate he had vowed to ""shut down"" Covid-19, only to say last week: ""There's nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months."" Mr Biden replied: ""What I meant was it took a long time to get here and it's going to take a long time to beat it."" ""I'm confident we will beat this virus,"" he added, ""but we're still going to be talking about it in the summer and dealing with it in the fall."" This video can not be played Five ways President Biden plans to tackle coronavirus in his first 100 days The Biden administration on Monday renewed Trump-era Covid-19 travel bans on non-US visitors from Brazil and most of Europe, including the UK and Ireland. The White House also imposed a new ban on South Africa over its virus variant. Former President Donald Trump had ordered the bans to end on 26 January as one of his final acts in office. The new travel restrictions came as Minnesota recorded the first US case of the Brazil variant from a resident who had recently travelled to that country. ""This case marks the first documented instance of the Brazil P.1 variant in the United States,""said the Minnesota Department of Health,externalon Monday. Trump v Biden on China fact-checked Biden signs more executive orders in Covid fight Biden overturns Trump transgender military ban The unnamed patient lives in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area, said the department. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki confirmed the decision to continue the restrictions on foreign travellers on Monday. She told reporters: ""With the pandemic worsening and more contagious variants spreading, this isn't the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel."" All international travellers must also present a negative test within three days of air travel to the US. Travel restrictions have been in place since mid-March. When Mr Trump ordered a ban on flights from China in February, citing the ""Chinese virus"", Mr Biden railed against Mr Trump's ""hysterical xenophobia"". At the time, the Biden campaign denied the remark was about Mr Trump's travel ban. Ms Psaki was asked on Monday about Mr Biden's stance in light of the ""xenophobic"" remark. She said: ""He was critical of the former president for having a policy that was not more comprehensive than travel restrictions and he conveyed at the time - and more recently - the importance of having a multi-faceted approach."" The US has had more than double the cases of the next highest country, India. There have been over 420,000 deaths - nearly twice as many as Brazil, the second highest - and above 25 million cases. New York City - the most populous urban area in the country - has postponed plans for three mass vaccination sites due to a low supply of vaccine doses. City authorities were co-ordinating plans to turn two baseball stadiums as well as an outlet mall into inoculation hubs, but vaccine supply has not kept up with demand. Staff at Los Angeles airport move passengers through the line at the onsite Covid testing lab Also on Monday, California lifted a stay-at-home order imposed in December as officials said projections for hospital intensive care capacity had improved. The Golden State has been hard hit by a post-holiday surge that stretched hospitals to their limits. Governor Gavin Newsom is facing intense criticism over his refusal to share the data used by his administration to drive Covid policy decisions. State health officials said the metric is complicated, and would only confuse the public if released. The stay-at-home order had been in place for Southern California, the San Joaquin Valley and the Bay Area, which are home to over 90% of the state's residents. The region is still under restrictions, however - non-essential businesses are still to remain closed and restaurants must serve outdoors only. The Biden administration is proposing another economic rescue package, this one worth $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn). However, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday he was against ""an imprecise deluge of borrowed money that would direct huge sums toward those who don't need it"".

"This video can not be played Dutch police have described it as the worst unrest in four decades More than 180 people were arrested in 10 Dutch cities as protesters defying a curfew clashed with riot police for a third night running. Shops in Rotterdam were looted and police used water cannon, as rioters resisted latest Covid restrictions. Prime Minister Mark Rutte condemned ""criminal violence"" and the justice minister said the curfew would remain. The Dutch chief of police said the riots no longer had ""anything to do with the basic right to demonstrate"". Dutch PM condemns curfew riots The Netherlands has had nearly one million confirmed Covid cases since the start of the outbreak, with more than 13,500 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University in the US, which is tracking the pandemic. The government recently introduced a night-time curfew which runs from 21:00 (20:00 GMT) to 04:30. Anyone caught violating it faces a â¬95 (Â£84) fine. There were further violent scenes in many towns and cities. Riot police clashed with protesters in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, as well as Amersfoort, Den Bosch, Alphen and Helmond. Some of the worst disturbances were in the south of Rotterdam where police said 10 officers were hurt. Across the country 184 people were arrested. Amsterdam's mayor appealed to parents to keep young people indoors. Several cities have vowed to introduce emergency measures in an effort to prevent more disturbances The windows of some shops were smashed in Rotterdam Fires were lit on the streets of The Hague, where police on bicycles attempted to move small clusters of men who threw stones and fireworks. There was violence in the southern city of Den Bosch, where rioters set off fireworks, broke windows, looted a supermarket and overturned cars. A woman living near Den Bosch train station told Dutch radio that masked youths had left a trail of destruction in the city centre. ""I saw windows smashed and fireworks going off. Really crazy, just like a war zone,"" the woman said. Roads into the city were closed to stop people joining the rioters and Mayor Jack Mikkers imposed an emergency order banning gatherings on Tuesday. The ignition of discontent has rocked the core of Dutch society. In the absence of any legitimate way to socialise, is this simply an outlet for young men to feel part of something, their masks concealing their identities and enabling them to violently channel their frustrations? There are more sinister influences at play. Messages on social media, overt and covert, have whipped up anger. Misinformation has even been spread by some politicians. Some of the worst violence was in Rotterdam Some feared a curfew would be a tipping point, as Dutch restrictions tighten while some neighbouring countries relax their rules. The vast majority of people in the Netherlands are peacefully observing the curfew. The unrest was initially seen as a response to the first ""stay-at-home"" order imposed since Nazi occupation during World War Two. That notion has been dismissed by Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who said the rioters were simply criminals and would be treated as such. But there are simmering anxieties in Dutch towns and cities, and with less than two months before a general election, voters are vulnerable and the streets volatile. There has been widespread shock at the violence. In Rotterdam, where police used water cannon during clashes with rioters, Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb signed an emergency decree, giving police broader powers of arrest. He reacted furiously to shops being looted in the south of the city, condemning ""shameless thieves, I can't call it anything else"". The prime minister said the police had the government's full support: ""The riots have nothing to do with protesting or fighting for freedom."" Rotterdam shop-owner Emrah KÃ¶ker said he had no words for what he had seen. ""How can this happen in the Netherlands?"" he asked Dutch daily newspaper Algemeen Dagblad. Justice Minister Ferd Grapperhuis challenged anyone to explain what looting a shop had to do with coronavirus. The mayor of Den Bosch said police had struggled to respond to the violence because they were needed in other nearby towns. Football fans of the Willem II club took to the streets of Tilburg to ""protect their city"" against rioters, news site Brabants Dagblad reports. Mayors in several cities have vowed to introduce emergency measures in an effort to prevent more disturbances.

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock says lifting restrictions can only happen when ""facts on the ground"" show it is safe It is ""difficult to put a timeline"" on when England's lockdown could be lifted, Matt Hancock has said. The health secretary said there were ""early signs"" the measures were working but it was ""not a moment to ease up"". He said there were 37,000 people in hospital with coronavirus in the UK and ""more people on ventilators than at any time in this whole pandemic"". ""The pressure on the NHS remains huge and we've got to get that case rate down,"" he said. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has been falling, but the number of people in hospital remains high, as does the UK's daily death numbers. A further 592 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test and another 22,195 cases have been recorded,according to Monday's government figures,external. The are 4,076 people in hospital on ventilators. PM promises school update 'as soon as we can' Quarantine hotel plan to be discussed by ministers Watch: DIY store to vaccine centre in three weeks Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and only go out for limited reasons. This includes for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. At Monday's Downing Street press briefing, Mr Hancock said: ""I understand the yearning people have to get out of this. ""The thing is that we have to look at the facts on the ground and we have to monitor those facts. ""And of course, everybody wants to have a timeline for that, but I think most people understand why it is difficult to put a timeline on it because it's a matter of monitoring the data."" He set out the factors the government would take into account when reaching decisions over lifting the restrictions, including: the death rate, the number of people in hospital, whether there were new coronavirus variants and the success of the vaccine rollout. Almost four in five of the UK's over-80s have had the vaccine, Mr Hancock said, with nearly 6.6m people in total having had their first dose. The falling numbers of infections being reported and the rising rate of vaccination are incredibly promising - even if the drop in infections reported on Monday may have been partly an artefact of fewer people coming forward for a test because of the snow. But that does not offer any guarantees of a rapid lifting of lockdown. What is concerning ministers are the high numbers in hospital. The number of new admissions seems to have plateaued - but at a very high rate. Close to 4,000 patients a day are being admitted to hospital. To put that in context, that is four times the total number of all types of respiratory admissions the NHS would normally see in winter. It means the numbers in hospital are at nearly twice the level they were at the peak in the spring during the first wave. With better treatments available, patients are spending longer in hospital. So come mid-February the pressures in hospital are likely to be very high, leaving ministers little wriggle-room to relax restrictions. The big unknown, however, is what impact and how quickly vaccination will have an effect on admissions. There is encouraging early news from Israel that hospitalisation really starts to drop three weeks after the first dose. If that is repeated here, the picture could quickly change. But until that happens the government - in the words of Health Secretary Matt Hancock - is urging the country to hold its nerve. Speaking at the Downing Street press conference, Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, warned: ""We are not out of this by a very long way."" She said current coronavirus rates were still causing concern, patience was needed about the vaccination programme and the NHS still faced its usual winter pressures. Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England, said the UK need to see the death rate ""fall much lower"" before any decision to ease measures. She said teams were currently studying the impact on the UK's vaccine programme of the variant first identified in South Africa. But she added the ""consensus view"" from four UK laboratories suggested that ""the current vaccine works against the variant that was first discovered in the UK"".

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says teachers and pupils will be told âas much as we can, as soon as we canâ about reopening schools The government will tell teachers and parents when schools in England can reopen ""as soon as we can"", the prime minister has said. MPs have called on the government to set out a ""route map"" for reopening amid concerns for children's education. Boris Johnson said he understood why people wanted a timetable but he did not want to lift restrictions while the infection rate was ""still very high"". He would not guarantee schools would reopen before April's Easter break. Mr Johnson said: ""We've now got the R [reproduction rate] down below 1 across the whole of the country, that's a great achievement, we don't want to see a huge surge of infection just when we've got the vaccination programme going so well and people working so hard. ""I understand why people want to get a timetable from me today, what I can tell you is we'll tell you, tell parents, tell teachers as much as we can as soon as we can."" He said the government would be ""looking at the potential of relaxing some measures"" before mid-February, with Downing Street clarifying that this meant looking at the data to decide ""what we may or may not be able to ease from 15 February onwards"". A further 592 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test and another 22,195 cases have been recorded,according to Monday's government figures,external. 'Knackered and confused.' That's just the parents. Will schools reopen before Easter? How is the BBC helping home-schooling families? At Monday's Downing Street press briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said almost four in five of the UK's over-80s have had the vaccine, with nearly 6.6m people in total having had their first dose. But he said the NHS continues to be under ""intense pressure"", with Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, saying there are ""twice the number of people in hospital than we had in the first wave"" of the pandemic. Robert Halfon, chairman of the education select committee, told BBC Breakfast there was ""enormous uncertainty"" and called for the government to set out what the conditions needed to be for pupils to return to schools. The Conservative MP for Harlow suggested the government could consider tighter restrictions in other parts of society and the economy, in order to enable schools to open. Tory MPs were enraged by reports over the weekend that schools might not re-open fully until after the Easter holidays. Ministers say it's the progress of the pandemic that will determine their decision rather than a pre-agreed timetable. Yet whenever the government speaks, parents hear dates. Whether it's that the situation will be reviewed at half-term. Or a pledge to give two weeks' notice when classes will come back. MPs are now pushing for more transparency from the government about how they'll assess the data, and for some ideas between school being mostly closed or totally open. This issue is a perfect metaphor for the situation facing the entire country. Too much hope breeds disappointment, but living with uncertainty is just as hard. And you can come up with a plan but it might have to be junked if the virus has other ideas. Children's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield joined the call for clarity and told the BBC: ""Children are more withdrawn, they are really suffering in terms of isolation, their confidence levels are falling, and for some there are serious issues."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the government wanted to ""see all children back at the very earliest moment"". Schools in England have been closed to most pupils since the national lockdown began on 5 January due to high levels of Covid transmission in the community. There have been calls for teachers to be vaccinated sooner, although it is not clear if that would allow schools to reopen earlier. The majority of pupils in England are learning from home with schools only open to the children of key workers, vulnerable children and those who cannot learn at home Covid death rates among educational professionals are not ""statistically significantly different"" to those in the general population, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data, but secondary school teachers appeared to have an elevated risk compared particularly with people working in office-type jobs. Among secondary school teachers Covid death rates were 39.2 deaths per 100,000 males, compared with 31.4 for all males aged 20 to 64, and 21.2 per 100,000 females, compared with 16.8, but the ONS said these were ""not statistically significantly different than those of the same age and sex in the wider population"". Schools will remain closed inNorthern Ireland, Scotland and Walesuntil at least the February half-term - with the Welsh first minister saying it is""unlikely"" all pupils will return after the break. Gemma Cocker with her children Charlie and Lyla Gemma Cocker from Brighton is one of the many parents struggling to balance childcare, home learning and work. She says she's having to share her work laptop with her son, who has already missed learning time after the family moved home and did not have internet access. ""We didn't have any internet. The school said they had reached their limit so couldn't take him,"" she says. And because her children are young, she says: ""They're never just going to watch a classroom by themselves, you have to be with them the whole time."" Kitty Jones, 11, is in her last year of primary school and she says home learning is ""tricky"" because she is not used to using different remote platforms like Google Classroom and she wants to return ""as soon as possible"". ""I still think that I'm learning a bit, but I don't think I'm learning as much as I would be in person,"" she tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. Holly Agbukor, 18, is studying for her A-levels, says it is ""quite stressful"" learning at home, as it is a ""different environment, so it is not as easy to be fully present in the lessons"". But, she says, while is it ""difficult"" working at home, ""I don't think it is worth the cost of reintroducing the virus into society and making things worse overall"".

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock says lifting restrictions can only happen when ""facts on the ground"" show it is safe It is ""difficult to put a timeline"" on when England's lockdown could be lifted, Matt Hancock has said. The health secretary said there were ""early signs"" the measures were working but it was ""not a moment to ease up"". He said there were 37,000 people in hospital with coronavirus in the UK and ""more people on ventilators than at any time in this whole pandemic"". ""The pressure on the NHS remains huge and we've got to get that case rate down,"" he said. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has been falling, but the number of people in hospital remains high, as does the UK's daily death numbers. A further 592 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test and another 22,195 cases have been recorded,according to Monday's government figures,external. The are 4,076 people in hospital on ventilators. PM promises school update 'as soon as we can' Quarantine hotel plan to be discussed by ministers Watch: DIY store to vaccine centre in three weeks Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and only go out for limited reasons. This includes for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. At Monday's Downing Street press briefing, Mr Hancock said: ""I understand the yearning people have to get out of this. ""The thing is that we have to look at the facts on the ground and we have to monitor those facts. ""And of course, everybody wants to have a timeline for that, but I think most people understand why it is difficult to put a timeline on it because it's a matter of monitoring the data."" He set out the factors the government would take into account when reaching decisions over lifting the restrictions, including: the death rate, the number of people in hospital, whether there were new coronavirus variants and the success of the vaccine rollout. Almost four in five of the UK's over-80s have had the vaccine, Mr Hancock said, with nearly 6.6m people in total having had their first dose.

"Jenners department store in Edinburgh has been at the site since 1838 The owner of the Jenners building in Edinburgh has promised that it will remain a department store - despite the departure of its current tenant, the House of Fraser. Frasers Group said it would cease trading at the site on 3 May, with the loss of 200 jobs. The building is owned by Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen. A company spokesman said it would continue as a store and that ""advanced"" talks were taking place with operators. The Jenners building has occupied a prime location on Princes Street for 183 years. It was bought by Mr Povlsen - who is one of Scotland's biggest landowners - in 2017, reportedly for Â£53m. Jenners: No appetite for old retail? Jenners could quit Princes Street after 181 years House of Fraser attacks 'greedy' landlords The store is currently operated by the Frasers Group, which owns the commercial rights to the Jenners trading name. It said it would be quitting the site in May after the two sides were unable to come to an agreement. A Frasers spokesman claimed that the landlord had not been able to ""work mutually on a fair agreement"". He said this had led to ""the loss of 200 jobs and a vacant site for the foreseeable future, with no immediate plans. ""Our commitment to our Frasers strategy remains but landlords and retailers need to work together in a fair manner, especially when all stores are closed."" Anders Holch Povlsen is one of Scotland's biggest landowners However, Anders Krogh Vogdrup - the director of AAA United, which owns the Jenners building - said it had given Frasers a substantial rent reduction and rent-free periods to cover the lockdowns. ""Frasers has made the decision that it does not wish to continue in occupation,"" he said. ""This will see the end of the 16-year association between House of Fraser and this building, but not of the 180 years of Jenners department store."" Mr Vogdrup told BBC Scotland that it had bought the Jenners building ""out of passion for its architecture and history"". ""We have been sad to read on social media that we are to close the department store, as that is not the case,"" he said. ""We fought to keep the current tenant and we are now in advanced talks with other partners."" He said their ""first priority"" was to keep it as a department store, while there were also plans to turn some unused parts of the building into a hotel. ""The Jenners department store and building is the jewel in the crown of Edinburgh,"" he added. ""We are not turning it into a hotel. It will remain a department store."" He also expects the Jenners name will remain on the side of the building. Mr Povlsen, whose parents set up Scandinavian fashion company Bestseller, is believed to be worth Â£4.5bn. As well as owning Bestseller he is a major shareholder in online retailer Asos. He has previously revealed plans to use parts of the Princes Street building for a hotel, with the rest reserved for retail. The plans included the restoration of the building's Victorian facade and central atrium, which is a three-storey, top-lit grand saloon. A rooftop restaurant and bar would overlook nearby St Andrew Square. Mr Vogdrup said the plans to refurbish the store were now on hold due to the current economic climate. Jenners has dominated Edinburgh's main shopping thoroughfare since the mid-19th Century. It was opened in 1838 by local drapers Charles Jenner and Charles Kennington, who found themselves out of work after being sacked for taking a day off to go to the races in Musselburgh. Initially called Kennington & Jenner, the boutique store proved popular for keeping the people of Edinburgh in fine silks and linen, which could normally only be found in London. By 1890 the shop had changed name to Charles Jenner & Co and had expanded to adjoining buildings, making it one of the biggest stores in Scotland. But just two years later fire destroyed the shop and ambitious plans - backed by the local council - were launched for a new look Jenners. Celebrated architect William Hamilton Beattie, who also designed the Balmoral and Carlton Hotel, was brought in for the redesign. Charles Jenner died in 1893 before the work was completed in 1895. In 1911 the popular store was given a Royal Warrant. After struggling in the the 21st Century, the Jenners brand was sold to rivals House of Fraser for Â£46m in 2005. In 2018, House of Fraser was bought by Mike Ashley's Sports Direct group. Jenners: No appetite for old retail?

"Mr Conte hopes to form a new and stronger government after losing his majority in the Senate Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has resigned - and it is not clear if he will be able to form and lead a new coalition government. Parties are divided over spending in the coronavirus crisis, in which more than 85,000 Italians have died. Mr Conte met President Sergio Mattarella, who may ask him to form a stronger government. Last week he lost his Senate majority. But someone else could become Italy's PM, or a snap election could be called. The law professor, who has headed coalition governments since 2018, tendered his resignation to the president. And now Mr Conte is discussing the political crisis with Senate president Elisabetta Casellati. Italy political crisis erupts over Covid spending Italian PM wins crucial vote to stay in power President Mattarella is expected to spend two days in talks with party leaders, as it is up to the president to decide the next move. The centrist coalition government was plunged into crisis two weeks ago when former PM Matteo Renzi pulled his small, liberal Italia Viva party out of it. He said he would only return if Mr Conte accepted a list of demands. Mr Conte survived a vote of confidence in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, last week. He then won a Senate vote, but without an absolute majority. The lack of a majority would restrict government business - hence the political shake-up. Mr Renzi's main objection was to Mr Conte's plans for spending â¬209bn (Â£186bn; $254bn) of EU recovery funds - part of a â¬750bn EU rescue for the Covid crisis. This video can not be played How the lockdown last year left some Italians struggling to get food Mr Renzi says EU funds should be invested in promising sectors like digital and green technologies, and wants MPs, rather than technocrats, to decide on the allocations. But he also wants more investment in the embattled health service. Italy, now mired in recession, was at the epicentre of the pandemic in Europe last year. Mr Renzi governed Italy in 2014-2016, but currently his Italia Viva party is polling below 3%. And so Italy's 66th government since World War Two comes to a close. A country of seemingly perennial political crises has chosen the worst possible time to face another - in the grip of a pandemic that has killed more than 85,000 Italians and unleashed the worst economic collapse in decades. That's why Giuseppe Conte may manage to come back with a new revamped government, arguing the need to avoid the turmoil of fresh elections at such a difficult time. Added to that, polls suggest an early vote would be won by the far right. So Mr Conte is hoping that the threat of losing their seats might tempt enough centrist politicians to jump the opposition ship and join a reformed coalition. Italy's 29th prime minister since the war is hoping to return asâ¦ Italy's 29th prime minister since the war. But his opponents are circling. And he won't have much time to convince parliament that he can become the new, stronger comeback kid. There are several options: Mr Conte could be asked to stay on as PM, but he would need to revamp some of his policies and make some new appointments to win back a parliamentary majority He could persuade some non-aligned senators to join a new coalition if Mr Renzi refuses to support a Conte-led government The main parties in the outgoing coalition - anti-establishment Five Star (M5S) and the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) - could agree to serve under a new PM, perhaps with one or two other parties Mr Conte could persuade one or more right-wing parties to join a new coalition led by him. But that option is seen as unlikely, as right-wing parties are ahead in opinion polls, so a snap election would favour them. Mr Conte, an independent technocrat, has led two very different, successive governments. For 15 months he headed a coalition between M5S and the far-right League, whose leader Matteo Salvini pulled out in a failed bid to force elections. Since then he has led a four-party, centre-left coalition dominated by M5S and the PD. The Italians struggling to feed their families.

"Pictures of the Pampas grass on social media are thought to have made the area in South Shields popular A boom in the popularity of Pampas grass with interior decorators has led to ""droves"" of people picking the plant which grows wild near a beach. The grass, near Littlehaven Beach in South Shields, forms part of a wind defence to stop sand blowing onto roads and helps protect the coastline. South Tyneside Council warned anyone found removing it could be prosecuted. Councillor Ernest Gibson said while the grass may look ""beautiful in vases"" people were ""damaging the environment"". The grass, which was popular in the 1970s, can sell for up to Â£40 a bunch andhas proved a popular addition to people's homes.,external It is thought that photographs on social media sites such as Instagram may have influenced people turning up and taking it, Mr Gibson added. ""Pampas grass is quite expensive to buy if you went to a florist. It's cheaper to come to South Tyneside and take it away,"" he said. ""But what we are doing is urging people not to come here and take it away, it's there for a reason."" Pampas grass and Marram grass form part of a defence along the coast at South Shields The Pampas grass helps to bond poor soils found at the coast, while Marram grass helps to prevent erosion in the dunes. Signs are to be erected warning people not to pick the grass because it is already in need of replenishment, the council said. ""Through Covid, we have a massive amount of people coming to the coastal town, it's Benidorm without the sunshine,"" he added. ""It's great to see people at the seaside enjoying it [the grass] and that's what it's part of. It's there for everybody to view."" Garden designer George Wright said Pampas grass was ""very popular"" and he had seen demand increase two or three times at his nursery in West Boldon. He also expressed concern for the area.

"Vaughan Gething said he made an ""honest mistake"" with his figures The health minister has been accused of ""misleading"" people after claiming the majority of over 80s had been vaccinated against Covid-19. Vaughan Gething said he understood most people in the age group had received their first dose of the vaccine. Figures show there have been 43,879 doses issued - 23.9% of the priority group. The Welsh Conservatives accused him of misleading people, but Mr Gething said he had made an ""innocent mistake"". According to Public Health Wales figures, the total number of first dose vaccinations has reached 190,435 in Wales - 6% of the population. The figures also show 86,717 front-line health workers have also been given a first dose. More than half of care home residents and two thirds of care home workers have also had their first doses. In a virtual session of the Senedd on Tuesday, Mr Gething appeared to contradict the figures, saying it was his ""understanding"" that the vaccine roll out had reached ""the majority"" of Wales' over 80s population. Mr Gething also told the Welsh Parliament that he expected 70% of over 80s in Wales and 70% of care home residents and staff to receive their first jab by the end of this weekend. Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies accused Mr Gething ofmisleading the Senedd,external, saying: ""We need an urgent statement from the health minister clarifying the situation."" Mr Gething has since admitted making ""an innocent mistake"" and said: ""There was a minor amount of confusion about the difference between care home residents, where we had vaccinated a majority, and over 80s."" He said that vaccination for that cohort is a ""significant priority"" and he was still ""positive"" that the target to vaccinated 70 per cent by the end of the week can be achieved. He added that over 70s would be contacted soon, ""I fully expect that every health board will be inviting people over 70 to come forward for their vaccination over the next week."" Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said that Mr Gething's aim to have over 70% of over 80s would have the jab by the end of the week, would have been ""quite a task in three days"". ""The health minister should explain if he thinks we're still on track. Communication is key in building public trust,"" he added. In total, 9,364 (56%) of care home residents and 20,087 (67.5%) of care home workers have been given a first dose. The aim is for 70% of the over 80s and care home residents to be given a first dose of vaccine by 24 January. There are another 30,388 people, not designated, who have been given first doses. These include social workers and some in the main priority groups, where the data is not quite ready to be included. Health officials also say there is a time lag - which can be up to five days - between the day a person is vaccinated and when the recorded data is checked and finally published. This week, more than 60,000 doses of the Pfizer BioNtech vaccine and 90,000 of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines to hospitals and GP practices would be rolled out. Asked if he shared the same confidence as the health minister that they could meet the 70% target by the weekend, Wales' chief pharmaceutical officer said he expected the roll-out to increase further, particularly as GPs would be prioritising the over 80s and care home residents into the weekend. These include GPs vaccinating into the evening and over the weekend, although it could again be a few more days before those doses finally show up on the officially published data. ""I'm very confident that the numbers will be reflected for the over 80s by the end of the week,"" said Andrew Evans. ""We know that GPs across Wales are very keen to get their hands on the vaccine and, as it has happened, supply hasn't been able to meet their demand so we're confident there's the capacity and the system."" ""We're all very focused on making sure we offer as many people in those [priority] groups get the vaccine as quickly as possible."" Responding to criticism that the Welsh Government was falling behind other nations in administering the vaccine, Mr Evans said that Wales was moving as quickly as possible. He explained that there were challenges around transportation and storage of the Pfizer BioNtech vaccine which has to be kept at ultra-low temperatures in specialist centres. Mr Evans also said that plans for the Oxford AstaZenca vaccine were based on the allotted number that they received by Public Health England each week. ""We get an indication week of what allocation we're getting for next week for the AstraZenca of vaccine,"" he added. Covid: When, where and how will I get my jab?

More people have now had the first dose of the vaccine than the number - 185,035 - who have tested positive for Covid-19. Meanwhile, weekly figures - up to Sunday - show the vaccine roll-out across different parts of Wales, by health board. The rates of first doses to Welsh residents range from 4.4% of the population in north Wales to 5.8% in Powys. Mr Evans said the amount of vaccine a health board might have at any one time reflected the capacity or number of appointments it might have booked for its vaccination centres.

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock says lifting restrictions can only happen when ""facts on the ground"" show it is safe It is ""difficult to put a timeline"" on when England's lockdown could be lifted, Matt Hancock has said. The health secretary said there were ""early signs"" the measures were working but it was ""not a moment to ease up"". He said there were 37,000 people in hospital with coronavirus in the UK and ""more people on ventilators than at any time in this whole pandemic"". ""The pressure on the NHS remains huge and we've got to get that case rate down,"" he said. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has been falling, but the number of people in hospital remains high, as does the UK's daily death numbers. A further 592 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test and another 22,195 cases have been recorded,according to Monday's government figures,external. The are 4,076 people in hospital on ventilators. PM promises school update 'as soon as we can' Quarantine hotel plan to be discussed by ministers Watch: DIY store to vaccine centre in three weeks Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and only go out for limited reasons. This includes for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. At Monday's Downing Street press briefing, Mr Hancock said: ""I understand the yearning people have to get out of this. ""The thing is that we have to look at the facts on the ground and we have to monitor those facts. ""And of course, everybody wants to have a timeline for that, but I think most people understand why it is difficult to put a timeline on it because it's a matter of monitoring the data."" He set out the factors the government would take into account when reaching decisions over lifting the restrictions, including: the death rate, the number of people in hospital, whether there were new coronavirus variants and the success of the vaccine rollout. Almost four in five of the UK's over-80s have had the vaccine, Mr Hancock said, with nearly 6.6m people in total having had their first dose. The falling numbers of infections being reported and the rising rate of vaccination are incredibly promising - even if the drop in infections reported on Monday may have been partly an artefact of fewer people coming forward for a test because of the snow. But that does not offer any guarantees of a rapid lifting of lockdown. What is concerning ministers are the high numbers in hospital. The number of new admissions seems to have plateaued - but at a very high rate. Close to 4,000 patients a day are being admitted to hospital. To put that in context, that is four times the total number of all types of respiratory admissions the NHS would normally see in winter. It means the numbers in hospital are at nearly twice the level they were at the peak in the spring during the first wave. With better treatments available, patients are spending longer in hospital. So come mid-February the pressures in hospital are likely to be very high, leaving ministers little wriggle-room to relax restrictions. The big unknown, however, is what impact and how quickly vaccination will have an effect on admissions. There is encouraging early news from Israel that hospitalisation really starts to drop three weeks after the first dose. If that is repeated here, the picture could quickly change. But until that happens the government - in the words of Health Secretary Matt Hancock - is urging the country to hold its nerve. Speaking at the Downing Street press conference, Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, warned: ""We are not out of this by a very long way."" She said current coronavirus rates were still causing concern, patience was needed about the vaccination programme and the NHS still faced its usual winter pressures. Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England, said the UK need to see the death rate ""fall much lower"" before any decision to ease measures. She said teams were currently studying the impact on the UK's vaccine programme of the variant first identified in South Africa. But she added the ""consensus view"" from four UK laboratories suggested that ""the current vaccine works against the variant that was first discovered in the UK"".

"Jenners department store in Edinburgh has been at the site since 1838 The owner of the Jenners building in Edinburgh has promised that it will remain a department store - despite the departure of its current tenant, the House of Fraser. Frasers Group said it would cease trading at the site on 3 May, with the loss of 200 jobs. The building is owned by Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen. A company spokesman said it would continue as a store and that ""advanced"" talks were taking place with operators. The Jenners building has occupied a prime location on Princes Street for 183 years. It was bought by Mr Povlsen - who is one of Scotland's biggest landowners - in 2017, reportedly for Â£53m. Jenners: No appetite for old retail? Jenners could quit Princes Street after 181 years House of Fraser attacks 'greedy' landlords The store is currently operated by the Frasers Group, which owns the commercial rights to the Jenners trading name. It said it would be quitting the site in May after the two sides were unable to come to an agreement. A Frasers spokesman claimed that the landlord had not been able to ""work mutually on a fair agreement"". He said this had led to ""the loss of 200 jobs and a vacant site for the foreseeable future, with no immediate plans. ""Our commitment to our Frasers strategy remains but landlords and retailers need to work together in a fair manner, especially when all stores are closed."" Anders Holch Povlsen is one of Scotland's biggest landowners However, Anders Krogh Vogdrup - the director of AAA United, which owns the Jenners building - said it had given Frasers a substantial rent reduction and rent-free periods to cover the lockdowns. ""Frasers has made the decision that it does not wish to continue in occupation,"" he said. ""This will see the end of the 16-year association between House of Fraser and this building, but not of the 180 years of Jenners department store."" Mr Vogdrup told BBC Scotland that it had bought the Jenners building ""out of passion for its architecture and history"". ""We have been sad to read on social media that we are to close the department store, as that is not the case,"" he said. ""We fought to keep the current tenant and we are now in advanced talks with other partners."" He said their ""first priority"" was to keep it as a department store, while there were also plans to turn some unused parts of the building into a hotel. ""The Jenners department store and building is the jewel in the crown of Edinburgh,"" he added. ""We are not turning it into a hotel. It will remain a department store."" He also expects the Jenners name will remain on the side of the building. Mr Povlsen, whose parents set up Scandinavian fashion company Bestseller, is believed to be worth Â£4.5bn. As well as owning Bestseller he is a major shareholder in online retailer Asos. He has previously revealed plans to use parts of the Princes Street building for a hotel, with the rest reserved for retail. The plans included the restoration of the building's Victorian facade and central atrium, which is a three-storey, top-lit grand saloon. A rooftop restaurant and bar would overlook nearby St Andrew Square. Mr Vogdrup said the plans to refurbish the store were now on hold due to the current economic climate. Jenners has dominated Edinburgh's main shopping thoroughfare since the mid-19th Century. It was opened in 1838 by local drapers Charles Jenner and Charles Kennington, who found themselves out of work after being sacked for taking a day off to go to the races in Musselburgh. Initially called Kennington & Jenner, the boutique store proved popular for keeping the people of Edinburgh in fine silks and linen, which could normally only be found in London. By 1890 the shop had changed name to Charles Jenner & Co and had expanded to adjoining buildings, making it one of the biggest stores in Scotland. But just two years later fire destroyed the shop and ambitious plans - backed by the local council - were launched for a new look Jenners. Celebrated architect William Hamilton Beattie, who also designed the Balmoral and Carlton Hotel, was brought in for the redesign. Charles Jenner died in 1893 before the work was completed in 1895. In 1911 the popular store was given a Royal Warrant. After struggling in the the 21st Century, the Jenners brand was sold to rivals House of Fraser for Â£46m in 2005. In 2018, House of Fraser was bought by Mike Ashley's Sports Direct group. Jenners: No appetite for old retail?

We'll be wrapping up our live coverage shortly. Here are some of the main stories we've been covering this Monday:  We'll be back tomorrow. Today's live page has been brought to you by James Clarke, Alex Kleiderman, Victoria Lindrea, Cherry Wilson, Jennifer Meierhans, Lauren Turner, Justin Parkinson and Sam Cabral.   Whenever President Donald Trump spoke about his administration's Covid response, he was often flanked by two of the nation's top doctors - Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx. Now the duo are revealing just how difficult it was to work under him. Ina long interview with the New York Times,external, Dr Fauci - the chief infectious disease specialist in the country - said the then president would often tell him he was too negative. ""I always felt that if I did walk away, the skunk at the picnic would no longer be at the picnic,"" explained Dr Fauci. Often contradicting the administration, he said he could not bring himself to resign because there was far too much Covid denialism - including from within the White House. ""Even if I wasn't very effective in changing everybody's minds, the idea 
that they knew that nonsense could not be spouted without my pushing 
back on it, I felt was important."" Ina separate interview with CBS,external, Dr Birx - the White House's Covid task force coordinator - confirmed that there was a ""parallel set of data and graphics"" presented to the president that she wasn't privy to. Dr Birx has since retired from public service, but Dr Fauci has joined the Biden administration as the new president's chief medical adviser. Home schooling can be tough. It's difficult to concentrate, there's emotional exhaustion, boredom, a lack of motivation and it's really hard not going out to see friends. And that's just the parents. This winter lockdown is taking its toll on families, now struggling even more on the black ice of uncertainty as no-one can say when schools in England are going to reopen for most pupils again. ""There's a sense of fatigue,"" says Jacqueline Smallwood, who is at home with three secondary-school children. She says her own ""concentration levels have fallen dramatically"". ""It's so repetitive that it just makes you feel tired,"" she says of the latest lockdown and the ""silent struggle"" facing both parents and their children to try to get motivated. Sound familiar?

Under the round-the-clock curfew, citizens who are not ""essential workers"" have been barred from leaving their homes since 14 January. Laila, 12, is in Beirut trying to study while her family works from home. ""We all have our own work to do and when we have meetings we hear each other. It can be a real distraction and stop you from finishing your work on time,"" she says. ""Sometimes I can't study well because I get stressed with all the work they're giving us. It is definitely not the same studying online as it is in the physical world."" For hairdresser Walid Kanaan this year has been ""extremely difficult psychologically and economically"". ""I own my shop but still I cannot afford it. I pay the workers' salary so I am really broke,"" says the 45-year-old. ""It is hitting hard. You can't go out at all or do anything.

All of the residents in Manchesterâs care homes for older people have received their first Covid-19 vaccinations, according to the city's council. People living in the city's 56 care homes were prioritised for the vaccine rollout - with NHS teams aiming to have completed the first jabs by 24 January. Carolyn Ball, general manager of Belong Morris Feinmann Care Village in Didsbury, said she was ""delighted"" all their residents had been vaccinated. âThis is the additional protection we have long been waiting for and itâs great to be starting the new year knowing that our residents are at reduced risk,"" she added.  Reality Check At the daily briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that, âunder this lockdown, it is illegal to travel abroad unless you have a reasonable excuseâ. Under Englandâs lockdown rules, people must only go abroad for âessential reasonsâ. These are the same as the ""reasonable excuses"" for domestic travel, including:  The police can stop people to ask if they have a âreasonable excuseâ to travel, but it is not the responsibility of airlines to check. A handful of jobs and professions are also exempt from some of the travel restrictions, if they are making the journey for work reasons -  including pilots and coach drivers. Read more here:What are the UK travel rules? The UK government has confirmed it is considering using hotels to quarantine people arriving in the UK from countries with dangerous variants of coronavirus. But as that was revealed, shares in airlines and travel companies fell sharply. Both Easyjet and British Airways' parent company, IAG, saw their shares fall more than 7%.

It passed the devastating milestone on Sunday morning, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US has had well over twice as many overall cases as the next highest country, India, which has over 10 million cases. Nearly 420,000 Americans have died from the virus, almost double that of Brazil, the second highest. On Friday, US president Joe Biden warned the worst could be yet to come: ""The virus is surging. We're 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000."" It is now a race between the virus and the vaccine, as the new administration aims for 100 million jabs in its first 100 days. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Conservative MPs, publicly and
privately, are pressing for a clearer route-map out of lockdown. And in some
cases, frustration is boiling over; one Tory MP told me earlier that they were
âlividâ about the ongoing situation with schools. Matt Hancock was never likely
to come out and bind the government to a timeline today. But at the Downing Street press conference, he did talk about
these four âfactorsâ that ministers will be looking at when it comes to lifting
restrictions. Namely - the death rate, hospitalisations, any new variants that
affect the pandemic and the success of the vaccine rollout. Ministers may feel they need some room for manoeuvre in these
uncertain times. But a number of their own backbenchers will likely keep trying
to pin down some detail. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The falling numbers of infections being reported and rising
rate of vaccination are incredibly promising - even if the drop in infections
reported on Monday may have been partly an artefact of fewer people coming
forward for a test because of the snow. But that does not offer any guarantees of a rapid lifting of
lockdown. What is concerning ministers though are the high numbers in
hospital. The number of new admissions seems to have plateaued - but
at a very high rate. Close to 4,000 patients a day are being admitted to
hospital. To put that in context, that is four times the total number
of all types of respiratory admissions the NHS would normally see in winter. It means the numbers in hospital are at nearly twice the
level they were at the peak in the spring during the first wave. With better treatments available, patients are spending
longer in hospital. So come mid February the pressures in hospital are likely to
be very high, leaving ministers little wriggle-room to relax restrictions. The big unknown, however, is what impact and how quickly
vaccination will have an effect on admissions. There is encouraging early news from Israel that
hospitalisation really start to drop three weeks after the first dose. If that is repeated here, the picture could quickly change. But until that happens the government - in the words of Health
Secretary Matt Hancock - is urging the country to hold its nerve. A couple have been fined for making a 130-mile (209km) round trip from Derbyshire to York for a roast dinner. North Yorkshire Police said the couple, who were in their 20s, told officers one of their mothers was going to cook lunch on Sunday, but ""let them down"". They decided to make the trip to York in search of a takeaway lunch instead. The pair were given Covid fixed penalty notices, with police saying: ""We know nobody does Yorkshire puddings better than us here in Yorkshire... but they're really not worth getting into trouble for."" Read the full storyhere.  As a winter Covid surge batters California, scientists wondered if the contagious UK variant had landed in their state. Two independent research groups - in Los Angeles and San Francisco - are now confirming the existence of a homegrown variant of the virus. Data suggests it appears to be spreading faster than any other variant in the state. Both sets of researchers confirmed they had been looking for the UK strain when they stumbled upon the new mutation. A single instance of the strain was detected back in July but it lay dormant for months. It has since exploded across the state, likely contributing to a brutal holiday season that has strained hospital capacity to its limits and doubled the state's death toll. California has now recorded over three million total cases and more than 37,000 deaths. The daily press conference was given by Health Secretary Matt Hancock. He was joined by Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, and Dr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England. Here's what they told us: Reducing wastage of vaccines when dealing with the pandemic is crucial, Matt Hancock says. Asked if he will publish detailed wastage rates, he says he is ""very happy"" to look into giving more details. That concludes today's Downing Street press conference. Dan O'Donoghue from the Press and Journal asks why Scotland has the lowest vaccination rate in the UK. He also wants to know, following recent polls on Scottish independence, if the case for the union is helped or hindered by the government's performance over the past year. Echoing his earlier statement at the press conference, Matt Hancock says the case for the union is ""undoubtedly strengthened"" and the pandemic response has shown ""we are stronger as one United Kingdom"". He says the vaccine rollout is a case in point and that, other than Israel and the UAE, the UK has the fastest vaccine rollout in the world. ""It shows what the United Kingdom can do when we pull together,"" he said. Hancock adds that colleagues in Scotland are ""working incredibly hard"" to roll out the vaccines and ""the NHS in Scotland is doing an absolutely terrific job"". ""If this pandemic has taught us anything, it's that we all rely on each other,"" he adds. Matt Hancock says the proportion of people declining vaccinations is ""very, very low"". The programme is ""going well"" and the uptake is ""getting to really high levels"", he adds. Getting a jab is ""the right thing"", Hancock says, calling the media ""absolutely brilliant"" for ""supporting the science on this one"". Jenny Harries adds that with more information, take-up increases. Communities are getting the ""real level of data"" needed to support people, she says. She said the steroid Dexamethasone should also still work ""perfectly"" as a treatment for new variants. Channel 5's question about possible enforced hotel quarantine for people arriving from aboard was a reference to the prime minister's confirmation earlier in the day that the government was considering such a move. Incoming travellers already have to show evidence of a recent negative coronavirus test. At present, all travellers must provide contact details and theirUK address,external. They can then travel - by public transport if necessary - to their home or to the place where they plan to self-isolate. Here's everything you need to know about the UK travel and quarantine rules. Andy Bell at Channel 5 asks if Matt Hancock believes the time has come for enforced hotel quarantine for anyone coming into the UK. The health secretary says it is ""incredibly important"" that ""we are cautious at the border"". He notes travel corridors have now been removed and that lockdown rules mean travel abroad is illegal without a reasonable excuse, for example medical reasons. He says it is right to take a ""precautionary"" approach while analysis is continuing around the world on the virus. Dr Harries is asked if it was wrong to say, earlier in the pandemic, that there was no point in controlling the people coming in to the UK once the virus was already here. She says once there was a significant infection rate, the proportion coming in through borders was very small. But now new variants are being identified, other measures need to be put in place.  Matt Hancock says new virus variants from South Africa and Brazil are in ""very small numbers"" in the UK at present. The government is using ""enhanced contact tracing"" to deal with these, he adds, to ensure people affected and their contacts self-isolate. Asked how effective vaccines are against new coronavirus variants, Hancock says there's a ""high degree of confidence"" it works with the one first detected in Kent. The ban on foreign travel for most people is because the government does not want more people arriving ""at risk"" of having other strains. Susan Hopkins says it's ""reassuring"" that the vaccines work with the Kent variant. She said work is starting on testing its effect on the South African strain. Jenny Harries says mutations are normal for viruses and the ""majority"" will not be ""a cause of concern"". It's unlikely that vaccines will not work, to some extent, on new strains, she adds.

"Mr Conte hopes to form a new and stronger government after losing his majority in the Senate Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has resigned - and it is not clear if he will be able to form and lead a new coalition government.

"There are 37,899 people in hospital in the UK with coronavirus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock says, including 4,076 on ventilators Almost four-in-five of people aged 80 and over have been vaccinated, Hancock says The new variant of the virus first identified in South East England is spreading 30-70% faster than the original, he says There are ""early signs that the actions we are taking are working"", with the rise in case numbers slowing and falling in some areas, he adds Ministers are holding discussions about what tier system will replace the current lockdown once it is lifted, Hancock says A further 592 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, new daily figures show Schools reopening is a priority but nobody wants restrictions lifted so quickly while the rate of infection is still very high, the prime minister says Thanks for joining us today. We'll be wrapping up our live coverage shortly. Here are some of the main stories we've been covering this Monday:  We'll be back tomorrow. Today's live page has been brought to you by James Clarke, Alex Kleiderman, Victoria Lindrea, Cherry Wilson, Jennifer Meierhans, Lauren Turner, Justin Parkinson and Sam Cabral.   Whenever President Donald Trump spoke about his administration's Covid response, he was often flanked by two of the nation's top doctors - Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx. Now the duo are revealing just how difficult it was to work under him. Ina long interview with the New York Times,external, Dr Fauci - the chief infectious disease specialist in the country - said the then president would often tell him he was too negative. ""I always felt that if I did walk away, the skunk at the picnic would no longer be at the picnic,"" explained Dr Fauci. Often contradicting the administration, he said he could not bring himself to resign because there was far too much Covid denialism - including from within the White House. ""Even if I wasn't very effective in changing everybody's minds, the idea 
that they knew that nonsense could not be spouted without my pushing 
back on it, I felt was important."" Ina separate interview with CBS,external, Dr Birx - the White House's Covid task force coordinator - confirmed that there was a ""parallel set of data and graphics"" presented to the president that she wasn't privy to. Dr Birx has since retired from public service, but Dr Fauci has joined the Biden administration as the new president's chief medical adviser. Home schooling can be tough. It's difficult to concentrate, there's emotional exhaustion, boredom, a lack of motivation and it's really hard not going out to see friends. And that's just the parents. This winter lockdown is taking its toll on families, now struggling even more on the black ice of uncertainty as no-one can say when schools in England are going to reopen for most pupils again. ""There's a sense of fatigue,"" says Jacqueline Smallwood, who is at home with three secondary-school children. She says her own ""concentration levels have fallen dramatically"". ""It's so repetitive that it just makes you feel tired,"" she says of the latest lockdown and the ""silent struggle"" facing both parents and their children to try to get motivated. Sound familiar? Read more from other parents ""at the end of their tether"". People in Lebanon are living under one of the world's strictest lockdowns. Under the round-the-clock curfew, citizens who are not ""essential workers"" have been barred from leaving their homes since 14 January. Laila, 12, is in Beirut trying to study while her family works from home. ""We all have our own work to do and when we have meetings we hear each other. It can be a real distraction and stop you from finishing your work on time,"" she says. ""Sometimes I can't study well because I get stressed with all the work they're giving us. It is definitely not the same studying online as it is in the physical world."" For hairdresser Walid Kanaan this year has been ""extremely difficult psychologically and economically"". ""I own my shop but still I cannot afford it. I pay the workers' salary so I am really broke,"" says the 45-year-old. ""It is hitting hard. You can't go out at all or do anything. My wife works in a bank and she is also collapsing. She doesn't know if she will still have her job or not. ""We don't trust the government that if they bring a vaccine it will be safe to take it. We can only pray for God to protect us."" Read more stories from people in lockdown in Lebanonhere. All of the residents in Manchesterâs care homes for older people have received their first Covid-19 vaccinations, according to the city's council. People living in the city's 56 care homes were prioritised for the vaccine rollout - with NHS teams aiming to have completed the first jabs by 24 January. Carolyn Ball, general manager of Belong Morris Feinmann Care Village in Didsbury, said she was ""delighted"" all their residents had been vaccinated. âThis is the additional protection we have long been waiting for and itâs great to be starting the new year knowing that our residents are at reduced risk,"" she added.  Reality Check At the daily briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that, âunder this lockdown, it is illegal to travel abroad unless you have a reasonable excuseâ. Under Englandâs lockdown rules, people must only go abroad for âessential reasonsâ. These are the same as the ""reasonable excuses"" for domestic travel, including:  The police can stop people to ask if they have a âreasonable excuseâ to travel, but it is not the responsibility of airlines to check. A handful of jobs and professions are also exempt from some of the travel restrictions, if they are making the journey for work reasons -  including pilots and coach drivers. Read more here:What are the UK travel rules? The UK government has confirmed it is considering using hotels to quarantine people arriving in the UK from countries with dangerous variants of coronavirus. But as that was revealed, shares in airlines and travel companies fell sharply. Both Easyjet and British Airways' parent company, IAG, saw their shares fall more than 7%. Read more hereon the hotel quarantine plans which are going to be discussed. Barely one year after its first coronavirus case was detected, the US has now surpassed 25 million total infections. It passed the devastating milestone on Sunday morning, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US has had well over twice as many overall cases as the next highest country, India, which has over 10 million cases. Nearly 420,000 Americans have died from the virus, almost double that of Brazil, the second highest. On Friday, US president Joe Biden warned the worst could be yet to come: ""The virus is surging. We're 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000."" It is now a race between the virus and the vaccine, as the new administration aims for 100 million jabs in its first 100 days. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Conservative MPs, publicly and
privately, are pressing for a clearer route-map out of lockdown. And in some
cases, frustration is boiling over; one Tory MP told me earlier that they were
âlividâ about the ongoing situation with schools. Matt Hancock was never likely
to come out and bind the government to a timeline today. But at the Downing Street press conference, he did talk about
these four âfactorsâ that ministers will be looking at when it comes to lifting
restrictions. Namely - the death rate, hospitalisations, any new variants that
affect the pandemic and the success of the vaccine rollout. Ministers may feel they need some room for manoeuvre in these
uncertain times. But a number of their own backbenchers will likely keep trying
to pin down some detail. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The falling numbers of infections being reported and rising
rate of vaccination are incredibly promising - even if the drop in infections
reported on Monday may have been partly an artefact of fewer people coming
forward for a test because of the snow. But that does not offer any guarantees of a rapid lifting of
lockdown. What is concerning ministers though are the high numbers in
hospital. The number of new admissions seems to have plateaued - but
at a very high rate. Close to 4,000 patients a day are being admitted to
hospital. To put that in context, that is four times the total number
of all types of respiratory admissions the NHS would normally see in winter. It means the numbers in hospital are at nearly twice the
level they were at the peak in the spring during the first wave. With better treatments available, patients are spending
longer in hospital. So come mid February the pressures in hospital are likely to
be very high, leaving ministers little wriggle-room to relax restrictions. The big unknown, however, is what impact and how quickly
vaccination will have an effect on admissions. There is encouraging early news from Israel that
hospitalisation really start to drop three weeks after the first dose. If that is repeated here, the picture could quickly change. But until that happens the government - in the words of Health
Secretary Matt Hancock - is urging the country to hold its nerve. A couple have been fined for making a 130-mile (209km) round trip from Derbyshire to York for a roast dinner. North Yorkshire Police said the couple, who were in their 20s, told officers one of their mothers was going to cook lunch on Sunday, but ""let them down"". They decided to make the trip to York in search of a takeaway lunch instead. The pair were given Covid fixed penalty notices, with police saying: ""We know nobody does Yorkshire puddings better than us here in Yorkshire... but they're really not worth getting into trouble for."" Read the full storyhere.  As a winter Covid surge batters California, scientists wondered if the contagious UK variant had landed in their state. Two independent research groups - in Los Angeles and San Francisco - are now confirming the existence of a homegrown variant of the virus. Data suggests it appears to be spreading faster than any other variant in the state. Both sets of researchers confirmed they had been looking for the UK strain when they stumbled upon the new mutation. A single instance of the strain was detected back in July but it lay dormant for months. It has since exploded across the state, likely contributing to a brutal holiday season that has strained hospital capacity to its limits and doubled the state's death toll. California has now recorded over three million total cases and more than 37,000 deaths. The daily press conference was given by Health Secretary Matt Hancock. He was joined by Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, and Dr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England. Here's what they told us: Reducing wastage of vaccines when dealing with the pandemic is crucial, Matt Hancock says. Asked if he will publish detailed wastage rates, he says he is ""very happy"" to look into giving more details. That concludes today's Downing Street press conference. Dan O'Donoghue from the Press and Journal asks why Scotland has the lowest vaccination rate in the UK. He also wants to know, following recent polls on Scottish independence, if the case for the union is helped or hindered by the government's performance over the past year. Echoing his earlier statement at the press conference, Matt Hancock says the case for the union is ""undoubtedly strengthened"" and the pandemic response has shown ""we are stronger as one United Kingdom"". He says the vaccine rollout is a case in point and that, other than Israel and the UAE, the UK has the fastest vaccine rollout in the world. ""It shows what the United Kingdom can do when we pull together,"" he said. Hancock adds that colleagues in Scotland are ""working incredibly hard"" to roll out the vaccines and ""the NHS in Scotland is doing an absolutely terrific job"". ""If this pandemic has taught us anything, it's that we all rely on each other,"" he adds. Matt Hancock says the proportion of people declining vaccinations is ""very, very low"". The programme is ""going well"" and the uptake is ""getting to really high levels"", he adds. Getting a jab is ""the right thing"", Hancock says, calling the media ""absolutely brilliant"" for ""supporting the science on this one"". Jenny Harries adds that with more information, take-up increases. Communities are getting the ""real level of data"" needed to support people, she says. She said the steroid Dexamethasone should also still work ""perfectly"" as a treatment for new variants.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: âThat idea of looking at hotels is certainly one thing we are actively now working on.â British nationals travelling to the UK from high-risk countries will have to quarantine in a hotel, under plans to be discussed by ministers. The BBC understands the proposals, expected to be discussed on Tuesday, could see people bussed to hotels on arrival. Boris Johnson said ministers were ""actively working on"" the idea, amid concern over new coronavirus variants. Most foreign nationals from high-risk countries already face UK travel bans. These include South Africa and Brazil, where newvariants of the viruswere recently discovered, as well as a number of countries near them. Whitehall sources said those quarantining in hotels would have to pay for the costs of their own accommodation. Hotel quarantine is already in place in countries including New Zealand and Australia. Hotel quarantine for UK arrivals to be discussed What are the new UK travel rules? Under current travel curbs, almost all people must test negative for Covid-19 up to 72 hours before travelling to be allowed into the UK. Even after this negative test, arrivals still have to quarantine for up to 10 days, although this can be done at home. In England, this self-isolation periodcan be cut short,externalwith a second negative test after five days. Quarantine rules are set separately inEngland,external,Scotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,external- but have only tended to differ slightly. Have you stayed in a quarantine hotel? Share your experiences. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy On Monday, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed officials around the UK had discussed a ""four nations"" approach to the issue. She added that hotel quarantine was ""under active consideration"" by Scottish ministers, and would be discussed at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. The Northern Ireland Executive is also expected to discuss travel rules when it meets on Tuesday. Speaking on Monday, Mr Johnson said the UK already had ""one of the tightest regimes in the world"" but the government wanted to ""protect this country from reinfection from abroad"" during the rollout of the vaccines. Asked who exactly would be required to self-isolate in hotels, he said: ""We need a solution that gives us the maximum possible protection against reinfection"". ""We have to realise there is at least the theoretical risk of a new variant that is a vaccine-busting variant coming in,"" he told reporters. ""We've got to be able to keep that under control"". The policy is among the measures credited with limiting cases of coronavirus in Australia -  whose population is around 25 million - to just 28,777 positive cases during the entire pandemic. This is a smaller number of new cases than are currently recorded in the UK every day - with adaily average,externalof over 33,000 in the past seven days. Passengers in Australian quarantine hotels have all meals delivered to their room. In Australia, travellers are allocated a hotel room on arrival and taken there by bus. Often, entire flights are accommodated in the same hotel. The New South Wales government pledges to make ""every attempt"" to find suitable accommodation for travellers and families. But availability of rooms means there are severe limits on the number of people who can arrive into the country on any given day. The hotel quarantine lasts a minimum of 14 days up to 24 days, providing a persontests negative twice,external. The cost of the quarantine is borne by the passenger - at around Â£1,700 per adult and Â£2,800 for a family of two adults and two children - and billed after the quarantine in completed. Fees are waived for those who can prove they are unable to pay, and there are certain exemptions. But not following the rules is a criminal offence, and in New South Wales carries fines of around Â£6,000 for individuals, six months in prison, or both with an additional Â£3,100 fine for each day the offence continues. Ministers have been facing pressure to toughen up the UK's borders in recent weeks, with Labour accusing ministers of ""dragging their feet on setting vital protections"". On Monday the party's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds backed the idea of using hotels to help ""prevent the importation of further strains of the virus"". Accusing ministers of a ""lack of strategy,"" he said the UK ""continually acts too slowly and without proper planning in place."" ""This continued failure is leaving the door open to new strains of Covid-19, putting people at risk and undermining the sacrifices everyone is making to address this virus.""

"Fraud has reached epidemic levels in the UK and should be seen as a national security issue, says think tank the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). The scale of credit card, identity and cyber-fraud makes it the most prevalent crime, costing up to Â£190bn a year. UK intelligence agencies should play a greater role in responding, the RUSI argues in a report. Policing should be better resourced, working more closely with the private sector, it adds. The report argues that the scale of fraud against the private sector has an impact on the reputation of the UK as a place to do business. Meanwhile, the amount lost by the government in fraudulent claims represents a ""heist"" on the public purse, undermining faith and trust, it says. It is the crime UK citizens are most likely to fall victim to, but the failures in responding risk undermining public confidence in the rule of law. The Crime Survey for England and Wales found 3.7 million reported incidents in 2019-20 of members of the public being targeted by credit card, identity and cyber-fraud. The private sector takes the biggest financial losses. One estimate from 2017 put the cost of fraud to businesses at Â£140bn. Brazen fraudsters offer crime subscription service UK cyber-centre targets payment card fraud Fraud against the public sector, including benefit, tax credit and student loan fraud, is estimated to cost Â£31-48bn a year, the upper figure larger than the UK's annual defence budget. The losses go beyond the financial, the authors say. ""Fraud has the potential to disrupt society in multiple ways, by psychologically impacting individuals, undermining the viability of businesses, putting pressure on public services, fuelling organised crime and funding terrorism,"" they add. The report cites evidence that terrorist groups and lone actors turn to fraud in order to finance their activities. In one case, eight supporters of the Islamic State group were convicted of defrauding UK pensioners out of more than Â£1m, which was alleged to be used in part to fund travel from the UK to Syria. The men carried out a type of courier fraud in which they pretended to be police officers, telling victims that their bank accounts had been compromised and needed to be transferred. But despite the growing scale of the problem, there is no national strategy for tackling the issue, while the police response is underfunded and lacking focus. This makes fraud ""everyone's problem but no-one's priority"", according to the report, written by RUSI experts Helena Wood, Tom Keatinge, Keith Ditcham and Ardi Janjev. The digitisation of everyday life - accelerated by Covid - has only increased the risks, with organised crime groups showing increased sophistication in their tactics. ""The UK has become a target destination for global fraudsters,"" the RUSI argues. But the extent to which international criminals focus on the UK is hard to gauge, because intelligence agencies have not traditionally focused on the issue. One senior fraud professional interviewed by the researchers said that despite 30 years of investigating fraud, they still had no idea what proportion of the threat emanated from overseas. Classifying fraud as a national security issue would help ensure the right level of resourcing and prioritisation, the authors argue. They also recommend more focused intelligence direction from the National Security Council, including greater tasking for GCHQ as well as the National Crime Agency to understand the issue. They call for better information-sharing and use of data analytics, as well as more money and attention from police forces to address what they call a ""responsibility vacuum"".

"Pictures of the Pampas grass on social media are thought to have made the area in South Shields popular A boom in the popularity of Pampas grass with interior decorators has led to ""droves"" of people picking the plant which grows wild near a beach. The grass, near Littlehaven Beach in South Shields, forms part of a wind defence to stop sand blowing onto roads and helps protect the coastline. South Tyneside Council warned anyone found removing it could be prosecuted. Councillor Ernest Gibson said while the grass may look ""beautiful in vases"" people were ""damaging the environment"". The grass, which was popular in the 1970s, can sell for up to Â£40 a bunch andhas proved a popular addition to people's homes.,external It is thought that photographs on social media sites such as Instagram may have influenced people turning up and taking it, Mr Gibson added. ""Pampas grass is quite expensive to buy if you went to a florist. It's cheaper to come to South Tyneside and take it away,"" he said. ""But what we are doing is urging people not to come here and take it away, it's there for a reason."" Pampas grass and Marram grass form part of a defence along the coast at South Shields The Pampas grass helps to bond poor soils found at the coast, while Marram grass helps to prevent erosion in the dunes. Signs are to be erected warning people not to pick the grass because it is already in need of replenishment, the council said. ""Through Covid, we have a massive amount of people coming to the coastal town, it's Benidorm without the sunshine,"" he added. ""It's great to see people at the seaside enjoying it [the grass] and that's what it's part of. It's there for everybody to view."" Garden designer George Wright said Pampas grass was ""very popular"" and he had seen demand increase two or three times at his nursery in West Boldon. He also expressed concern for the area. ""Once they take the flower heads themselves they take the seeds. Eventually this will become very much a patchy area and they will all start to decline. ""Pampas grass is becoming more and and more popular at the moment and I think a lot of it is people are starting to extend their houses into the garden so they want something nice in there, and also it's being used for interior decoration in houses.""

"Credit card giant Mastercard is to raise the fees it charges EU merchants when UK cardholders buy goods and services from them online by fivefold. It has sparked fears that consumer prices could rise if merchants choose to pass on those costs, especially on items not available from UK retailers. Transactions with airlines, hotels, car rentals and holiday firms based in the EU could all be affected. Mastercard attributed the move to the UK's decision to leave the EU. It said that only online sales would be affected and that ""in practice"" UK consumers would not notice the change. The change affects the ""interchange"" fees Mastercard sets on behalf of big banks, so that its customers can use their payment networks. Visa and Mastercard accused of 'excessive' fees 'I was asked to pay an extra Â£82 for my Â£200 coat' From October, Mastercard said it would increase these fees to 1.5% on every transaction, up from 0.3%. The EU introduced a cap on such fees in 2015 after concerns they pushed prices up for consumers and unfairly burdened companies. British customers makes tens of billions of pounds of purchases every year from European merchants on credit cards alone - and the hike in fees from Mastercard will affect the majority of those. The increase may be relatively small but it's significant, coming at a time when retailers may face extra paperwork and checks - higher costs - for goods coming into the UK. With Covid  restrictions bringing their own challenges, businesses, especially smaller ones,  may be compelled to pass on the costs to consumers. And it's not just items crossing borders. The payments for most items bought on Amazon in the UK are processed via its Luxembourg headquarters. With the increase not coming in for several months, international companies may look at ways to reclassify UK sales, to avoid the charges. Mastercard is implementing the rises simply as it's no longer bound by the restrictions imposed by the UK being in the EU. The banks which receive the fees have said in the past that they are invested in areas such as card security and innovation. This time, however, the trade body which represents them has declined to comment on the rises. But Mastercard said that since the end of the Brexit transition period, the cap no longer applied to many payments between the UK and European Economic Area (which also includes Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). ""As a result of the UK leaving the EEA, Mastercard will adapt interchange rates on UK cards to the commitments it gave the European Commission in 2019 for non-EEA card transactions,"" the company said. ""In practice, only EEA merchants making e-commerce sales to UK cardholders will see a change."" Kevin Hollinrake, chair of the parliamentary group on Fair Business Banking,told the Financial Times,external, which first reported the story, that the move ""smacks of opportunism"". And Callum Godwin, chief economist at CMSPI, the global payments consultancy, said airlines, hotels, car rentals and travel groups would be hit. ""[This will happen] anywhere the consumer is in the UK and the merchant is in the EU,"" he said. He added that many firms in these industries were already struggling due to the pandemic.Â Visa, Mastercard's larger rival, has not announced plans to change its fees but told the FT it was keeping the issue under review. Companies in the UK and EU are already facing added costs and delays due to post-Brexit trade rules brought in on 1 January. Some EU exporters have already stopped deliveries to the UK because ofnew VAT related charges. Meanwhile, UK consumers who have bought goods from firms based in the bloc have found themselves facing hefty chargesto cover customs duties, taxes and administration.

"Fashion retailer Boohoo has bought the Debenhams brand and website for Â£55m. However, it will not take on any of the firm's remaining 118 High Street stores or its workforce. Boohoo said it was a ""transformational deal"" and a ""huge step"". But the deal means that up to 12,000 jobs at the department store chain are set to go. The 242-year-old Debenhams chain is already in the process of closing down, after administrators failed to secure a rescue deal for the business. In a separate development,Asos says it is in ""exclusive"" talksto buy the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT brands out of administration. But the online retailer said it only wanted the brands, not their shops, suggesting any deal would cost jobs. The current owner of the brands, Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group, fell into administration last November putting 13,000 jobs at risk. A closing-down sale at 124 Debenhams stores began in December, as the administrators continued to seek offers for all or parts of the business. The company announced recently that six shops would not reopen after lockdown, including its flagship department store on London's Oxford Street. The administrators of Debenhams UK, FRP Advisory, said they had undertaken a ""thorough and robust process"" to achieve ""the best outcome for Debenhams' stakeholders"". ""This transaction will allow a new Debenhams-branded business to emerge under strong new ownership, including an online operation and the opportunity to secure an international franchise network that will operate under licence using the Debenhams name,"" they added. What went wrong at Debenhams? Five things you didn't know about Boohoo Asos frontrunner to buy Topshop and Miss Selfridge Debenhams pictured through the years Boohoo has already bought a number of High Street brands out of administration. It snapped up Oasis, Coast and Karen Millen, but not the associated stores. Its executive chairman, Mahmud Kamani, said: ""This is a transformational deal for the group, which allows us to capture the fantastic opportunity as ecommerce continues to grow. Our ambition is to create the UK's largest marketplace. ""Our acquisition of the Debenhams brand is strategically significant as it represents a huge step which accelerates our ambition to be a leader, not just in fashion ecommerce, but in new categories including beauty, sport and homeware."" Boohoo said Debenhams was expected to relaunch on Boohoo's web platform later this year. In the meantime, Debenhams will continue to operate its website for an agreed period. Boohoo's fast-fashion model has come under scrutiny Boohoo has recently come under fire over workers' pay and conditions and its ultra-low pricing. As well as facing questions about the environmental impact of its fast-fashion business model, there have been accusations of  widespread abuse of employment law at some of Boohoo's suppliers in Leicester. Investigations last year suggested workers were being paid below the minimum wage. After an independent review of the claims found a series of failings, Mr Kamani said last month that the firm was working to fix the problems, adding:""We will make a better Boohoo."" While online retailers have been whittling away at their High Street rivals for years, few could have predicted how quickly bricks-and-mortar stalwarts have collapsed. The pandemic has fatally undermined their already parlous finances. Businesses that appeared to have a chance of survival just a year ago have been wiped out and their brands bought by online players. The scale of the change is profound: when Debenhams listed on the stock exchange in 2011, investors valued it at Â£1.6bn. Boohoo, which was founded only in 2006, already has a stock market value of Â£4.4bn. Asos, a bit player two decades ago when Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group was riding high and toying with a bid for Marks & Spencer, is now valued by the stock market at Â£5bn. Neither Boohoo or Asos see any value in the Debenhams or Topshop High Street estates. Instead, they will concentrate on development of the brands and the associated customer data. This is bad news for the 19,000-odd people who work in the branches of Debenhams and Topshop, and will leave councils around the country wondering how they will fill town centres that were based on retail. But just as canny entrepreneurs and private equity companies are gearing up to buy struggling pub chains, in the hope of a recovery once lockdown restrictions are eased, so will some investors be wondering what next for the High Street. The British love affair with shopping will not end overnight and a well-placed punt now could have big rewards. Debenhams has struggled for years with falling profits and rising debts, as more shopping has moved online. It called in administrators twice in two years, most recently in April. However, its position became untenable during the coronavirus pandemic as non-essential retailers were forced to close for prolonged periods. The firm had already trimmed its store portfolio and cut about 6,500 jobs since May, as it struggled to stay afloat. Businessman Mike Ashley, who founded Sports Direct and also owns House of Fraser, had already made an offer for Debenhams after it was initially put up for sale in April. However, the takeover offer, thought to be in the region of Â£125m, was rejected as being too low. Meanwhile, one of House of Fraser's flagship outlets, the Jenners department store in Edinburgh, is to leave its Princes Street home after 183 years. It will close on 3 May with the loss of 200 jobs. The building's owner, Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, announced in November 2019 thathe intended to convert the site, replacing Jenners with a hotel, cafes, a rooftop restaurant and luxury shops. However, a spokesperson for Frasers Group said it had been ""unable to reach an agreement"" with Mr Povlsen and that the closure of Jenners would leave ""a vacant site for the foreseeable future with no immediate plans"".

"Testing for different variants of Covid-19 is ""massively more advanced"" in NI than in the Republic, the first minister has said. Arlene Foster commented on social media after Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin said his ""understanding"" was NI was not testing for the new variant. Mrs Foster said she had spoken to Mr Martin on Monday. She tweeted that he had ""accepted that Northern Ireland is testing for SARS-CoV-2"". Speaking to Irish national broadcaster RTÃ on Saturday, Mr Martin had said: ""When I discussed this with the leaders, their view was the variant doesn't appear to be as big an issue in the north... I can't understand that."" On Monday, the NI Department of Health announced 17 further deaths linked to Covid-19 and 422 more cases of the virus. The Republic of Ireland reported a further seven Covid-19 related deaths and 1,372 more cases. The departmentreleased a statement on Sunday,externalsaying ""in light of some misleading commentary in recent days"", it wanted to detail ""the ongoing work in Northern Ireland to identify new variants of the Covid-19"". It said that ""whole genome sequencing"", which is used to identify and track new strains of Covid-19, had been in place in Northern Ireland ""from an early stage of this pandemic"". It is thought that up to 50% of current Covid-19 cases could be related to the new ""English"" variant, which is thought to be about 50-70% more infectious than the original strain. Speaking on BBC's Good Morning Ulster, Dr Connor Bamford, a virologist at Queen's University, said: ""I think we need to be fairly concerned about this, for a couple of these variants they're actually changing how the virus behaves. ""This one, in particular, seems to be more transmissible, which means more people getting infected, more people getting sick and more people dying."" Is NI in the toughest period of Covid-19 pandemic? NI testing for new coronavirus variant 'limited' When asked on Good Morning Ulster about the new variant, Dr David Farren, a consultant microbiologist, said: ""It's not true to say we're not looking for it, but we are only looking for it, in a small number of cases."" When asked if it is inevitable that the new variant becomes the dominant variant he said there's ""certainly a high risk of that"".

Health trusts are now planning to invite clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) patients to receive their vaccine. The department said CEV patients would be contacted in due course. It also urged healthcare workers to take up the offer of a jab quickly.

As of Monday, 159,642 people in Northern Ireland had received a first vaccine dose. That represents more than 10.5% of the NI population. More than 20,000 people have received a second dose.

"Jenners department store in Edinburgh has been at the site since 1838 The owner of the Jenners building in Edinburgh has promised that it will remain a department store - despite the departure of its current tenant, the House of Fraser. Frasers Group said it would cease trading at the site on 3 May, with the loss of 200 jobs. The building is owned by Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen. A company spokesman said it would continue as a store and that ""advanced"" talks were taking place with operators. The Jenners building has occupied a prime location on Princes Street for 183 years. It was bought by Mr Povlsen - who is one of Scotland's biggest landowners - in 2017, reportedly for Â£53m. Jenners: No appetite for old retail? Jenners could quit Princes Street after 181 years House of Fraser attacks 'greedy' landlords The store is currently operated by the Frasers Group, which owns the commercial rights to the Jenners trading name. It said it would be quitting the site in May after the two sides were unable to come to an agreement. A Frasers spokesman claimed that the landlord had not been able to ""work mutually on a fair agreement"". He said this had led to ""the loss of 200 jobs and a vacant site for the foreseeable future, with no immediate plans. ""Our commitment to our Frasers strategy remains but landlords and retailers need to work together in a fair manner, especially when all stores are closed."" Anders Holch Povlsen is one of Scotland's biggest landowners However, Anders Krogh Vogdrup - the director of AAA United, which owns the Jenners building - said it had given Frasers a substantial rent reduction and rent-free periods to cover the lockdowns. ""Frasers has made the decision that it does not wish to continue in occupation,"" he said. ""This will see the end of the 16-year association between House of Fraser and this building, but not of the 180 years of Jenners department store."" Mr Vogdrup told BBC Scotland that it had bought the Jenners building ""out of passion for its architecture and history"". ""We have been sad to read on social media that we are to close the department store, as that is not the case,"" he said. ""We fought to keep the current tenant and we are now in advanced talks with other partners."" He said their ""first priority"" was to keep it as a department store, while there were also plans to turn some unused parts of the building into a hotel. ""The Jenners department store and building is the jewel in the crown of Edinburgh,"" he added. ""We are not turning it into a hotel. It will remain a department store."" He also expects the Jenners name will remain on the side of the building. Mr Povlsen, whose parents set up Scandinavian fashion company Bestseller, is believed to be worth Â£4.5bn. As well as owning Bestseller he is a major shareholder in online retailer Asos. He has previously revealed plans to use parts of the Princes Street building for a hotel, with the rest reserved for retail. The plans included the restoration of the building's Victorian facade and central atrium, which is a three-storey, top-lit grand saloon. A rooftop restaurant and bar would overlook nearby St Andrew Square. Mr Vogdrup said the plans to refurbish the store were now on hold due to the current economic climate. Jenners has dominated Edinburgh's main shopping thoroughfare since the mid-19th Century. It was opened in 1838 by local drapers Charles Jenner and Charles Kennington, who found themselves out of work after being sacked for taking a day off to go to the races in Musselburgh. Initially called Kennington & Jenner, the boutique store proved popular for keeping the people of Edinburgh in fine silks and linen, which could normally only be found in London. By 1890 the shop had changed name to Charles Jenner & Co and had expanded to adjoining buildings, making it one of the biggest stores in Scotland.

"There are 37,899 people in hospital in the UK with coronavirus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock says, including 4,076 on ventilators Almost four-in-five of people aged 80 and over have been vaccinated, Hancock says The new variant of the virus first identified in South East England is spreading 30-70% faster than the original, he says There are ""early signs that the actions we are taking are working"", with the rise in case numbers slowing and falling in some areas, he adds Ministers are holding discussions about what tier system will replace the current lockdown once it is lifted, Hancock says A further 592 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, new daily figures show Schools reopening is a priority but nobody wants restrictions lifted so quickly while the rate of infection is still very high, the prime minister says Thanks for joining us today. We'll be wrapping up our live coverage shortly. Here are some of the main stories we've been covering this Monday:  We'll be back tomorrow. Today's live page has been brought to you by James Clarke, Alex Kleiderman, Victoria Lindrea, Cherry Wilson, Jennifer Meierhans, Lauren Turner, Justin Parkinson and Sam Cabral.   Whenever President Donald Trump spoke about his administration's Covid response, he was often flanked by two of the nation's top doctors - Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx. Now the duo are revealing just how difficult it was to work under him. Ina long interview with the New York Times,external, Dr Fauci - the chief infectious disease specialist in the country - said the then president would often tell him he was too negative. ""I always felt that if I did walk away, the skunk at the picnic would no longer be at the picnic,"" explained Dr Fauci. Often contradicting the administration, he said he could not bring himself to resign because there was far too much Covid denialism - including from within the White House. ""Even if I wasn't very effective in changing everybody's minds, the idea 
that they knew that nonsense could not be spouted without my pushing 
back on it, I felt was important."" Ina separate interview with CBS,external, Dr Birx - the White House's Covid task force coordinator - confirmed that there was a ""parallel set of data and graphics"" presented to the president that she wasn't privy to. Dr Birx has since retired from public service, but Dr Fauci has joined the Biden administration as the new president's chief medical adviser. Home schooling can be tough. It's difficult to concentrate, there's emotional exhaustion, boredom, a lack of motivation and it's really hard not going out to see friends. And that's just the parents. This winter lockdown is taking its toll on families, now struggling even more on the black ice of uncertainty as no-one can say when schools in England are going to reopen for most pupils again. ""There's a sense of fatigue,"" says Jacqueline Smallwood, who is at home with three secondary-school children. She says her own ""concentration levels have fallen dramatically"". ""It's so repetitive that it just makes you feel tired,"" she says of the latest lockdown and the ""silent struggle"" facing both parents and their children to try to get motivated. Sound familiar? Read more from other parents ""at the end of their tether"". People in Lebanon are living under one of the world's strictest lockdowns. Under the round-the-clock curfew, citizens who are not ""essential workers"" have been barred from leaving their homes since 14 January. Laila, 12, is in Beirut trying to study while her family works from home. ""We all have our own work to do and when we have meetings we hear each other. It can be a real distraction and stop you from finishing your work on time,"" she says. ""Sometimes I can't study well because I get stressed with all the work they're giving us. It is definitely not the same studying online as it is in the physical world."" For hairdresser Walid Kanaan this year has been ""extremely difficult psychologically and economically"". ""I own my shop but still I cannot afford it. I pay the workers' salary so I am really broke,"" says the 45-year-old. ""It is hitting hard. You can't go out at all or do anything. My wife works in a bank and she is also collapsing. She doesn't know if she will still have her job or not. ""We don't trust the government that if they bring a vaccine it will be safe to take it. We can only pray for God to protect us."" Read more stories from people in lockdown in Lebanonhere. All of the residents in Manchesterâs care homes for older people have received their first Covid-19 vaccinations, according to the city's council. People living in the city's 56 care homes were prioritised for the vaccine rollout - with NHS teams aiming to have completed the first jabs by 24 January. Carolyn Ball, general manager of Belong Morris Feinmann Care Village in Didsbury, said she was ""delighted"" all their residents had been vaccinated. âThis is the additional protection we have long been waiting for and itâs great to be starting the new year knowing that our residents are at reduced risk,"" she added.  Reality Check At the daily briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that, âunder this lockdown, it is illegal to travel abroad unless you have a reasonable excuseâ. Under Englandâs lockdown rules, people must only go abroad for âessential reasonsâ. These are the same as the ""reasonable excuses"" for domestic travel, including:  The police can stop people to ask if they have a âreasonable excuseâ to travel, but it is not the responsibility of airlines to check. A handful of jobs and professions are also exempt from some of the travel restrictions, if they are making the journey for work reasons -  including pilots and coach drivers. Read more here:What are the UK travel rules? The UK government has confirmed it is considering using hotels to quarantine people arriving in the UK from countries with dangerous variants of coronavirus. But as that was revealed, shares in airlines and travel companies fell sharply. Both Easyjet and British Airways' parent company, IAG, saw their shares fall more than 7%. Read more hereon the hotel quarantine plans which are going to be discussed. Barely one year after its first coronavirus case was detected, the US has now surpassed 25 million total infections. It passed the devastating milestone on Sunday morning, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US has had well over twice as many overall cases as the next highest country, India, which has over 10 million cases. Nearly 420,000 Americans have died from the virus, almost double that of Brazil, the second highest. On Friday, US president Joe Biden warned the worst could be yet to come: ""The virus is surging. We're 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000."" It is now a race between the virus and the vaccine, as the new administration aims for 100 million jabs in its first 100 days. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Conservative MPs, publicly and
privately, are pressing for a clearer route-map out of lockdown. And in some
cases, frustration is boiling over; one Tory MP told me earlier that they were
âlividâ about the ongoing situation with schools. Matt Hancock was never likely
to come out and bind the government to a timeline today. But at the Downing Street press conference, he did talk about
these four âfactorsâ that ministers will be looking at when it comes to lifting
restrictions. Namely - the death rate, hospitalisations, any new variants that
affect the pandemic and the success of the vaccine rollout. Ministers may feel they need some room for manoeuvre in these
uncertain times. But a number of their own backbenchers will likely keep trying
to pin down some detail. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The falling numbers of infections being reported and rising
rate of vaccination are incredibly promising - even if the drop in infections
reported on Monday may have been partly an artefact of fewer people coming
forward for a test because of the snow. But that does not offer any guarantees of a rapid lifting of
lockdown. What is concerning ministers though are the high numbers in
hospital. The number of new admissions seems to have plateaued - but
at a very high rate. Close to 4,000 patients a day are being admitted to
hospital. To put that in context, that is four times the total number
of all types of respiratory admissions the NHS would normally see in winter. It means the numbers in hospital are at nearly twice the
level they were at the peak in the spring during the first wave. With better treatments available, patients are spending
longer in hospital. So come mid February the pressures in hospital are likely to
be very high, leaving ministers little wriggle-room to relax restrictions. The big unknown, however, is what impact and how quickly
vaccination will have an effect on admissions. There is encouraging early news from Israel that
hospitalisation really start to drop three weeks after the first dose. If that is repeated here, the picture could quickly change. But until that happens the government - in the words of Health
Secretary Matt Hancock - is urging the country to hold its nerve. A couple have been fined for making a 130-mile (209km) round trip from Derbyshire to York for a roast dinner. North Yorkshire Police said the couple, who were in their 20s, told officers one of their mothers was going to cook lunch on Sunday, but ""let them down"". They decided to make the trip to York in search of a takeaway lunch instead. The pair were given Covid fixed penalty notices, with police saying: ""We know nobody does Yorkshire puddings better than us here in Yorkshire... but they're really not worth getting into trouble for."" Read the full storyhere.  As a winter Covid surge batters California, scientists wondered if the contagious UK variant had landed in their state. Two independent research groups - in Los Angeles and San Francisco - are now confirming the existence of a homegrown variant of the virus. Data suggests it appears to be spreading faster than any other variant in the state. Both sets of researchers confirmed they had been looking for the UK strain when they stumbled upon the new mutation. A single instance of the strain was detected back in July but it lay dormant for months. It has since exploded across the state, likely contributing to a brutal holiday season that has strained hospital capacity to its limits and doubled the state's death toll. California has now recorded over three million total cases and more than 37,000 deaths. The daily press conference was given by Health Secretary Matt Hancock. He was joined by Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, and Dr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England. Here's what they told us: Reducing wastage of vaccines when dealing with the pandemic is crucial, Matt Hancock says. Asked if he will publish detailed wastage rates, he says he is ""very happy"" to look into giving more details. That concludes today's Downing Street press conference. Dan O'Donoghue from the Press and Journal asks why Scotland has the lowest vaccination rate in the UK. He also wants to know, following recent polls on Scottish independence, if the case for the union is helped or hindered by the government's performance over the past year. Echoing his earlier statement at the press conference, Matt Hancock says the case for the union is ""undoubtedly strengthened"" and the pandemic response has shown ""we are stronger as one United Kingdom"". He says the vaccine rollout is a case in point and that, other than Israel and the UAE, the UK has the fastest vaccine rollout in the world. ""It shows what the United Kingdom can do when we pull together,"" he said. Hancock adds that colleagues in Scotland are ""working incredibly hard"" to roll out the vaccines and ""the NHS in Scotland is doing an absolutely terrific job"". ""If this pandemic has taught us anything, it's that we all rely on each other,"" he adds. Matt Hancock says the proportion of people declining vaccinations is ""very, very low"". The programme is ""going well"" and the uptake is ""getting to really high levels"", he adds. Getting a jab is ""the right thing"", Hancock says, calling the media ""absolutely brilliant"" for ""supporting the science on this one"". Jenny Harries adds that with more information, take-up increases. Communities are getting the ""real level of data"" needed to support people, she says. She said the steroid Dexamethasone should also still work ""perfectly"" as a treatment for new variants. Channel 5's question about possible enforced hotel quarantine for people arriving from aboard was a reference to the prime minister's confirmation earlier in the day that the government was considering such a move. Incoming travellers already have to show evidence of a recent negative coronavirus test. At present, all travellers must provide contact details and theirUK address,external. They can then travel - by public transport if necessary - to their home or to the place where they plan to self-isolate. Here's everything you need to know about the UK travel and quarantine rules. Andy Bell at Channel 5 asks if Matt Hancock believes the time has come for enforced hotel quarantine for anyone coming into the UK. The health secretary says it is ""incredibly important"" that ""we are cautious at the border"". He notes travel corridors have now been removed and that lockdown rules mean travel abroad is illegal without a reasonable excuse, for example medical reasons. He says it is right to take a ""precautionary"" approach while analysis is continuing around the world on the virus. Dr Harries is asked if it was wrong to say, earlier in the pandemic, that there was no point in controlling the people coming in to the UK once the virus was already here. She says once there was a significant infection rate, the proportion coming in through borders was very small. But now new variants are being identified, other measures need to be put in place.  Matt Hancock says new virus variants from South Africa and Brazil are in ""very small numbers"" in the UK at present. The government is using ""enhanced contact tracing"" to deal with these, he adds, to ensure people affected and their contacts self-isolate. Asked how effective vaccines are against new coronavirus variants, Hancock says there's a ""high degree of confidence"" it works with the one first detected in Kent. The ban on foreign travel for most people is because the government does not want more people arriving ""at risk"" of having other strains. Susan Hopkins says it's ""reassuring"" that the vaccines work with the Kent variant. She said work is starting on testing its effect on the South African strain. Jenny Harries says mutations are normal for viruses and the ""majority"" will not be ""a cause of concern"". It's unlikely that vaccines will not work, to some extent, on new strains, she adds.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says teachers and pupils will be told âas much as we can, as soon as we canâ about reopening schools The government will tell teachers and parents when schools in England can reopen ""as soon as we can"", the prime minister has said. MPs have called on the government to set out a ""route map"" for reopening amid concerns for children's education. Boris Johnson said he understood why people wanted a timetable but he did not want to lift restrictions while the infection rate was ""still very high"". He would not guarantee schools would reopen before April's Easter break. Mr Johnson said: ""We've now got the R [reproduction rate] down below 1 across the whole of the country, that's a great achievement, we don't want to see a huge surge of infection just when we've got the vaccination programme going so well and people working so hard. ""I understand why people want to get a timetable from me today, what I can tell you is we'll tell you, tell parents, tell teachers as much as we can as soon as we can."" He said the government would be ""looking at the potential of relaxing some measures"" before mid-February, with Downing Street clarifying that this meant looking at the data to decide ""what we may or may not be able to ease from 15 February onwards"". A further 592 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test and another 22,195 cases have been recorded,according to Monday's government figures,external. 'Knackered and confused.' That's just the parents. Will schools reopen before Easter? How is the BBC helping home-schooling families? At Monday's Downing Street press briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said almost four in five of the UK's over-80s have had the vaccine, with nearly 6.6m people in total having had their first dose. But he said the NHS continues to be under ""intense pressure"", with Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, saying there are ""twice the number of people in hospital than we had in the first wave"" of the pandemic. Robert Halfon, chairman of the education select committee, told BBC Breakfast there was ""enormous uncertainty"" and called for the government to set out what the conditions needed to be for pupils to return to schools. The Conservative MP for Harlow suggested the government could consider tighter restrictions in other parts of society and the economy, in order to enable schools to open. Tory MPs were enraged by reports over the weekend that schools might not re-open fully until after the Easter holidays. Ministers say it's the progress of the pandemic that will determine their decision rather than a pre-agreed timetable. Yet whenever the government speaks, parents hear dates. Whether it's that the situation will be reviewed at half-term. Or a pledge to give two weeks' notice when classes will come back. MPs are now pushing for more transparency from the government about how they'll assess the data, and for some ideas between school being mostly closed or totally open. This issue is a perfect metaphor for the situation facing the entire country. Too much hope breeds disappointment, but living with uncertainty is just as hard. And you can come up with a plan but it might have to be junked if the virus has other ideas. Children's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield joined the call for clarity and told the BBC: ""Children are more withdrawn, they are really suffering in terms of isolation, their confidence levels are falling, and for some there are serious issues."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the government wanted to ""see all children back at the very earliest moment"". Schools in England have been closed to most pupils since the national lockdown began on 5 January due to high levels of Covid transmission in the community. There have been calls for teachers to be vaccinated sooner, although it is not clear if that would allow schools to reopen earlier. The majority of pupils in England are learning from home with schools only open to the children of key workers, vulnerable children and those who cannot learn at home Covid death rates among educational professionals are not ""statistically significantly different"" to those in the general population, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data, but secondary school teachers appeared to have an elevated risk compared particularly with people working in office-type jobs. Among secondary school teachers Covid death rates were 39.2 deaths per 100,000 males, compared with 31.4 for all males aged 20 to 64, and 21.2 per 100,000 females, compared with 16.8, but the ONS said these were ""not statistically significantly different than those of the same age and sex in the wider population"". Schools will remain closed inNorthern Ireland, Scotland and Walesuntil at least the February half-term - with the Welsh first minister saying it is""unlikely"" all pupils will return after the break. Gemma Cocker with her children Charlie and Lyla Gemma Cocker from Brighton is one of the many parents struggling to balance childcare, home learning and work. She says she's having to share her work laptop with her son, who has already missed learning time after the family moved home and did not have internet access. ""We didn't have any internet. The school said they had reached their limit so couldn't take him,"" she says. And because her children are young, she says: ""They're never just going to watch a classroom by themselves, you have to be with them the whole time."" Kitty Jones, 11, is in her last year of primary school and she says home learning is ""tricky"" because she is not used to using different remote platforms like Google Classroom and she wants to return ""as soon as possible"". ""I still think that I'm learning a bit, but I don't think I'm learning as much as I would be in person,"" she tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. Holly Agbukor, 18, is studying for her A-levels, says it is ""quite stressful"" learning at home, as it is a ""different environment, so it is not as easy to be fully present in the lessons"". But, she says, while is it ""difficult"" working at home, ""I don't think it is worth the cost of reintroducing the virus into society and making things worse overall"".

"Ambrose O'Neill was sentenced in his absence in 2008 A violent robber who went on the run for nearly 13 years has finally been caught and jailed. Ambrose O'Neill - dubbed ""The Running Man"" due to his ability to evade capture - skipped his 2008 trial over an attack on an antiques dealer. He was sentenced to eight years in prison in his absence but spent years at large, until police got a tip-off he was in hiding in Lincolnshire. The 42-year-old was arrested on Friday and is now beginning his sentence. Nottinghamshire Police said in 2007, O'Neill, of Ludgate Close in Arnold, knocked on his victim's front door in Seagrave, Leicestershire, posing as a pizza delivery man. When his victim opened the door, O'Neill pushed him over, punched him in the face and demanded he open a safe, threatening to kill him. But he ultimately left empty-handed and was later arrested. O'Neill attended the first day of his trial at Leicester Crown Court but then went on the run. Police said they launched Operation Gladiolus in December 2020 in a bid to track him down. PC James Gill, from Nottinghamshire Police's ""wanted squad"", said: ""We knew he had changed his appearance and lived in an area where people do not know him and he had an assumed identity,"" he said. ""He was laughing at the police, so we were determined to do everything to find him."" A major breakthrough came from an anonymous tip-off suggesting O'Neill may be living with a woman in the Wyberton area, in Lincolnshire.

"Jenners department store in Edinburgh has been at the site since 1838 The owner of the Jenners building in Edinburgh has promised that it will remain a department store - despite the departure of its current tenant, the House of Fraser. Frasers Group said it would cease trading at the site on 3 May, with the loss of 200 jobs. The building is owned by Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen. A company spokesman said it would continue as a store and that ""advanced"" talks were taking place with operators. The Jenners building has occupied a prime location on Princes Street for 183 years. It was bought by Mr Povlsen - who is one of Scotland's biggest landowners - in 2017, reportedly for Â£53m. Jenners: No appetite for old retail? Jenners could quit Princes Street after 181 years House of Fraser attacks 'greedy' landlords The store is currently operated by the Frasers Group, which owns the commercial rights to the Jenners trading name. It said it would be quitting the site in May after the two sides were unable to come to an agreement. A Frasers spokesman claimed that the landlord had not been able to ""work mutually on a fair agreement"". He said this had led to ""the loss of 200 jobs and a vacant site for the foreseeable future, with no immediate plans. ""Our commitment to our Frasers strategy remains but landlords and retailers need to work together in a fair manner, especially when all stores are closed."" Anders Holch Povlsen is one of Scotland's biggest landowners However, Anders Krogh Vogdrup - the director of AAA United, which owns the Jenners building - said it had given Frasers a substantial rent reduction and rent-free periods to cover the lockdowns. ""Frasers has made the decision that it does not wish to continue in occupation,"" he said. ""This will see the end of the 16-year association between House of Fraser and this building, but not of the 180 years of Jenners department store."" Mr Vogdrup told BBC Scotland that it had bought the Jenners building ""out of passion for its architecture and history"". ""We have been sad to read on social media that we are to close the department store, as that is not the case,"" he said. ""We fought to keep the current tenant and we are now in advanced talks with other partners."" He said their ""first priority"" was to keep it as a department store, while there were also plans to turn some unused parts of the building into a hotel. ""The Jenners department store and building is the jewel in the crown of Edinburgh,"" he added. ""We are not turning it into a hotel. It will remain a department store."" He also expects the Jenners name will remain on the side of the building. Mr Povlsen, whose parents set up Scandinavian fashion company Bestseller, is believed to be worth Â£4.5bn. As well as owning Bestseller he is a major shareholder in online retailer Asos. He has previously revealed plans to use parts of the Princes Street building for a hotel, with the rest reserved for retail. The plans included the restoration of the building's Victorian facade and central atrium, which is a three-storey, top-lit grand saloon. A rooftop restaurant and bar would overlook nearby St Andrew Square. Mr Vogdrup said the plans to refurbish the store were now on hold due to the current economic climate. Jenners has dominated Edinburgh's main shopping thoroughfare since the mid-19th Century. It was opened in 1838 by local drapers Charles Jenner and Charles Kennington, who found themselves out of work after being sacked for taking a day off to go to the races in Musselburgh. Initially called Kennington & Jenner, the boutique store proved popular for keeping the people of Edinburgh in fine silks and linen, which could normally only be found in London. By 1890 the shop had changed name to Charles Jenner & Co and had expanded to adjoining buildings, making it one of the biggest stores in Scotland. But just two years later fire destroyed the shop and ambitious plans - backed by the local council - were launched for a new look Jenners. Celebrated architect William Hamilton Beattie, who also designed the Balmoral and Carlton Hotel, was brought in for the redesign. Charles Jenner died in 1893 before the work was completed in 1895. In 1911 the popular store was given a Royal Warrant. After struggling in the the 21st Century, the Jenners brand was sold to rivals House of Fraser for Â£46m in 2005. In 2018, House of Fraser was bought by Mike Ashley's Sports Direct group. Jenners: No appetite for old retail?

"Sikkim is one of many areas that have seen India-China disputes. File image Chinese and Indian troops have reportedly clashed again in a disputed border area, with injuries on both sides, Indian media say. The incident took place in north Sikkim last Wednesday. India's army said there had been a ""minor"" incident that had been ""resolved"". Tensions are high along the world's longest disputed border. Both sides claim large areas of territory. At least 20 Indian soldiers died in a skirmish in the Ladakh area last June. The border row explained in 400 words Why tensions are rising between the neighbours India and China race to build along a disputed frontier It happened at Naku La in north Sikkim, the media reports said. Sikkim is an Indian state sandwiched between Bhutan and Nepal, about 2,500km (1,500 miles) east of the Ladakh area. A Chinese patrol tried to enter Indian territory and was forced back, the officials said. Some reports said sticks and stones were used, but there were no gunshots. An Indian army statement played down the incident, saying there ""was a minor face-off at Naku La area of North Sikkim on 20 January 2021 and the same was resolved by local commanders as per established protocols"". One source told the Times of India that both sides brought in reinforcements after a ""brawl"" but there was no gunfire and the situation was under control. China's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian did not give details of the incident, but said China's troops were ""committed to upholding peace"" and urged India to ""refrain from actions that might escalate or complicate the situation along the border"". The editor-in-chief of China's state-affiliated Global Times tweeted there was ""no record of this clash in the patrol log of the Chinese side"". Analysis by Vikas Pandey, BBC News, Delhi The latest reports about skirmishes show that tensions are still running high. The Indian army statement shows that both nations are still keen on keeping the dialogue route open and don't want skirmishes to derail the process. They have conducted several military-level talks to ease tensions but nothing concrete has come of them yet. And troops are still facing each other at several flashpoints along their contested border. Some former Indian officers say such exchanges can't be avoided when the situation is so fluid. But they agree that talks need to continue as both nations would not want a war - not even a limited one. A lot of the 3,440km (2,100-mile) border is ill defined. Rivers, lakes and snowcaps mean the line can shift, bringing soldiers face to face at many points, sometimes leading to confrontations. There was a minor clash last May at Naku La, which is at an altitude of more than 5,000m (16,000ft). One month later a deadly clash eruptedin the Galwan Valley in Ladakh. In addition to the Indian deaths, China also reportedly suffered casualties although it made no official comment. This video can not be played Ros Atkins looks at what happened on the India-China border in June 2020 Since the savage hand-to-hand fighting there, in which no shots were fired, the two sides have held de-escalation talks. The ninth round of them took place between military commanders on Sunday in eastern Ladakh but there have been no details of any agreements. How misleading India-China border claims were shared online The nuclear-armed neighbours have a lot to lose, with China one of India's biggest trading partners. Relations have worsened amid the border face-off. Both have stepped up infrastructure construction along some of the border areas. India's government hasalso banned more than 200 Chinese apps, citing cyber security concerns. The two countries have fought only one war, in 1962, when India suffered a heavy defeat. An agreement was signed in 1996 barring the use of guns and explosives from the Line of Actual Control, as the disputed border is known. It has held, although both sides didaccuse each other of firing warning shots or shots into the air in Ladakhlast September. The tiny east Himalayan region has been a key flashpoint between India and China for decades. It saw clashes in their 1962 war. Five years later, fighting along its border left several hundred soldiers dead on either side. The former kingdom was an Indian protectorate at the time, and only became the country's 22nd state after a referendum in 1975. Sikkim is near a high-altitude plateau known as Doklam in India and Donglang in China. India fears that greater Chinese road access to the plateau would threaten India's strategically vulnerable ""chicken's neck"", the 20km (12-mile) wide Siliguri Corridor that links seven north-eastern states, including Assam, to the rest of the country. The border in Sikkim is also crucial for another reason. Indian military experts say it's the only area through which India could make an offensive response to a Chinese incursion, and the only stretch of the Himalayan frontier where Indian troops have a terrain and tactical advantage. They have higher ground, and the Chinese positions there are squeezed between India and Bhutan.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: âThat idea of looking at hotels is certainly one thing we are actively now working on.â British nationals travelling to the UK from high-risk countries will have to quarantine in a hotel, under plans to be discussed by ministers. The BBC understands the proposals, expected to be discussed on Tuesday, could see people bussed to hotels on arrival. Boris Johnson said ministers were ""actively working on"" the idea, amid concern over new coronavirus variants. Most foreign nationals from high-risk countries already face UK travel bans. These include South Africa and Brazil, where newvariants of the viruswere recently discovered, as well as a number of countries near them. Whitehall sources said those quarantining in hotels would have to pay for the costs of their own accommodation. Hotel quarantine is already in place in countries including New Zealand and Australia. Hotel quarantine for UK arrivals to be discussed What are the new UK travel rules? Under current travel curbs, almost all people must test negative for Covid-19 up to 72 hours before travelling to be allowed into the UK. Even after this negative test, arrivals still have to quarantine for up to 10 days, although this can be done at home. In England, this self-isolation periodcan be cut short,externalwith a second negative test after five days. Quarantine rules are set separately inEngland,external,Scotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,external- but have only tended to differ slightly. Have you stayed in a quarantine hotel? Share your experiences. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy On Monday, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed officials around the UK had discussed a ""four nations"" approach to the issue. She added that hotel quarantine was ""under active consideration"" by Scottish ministers, and would be discussed at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. The Northern Ireland Executive is also expected to discuss travel rules when it meets on Tuesday. Speaking on Monday, Mr Johnson said the UK already had ""one of the tightest regimes in the world"" but the government wanted to ""protect this country from reinfection from abroad"" during the rollout of the vaccines. Asked who exactly would be required to self-isolate in hotels, he said: ""We need a solution that gives us the maximum possible protection against reinfection"". ""We have to realise there is at least the theoretical risk of a new variant that is a vaccine-busting variant coming in,"" he told reporters. ""We've got to be able to keep that under control"". The policy is among the measures credited with limiting cases of coronavirus in Australia -  whose population is around 25 million - to just 28,777 positive cases during the entire pandemic. This is a smaller number of new cases than are currently recorded in the UK every day - with adaily average,externalof over 33,000 in the past seven days. Passengers in Australian quarantine hotels have all meals delivered to their room. In Australia, travellers are allocated a hotel room on arrival and taken there by bus. Often, entire flights are accommodated in the same hotel. The New South Wales government pledges to make ""every attempt"" to find suitable accommodation for travellers and families. But availability of rooms means there are severe limits on the number of people who can arrive into the country on any given day. The hotel quarantine lasts a minimum of 14 days up to 24 days, providing a persontests negative twice,external. The cost of the quarantine is borne by the passenger - at around Â£1,700 per adult and Â£2,800 for a family of two adults and two children - and billed after the quarantine in completed. Fees are waived for those who can prove they are unable to pay, and there are certain exemptions. But not following the rules is a criminal offence, and in New South Wales carries fines of around Â£6,000 for individuals, six months in prison, or both with an additional Â£3,100 fine for each day the offence continues. Ministers have been facing pressure to toughen up the UK's borders in recent weeks, with Labour accusing ministers of ""dragging their feet on setting vital protections"". On Monday the party's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds backed the idea of using hotels to help ""prevent the importation of further strains of the virus"". Accusing ministers of a ""lack of strategy,"" he said the UK ""continually acts too slowly and without proper planning in place."" ""This continued failure is leaving the door open to new strains of Covid-19, putting people at risk and undermining the sacrifices everyone is making to address this virus.""

"Dom Sibley and Jos Buttler shared a stand of 74 from 111 balls to secure victory late in the day Second Test, Galle (day four of five) Sri Lanka 381(Mathews 110, Anderson 6-40)& 126(Bess 4-49, Leach 4-59) England 344(Root 186, Embuldeniya 7-137)& 164-4(Sibley 56*, Buttler 46*) England won by six wickets Scorecard England completed a thrilling victory on day four of the second Test against Sri Lanka to take the series 2-0. Chasing a tricky 164, England were 89-4 on a turning pitch but opener Dom Sibley hit 56 not out to lead them to a six-wicket win. Sibley, who had not reached double figures in the series, put on 75 with Jos Buttler, who made 46 not out. Earlier, England capitalised on reckless batting to dismiss Sri Lanka for 126 in their second innings. Dom Bess and Jack Leach took four wickets each and the hosts would have been dismissed even more cheaply but for 40 from number 10 Lasith Embuldeniya, who finished with match figures of 10-210. Resuming on 339-9 in their first innings, England conceded a first-innings deficit of 37 when Jack Leach was dismissed with only five runs added. Sri Lanka were favourites at that point but England completed a turnaround on a dramatic day when 15 wickets fell. The series win is England's fourth in a row and they are also unbeaten in 10 successive Tests under Joe Root's captaincy, going into a difficult series in India which starts on 5 February. England are fourth in the World Test Championship table, 0.5% behind third-placed Australia. Root urges England not to 'stand still' TMS podcast: What does England's series win mean for India tour? The World Test Championship is based on the percentage of points won from those available, because of the coronavirus pandemic's impact on the calendar. The top two teams will compete in the final this summer. This was also England's fifth consecutive away Test win, the first time they have achieved that feat since World War One. They are developing an impressive winning habit. Sri Lanka's batting, perhaps spooked by the turning pitch, was inept and their effort in the field lacklustre, but England were clinical. Bess and Leach bowled well - far better than their wicketless showing in the first innings - while James Anderson took a brilliant high catch and Zak Crawley two excellent grabs at short leg. Sri Lanka were leading only by 115 when their eighth wicket fell, before Embuldeniya, who had a remarkable game in defeat, dragged them to a score. The target looked competitive - the hosts were possibly even favourites - but the manner England in which overhauled it was mightily impressive. There was a wobble when Jonny Bairstow was trapped lbw for a useful 28-ball 29, Root - the dominant player in the series - was bowled for 11 and Dan Lawrence edged behind with a further 85 needed. England have won six successive Tests in Sri Lanka However, Sibley played the anchor role while Buttler provided impetus in his typically attacking style. Sibley, so at sea in his previous three innings, calmly nudged singles into the leg side. Buttler played thumped drives to the extra-cover boundary, smacked a reverse sweep through point and launched a slog sweep through mid-wicket. In the end, England won with ease, Sibley sealing a fine win by tapping for one. Sri Lanka threatened better in this match, having been convincingly beaten by seven wickets in the first. They batted well in the first innings and in Embuldeniya they have a fine spinner, playing only his ninth Test. But their fourth-day performance was abysmal. Their batting was akin to their performance on day one of the series when they were bowled out for 135. The dismissals of captain Dinesh Chandimal - skying a slog sweep to Anderson at mid-on having hit a four a ball earlier - and Niroshan Dickwella, who drove Bess to extra cover two minutes before lunch, were the worst of a series of needlessly aggressive shots. Sri Lanka also disappointed in the field. They were a little unfortunate that Sibley survived three tight lbw reviews, all of which were umpire's call, but their tactics were baffling. Chandimal set the field back and allowed an accumulator in Sibley to tick along as he wished. This tour, while important for points in the World Test Championship, always felt like the warm-up act in a huge year for England's Test team. Next they face a far bigger challenge in India before a summeragainst New Zealand,top of the Test rankings, India again, and an Ashes series in Australia the winter. The biggest plus of this series has been the emphatic run-scoring of Root. He did not score a century in 2019 but made 228 and 186, albeit against a poor Sri Lanka. The skipper amassed 426 runs at an average of 106.50 in the series. Bess and Leach were by no means perfect - they bowl too many bad balls - but finished the series with 12 and 10 wickets respectively. The match-winning fifty for Sibley is also a significant boost going into the four Tests in India. Having been dismissed by Embuldeniya in every innings on tour previously, he showed he can grind out a score. England's veteran bowlers, Anderson and Stuart Broad, proved once again they can perform in unhelpful conditions. There are question marks, however, about opener Crawley, whose top score in four innings was 13. The issues at the top of the order are complicated by the fact Bairstow, who has done well at number three, has been rested for the first two Tests in India. England opener Dom Sibley on Test Match Special:""I didn't think I'd left any stone unturned with regards playing spin, but then you go back to your room in the evening and think 'maybe I'm not up to this' and have those doubts. ""It is about accepting those and just believing. It just feels like pure relief at the moment."" Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal:""We were outplayed today. We have done all the hard work in the last three days but as a batting unit we made the same mistakes of the first Test. There are no excuses for the batsmen and we've got to learn how to bat like Joe Root."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan:""A really, really strong performance from England. If you look down from one to 11, most people have contributed. ""They will have to bowl better in India. But the confidence that this will do for the team, and for Joe Root at the start of a huge year, is huge.""

"Fashion retailer Boohoo has bought the Debenhams brand and website for Â£55m. However, it will not take on any of the firm's remaining 118 High Street stores or its workforce. Boohoo said it was a ""transformational deal"" and a ""huge step"". But the deal means that up to 12,000 jobs at the department store chain are set to go. The 242-year-old Debenhams chain is already in the process of closing down, after administrators failed to secure a rescue deal for the business. In a separate development,Asos says it is in ""exclusive"" talksto buy the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT brands out of administration. But the online retailer said it only wanted the brands, not their shops, suggesting any deal would cost jobs. The current owner of the brands, Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group, fell into administration last November putting 13,000 jobs at risk. A closing-down sale at 124 Debenhams stores began in December, as the administrators continued to seek offers for all or parts of the business. The company announced recently that six shops would not reopen after lockdown, including its flagship department store on London's Oxford Street. The administrators of Debenhams UK, FRP Advisory, said they had undertaken a ""thorough and robust process"" to achieve ""the best outcome for Debenhams' stakeholders"". ""This transaction will allow a new Debenhams-branded business to emerge under strong new ownership, including an online operation and the opportunity to secure an international franchise network that will operate under licence using the Debenhams name,"" they added. What went wrong at Debenhams? Five things you didn't know about Boohoo Asos frontrunner to buy Topshop and Miss Selfridge Debenhams pictured through the years Boohoo has already bought a number of High Street brands out of administration. It snapped up Oasis, Coast and Karen Millen, but not the associated stores. Its executive chairman, Mahmud Kamani, said: ""This is a transformational deal for the group, which allows us to capture the fantastic opportunity as ecommerce continues to grow. Our ambition is to create the UK's largest marketplace. ""Our acquisition of the Debenhams brand is strategically significant as it represents a huge step which accelerates our ambition to be a leader, not just in fashion ecommerce, but in new categories including beauty, sport and homeware."" Boohoo said Debenhams was expected to relaunch on Boohoo's web platform later this year. In the meantime, Debenhams will continue to operate its website for an agreed period. Boohoo's fast-fashion model has come under scrutiny Boohoo has recently come under fire over workers' pay and conditions and its ultra-low pricing. As well as facing questions about the environmental impact of its fast-fashion business model, there have been accusations of  widespread abuse of employment law at some of Boohoo's suppliers in Leicester. Investigations last year suggested workers were being paid below the minimum wage. After an independent review of the claims found a series of failings, Mr Kamani said last month that the firm was working to fix the problems, adding:""We will make a better Boohoo."" While online retailers have been whittling away at their High Street rivals for years, few could have predicted how quickly bricks-and-mortar stalwarts have collapsed. The pandemic has fatally undermined their already parlous finances. Businesses that appeared to have a chance of survival just a year ago have been wiped out and their brands bought by online players. The scale of the change is profound: when Debenhams listed on the stock exchange in 2011, investors valued it at Â£1.6bn. Boohoo, which was founded only in 2006, already has a stock market value of Â£4.4bn. Asos, a bit player two decades ago when Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group was riding high and toying with a bid for Marks & Spencer, is now valued by the stock market at Â£5bn. Neither Boohoo or Asos see any value in the Debenhams or Topshop High Street estates. Instead, they will concentrate on development of the brands and the associated customer data. This is bad news for the 19,000-odd people who work in the branches of Debenhams and Topshop, and will leave councils around the country wondering how they will fill town centres that were based on retail. But just as canny entrepreneurs and private equity companies are gearing up to buy struggling pub chains, in the hope of a recovery once lockdown restrictions are eased, so will some investors be wondering what next for the High Street. The British love affair with shopping will not end overnight and a well-placed punt now could have big rewards. Debenhams has struggled for years with falling profits and rising debts, as more shopping has moved online. It called in administrators twice in two years, most recently in April. However, its position became untenable during the coronavirus pandemic as non-essential retailers were forced to close for prolonged periods. The firm had already trimmed its store portfolio and cut about 6,500 jobs since May, as it struggled to stay afloat. Businessman Mike Ashley, who founded Sports Direct and also owns House of Fraser, had already made an offer for Debenhams after it was initially put up for sale in April. However, the takeover offer, thought to be in the region of Â£125m, was rejected as being too low. Meanwhile, one of House of Fraser's flagship outlets, the Jenners department store in Edinburgh, is to leave its Princes Street home after 183 years. It will close on 3 May with the loss of 200 jobs. The building's owner, Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, announced in November 2019 thathe intended to convert the site, replacing Jenners with a hotel, cafes, a rooftop restaurant and luxury shops. However, a spokesperson for Frasers Group said it had been ""unable to reach an agreement"" with Mr Povlsen and that the closure of Jenners would leave ""a vacant site for the foreseeable future with no immediate plans"".

"Dom Sibley and Jos Buttler shared a stand of 74 from 111 balls to secure victory late in the day Second Test, Galle (day four of five) Sri Lanka 381(Mathews 110, Anderson 6-40)& 126(Bess 4-49, Leach 4-59) England 344(Root 186, Embuldeniya 7-137)& 164-4(Sibley 56*, Buttler 46*) England won by six wickets Scorecard England completed a thrilling victory on day four of the second Test against Sri Lanka to take the series 2-0. Chasing a tricky 164, England were 89-4 on a turning pitch but opener Dom Sibley hit 56 not out to lead them to a six-wicket win. Sibley, who had not reached double figures in the series, put on 75 with Jos Buttler, who made 46 not out. Earlier, England capitalised on reckless batting to dismiss Sri Lanka for 126 in their second innings. Dom Bess and Jack Leach took four wickets each and the hosts would have been dismissed even more cheaply but for 40 from number 10 Lasith Embuldeniya, who finished with match figures of 10-210. Resuming on 339-9 in their first innings, England conceded a first-innings deficit of 37 when Jack Leach was dismissed with only five runs added. Sri Lanka were favourites at that point but England completed a turnaround on a dramatic day when 15 wickets fell. The series win is England's fourth in a row and they are also unbeaten in 10 successive Tests under Joe Root's captaincy, going into a difficult series in India which starts on 5 February. England are fourth in the World Test Championship table, 0.5% behind third-placed Australia. Root urges England not to 'stand still' TMS podcast: What does England's series win mean for India tour? The World Test Championship is based on the percentage of points won from those available, because of the coronavirus pandemic's impact on the calendar. The top two teams will compete in the final this summer. This was also England's fifth consecutive away Test win, the first time they have achieved that feat since World War One. They are developing an impressive winning habit. Sri Lanka's batting, perhaps spooked by the turning pitch, was inept and their effort in the field lacklustre, but England were clinical. Bess and Leach bowled well - far better than their wicketless showing in the first innings - while James Anderson took a brilliant high catch and Zak Crawley two excellent grabs at short leg. Sri Lanka were leading only by 115 when their eighth wicket fell, before Embuldeniya, who had a remarkable game in defeat, dragged them to a score. The target looked competitive - the hosts were possibly even favourites - but the manner England in which overhauled it was mightily impressive. There was a wobble when Jonny Bairstow was trapped lbw for a useful 28-ball 29, Root - the dominant player in the series - was bowled for 11 and Dan Lawrence edged behind with a further 85 needed. England have won six successive Tests in Sri Lanka However, Sibley played the anchor role while Buttler provided impetus in his typically attacking style. Sibley, so at sea in his previous three innings, calmly nudged singles into the leg side. Buttler played thumped drives to the extra-cover boundary, smacked a reverse sweep through point and launched a slog sweep through mid-wicket. In the end, England won with ease, Sibley sealing a fine win by tapping for one. Sri Lanka threatened better in this match, having been convincingly beaten by seven wickets in the first. They batted well in the first innings and in Embuldeniya they have a fine spinner, playing only his ninth Test. But their fourth-day performance was abysmal. Their batting was akin to their performance on day one of the series when they were bowled out for 135. The dismissals of captain Dinesh Chandimal - skying a slog sweep to Anderson at mid-on having hit a four a ball earlier - and Niroshan Dickwella, who drove Bess to extra cover two minutes before lunch, were the worst of a series of needlessly aggressive shots. Sri Lanka also disappointed in the field. They were a little unfortunate that Sibley survived three tight lbw reviews, all of which were umpire's call, but their tactics were baffling. Chandimal set the field back and allowed an accumulator in Sibley to tick along as he wished. This tour, while important for points in the World Test Championship, always felt like the warm-up act in a huge year for England's Test team. Next they face a far bigger challenge in India before a summeragainst New Zealand,top of the Test rankings, India again, and an Ashes series in Australia the winter. The biggest plus of this series has been the emphatic run-scoring of Root. He did not score a century in 2019 but made 228 and 186, albeit against a poor Sri Lanka. The skipper amassed 426 runs at an average of 106.50 in the series. Bess and Leach were by no means perfect - they bowl too many bad balls - but finished the series with 12 and 10 wickets respectively. The match-winning fifty for Sibley is also a significant boost going into the four Tests in India. Having been dismissed by Embuldeniya in every innings on tour previously, he showed he can grind out a score. England's veteran bowlers, Anderson and Stuart Broad, proved once again they can perform in unhelpful conditions. There are question marks, however, about opener Crawley, whose top score in four innings was 13. The issues at the top of the order are complicated by the fact Bairstow, who has done well at number three, has been rested for the first two Tests in India. England opener Dom Sibley on Test Match Special:""I didn't think I'd left any stone unturned with regards playing spin, but then you go back to your room in the evening and think 'maybe I'm not up to this' and have those doubts. ""It is about accepting those and just believing. It just feels like pure relief at the moment."" Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal:""We were outplayed today. We have done all the hard work in the last three days but as a batting unit we made the same mistakes of the first Test. There are no excuses for the batsmen and we've got to learn how to bat like Joe Root."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan:""A really, really strong performance from England. If you look down from one to 11, most people have contributed. ""They will have to bowl better in India. But the confidence that this will do for the team, and for Joe Root at the start of a huge year, is huge.""

"At least 80 people had to leave their homes in the village after flooding People whose homes were flooded after a ""blow out"" at a mine shaft are said to be ""devastated"" as they face months before they can return home. Steve Morris said his son Gareth and his girlfriend's home in Skewen, Neath Port Talbot, was inundated by ""orange"" flood water containing sewage. Eighty people were evacuated on Thursdayand residents wereurged to stay away due to safety fears. But some will be allowed back to their properties on Tuesday. Residents of Goshen Park and Sunnyland Crescent who have yet to contact Neath Port Talbot council are urged to do so in the next 24 hours. The council said access to these properties would continue to be affected beyond 26 January and the Coal Authority wished to have early discussions with them. Mr Morris told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast that his son called him on Thursday to say his house was about to be flooded. This video can not be played Teresa Dalling says a river of orange water rushed through the village on Thursday ""I live about half a mile away... and by the time I got to his address I could see the water levels were rising rapidly up the road,"" he explained. ""Then it was so quick - the water came through his rear patio doors firstly, then the gardens and then the drains couldn't cope on the main road and came through the front door, then the side door. ""His ground floor was four feet under water, and it was this orange coloured water. There was sewage in the house, so his ground floor needs totally gutting."" Is Wales' coalmining past behind home evacuations? Financial help offered to flood victims Helicopter crew rescues family trapped by floods Mr Morris said Gareth and his girlfriend are staying in a hotel as they wait to be allowed back to assess the damage. He hopes their insurance firm will pay to rent a home for them, adding: ""I can honestly see them being out of their house for between six and 10 months. ""They are obviously devastated - they have only been in there for 12 months so everything was near enough brand new."" Cerys Thomas was at her mother's house with her son, in Goshen Park, when she saw water coming through the front door. The stairs at the home of Cerys Thomas' parents were left caked in mud She said: ""I said to my mother to get my son and herself out and up toward the street. I phoned the police then, because I could see it was going to be an emergency, and within minutes my parents' conservatory doors just blew through. ""The pressure of the water just blew through the house and the water, within minutes, was up to my waist. ""Trying to get out of the house was very scary because the pressure of the front door was getting pushed back."" She said the street was under water ""within seven minutes"". ""It was something you would see in a movie,"" she said. Within minutes of water entering the house Ms Thomas was up to her waist in water Meanwhile, the Coal Authority said it has identified the cause of the ""blow out"". Chief executive Lisa Pinney told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""Firstly, I just want to say our thoughts are with everyone affected by this flooding and we are genuinely sorry people have been affected in this way. ""What we know so far is the blow out was caused by a blockage underground which caused water to break out, basically to find the easiest path, and there's no doubt the excessive rainfall in the days before was also a factor in that."" This video can not be played Parts of village underwater after flooding Ms Pinney said crews had been able to find the site of the collapsed mineshaft which had caused the flooding, and the authority had started to ""develop options"". ""We really understand people want to get back into their homes, they want to collect things, they want to know what the next steps are,"" she continued. ""We are working as fast as possible to make that happen and we hope to be able to provide some more information in the next day or so, but you will understand that we have to be sure for public safety."" Ms Pinney said there are almost 300 mine shafts or entries across the Skewen mine works, which covers an area of about 12 sq km (7.6 sq miles).

Eighty people had to be evacuated from Skewen, Neath Port Talbot, on Thursday and the Coal Authority is investigating the cause of the flooding. On Sunday First Minister Mark Drakeford visited the village. Specialists said mine shafts in the area were stable, but villagers were told it was not safe to return home. Neath Port Talbot Council tweeted on Sunday afternoon that some evacuated residents had ignored the warnings. It said: ""We are getting reports that some residents who have been evacuated are returning to their homes. ""Investigations are ongoing at the site, including safety checks by utility companies.

"The water is warmer than the air and is creating a mist along Dynevor Road The coalmining heritage of Wales has been implicated in flooding of homes - but what has happened in Skewen? About80 people were evacuatedfrom the Neath Port Talbot village, with at least eight streets left under water. Council leader Rob Jones says the flood appears to be related to mine works - but the volume of water involved has hampered a full assessment so far. The Coal Authority is investigating how ""historic underground mining features"" in the area exacerbated the problem. A geologist says there are tens of thousands of old mine shafts across the former south Wales coalfield and it is ""incredibly difficult"" to monitor them all. Skewen lies within an old coal mining hotspot, with several former colliery sites near the village that operated in the 19th and early 20th Century. There were colliery sites near what is now Drummau Road, in the north of the village and another close to Old Road, near Neath Abbey. Skewen was part of a collection of collieries that stretched between Neath and Llanelli on the western side of south Wales' coalfield. Graham Levins, secretary of the Welsh Mines Preservation Trust, said old mines often contain groundwater which can flood in heavy rain. Financial help offered to flood victims Storm Christoph: Flood warnings and homes evacuated Storm Christoph in pictures Storm Christoph floods tracked by satellite radar He said: ""A lot of them go very, very deep down, much below the local water level and that's why they had all the big wheels to pump the water out. ""It fills up with water and will find a way out. Normally rainfall you get it doesn't cause a lot of problems but when you get really heavy rain, the water drains down through the ground and builds up."" Streets were turned into rivers in Skewen Geologist Tom Backhouse said water was coming out of an area near the junction of Goshen Park and Drummau Road, where there is a record of a mine shaft dating from the turn of the 20th Century. It then started ""rushing down"" Drummau Road, causing the flooding that forced evacuations. ""What we can expect to have happened is that the water level in the mines rose to a point where it's burst out of that entry point from the mine workings below. ""Also, there are images of very ochre like orange-coloured water and again, that may well be issuing from the mine workings on the highlands to the east of the property on the hill behind. ""That may be where the shallow workings have flooded."" He said old mine working across the former coalfield area hold water at a certain depth, but when an event such as Storm Christoph drops ""a huge amount in a small area"", the levels rise quickly. ""As it gets closer and closer to the surface, it basically looks for an escape, the pressure builds up,"" he continued. ""What it looks like has happened on the junction of Goshen Park and Drummau Road, where the mine shaft is recorded, is that pressure has built up at that point and then burst out through the shaft which is very likely to have been capped with wood or something like that. ""Where you've got those mine shafts, which ultimately are vertical tunnels down into the mine workings below, the water has literally forced itself up through that shaft, and the pressure is obviously so great it's caused this devastating flash flood."" As well as properties, vehicles were submerged in water There are about 13 shafts recorded within about 820ft (250m) of the one in Goshen Park, so Mr Backhouse said it is possible more than one may have burst. There are tens of thousands in south Wales and he said it was ""incredibly difficult"" to check them all, but there were ""tell tale signs"" as to why they may collapse such as age or what type of developments are around them. The clean up has continued on Friday morning ""Not to try and fear-monger or anything but of course this sort of thing can happen again,"" he said. ""If another event like Storm Christoph happens, the water levels in the mine rises as quickly as it did, there's absolutely nothing to say that it wouldn't happen again in the future. ""And obviously as climate changes and we have many more events like Storm Christoph, they are going to increase in frequency, they are going to be much more severe. ""The Coal Authority will have to consider the risk in places like Skewen, and they'll have to understand how it will affect residents and proactively manage that and look at how to reduce the risks for residents.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: âThat idea of looking at hotels is certainly one thing we are actively now working on.â British nationals travelling to the UK from high-risk countries will have to quarantine in a hotel, under plans to be discussed by ministers. The BBC understands the proposals, expected to be discussed on Tuesday, could see people bussed to hotels on arrival. Boris Johnson said ministers were ""actively working on"" the idea, amid concern over new coronavirus variants. Most foreign nationals from high-risk countries already face UK travel bans. These include South Africa and Brazil, where newvariants of the viruswere recently discovered, as well as a number of countries near them. Whitehall sources said those quarantining in hotels would have to pay for the costs of their own accommodation. Hotel quarantine is already in place in countries including New Zealand and Australia. Hotel quarantine for UK arrivals to be discussed What are the new UK travel rules? Under current travel curbs, almost all people must test negative for Covid-19 up to 72 hours before travelling to be allowed into the UK. Even after this negative test, arrivals still have to quarantine for up to 10 days, although this can be done at home. In England, this self-isolation periodcan be cut short,externalwith a second negative test after five days. Quarantine rules are set separately inEngland,external,Scotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,external- but have only tended to differ slightly. Have you stayed in a quarantine hotel? Share your experiences. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy On Monday, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed officials around the UK had discussed a ""four nations"" approach to the issue. She added that hotel quarantine was ""under active consideration"" by Scottish ministers, and would be discussed at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. The Northern Ireland Executive is also expected to discuss travel rules when it meets on Tuesday. Speaking on Monday, Mr Johnson said the UK already had ""one of the tightest regimes in the world"" but the government wanted to ""protect this country from reinfection from abroad"" during the rollout of the vaccines. Asked who exactly would be required to self-isolate in hotels, he said: ""We need a solution that gives us the maximum possible protection against reinfection"". ""We have to realise there is at least the theoretical risk of a new variant that is a vaccine-busting variant coming in,"" he told reporters. ""We've got to be able to keep that under control"". The policy is among the measures credited with limiting cases of coronavirus in Australia -  whose population is around 25 million - to just 28,777 positive cases during the entire pandemic. This is a smaller number of new cases than are currently recorded in the UK every day - with adaily average,externalof over 33,000 in the past seven days. Passengers in Australian quarantine hotels have all meals delivered to their room. In Australia, travellers are allocated a hotel room on arrival and taken there by bus. Often, entire flights are accommodated in the same hotel. The New South Wales government pledges to make ""every attempt"" to find suitable accommodation for travellers and families. But availability of rooms means there are severe limits on the number of people who can arrive into the country on any given day. The hotel quarantine lasts a minimum of 14 days up to 24 days, providing a persontests negative twice,external. The cost of the quarantine is borne by the passenger - at around Â£1,700 per adult and Â£2,800 for a family of two adults and two children - and billed after the quarantine in completed. Fees are waived for those who can prove they are unable to pay, and there are certain exemptions. But not following the rules is a criminal offence, and in New South Wales carries fines of around Â£6,000 for individuals, six months in prison, or both with an additional Â£3,100 fine for each day the offence continues. Ministers have been facing pressure to toughen up the UK's borders in recent weeks, with Labour accusing ministers of ""dragging their feet on setting vital protections"". On Monday the party's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds backed the idea of using hotels to help ""prevent the importation of further strains of the virus"". Accusing ministers of a ""lack of strategy,"" he said the UK ""continually acts too slowly and without proper planning in place."" ""This continued failure is leaving the door open to new strains of Covid-19, putting people at risk and undermining the sacrifices everyone is making to address this virus.""

"Ambrose O'Neill was sentenced in his absence in 2008 A violent robber who went on the run for nearly 13 years has finally been caught and jailed. Ambrose O'Neill - dubbed ""The Running Man"" due to his ability to evade capture - skipped his 2008 trial over an attack on an antiques dealer. He was sentenced to eight years in prison in his absence but spent years at large, until police got a tip-off he was in hiding in Lincolnshire. The 42-year-old was arrested on Friday and is now beginning his sentence. Nottinghamshire Police said in 2007, O'Neill, of Ludgate Close in Arnold, knocked on his victim's front door in Seagrave, Leicestershire, posing as a pizza delivery man. When his victim opened the door, O'Neill pushed him over, punched him in the face and demanded he open a safe, threatening to kill him. But he ultimately left empty-handed and was later arrested. O'Neill attended the first day of his trial at Leicester Crown Court but then went on the run. Police said they launched Operation Gladiolus in December 2020 in a bid to track him down. PC James Gill, from Nottinghamshire Police's ""wanted squad"", said: ""We knew he had changed his appearance and lived in an area where people do not know him and he had an assumed identity,"" he said. ""He was laughing at the police, so we were determined to do everything to find him."" A major breakthrough came from an anonymous tip-off suggesting O'Neill may be living with a woman in the Wyberton area, in Lincolnshire. Police narrowed it down to a house in Causeway and arrested the ""surprised"" O'Neill in the early hours of Friday. PC James Gill worked in his free time to bring O'Neill to justice, Nottinghamshire Police said Officers also arrested a 41-year-old woman on suspicion of assisting an offender. She remains in custody. O'Neill is due to appear at Leicester Crown Court on 29 January, where his sentence could be extended, the force added.

"Fashion retailer Boohoo has bought the Debenhams brand and website for Â£55m. However, it will not take on any of the firm's remaining 118 High Street stores or its workforce. Boohoo said it was a ""transformational deal"" and a ""huge step"". But the deal means that up to 12,000 jobs at the department store chain are set to go. The 242-year-old Debenhams chain is already in the process of closing down, after administrators failed to secure a rescue deal for the business. In a separate development,Asos says it is in ""exclusive"" talksto buy the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT brands out of administration. But the online retailer said it only wanted the brands, not their shops, suggesting any deal would cost jobs. The current owner of the brands, Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group, fell into administration last November putting 13,000 jobs at risk. A closing-down sale at 124 Debenhams stores began in December, as the administrators continued to seek offers for all or parts of the business. The company announced recently that six shops would not reopen after lockdown, including its flagship department store on London's Oxford Street. The administrators of Debenhams UK, FRP Advisory, said they had undertaken a ""thorough and robust process"" to achieve ""the best outcome for Debenhams' stakeholders"". ""This transaction will allow a new Debenhams-branded business to emerge under strong new ownership, including an online operation and the opportunity to secure an international franchise network that will operate under licence using the Debenhams name,"" they added. What went wrong at Debenhams? Five things you didn't know about Boohoo Asos frontrunner to buy Topshop and Miss Selfridge Debenhams pictured through the years Boohoo has already bought a number of High Street brands out of administration. It snapped up Oasis, Coast and Karen Millen, but not the associated stores. Its executive chairman, Mahmud Kamani, said: ""This is a transformational deal for the group, which allows us to capture the fantastic opportunity as ecommerce continues to grow. Our ambition is to create the UK's largest marketplace. ""Our acquisition of the Debenhams brand is strategically significant as it represents a huge step which accelerates our ambition to be a leader, not just in fashion ecommerce, but in new categories including beauty, sport and homeware."" Boohoo said Debenhams was expected to relaunch on Boohoo's web platform later this year. In the meantime, Debenhams will continue to operate its website for an agreed period. Boohoo's fast-fashion model has come under scrutiny Boohoo has recently come under fire over workers' pay and conditions and its ultra-low pricing. As well as facing questions about the environmental impact of its fast-fashion business model, there have been accusations of  widespread abuse of employment law at some of Boohoo's suppliers in Leicester. Investigations last year suggested workers were being paid below the minimum wage. After an independent review of the claims found a series of failings, Mr Kamani said last month that the firm was working to fix the problems, adding:""We will make a better Boohoo."" While online retailers have been whittling away at their High Street rivals for years, few could have predicted how quickly bricks-and-mortar stalwarts have collapsed. The pandemic has fatally undermined their already parlous finances. Businesses that appeared to have a chance of survival just a year ago have been wiped out and their brands bought by online players. The scale of the change is profound: when Debenhams listed on the stock exchange in 2011, investors valued it at Â£1.6bn. Boohoo, which was founded only in 2006, already has a stock market value of Â£4.4bn. Asos, a bit player two decades ago when Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group was riding high and toying with a bid for Marks & Spencer, is now valued by the stock market at Â£5bn. Neither Boohoo or Asos see any value in the Debenhams or Topshop High Street estates. Instead, they will concentrate on development of the brands and the associated customer data. This is bad news for the 19,000-odd people who work in the branches of Debenhams and Topshop, and will leave councils around the country wondering how they will fill town centres that were based on retail. But just as canny entrepreneurs and private equity companies are gearing up to buy struggling pub chains, in the hope of a recovery once lockdown restrictions are eased, so will some investors be wondering what next for the High Street. The British love affair with shopping will not end overnight and a well-placed punt now could have big rewards. Debenhams has struggled for years with falling profits and rising debts, as more shopping has moved online. It called in administrators twice in two years, most recently in April. However, its position became untenable during the coronavirus pandemic as non-essential retailers were forced to close for prolonged periods. The firm had already trimmed its store portfolio and cut about 6,500 jobs since May, as it struggled to stay afloat. Businessman Mike Ashley, who founded Sports Direct and also owns House of Fraser, had already made an offer for Debenhams after it was initially put up for sale in April. However, the takeover offer, thought to be in the region of Â£125m, was rejected as being too low. Meanwhile, one of House of Fraser's flagship outlets, the Jenners department store in Edinburgh, is to leave its Princes Street home after 183 years. It will close on 3 May with the loss of 200 jobs. The building's owner, Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, announced in November 2019 thathe intended to convert the site, replacing Jenners with a hotel, cafes, a rooftop restaurant and luxury shops. However, a spokesperson for Frasers Group said it had been ""unable to reach an agreement"" with Mr Povlsen and that the closure of Jenners would leave ""a vacant site for the foreseeable future with no immediate plans"".

"Bethany and her two children have been on a waiting list for more than a year There is a ""shocking"" lack of places for traveller families to live in England, according to a charity. Only 18 out of 251 registered traveller sites have any spaces available, research from Friends, Families and Travellers (FFT) suggests. It says the government must ""do more"" to identify land for the community to live on. The government says councils are ""best placed"" to assess the local need for permanent traveller sites. In October, FFT wrote to all local authorities and private registered site providers in England to ask how many pitches they had available. It received responses relating to 251 out of 266 traveller sites - which represented 3,482 permanent pitches and 304 transit pitches. A transit pitch is a short-term place where people can stay for a set period of usually up to three months. The research,externalfound: There were 13 permanent sites and five transit sites with available pitches There were 59 permanent pitches and 42 transit pitches available At least 1,696 households are on waiting lists for pitches on traveller sites Bethany says she's near the bottom of the waiting list for a pitch in her local area Bethany Rose, 26, and her two children have been on a waiting list for a pitch in West Sussex for more than a year. She is currently staying with her parents in their caravan on a registered traveller site. But this is against the rules of their tenancy contract and she will have to move out once the coronavirus pandemic is over. Bethany has a health condition which means she can often be paralysed from the waist down and she needs to be close to her mum who is her carer. ""It's frustrating, annoying, aggravating, I feel let down,"" she says. ""I'm disabled. I'm homeless and I have two kids. ""For anyone normally it would just be like, 'Boof, there you go, there's a property, go and live there'. But I can't do that. I can't even get a house, I can't buy a plot of land, I can't do anything."" Bethany and her children are currently living with her parents on a traveller site in West Sussex It's estimatedabout 1.1 million households,externalare on local authority housing waiting lists, but Bethany believes it would be easier for her to get a home if she wasn't a traveller. She says being a traveller is a huge part of her identity and she wants to live on a site so she can continue to be connected to her heritage. ""A whole community is there if you need something or something happens,"" she said. ""If you fall or you go to hospital, you can guarantee your neighbour will watch the kids until you come back. If you need a cup of sugar, you can just go round."" The research from FFT comes as MPs were due todebate a petition on Monday,externalagainst government proposals to criminalise trespassing. However, this has been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The new measures could see travellers facing a fine or prison if they set up unauthorised encampments - currently it's a civil offence. In aconsultation paper published in 2019,external, the Home Office said there had been ""long-standing concerns"" about the distress they caused to local communities. This video can not be played Sarah Tanner posted a video saying she was ""disgusted"" by mess left by travellers in Dorset In June 2020, residents in Dorset complained aboutmess left by travellers on a local park- which included a car being abandoned in the middle of a cricket pitch, rubbish dumped in green spaces and human waste deposited in the pond and lake. FFT says councils are failing to provide enough sites for travellers to live on. In January 2019, plans to spend Â£5m on new traveller pitches in Milton Keyneswere put on holdafter a ""heated"" meeting with local residents. Bethany believes councils are not doing more to provide extra sites because of discrimination towards travellers. ""They're building 50,000 new houses in West Sussex, not one of those places is having a site,"" she said. ""So you've got the Nimby (Not In My Back Yard) culture attached to that. ""For every 50 houses, they could put a site of five which is a whole little community that they can get used to and go, 'Yeah, OK, they're not as bad as people say.' ""That also means we're not pulling up the side of the roads. We're not being moved off. We're just trying to live like everyone else."" Milton Keynes Council changed its plan to build a new traveller site after listening to residents West Sussex County Council says when a vacancy comes up on a permanent site all those who have expressed an interest in that location are considered for the pitch. The FFT wants the government to reintroduce pitch targets and a statutory duty on local authorities to meet the assessed need for Gypsy and traveller sites. It also calls on the government to abandon its proposal to criminalise trespassing. Sarah Sweeney, policy and communications manager at FFT, said: ""It is deeply unfair that while the government is dramatically failing to identify enough land for Gypsy and traveller families to live on, the home secretary is working to create laws to imprison, fine and remove the homes of families living on roadside camps for the 'crime' of having nowhere else to go."" The Local Government Association says it wants the government to publish ""better data"" on the scale of unauthorised encampments and the availability of authorised sites to help councils in England meet their planning obligations. A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""Unauthorised encampments cause distress and disruption for many people across the country so it's right we are giving the police the powers they need to address this issue. ""Councils are best placed to assess the local need for permanent traveller sites and decide where they should be, and can apply for funding through our Shared Ownership and Affordable Homes Programme to help build them.""

"The public's trust in the way the UK is run is breaking down, former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown has warned. He said Covid-19 had exposed ""tensions"" between Whitehall and the nations and regions, who were often treated by the centre as if they were ""invisible"". Mr Brown is urging Boris Johnson to set up a commission to review how the country is governed and powers shared. But the PM said his focus was on the pandemic, stressing the benefits of the union could be ""seen everywhere"". Recent opinion polls have suggestedrising support for Scottish independenceandpotentially for a border vote in Northern Ireland. Mr Brown's intervention comes amid a looming clash between Mr Johnson and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who has demanded the UK agree to another Scottish independence referendum if the SNP wins a majority in May's Holyrood elections. SNP reveal 'roadmap' to another independence vote What's going on with Scottish independence? Border poll would be 'absolutely reckless' The Court of Session is hearing arguments about whether Holyrood can legislate to hold oneeven if the UK government continues to object. Writing inthe Daily Telegraph,external, Mr Brown -who advocates a federal system with more power for nations and regions- says the pandemic has ""brought to the surface tensions and grievances that have been simmering for years"" between Downing Street and the various parts of the UK. This video can not be played The Conservatives election win was not 'a signal that the country is at ease' warns Brown He points to ""bitter disputes"" over issues such as lockdown restrictions and furlough and said unless underlying tensions were resolved, the UK risked becoming a ""failed state"". In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today, he said at a time ""when all should be pulling together and intensifying co-operation across the UK"" there was division and claims by the leaders of Scotland and Wales and the English regions that they were not being properly consulted. Last year there wererows between the government and local authorities over coronavirus tiers, with the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, objecting to plans to put the region into the strictest level of restrictions. Mr Brown told Today that while he was ""confident"" that Scotland would still be part of the UK in ten years time, the way the UK was governed had to change. ""I think the public are fed up. I think in many ways, they feel they are being treated as second class citizens, particularly in the outlying areas, that they are invisible and forgotten."" ""Something has broken down in trust and has to be repaired."" Mr Brown is advising the Labour Party on its devolution strategy - but has also held talks with government ministers including Michael Gove in recent weeks. Government sources say they are focused on taking tangible steps to demonstrate the value of the UK. The idea of a fundamental review of the UK's power structures has been suggested as one possible way to counter support for Scottish independence ahead of May's Holyrood election. But a series of polls now suggest support for independence is higher than support for the union - and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will demand another referendum if, as seems likely, her party - the SNP - wins in May. He is calling on Boris Johnson to immediately set up a commission on democracy to review how the UK is governed, something the Conservatives promised in theirmanifesto before the last general election. In his Telegraph article, he suggests it would find that the UK needs a Forum of the Nations and Regions, citizens' assemblies, and a greater focus on the benefits of cooperation in areas such as the NHS and the armed forces. The current Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmeralso supports devolving more powers from Westminster but opposes another Scottish independence referendum. The SNP said last week thatthere would be a ""legal referendum"" after the pandemicif May's Holyrood election returned a pro-independence majority. Asked if he would stand in the way of this, Mr Johnson said what the British public wanted was for its political leaders to focus on beating coronavirus, adding that the advantages of the UK's four nations working together ""spoke for themselves"". ""I think people can see everywhere in the UK the visible benefits of our wonderful union,"" he said. ""A vaccine programme that is being rolled out by a National Health Service, a vaccine that was developed in labs in Oxford and is being administered by the British Army."" But the SNP said the Scottish people, not Westminster-based politicians, should decide the country's future. ""No amount of constitutional tinkering from Labour would protect Scotland from Brexit or the Tory power grab - only independence can do that,"" said Kirsten Oswald, the party's deputy Westminster leader. ""The Scottish people will see right through this attempt to deny their democratic right."" Apoll commissioned by the Sunday Times,externalin Northern Ireland found 51% of people wanted a referendum on Irish unity in the next five years. DUP leader and Northern Irish First Minister Arlene Foster said such a vote would be""absolutely reckless"". Numbers supporting Wales breaking away from the UK also appear to be rising.

"Concerns emerged in late 2018 that women and babies may have come to harm because of staff shortages and failures to report serious incidents Two-thirds of women at the heart of a review into maternity services at a Welsh health board could have had very different outcomes if they had received better care, a report has found. The Independent Maternity Services Oversight Panel (Imsop) focused on the experiences of pregnant women at Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board. Its maternity services have been in special measures since ""serious failings"" were found two years ago. The health board noted the findings. Q&A: Cwm Taf maternity problems Mothers ignored and made to feel worthless Cwm Taf maternity services in special measures after review Concerns emerged in late 2018 that women and babies may have come to harm because of staff shortages and failures to report serious incidents. This sparked a major independent review, which gave a damning verdict on maternity services in the health board area that covers about 450,000 people living in Rhondda Cynon Taf, Bridgend and Merthyr Tydfil. Published on Monday, the Imsop report focuses on the care of 27 women, most of whom were admitted to an intensive care unit during 28 ""episodes of care"" between January 2016 and September 2018. It found that 19 reviews of maternal care (68%) revealed at least one factor where ""different management would reasonably have been expected to alter the outcome"". This video can not be played Kayden was born with severe brain damage following mistakes in his mother's maternity care The panel's chairman, Mick Giannasi, said: ""These findings will be concerning and potentially distressing for the women and families involved, and it will be difficult for staff. ""Of the 28 episodes of care, we concluded that in 27 of them, our independent teams who reviewed the care would have done something differently. Put simply, what went wrong, might not have gone wrong if things had been done differently."" Two further reviews of stillbirths and neonatal mortality and morbidity will follow later this year. In total, all three independent reviews will looks at 160 cases. Damning report into failings not flagged up Mothers to be told of service failings Cwm Taf maternity: Calls for police investigation Imsop's findings reinforcethose of the Royal College of Midwives and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The royal colleges' 2019 investigation found mothers faced ""distressing experiences and poor care"" at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant and Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, with maternity services deemed ""dysfunctional"". Four key areas have been identified by Imsop as factors which contributed to poor care. These are: A ""failure to listen to women"" A ""failure to identify and escalate risk"" ""Inadequate leadership"" And ""inappropriate treatment leading to adverse outcomes"" Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the latest report recognises things are moving in the right direction for the health board, but more needs to be done. ""The report highlights that women weren't always at the centre of their care and that women weren't always listened to, and that led to harm that could have been avoided,"" Mr Gething told reporters at the latest Welsh Government press briefing. ""Nothing will be able to change what these women and their families experienced at these two hospitals or the outcome for those families whose babies died or came to harm. ""I am deeply sorry for everything that happened."" Vaughan Gething says he is ""deeply sorry"" women and their families were not listened to He said he hoped ""families can take some comfort"" from the reviews that have provided answers to questions they were asking. ""My thoughts are with everyone affected by this report today and those who are still awaiting the outcome of their reviews,"" Mr Gething added. Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board said it has been ""working with the panel and families"" to put in place a ""comprehensive maternity and neonatal improvement programme"". ""It has been a period of reflection during which we have examined the regrettable failings in maternity services of the former Cwm Taf University Health Board and we acknowledge the fact that we still have some way to go,"" said Greg Dix, the health board's executive director of nursing and midwifery. ""We will never forget the tragedies suffered by women, their families and our staff, and the learning from these cases is a key corner stone on which we are building our improvement plans.""

"The review took a wider look at the health board, where the maternity unit is in special measures A health board criticised for severe maternity failings put too much emphasis on targets instead of patient safety, according to a new review. It found wider failings in Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board's governance. Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) and the Wales Audit Office (WAO) also found a high level of risk to patient safety was accepted as the norm in some departments. The health board said work was under way to address the issues raised. The report was not an assessment of front-line care, but spoke to staff about procedures for reporting and learning from problems. It found Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board had not given enough attention to the safety of its services, in contrast to a strong focus on targets and financial controls. Adrian Crompton, the auditor general for Wales, said while finance and performance targets were ""vitally important"", the review raised questions about how the performance of the health service was assessed. ""This piece of work suggests one part of the health service perhaps over-prioritised these issues and has taken its eye off the ball in respect of issues related to patient care,"" he said. The regulators found emergency departments at the Royal Glamorgan and Prince Charles hospitals were often working at high levels of risk Health boss resigns after maternity failings Mothers ignored and made to feel worthless Q&A: Cwm Taf maternity problems The regulator HIW found examples where working at high levels of risk had become ""normalised"". On visits to the emergency departments at the Prince Charles and Royal Glamorgan hospitals, the review found ""areas of concern which we felt could pose an immediate risk to the safety of patients"", including issues around nurse and doctor staffing levels and the safety and dignity of managing patients in corridors. ""Staff said they had repeatedly raised concerns and now felt they could do no more to escalate their concerns,"" the report said. The review found there was a muddled system and a lack of leadership as to who was in charge of safety at various levels and no formal process for learning from problems. For example, staff may not have been aware that other parts of the organisation had been inspected and needed improvement. Kate Chamberlain said the flow of information from the front line to senior management was vital to good care The review found gaps in how information and incidents were reported to the board. Kate Chamberlain, chief executive of HIW, said what concerned them most was ""the lack of clarity about how front-line staff... can escalate their concerns and make them known"". ""It is absolutely fundamental to patient safety that there should be a good flow of information,"" she said. The report said there still appeared to be a culture of fear and blame in some parts of the organisation relating to the reporting of incidents. A quarter of the staff who answered the review's survey felt the organisation blamed or punished people who were involved in errors, near misses or incidents, and nearly half of the respondents felt managers would not act on feedback from staff. Earlier in the year two damning reports into maternity services and the experiences of mothers were published The report also raised concerns the health board had not addressed weaknesses identified in a previous HIW report in 2012. Mr Crompton said the two organisations were already planning the joint review before the recent maternity failings emerged. But the review found some cause for optimism given the new set of managers. In December the two organisations will meet the Welsh Government to give their recommendation on whether the whole health board needs to be put into special measures. At present it is one step down from special measures and the maternity unit is already at the highest level of oversight. Sharon Hopkins, interim chief executive of the health board, welcomed the review and accepted all 14 of the recommendations made, Ms Hopkins told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast she was ""confident care in maternity services is improving"". ""You can never say 100% of the time somebody's experience will be absolutely as we would like it.,"" she said. ""But I think we can be confident with what we are doing now, and how hard people are working, that care in maternity services is of a good quality, and improving all the time."" She said improvements included making the structure of the organisation better, increasing ""engagement with staff and partners"" and strengthening governance arrangements. In Octoberan independent review panelsaid there was a ""very long way to go"" before maternity services at a health board could be declared safe.

"Some Barclaycard customers will see their minimum repayments rise from Tuesday, at a time when finances are already stretched owing to Covid and Christmas. The new requirements are tailored to each customer, although some may see a significant rise in demands. But the changes will also see charges for exceeding a credit limit scrapped. January is a pinch point for many in debt and borrowers are being urged to seek help if they are in trouble. Barclaycard signalled the changes to their pricing structures in November, although some borrowers may have missed the notice, which was titled ""changes to your terms and conditions"". Thenew repayment rates,externalwill affect those with Platinum, Initial, Freedom, Forward, Cashback, Littlewoods, Rewards and Hilton Honors cards, but not Premier or Woolwich cards. For cardholders who started using their cards in the last decade, the minimum repayment each month has been calculated as the highest of 2.25% of the full balance, 1% of the balance plus interest, or Â£5. This differed slightly for longer-standing customers. The new charges mean minimum repayments will be the highest of between 2% and 5% of the full balance, between 1% and 3% of the balance plus interest, or Â£5. Covid means UK 'sleep-walking into a debt crisis' Missed Klarna payments may soon hit credit scores This means some people could see the minimum repayment rise, although some other charges - such as the late payment fee - will be limited. The exact percentage depends on the customer and would have been outlined in the November message. A Barclaycard spokesman said: ""We are increasing minimum payments for some customers to help them pay off debt quicker and reduce the overall interest they pay. ""This is part of our ambition to ensure that no Barclaycard customer gets into persistent debt - where they pay more in interest and charges than reducing their debt and take a long time to pay this debt off - and is being put in place to support our customers."" Sara Williams, who writes theDebt Camel blog,external, said that the higher minimum payment may well come as a ""nasty shock"". ""January is always the tightest month for money for most people. December pay is often early, so the money has to stretchÂ further, and if you put any Christmas presents or expenses on your Barclaycard, this month's bill will be high anyway,"" she said.Â ""For people who were hardly managingÂ before, the increase to the minimum payments may tip the bill over into being unaffordable."" Debt charities had already warned that the coronavirus pandemic meant theÂ UK was ""sleepwalking into a debt crisis"". The government-backed Money and Pensions Service -which offers free guidance,external- said it was expecting a call about debt at least every four minutes throughout January. Barclaycard said the timing of the changes - which coincide with lockdown and many people on a reduced furlough income - was unintentional and had been signalled some time ago. Any borrowers who feel the new repayment levels are unaffordable are being asked to contact the company. More broadly, anyone struggling to make debt repayments of any kind is being urged to face their difficulties and seek help. ""Financial worries negatively affect our 'cognition', which are the thinking processes that support and maintain our mental health. When in a poor state, financial worries cause stress and our cognition fails,"" said Keiron Sparrowhawk, a cognition expert from the Being Well Group, which runs the MyCognition app. This could lead to depression and hasty, ill-thought-out decisions, he said. ""Together, depression and anxiety are distressing and disabling, causing us to spiral out of control and enter a pit of hell,"" he said. Open up to someone and talk about the problems Work out your debts by writing down everything you owe Pay debts in the right order, starting with priority bills and debts such as mortgage, rent and energy payments ahead of overdrafts, personal loans, credit cards and Buy Now Pay Later arrangements Avoid high-cost credit.

"The public's trust in the way the UK is run is breaking down, former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown has warned. He said Covid-19 had exposed ""tensions"" between Whitehall and the nations and regions, who were often treated by the centre as if they were ""invisible"". Mr Brown is urging Boris Johnson to set up a commission to review how the country is governed and powers shared. But the PM said his focus was on the pandemic, stressing the benefits of the union could be ""seen everywhere"". Recent opinion polls have suggestedrising support for Scottish independenceandpotentially for a border vote in Northern Ireland. Mr Brown's intervention comes amid a looming clash between Mr Johnson and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who has demanded the UK agree to another Scottish independence referendum if the SNP wins a majority in May's Holyrood elections. SNP reveal 'roadmap' to another independence vote What's going on with Scottish independence? Border poll would be 'absolutely reckless' The Court of Session is hearing arguments about whether Holyrood can legislate to hold oneeven if the UK government continues to object. Writing inthe Daily Telegraph,external, Mr Brown -who advocates a federal system with more power for nations and regions- says the pandemic has ""brought to the surface tensions and grievances that have been simmering for years"" between Downing Street and the various parts of the UK. This video can not be played The Conservatives election win was not 'a signal that the country is at ease' warns Brown He points to ""bitter disputes"" over issues such as lockdown restrictions and furlough and said unless underlying tensions were resolved, the UK risked becoming a ""failed state"". In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today, he said at a time ""when all should be pulling together and intensifying co-operation across the UK"" there was division and claims by the leaders of Scotland and Wales and the English regions that they were not being properly consulted. Last year there wererows between the government and local authorities over coronavirus tiers, with the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, objecting to plans to put the region into the strictest level of restrictions. Mr Brown told Today that while he was ""confident"" that Scotland would still be part of the UK in ten years time, the way the UK was governed had to change. ""I think the public are fed up. I think in many ways, they feel they are being treated as second class citizens, particularly in the outlying areas, that they are invisible and forgotten."" ""Something has broken down in trust and has to be repaired."" Mr Brown is advising the Labour Party on its devolution strategy - but has also held talks with government ministers including Michael Gove in recent weeks. Government sources say they are focused on taking tangible steps to demonstrate the value of the UK. The idea of a fundamental review of the UK's power structures has been suggested as one possible way to counter support for Scottish independence ahead of May's Holyrood election. But a series of polls now suggest support for independence is higher than support for the union - and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will demand another referendum if, as seems likely, her party - the SNP - wins in May. He is calling on Boris Johnson to immediately set up a commission on democracy to review how the UK is governed, something the Conservatives promised in theirmanifesto before the last general election. In his Telegraph article, he suggests it would find that the UK needs a Forum of the Nations and Regions, citizens' assemblies, and a greater focus on the benefits of cooperation in areas such as the NHS and the armed forces. The current Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmeralso supports devolving more powers from Westminster but opposes another Scottish independence referendum. The SNP said last week thatthere would be a ""legal referendum"" after the pandemicif May's Holyrood election returned a pro-independence majority. Asked if he would stand in the way of this, Mr Johnson said what the British public wanted was for its political leaders to focus on beating coronavirus, adding that the advantages of the UK's four nations working together ""spoke for themselves"". ""I think people can see everywhere in the UK the visible benefits of our wonderful union,"" he said. ""A vaccine programme that is being rolled out by a National Health Service, a vaccine that was developed in labs in Oxford and is being administered by the British Army."" But the SNP said the Scottish people, not Westminster-based politicians, should decide the country's future. ""No amount of constitutional tinkering from Labour would protect Scotland from Brexit or the Tory power grab - only independence can do that,"" said Kirsten Oswald, the party's deputy Westminster leader. ""The Scottish people will see right through this attempt to deny their democratic right."" Apoll commissioned by the Sunday Times,externalin Northern Ireland found 51% of people wanted a referendum on Irish unity in the next five years. DUP leader and Northern Irish First Minister Arlene Foster said such a vote would be""absolutely reckless"". Numbers supporting Wales breaking away from the UK also appear to be rising. The pro-independence campaign group Yes Cymru has saidmembership swelled from 2,000 at the start of 2020 to more than 17,000. Plaid Cymru has also promised to holdan independence referendum if it wins the next Senedd election. Responding to Mr Brown's intervention, the party's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said: ""It's been clear for many years that the UK doesn't work for Wales - I'm glad that the Labour Party are starting to see that.""

"This video can not be played Police used water cannon and tear gas to clear demonstrators Riot police in the Netherlands have clashed with protesters angry at new coronavirus restrictions. Officers used water cannon and tear gas to clear demonstrators in Eindhoven. They had gathered in defiance of a new 21:00 (20:00 GMT) curfew. Some protesters threw fireworks, looted supermarkets and smashed shop windows. There were smaller demonstrations in the capital, Amsterdam. More than 100 people have been arrested. Some of the demonstrators threw fireworks and grabbed bicycles to build barricades against the police, who eventually used tear gas to clear the streets. Protests also took place in Amsterdam A Covid-19 testing centre was also set alight on Saturday evening in the northern village of Urk, local authorities said. ""The fire in a screening centre in Urk goes beyond all limits,"" Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said. The 21:00 to 04:30 curfew, enforced on Saturday, is the first in the Netherlands since World War II. Violators face a â¬95 (Â£84) fine. Burning bikes were built into barricades, supermarkets looted. In Eindhoven, golf balls and fireworks were hurled at police in full riot gear, who eventually used tear gas to clear the crowds. The scenes of violent unrest spread across the country: Amsterdam, Tilburg and Enschede, where young men threw stones at a hospital and torched a Covid testing centre. National Security Council Chairman Hubert Bruls said that, while he understood the protesters' frustrations, the more the Dutch persevere now, the sooner they can get their freedoms back. He labelled those involved in the violence not demonstrators, but ""corona hooligans"". Actually many see vaccines as the key, and the Netherlands is lagging behind there - last in the EU to roll out its vaccine programme, to date 77,000 people have been given their first dose. At the start of the outbreak, the Dutch government resisted measures like masks and curfews, telling Dutch citizens they were sensible, rule-abiding and didn't need to be treated like children. That sense of exceptionalism has come back to haunt them. Almost a year on, some people are struggling to do the mental pivot required to accept that the Netherlands has been forced to introduce draconian measures it initially dismissed. The curfew was passed in parliament on Thursday, albeit with a slightly later start time than the proposed 20:30. Dozens were arrested in the protests The country's bars and restaurants have been shut since October, while schools and non-essential shops closed last month. A ban on flights from the UK, South Africa and South America has been put in place due to fears over new variants of the virus. There have been more than 944,000 cases and 13,646 confirmed deaths from Covid-19 in the Netherlands.

"Ella Lambert had never sewn before but borrowed a friend's machine to learn how to make sanitary pads made from cloth A student whose ""terrible period pains"" inspired her to start a reusable sanitary pad project has helped 600 refugees get out of ""period poverty"". Ella Lambert, 20, from Chelmsford, Essex, startedThe Pachamama Project,externalduring the first coronavirus lockdown. She said she wanted to help women who were unable to buy period products. Nearly 2,500 pads sewn by 150 volunteers have been sent to camps in Greece and Lebanon. Women are given four pads each, which are washable and can be reused for about five years, she said. The pads are distributed to women in refugee camps Ms Lambert said: ""In March I had terrible period pain, I was being sick, it was awful, and it made me think, I know I'm not the only person going through this. ""The people I want to help, in these camps, they're experiencing period pain and having to use random tissue paper, cardboard, socks, scraps of material and even leaves - whatever they can get hold of."" The University of Bristol languages student set up her not-for-profit group in March and launched her sanitary product - Pacha Pads - in August, with the help of charities and groups in the two countries to distribute them. Thousands of pads have been made by hundreds of volunteers since August It started when she put appeals for material on community groups, she said. Volunteers from all over the UK came forward to make the products after she developed a pattern, created a guide and explained how to source material for free. The products are then sent back to her to be posted abroad, after quality checks. Some of the sewers came from groups formed tomake scrubs for NHS workersduring the first lockdown, and who still wanted to be useful, she said. Alice Corrigan, from The Free Shop of Lebanon, said the project helped with the ""fight against period poverty in Lebanon"" Alice Corrigan, founder of The Free Shop Lebanon, which hands out the products for free in its shop, said: ""Sustainable menstrual products are very new to many Lebanese and in particular Syrian women."" She added it is not common for them to talk about menstrual activity, so it was important they could be helped to understand its importance and accept it as part of their routine. Katy Chadwick, technical adviser at the charityActionAid UK,external, said: ""For too many women and girls and people who menstruate a lack of access to products impacts on their ability to move freely and to access education and other opportunities. ""It's encouraging to see new initiatives to support the most marginalised women and girls access sustainable products.""

"Of 2,000 Welsh members of the Royal College of Nursing who took part in a survey, 75.9% reported increased stress over the past year A long-term plan is needed to help nurses cope with post-traumatic stress resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, union officials have said. Last year the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) ran a survey looking at its impact on front-line staff and how it had changed nurses' lives. Of 2,000 Welsh members who took part, 75.9% reported increased stress and 52% were worried about their mental health. The Welsh Government said it recognised the pressures on NHS workers. Carol Doggett, senior matron at Swansea's Morriston Hospital, said nurses were often becoming patients' ""next of kin"" during the pandemic, due to the ""absence of family, particularly at end of life"". ""Which we would do anyway, naturally, but in the absence of family it's far more profound than supporting them in a holistic way if they were present with us,"" she said. Senior matron Carol Doggett says the extreme pressure experienced in intensive care had been felt throughout the hospital Ms Doggett said the extreme pressure experienced in intensive care had been felt throughout the hospital. ""Patients are coming in through [the emergency department]. They are sicker. The number of sicker patients has definitely increased,"" she said. ""That results in them having an extended period in hospital. They can stay beyond Covid. They continue to suffer with those conditions that present themselves as a result of Covid."" On Sunday, Ms Doggett's colleague, Morriston intensive care consultant John Gorst,said as many as five patients are dying with Covid during a single 12-hour shift. Nicky Hughes, associate director of nursing at RCN Wales, said: ""The Welsh Government needs to set a long-term plan in place to deal with post-traumatic stress and other mental health issues amongst nurses as a result of the pandemic. ""Nurses are exhausted, stressed and nearing burnout. Every day they tell us that they feel that they have nothing left to give and feel devalued."" PTSD: Eyes can reveal previous trauma, study reveals Coronavirus: Children 'developing post-traumatic stress' from pandemic Coronavirus: Survivors 'at risk of PTSD' Almost a year on from the start of the pandemic nurses have had to find ""ever more physical and emotional strength"" to cope with Covid-19, said Ms Hughes. The RCN told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programme nurses needed ""adequate psychological support"". Mental health charity Mind Cymru agreed with the RCN that a ""coherent long-term strategy"" was needed to help front-line workers deal with the pandemic's effect on their mental health. ""We urge Welsh Government to factor this in to their plans and take the necessary steps to give people the support they need,"" said Simon Jones, Mind Cymru's head of policy. ""Nursing staff and other healthcare professionals have played, and continue to play, a vital role in combatting the pandemic, often putting their own health and wellbeing at risk. ""Even before the outbreak, we heard from many healthcare professionals struggling with the mental health impact of things like long working hours without breaks, unsociable shift patterns, and dealing with traumatic events."" The RCN told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programme nurses needed ""adequate psychological support"" A mental health support hotline for front-line NHS staff in Wales - Health for Health Professionals (HHP) Wales - has been set up by Cardiff University and has received Welsh Government funding. The hotline's director Prof Jonathan Bisson said he was ""encouraged"" by the Welsh Government's investment in HHP Wales along with Traumatic Stress Wales, which helps people who have experienced traumatic events. ""These two initiatives are taking a long term strategic approach to support health workers exposed to traumatic events,"" Prof Bisson said. ""HHP Wales offers access to mental health support for any member of NHS staff in Wales and has linked with Traumatic Stress Wales to provide evidence-based treatment to health workers who are experiencing post traumatic stress disorder as a result of traumatic experiences related to the pandemic and other causes."" Plaid Cymru said the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on health and care workers ""mustn't be underestimated"". ""The Welsh Government must demonstrate that they're taking this seriously with a robust workforce strategy that takes into account the mental health needs of workers, including sufficient down time after the pandemic, and addresses the need to retain and recruit more staff,"" said Plaid's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth. The Welsh Government called the ""commitment and tireless hard work"" of nurses across Wales ""truly remarkable"". A spokesman said: ""We recognise the pressures the NHS workforce is experiencing and have worked closely with NHS employers and trade unions to create a comprehensive wellbeing package to help support them, which includes a dedicated and confidential Samaritans listening support helpline. ""We have also expanded our Health for Health Professionals Wales service which offers psychological and mental health support, as well as a number of free-to-access health and wellbeing support apps."" RCN Wales said it was glad the Welsh Government was backing projects supporting health workers. It said it encouraged the continued development of a ""long-term strategy to deal with the lasting impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our nursing workforce.""

"Fashion retailer Boohoo has bought the Debenhams brand and website for Â£55m. However, it will not take on any of the firm's remaining 118 High Street stores or its workforce. Boohoo said it was a ""transformational deal"" and a ""huge step"". But the deal means that up to 12,000 jobs at the department store chain are set to go. The 242-year-old Debenhams chain is already in the process of closing down, after administrators failed to secure a rescue deal for the business. In a separate development,Asos says it is in ""exclusive"" talksto buy the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT brands out of administration. But the online retailer said it only wanted the brands, not their shops, suggesting any deal would cost jobs. The current owner of the brands, Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group, fell into administration last November putting 13,000 jobs at risk. A closing-down sale at 124 Debenhams stores began in December, as the administrators continued to seek offers for all or parts of the business. The company announced recently that six shops would not reopen after lockdown, including its flagship department store on London's Oxford Street. The administrators of Debenhams UK, FRP Advisory, said they had undertaken a ""thorough and robust process"" to achieve ""the best outcome for Debenhams' stakeholders"". ""This transaction will allow a new Debenhams-branded business to emerge under strong new ownership, including an online operation and the opportunity to secure an international franchise network that will operate under licence using the Debenhams name,"" they added. What went wrong at Debenhams? Five things you didn't know about Boohoo Asos frontrunner to buy Topshop and Miss Selfridge Debenhams pictured through the years Boohoo has already bought a number of High Street brands out of administration. It snapped up Oasis, Coast and Karen Millen, but not the associated stores. Its executive chairman, Mahmud Kamani, said: ""This is a transformational deal for the group, which allows us to capture the fantastic opportunity as ecommerce continues to grow. Our ambition is to create the UK's largest marketplace. ""Our acquisition of the Debenhams brand is strategically significant as it represents a huge step which accelerates our ambition to be a leader, not just in fashion ecommerce, but in new categories including beauty, sport and homeware."" Boohoo said Debenhams was expected to relaunch on Boohoo's web platform later this year. In the meantime, Debenhams will continue to operate its website for an agreed period. Boohoo's fast-fashion model has come under scrutiny Boohoo has recently come under fire over workers' pay and conditions and its ultra-low pricing. As well as facing questions about the environmental impact of its fast-fashion business model, there have been accusations of  widespread abuse of employment law at some of Boohoo's suppliers in Leicester. Investigations last year suggested workers were being paid below the minimum wage. After an independent review of the claims found a series of failings, Mr Kamani said last month that the firm was working to fix the problems, adding:""We will make a better Boohoo."" While online retailers have been whittling away at their High Street rivals for years, few could have predicted how quickly bricks-and-mortar stalwarts have collapsed. The pandemic has fatally undermined their already parlous finances. Businesses that appeared to have a chance of survival just a year ago have been wiped out and their brands bought by online players. The scale of the change is profound: when Debenhams listed on the stock exchange in 2011, investors valued it at Â£1.6bn. Boohoo, which was founded only in 2006, already has a stock market value of Â£4.4bn. Asos, a bit player two decades ago when Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group was riding high and toying with a bid for Marks & Spencer, is now valued by the stock market at Â£5bn. Neither Boohoo or Asos see any value in the Debenhams or Topshop High Street estates. Instead, they will concentrate on development of the brands and the associated customer data. This is bad news for the 19,000-odd people who work in the branches of Debenhams and Topshop, and will leave councils around the country wondering how they will fill town centres that were based on retail. But just as canny entrepreneurs and private equity companies are gearing up to buy struggling pub chains, in the hope of a recovery once lockdown restrictions are eased, so will some investors be wondering what next for the High Street. The British love affair with shopping will not end overnight and a well-placed punt now could have big rewards. Debenhams has struggled for years with falling profits and rising debts, as more shopping has moved online. It called in administrators twice in two years, most recently in April. However, its position became untenable during the coronavirus pandemic as non-essential retailers were forced to close for prolonged periods. The firm had already trimmed its store portfolio and cut about 6,500 jobs since May, as it struggled to stay afloat. Businessman Mike Ashley, who founded Sports Direct and also owns House of Fraser, had already made an offer for Debenhams after it was initially put up for sale in April. However, the takeover offer, thought to be in the region of Â£125m, was rejected as being too low. Meanwhile, one of House of Fraser's flagship outlets, the Jenners department store in Edinburgh, is to leave its Princes Street home after 183 years. It will close on 3 May with the loss of 200 jobs. The building's owner, Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, announced in November 2019 thathe intended to convert the site, replacing Jenners with a hotel, cafes, a rooftop restaurant and luxury shops. However, a spokesperson for Frasers Group said it had been ""unable to reach an agreement"" with Mr Povlsen and that the closure of Jenners would leave ""a vacant site for the foreseeable future with no immediate plans"".

"Jeff Bezos could have given every Amazon employee a $105,000 bonus with the money earned since March, claims Oxfam The combined wealth of the world's 10 richest men rose by $540bn (Â£400bn) during the pandemic, according to Oxfam. The charity claims this amount would be enough to prevent the world from falling into poverty because of the virus, and pay for vaccines for all. The organisation is urging governments to consider taxes on the super-rich. Oxfam's report,externalcomes as global leaders gather virtually for the World Economic Forum's ""Davos Dialogue"" meeting. 'Tax the wealthy to pay for coronavirus' Argentina to tax 12,000 wealthy people to tackle Covid In December 2020, the total wealth of billionaires worldwide hit $11.95tn - equivalent to the recovery spending of all the G20 governments put together, according to the charity. The 10 richest people, whose fortunes rose by $540bn since March 2020, include Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Tesla founder Elon Musk and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Oxfam claims that the billionaires' fortunes rose due to rebounding stock markets and a ""rigged economy"", causing rising inequality during the ""worst economic downturn in a century"". Many tech giants saw sales - and share prices - rise in 2020, as lockdowns led to a jump in demand for digital services. This inflated the wealth of men like Mr Bezos, whose giant fortunes are driven by the value of holdings such as property and the shares they own, rather than wages. However, ""wealth"" does not equal income. Wealth estimates refer to the net worth of an individual, including their money, the value of their assets and also the ""notional"" value of the shares they hold. A rise in share prices pertains to the perceived net worth of a company as a whole, rather than the shareholders themselves. The report said that Mr Bezos's worth had climbed so much between March-September 2020 that he could have given all 876,000 Amazon employees a $105,000 bonus and still have been as wealthy as he was before the pandemic. This compares with the world's poorest, for whom economic recovery could take more than a decade. Oxfam estimates that between 200 million and 500 million more people were living in poverty in 2020, reversing the decline in global poverty seen over the last two decades. ""We think that this is... an opportunity to do something radical about building back fairer to think about wealth taxes, to think about corporation taxes, to think about increasing the basic social floor for every citizen,"" Danny Sriskandarajah, Oxfam's chief executive told the BBC. With reference to the UK, he said imposing a tax could raise millions. Yes - some are. There have been a relatively high number of charitable mega-donations since the pandemic began, with celebrities, sports stars and business leaders responding to the Covid-19 emergency. In an October report, UBS said209 billionaires had committed a total equivalent to $7.2bn from March to June 2020 to fight Covid-19. ""They have reacted quickly, in a way that's akin to disaster relief, providing unrestricted grants to allow grantees to decide how best to use funds,"" the report added. Last month, MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Jeff Bezos, revealed she had donated more than $4bn to food banks and emergency relief funds in four months. In a blog post, Ms Scott said she wanted to help Americans who were struggling because of the pandemic. As of June last year, Mr Bezos was said to have donated $125m to the coronavirus effort. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey announced in April that he was moving $1bn of his assets into a fund to support pandemic relief efforts and other causes. This represents about a quarter of his $3.9bn net worth. Harry Potter author JK Rowling has donated Â£1m to help homeless people and those affected by domestic abuse during the pandemic. Meanwhile, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is chaired by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his wife Melinda, says it has committed a total of $1.75bn to the global Covid-19 response, including for the development and delivery of vaccines and tests.

"There are 37,899 people in hospital in the UK with coronavirus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock says, including 4,076 on ventilators Almost four-in-five of people aged 80 and over have been vaccinated, Hancock says The new variant of the virus first identified in South East England is spreading 30-70% faster than the original, he says There are ""early signs that the actions we are taking are working"", with the rise in case numbers slowing and falling in some areas, he adds Ministers are holding discussions about what tier system will replace the current lockdown once it is lifted, Hancock says A further 592 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, new daily figures show Schools reopening is a priority but nobody wants restrictions lifted so quickly while the rate of infection is still very high, the prime minister says Thanks for joining us today. We'll be wrapping up our live coverage shortly. Here are some of the main stories we've been covering this Monday:  We'll be back tomorrow. Today's live page has been brought to you by James Clarke, Alex Kleiderman, Victoria Lindrea, Cherry Wilson, Jennifer Meierhans, Lauren Turner, Justin Parkinson and Sam Cabral.   Whenever President Donald Trump spoke about his administration's Covid response, he was often flanked by two of the nation's top doctors - Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx. Now the duo are revealing just how difficult it was to work under him. Ina long interview with the New York Times,external, Dr Fauci - the chief infectious disease specialist in the country - said the then president would often tell him he was too negative. ""I always felt that if I did walk away, the skunk at the picnic would no longer be at the picnic,"" explained Dr Fauci. Often contradicting the administration, he said he could not bring himself to resign because there was far too much Covid denialism - including from within the White House. ""Even if I wasn't very effective in changing everybody's minds, the idea 
that they knew that nonsense could not be spouted without my pushing 
back on it, I felt was important."" Ina separate interview with CBS,external, Dr Birx - the White House's Covid task force coordinator - confirmed that there was a ""parallel set of data and graphics"" presented to the president that she wasn't privy to. Dr Birx has since retired from public service, but Dr Fauci has joined the Biden administration as the new president's chief medical adviser. Home schooling can be tough. It's difficult to concentrate, there's emotional exhaustion, boredom, a lack of motivation and it's really hard not going out to see friends. And that's just the parents. This winter lockdown is taking its toll on families, now struggling even more on the black ice of uncertainty as no-one can say when schools in England are going to reopen for most pupils again. ""There's a sense of fatigue,"" says Jacqueline Smallwood, who is at home with three secondary-school children. She says her own ""concentration levels have fallen dramatically"". ""It's so repetitive that it just makes you feel tired,"" she says of the latest lockdown and the ""silent struggle"" facing both parents and their children to try to get motivated. Sound familiar?

Under the round-the-clock curfew, citizens who are not ""essential workers"" have been barred from leaving their homes since 14 January. Laila, 12, is in Beirut trying to study while her family works from home. ""We all have our own work to do and when we have meetings we hear each other. It can be a real distraction and stop you from finishing your work on time,"" she says. ""Sometimes I can't study well because I get stressed with all the work they're giving us. It is definitely not the same studying online as it is in the physical world."" For hairdresser Walid Kanaan this year has been ""extremely difficult psychologically and economically"". ""I own my shop but still I cannot afford it. I pay the workers' salary so I am really broke,"" says the 45-year-old. ""It is hitting hard. You can't go out at all or do anything. My wife works in a bank and she is also collapsing. She doesn't know if she will still have her job or not. ""We don't trust the government that if they bring a vaccine it will be safe to take it.

All of the residents in Manchesterâs care homes for older people have received their first Covid-19 vaccinations, according to the city's council. People living in the city's 56 care homes were prioritised for the vaccine rollout - with NHS teams aiming to have completed the first jabs by 24 January. Carolyn Ball, general manager of Belong Morris Feinmann Care Village in Didsbury, said she was ""delighted"" all their residents had been vaccinated. âThis is the additional protection we have long been waiting for and itâs great to be starting the new year knowing that our residents are at reduced risk,"" she added.  Reality Check At the daily briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that, âunder this lockdown, it is illegal to travel abroad unless you have a reasonable excuseâ. Under Englandâs lockdown rules, people must only go abroad for âessential reasonsâ. These are the same as the ""reasonable excuses"" for domestic travel, including:  The police can stop people to ask if they have a âreasonable excuseâ to travel, but it is not the responsibility of airlines to check. A handful of jobs and professions are also exempt from some of the travel restrictions, if they are making the journey for work reasons -  including pilots and coach drivers.

The UK government has confirmed it is considering using hotels to quarantine people arriving in the UK from countries with dangerous variants of coronavirus.

It passed the devastating milestone on Sunday morning, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US has had well over twice as many overall cases as the next highest country, India, which has over 10 million cases. Nearly 420,000 Americans have died from the virus, almost double that of Brazil, the second highest. On Friday, US president Joe Biden warned the worst could be yet to come: ""The virus is surging. We're 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000."" It is now a race between the virus and the vaccine, as the new administration aims for 100 million jabs in its first 100 days. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Conservative MPs, publicly and
privately, are pressing for a clearer route-map out of lockdown. And in some
cases, frustration is boiling over; one Tory MP told me earlier that they were
âlividâ about the ongoing situation with schools. Matt Hancock was never likely
to come out and bind the government to a timeline today. But at the Downing Street press conference, he did talk about
these four âfactorsâ that ministers will be looking at when it comes to lifting
restrictions. Namely - the death rate, hospitalisations, any new variants that
affect the pandemic and the success of the vaccine rollout. Ministers may feel they need some room for manoeuvre in these
uncertain times. But a number of their own backbenchers will likely keep trying
to pin down some detail. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The falling numbers of infections being reported and rising
rate of vaccination are incredibly promising - even if the drop in infections
reported on Monday may have been partly an artefact of fewer people coming
forward for a test because of the snow. But that does not offer any guarantees of a rapid lifting of
lockdown. What is concerning ministers though are the high numbers in
hospital. The number of new admissions seems to have plateaued - but
at a very high rate. Close to 4,000 patients a day are being admitted to
hospital. To put that in context, that is four times the total number
of all types of respiratory admissions the NHS would normally see in winter. It means the numbers in hospital are at nearly twice the
level they were at the peak in the spring during the first wave. With better treatments available, patients are spending
longer in hospital. So come mid February the pressures in hospital are likely to
be very high, leaving ministers little wriggle-room to relax restrictions. The big unknown, however, is what impact and how quickly
vaccination will have an effect on admissions. There is encouraging early news from Israel that
hospitalisation really start to drop three weeks after the first dose. If that is repeated here, the picture could quickly change. But until that happens the government - in the words of Health
Secretary Matt Hancock - is urging the country to hold its nerve. A couple have been fined for making a 130-mile (209km) round trip from Derbyshire to York for a roast dinner. North Yorkshire Police said the couple, who were in their 20s, told officers one of their mothers was going to cook lunch on Sunday, but ""let them down"". They decided to make the trip to York in search of a takeaway lunch instead. The pair were given Covid fixed penalty notices, with police saying: ""We know nobody does Yorkshire puddings better than us here in Yorkshire... but they're really not worth getting into trouble for."" Read the full storyhere.  As a winter Covid surge batters California, scientists wondered if the contagious UK variant had landed in their state. Two independent research groups - in Los Angeles and San Francisco - are now confirming the existence of a homegrown variant of the virus. Data suggests it appears to be spreading faster than any other variant in the state. Both sets of researchers confirmed they had been looking for the UK strain when they stumbled upon the new mutation. A single instance of the strain was detected back in July but it lay dormant for months. It has since exploded across the state, likely contributing to a brutal holiday season that has strained hospital capacity to its limits and doubled the state's death toll. California has now recorded over three million total cases and more than 37,000 deaths. The daily press conference was given by Health Secretary Matt Hancock. He was joined by Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, and Dr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England. Here's what they told us: Reducing wastage of vaccines when dealing with the pandemic is crucial, Matt Hancock says. Asked if he will publish detailed wastage rates, he says he is ""very happy"" to look into giving more details. That concludes today's Downing Street press conference. Dan O'Donoghue from the Press and Journal asks why Scotland has the lowest vaccination rate in the UK. He also wants to know, following recent polls on Scottish independence, if the case for the union is helped or hindered by the government's performance over the past year. Echoing his earlier statement at the press conference, Matt Hancock says the case for the union is ""undoubtedly strengthened"" and the pandemic response has shown ""we are stronger as one United Kingdom"". He says the vaccine rollout is a case in point and that, other than Israel and the UAE, the UK has the fastest vaccine rollout in the world. ""It shows what the United Kingdom can do when we pull together,"" he said. Hancock adds that colleagues in Scotland are ""working incredibly hard"" to roll out the vaccines and ""the NHS in Scotland is doing an absolutely terrific job"". ""If this pandemic has taught us anything, it's that we all rely on each other,"" he adds. Matt Hancock says the proportion of people declining vaccinations is ""very, very low"". The programme is ""going well"" and the uptake is ""getting to really high levels"", he adds. Getting a jab is ""the right thing"", Hancock says, calling the media ""absolutely brilliant"" for ""supporting the science on this one"". Jenny Harries adds that with more information, take-up increases. Communities are getting the ""real level of data"" needed to support people, she says. She said the steroid Dexamethasone should also still work ""perfectly"" as a treatment for new variants. Channel 5's question about possible enforced hotel quarantine for people arriving from aboard was a reference to the prime minister's confirmation earlier in the day that the government was considering such a move. Incoming travellers already have to show evidence of a recent negative coronavirus test. At present, all travellers must provide contact details and theirUK address,external. They can then travel - by public transport if necessary - to their home or to the place where they plan to self-isolate. Here's everything you need to know about the UK travel and quarantine rules. Andy Bell at Channel 5 asks if Matt Hancock believes the time has come for enforced hotel quarantine for anyone coming into the UK. The health secretary says it is ""incredibly important"" that ""we are cautious at the border"". He notes travel corridors have now been removed and that lockdown rules mean travel abroad is illegal without a reasonable excuse, for example medical reasons. He says it is right to take a ""precautionary"" approach while analysis is continuing around the world on the virus. Dr Harries is asked if it was wrong to say, earlier in the pandemic, that there was no point in controlling the people coming in to the UK once the virus was already here. She says once there was a significant infection rate, the proportion coming in through borders was very small. But now new variants are being identified, other measures need to be put in place.  Matt Hancock says new virus variants from South Africa and Brazil are in ""very small numbers"" in the UK at present. The government is using ""enhanced contact tracing"" to deal with these, he adds, to ensure people affected and their contacts self-isolate. Asked how effective vaccines are against new coronavirus variants, Hancock says there's a ""high degree of confidence"" it works with the one first detected in Kent. The ban on foreign travel for most people is because the government does not want more people arriving ""at risk"" of having other strains. Susan Hopkins says it's ""reassuring"" that the vaccines work with the Kent variant. She said work is starting on testing its effect on the South African strain. Jenny Harries says mutations are normal for viruses and the ""majority"" will not be ""a cause of concern"". It's unlikely that vaccines will not work, to some extent, on new strains, she adds.

Today's live page has been brought to you by James Clarke, Alex Kleiderman, Victoria Lindrea, Cherry Wilson, Jennifer Meierhans, Lauren Turner, Justin Parkinson and Sam Cabral.   Whenever President Donald Trump spoke about his administration's Covid response, he was often flanked by two of the nation's top doctors - Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx. Now the duo are revealing just how difficult it was to work under him. Ina long interview with the New York Times,external, Dr Fauci - the chief infectious disease specialist in the country - said the then president would often tell him he was too negative. ""I always felt that if I did walk away, the skunk at the picnic would no longer be at the picnic,"" explained Dr Fauci. Often contradicting the administration, he said he could not bring himself to resign because there was far too much Covid denialism - including from within the White House. ""Even if I wasn't very effective in changing everybody's minds, the idea 
that they knew that nonsense could not be spouted without my pushing 
back on it, I felt was important."" Ina separate interview with CBS,external, Dr Birx - the White House's Covid task force coordinator - confirmed that there was a ""parallel set of data and graphics"" presented to the president that she wasn't privy to. Dr Birx has since retired from public service, but Dr Fauci has joined the Biden administration as the new president's chief medical adviser. Home schooling can be tough. It's difficult to concentrate, there's emotional exhaustion, boredom, a lack of motivation and it's really hard not going out to see friends. And that's just the parents. This winter lockdown is taking its toll on families, now struggling even more on the black ice of uncertainty as no-one can say when schools in England are going to reopen for most pupils again. ""There's a sense of fatigue,"" says Jacqueline Smallwood, who is at home with three secondary-school children. She says her own ""concentration levels have fallen dramatically"". ""It's so repetitive that it just makes you feel tired,"" she says of the latest lockdown and the ""silent struggle"" facing both parents and their children to try to get motivated. Sound familiar?

Under the round-the-clock curfew, citizens who are not ""essential workers"" have been barred from leaving their homes since 14 January. Laila, 12, is in Beirut trying to study while her family works from home. ""We all have our own work to do and when we have meetings we hear each other. It can be a real distraction and stop you from finishing your work on time,"" she says. ""Sometimes I can't study well because I get stressed with all the work they're giving us. It is definitely not the same studying online as it is in the physical world."" For hairdresser Walid Kanaan this year has been ""extremely difficult psychologically and economically"". ""I own my shop but still I cannot afford it. I pay the workers' salary so I am really broke,"" says the 45-year-old. ""It is hitting hard. You can't go out at all or do anything.

All of the residents in Manchesterâs care homes for older people have received their first Covid-19 vaccinations, according to the city's council. People living in the city's 56 care homes were prioritised for the vaccine rollout - with NHS teams aiming to have completed the first jabs by 24 January. Carolyn Ball, general manager of Belong Morris Feinmann Care Village in Didsbury, said she was ""delighted"" all their residents had been vaccinated. âThis is the additional protection we have long been waiting for and itâs great to be starting the new year knowing that our residents are at reduced risk,"" she added.  Reality Check At the daily briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that, âunder this lockdown, it is illegal to travel abroad unless you have a reasonable excuseâ. Under Englandâs lockdown rules, people must only go abroad for âessential reasonsâ. These are the same as the ""reasonable excuses"" for domestic travel, including:  The police can stop people to ask if they have a âreasonable excuseâ to travel, but it is not the responsibility of airlines to check. A handful of jobs and professions are also exempt from some of the travel restrictions, if they are making the journey for work reasons -  including pilots and coach drivers. Read more here:What are the UK travel rules? The UK government has confirmed it is considering using hotels to quarantine people arriving in the UK from countries with dangerous variants of coronavirus. But as that was revealed, shares in airlines and travel companies fell sharply. Both Easyjet and British Airways' parent company, IAG, saw their shares fall more than 7%.

It passed the devastating milestone on Sunday morning, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US has had well over twice as many overall cases as the next highest country, India, which has over 10 million cases. Nearly 420,000 Americans have died from the virus, almost double that of Brazil, the second highest. On Friday, US president Joe Biden warned the worst could be yet to come: ""The virus is surging. We're 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000."" It is now a race between the virus and the vaccine, as the new administration aims for 100 million jabs in its first 100 days. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Conservative MPs, publicly and
privately, are pressing for a clearer route-map out of lockdown. And in some
cases, frustration is boiling over; one Tory MP told me earlier that they were
âlividâ about the ongoing situation with schools. Matt Hancock was never likely
to come out and bind the government to a timeline today. But at the Downing Street press conference, he did talk about
these four âfactorsâ that ministers will be looking at when it comes to lifting
restrictions. Namely - the death rate, hospitalisations, any new variants that
affect the pandemic and the success of the vaccine rollout. Ministers may feel they need some room for manoeuvre in these
uncertain times. But a number of their own backbenchers will likely keep trying
to pin down some detail. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The falling numbers of infections being reported and rising
rate of vaccination are incredibly promising - even if the drop in infections
reported on Monday may have been partly an artefact of fewer people coming
forward for a test because of the snow. But that does not offer any guarantees of a rapid lifting of
lockdown. What is concerning ministers though are the high numbers in
hospital. The number of new admissions seems to have plateaued - but
at a very high rate. Close to 4,000 patients a day are being admitted to
hospital. To put that in context, that is four times the total number
of all types of respiratory admissions the NHS would normally see in winter. It means the numbers in hospital are at nearly twice the
level they were at the peak in the spring during the first wave. With better treatments available, patients are spending
longer in hospital. So come mid February the pressures in hospital are likely to
be very high, leaving ministers little wriggle-room to relax restrictions. The big unknown, however, is what impact and how quickly
vaccination will have an effect on admissions. There is encouraging early news from Israel that
hospitalisation really start to drop three weeks after the first dose. If that is repeated here, the picture could quickly change. But until that happens the government - in the words of Health
Secretary Matt Hancock - is urging the country to hold its nerve. A couple have been fined for making a 130-mile (209km) round trip from Derbyshire to York for a roast dinner. North Yorkshire Police said the couple, who were in their 20s, told officers one of their mothers was going to cook lunch on Sunday, but ""let them down"". They decided to make the trip to York in search of a takeaway lunch instead. The pair were given Covid fixed penalty notices, with police saying: ""We know nobody does Yorkshire puddings better than us here in Yorkshire... but they're really not worth getting into trouble for."" Read the full storyhere.  As a winter Covid surge batters California, scientists wondered if the contagious UK variant had landed in their state. Two independent research groups - in Los Angeles and San Francisco - are now confirming the existence of a homegrown variant of the virus. Data suggests it appears to be spreading faster than any other variant in the state. Both sets of researchers confirmed they had been looking for the UK strain when they stumbled upon the new mutation. A single instance of the strain was detected back in July but it lay dormant for months. It has since exploded across the state, likely contributing to a brutal holiday season that has strained hospital capacity to its limits and doubled the state's death toll. California has now recorded over three million total cases and more than 37,000 deaths. The daily press conference was given by Health Secretary Matt Hancock. He was joined by Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, and Dr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England. Here's what they told us: Reducing wastage of vaccines when dealing with the pandemic is crucial, Matt Hancock says. Asked if he will publish detailed wastage rates, he says he is ""very happy"" to look into giving more details. That concludes today's Downing Street press conference.

"Fashion retailer Boohoo has bought the Debenhams brand and website for Â£55m. However, it will not take on any of the firm's remaining 118 High Street stores or its workforce. Boohoo said it was a ""transformational deal"" and a ""huge step"". But the deal means that up to 12,000 jobs at the department store chain are set to go. The 242-year-old Debenhams chain is already in the process of closing down, after administrators failed to secure a rescue deal for the business. In a separate development,Asos says it is in ""exclusive"" talksto buy the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT brands out of administration. But the online retailer said it only wanted the brands, not their shops, suggesting any deal would cost jobs. The current owner of the brands, Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group, fell into administration last November putting 13,000 jobs at risk. A closing-down sale at 124 Debenhams stores began in December, as the administrators continued to seek offers for all or parts of the business. The company announced recently that six shops would not reopen after lockdown, including its flagship department store on London's Oxford Street. The administrators of Debenhams UK, FRP Advisory, said they had undertaken a ""thorough and robust process"" to achieve ""the best outcome for Debenhams' stakeholders"". ""This transaction will allow a new Debenhams-branded business to emerge under strong new ownership, including an online operation and the opportunity to secure an international franchise network that will operate under licence using the Debenhams name,"" they added. What went wrong at Debenhams? Five things you didn't know about Boohoo Asos frontrunner to buy Topshop and Miss Selfridge Debenhams pictured through the years Boohoo has already bought a number of High Street brands out of administration. It snapped up Oasis, Coast and Karen Millen, but not the associated stores. Its executive chairman, Mahmud Kamani, said: ""This is a transformational deal for the group, which allows us to capture the fantastic opportunity as ecommerce continues to grow. Our ambition is to create the UK's largest marketplace. ""Our acquisition of the Debenhams brand is strategically significant as it represents a huge step which accelerates our ambition to be a leader, not just in fashion ecommerce, but in new categories including beauty, sport and homeware."" Boohoo said Debenhams was expected to relaunch on Boohoo's web platform later this year. In the meantime, Debenhams will continue to operate its website for an agreed period. Boohoo's fast-fashion model has come under scrutiny Boohoo has recently come under fire over workers' pay and conditions and its ultra-low pricing. As well as facing questions about the environmental impact of its fast-fashion business model, there have been accusations of  widespread abuse of employment law at some of Boohoo's suppliers in Leicester. Investigations last year suggested workers were being paid below the minimum wage. After an independent review of the claims found a series of failings, Mr Kamani said last month that the firm was working to fix the problems, adding:""We will make a better Boohoo."" While online retailers have been whittling away at their High Street rivals for years, few could have predicted how quickly bricks-and-mortar stalwarts have collapsed. The pandemic has fatally undermined their already parlous finances. Businesses that appeared to have a chance of survival just a year ago have been wiped out and their brands bought by online players. The scale of the change is profound: when Debenhams listed on the stock exchange in 2011, investors valued it at Â£1.6bn. Boohoo, which was founded only in 2006, already has a stock market value of Â£4.4bn. Asos, a bit player two decades ago when Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group was riding high and toying with a bid for Marks & Spencer, is now valued by the stock market at Â£5bn. Neither Boohoo or Asos see any value in the Debenhams or Topshop High Street estates. Instead, they will concentrate on development of the brands and the associated customer data. This is bad news for the 19,000-odd people who work in the branches of Debenhams and Topshop, and will leave councils around the country wondering how they will fill town centres that were based on retail. But just as canny entrepreneurs and private equity companies are gearing up to buy struggling pub chains, in the hope of a recovery once lockdown restrictions are eased, so will some investors be wondering what next for the High Street. The British love affair with shopping will not end overnight and a well-placed punt now could have big rewards. Debenhams has struggled for years with falling profits and rising debts, as more shopping has moved online. It called in administrators twice in two years, most recently in April. However, its position became untenable during the coronavirus pandemic as non-essential retailers were forced to close for prolonged periods. The firm had already trimmed its store portfolio and cut about 6,500 jobs since May, as it struggled to stay afloat. Businessman Mike Ashley, who founded Sports Direct and also owns House of Fraser, had already made an offer for Debenhams after it was initially put up for sale in April. However, the takeover offer, thought to be in the region of Â£125m, was rejected as being too low. Meanwhile, one of House of Fraser's flagship outlets, the Jenners department store in Edinburgh, is to leave its Princes Street home after 183 years. It will close on 3 May with the loss of 200 jobs. The building's owner, Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, announced in November 2019 thathe intended to convert the site, replacing Jenners with a hotel, cafes, a rooftop restaurant and luxury shops. However, a spokesperson for Frasers Group said it had been ""unable to reach an agreement"" with Mr Povlsen and that the closure of Jenners would leave ""a vacant site for the foreseeable future with no immediate plans"".

hospital. The number of new admissions seems to have plateaued - but
at a very high rate. Close to 4,000 patients a day are being admitted to
hospital. To put that in context, that is four times the total number
of all types of respiratory admissions the NHS would normally see in winter. It means the numbers in hospital are at nearly twice the
level they were at the peak in the spring during the first wave. With better treatments available, patients are spending
longer in hospital. So come mid February the pressures in hospital are likely to
be very high, leaving ministers little wriggle-room to relax restrictions. The big unknown, however, is what impact and how quickly
vaccination will have an effect on admissions. There is encouraging early news from Israel that
hospitalisation really start to drop three weeks after the first dose. If that is repeated here, the picture could quickly change. But until that happens the government - in the words of Health
Secretary Matt Hancock - is urging the country to hold its nerve. A couple have been fined for making a 130-mile (209km) round trip from Derbyshire to York for a roast dinner. North Yorkshire Police said the couple, who were in their 20s, told officers one of their mothers was going to cook lunch on Sunday, but ""let them down"". They decided to make the trip to York in search of a takeaway lunch instead. The pair were given Covid fixed penalty notices, with police saying: ""We know nobody does Yorkshire puddings better than us here in Yorkshire... but they're really not worth getting into trouble for.""

Two independent research groups - in Los Angeles and San Francisco - are now confirming the existence of a homegrown variant of the virus. Data suggests it appears to be spreading faster than any other variant in the state. Both sets of researchers confirmed they had been looking for the UK strain when they stumbled upon the new mutation. A single instance of the strain was detected back in July but it lay dormant for months. It has since exploded across the state, likely contributing to a brutal holiday season that has strained hospital capacity to its limits and doubled the state's death toll. California has now recorded over three million total cases and more than 37,000 deaths. The daily press conference was given by Health Secretary Matt Hancock. He was joined by Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, and Dr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England. Here's what they told us: Reducing wastage of vaccines when dealing with the pandemic is crucial, Matt Hancock says. Asked if he will publish detailed wastage rates, he says he is ""very happy"" to look into giving more details. That concludes today's Downing Street press conference. Dan O'Donoghue from the Press and Journal asks why Scotland has the lowest vaccination rate in the UK. He also wants to know, following recent polls on Scottish independence, if the case for the union is helped or hindered by the government's performance over the past year. Echoing his earlier statement at the press conference, Matt Hancock says the case for the union is ""undoubtedly strengthened"" and the pandemic response has shown ""we are stronger as one United Kingdom"". He says the vaccine rollout is a case in point and that, other than Israel and the UAE, the UK has the fastest vaccine rollout in the world. ""It shows what the United Kingdom can do when we pull together,"" he said. Hancock adds that colleagues in Scotland are ""working incredibly hard"" to roll out the vaccines and ""the NHS in Scotland is doing an absolutely terrific job"". ""If this pandemic has taught us anything, it's that we all rely on each other,"" he adds. Matt Hancock says the proportion of people declining vaccinations is ""very, very low"". The programme is ""going well"" and the uptake is ""getting to really high levels"", he adds. Getting a jab is ""the right thing"", Hancock says, calling the media ""absolutely brilliant"" for ""supporting the science on this one"". Jenny Harries adds that with more information, take-up increases. Communities are getting the ""real level of data"" needed to support people, she says. She said the steroid Dexamethasone should also still work ""perfectly"" as a treatment for new variants. Channel 5's question about possible enforced hotel quarantine for people arriving from aboard was a reference to the prime minister's confirmation earlier in the day that the government was considering such a move. Incoming travellers already have to show evidence of a recent negative coronavirus test. At present, all travellers must provide contact details and theirUK address,external. They can then travel - by public transport if necessary - to their home or to the place where they plan to self-isolate. Here's everything you need to know about the UK travel and quarantine rules. Andy Bell at Channel 5 asks if Matt Hancock believes the time has come for enforced hotel quarantine for anyone coming into the UK. The health secretary says it is ""incredibly important"" that ""we are cautious at the border"". He notes travel corridors have now been removed and that lockdown rules mean travel abroad is illegal without a reasonable excuse, for example medical reasons. He says it is right to take a ""precautionary"" approach while analysis is continuing around the world on the virus. Dr Harries is asked if it was wrong to say, earlier in the pandemic, that there was no point in controlling the people coming in to the UK once the virus was already here. She says once there was a significant infection rate, the proportion coming in through borders was very small. But now new variants are being identified, other measures need to be put in place.  Matt Hancock says new virus variants from South Africa and Brazil are in ""very small numbers"" in the UK at present. The government is using ""enhanced contact tracing"" to deal with these, he adds, to ensure people affected and their contacts self-isolate. Asked how effective vaccines are against new coronavirus variants, Hancock says there's a ""high degree of confidence"" it works with the one first detected in Kent. The ban on foreign travel for most people is because the government does not want more people arriving ""at risk"" of having other strains. Susan Hopkins says it's ""reassuring"" that the vaccines work with the Kent variant. She said work is starting on testing its effect on the South African strain. Jenny Harries says mutations are normal for viruses and the ""majority"" will not be ""a cause of concern"". It's unlikely that vaccines will not work, to some extent, on new strains, she adds.

"There are 37,899 people in hospital in the UK with coronavirus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock says, including 4,076 on ventilators Almost four-in-five of people aged 80 and over have been vaccinated, Hancock says The new variant of the virus first identified in South East England is spreading 30-70% faster than the original, he says There are ""early signs that the actions we are taking are working"", with the rise in case numbers slowing and falling in some areas, he adds Ministers are holding discussions about what tier system will replace the current lockdown once it is lifted, Hancock says A further 592 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, new daily figures show Schools reopening is a priority but nobody wants restrictions lifted so quickly while the rate of infection is still very high, the prime minister says Thanks for joining us today. We'll be wrapping up our live coverage shortly. Here are some of the main stories we've been covering this Monday:  We'll be back tomorrow. Today's live page has been brought to you by James Clarke, Alex Kleiderman, Victoria Lindrea, Cherry Wilson, Jennifer Meierhans, Lauren Turner, Justin Parkinson and Sam Cabral.   Whenever President Donald Trump spoke about his administration's Covid response, he was often flanked by two of the nation's top doctors - Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx. Now the duo are revealing just how difficult it was to work under him. Ina long interview with the New York Times,external, Dr Fauci - the chief infectious disease specialist in the country - said the then president would often tell him he was too negative. ""I always felt that if I did walk away, the skunk at the picnic would no longer be at the picnic,"" explained Dr Fauci. Often contradicting the administration, he said he could not bring himself to resign because there was far too much Covid denialism - including from within the White House. ""Even if I wasn't very effective in changing everybody's minds, the idea 
that they knew that nonsense could not be spouted without my pushing 
back on it, I felt was important."" Ina separate interview with CBS,external, Dr Birx - the White House's Covid task force coordinator - confirmed that there was a ""parallel set of data and graphics"" presented to the president that she wasn't privy to. Dr Birx has since retired from public service, but Dr Fauci has joined the Biden administration as the new president's chief medical adviser. Home schooling can be tough. It's difficult to concentrate, there's emotional exhaustion, boredom, a lack of motivation and it's really hard not going out to see friends. And that's just the parents. This winter lockdown is taking its toll on families, now struggling even more on the black ice of uncertainty as no-one can say when schools in England are going to reopen for most pupils again. ""There's a sense of fatigue,"" says Jacqueline Smallwood, who is at home with three secondary-school children. She says her own ""concentration levels have fallen dramatically"". ""It's so repetitive that it just makes you feel tired,"" she says of the latest lockdown and the ""silent struggle"" facing both parents and their children to try to get motivated. Sound familiar?

Under the round-the-clock curfew, citizens who are not ""essential workers"" have been barred from leaving their homes since 14 January. Laila, 12, is in Beirut trying to study while her family works from home. ""We all have our own work to do and when we have meetings we hear each other. It can be a real distraction and stop you from finishing your work on time,"" she says. ""Sometimes I can't study well because I get stressed with all the work they're giving us. It is definitely not the same studying online as it is in the physical world."" For hairdresser Walid Kanaan this year has been ""extremely difficult psychologically and economically"". ""I own my shop but still I cannot afford it. I pay the workers' salary so I am really broke,"" says the 45-year-old. ""It is hitting hard. You can't go out at all or do anything. My wife works in a bank and she is also collapsing. She doesn't know if she will still have her job or not. ""We don't trust the government that if they bring a vaccine it will be safe to take it. We can only pray for God to protect us."" Read more stories from people in lockdown in Lebanonhere. All of the residents in Manchesterâs care homes for older people have received their first Covid-19 vaccinations, according to the city's council. People living in the city's 56 care homes were prioritised for the vaccine rollout - with NHS teams aiming to have completed the first jabs by 24 January. Carolyn Ball, general manager of Belong Morris Feinmann Care Village in Didsbury, said she was ""delighted"" all their residents had been vaccinated. âThis is the additional protection we have long been waiting for and itâs great to be starting the new year knowing that our residents are at reduced risk,"" she added.  Reality Check At the daily briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that, âunder this lockdown, it is illegal to travel abroad unless you have a reasonable excuseâ. Under Englandâs lockdown rules, people must only go abroad for âessential reasonsâ. These are the same as the ""reasonable excuses"" for domestic travel, including:  The police can stop people to ask if they have a âreasonable excuseâ to travel, but it is not the responsibility of airlines to check. A handful of jobs and professions are also exempt from some of the travel restrictions, if they are making the journey for work reasons -  including pilots and coach drivers. Read more here:What are the UK travel rules? The UK government has confirmed it is considering using hotels to quarantine people arriving in the UK from countries with dangerous variants of coronavirus. But as that was revealed, shares in airlines and travel companies fell sharply. Both Easyjet and British Airways' parent company, IAG, saw their shares fall more than 7%. Read more hereon the hotel quarantine plans which are going to be discussed. Barely one year after its first coronavirus case was detected, the US has now surpassed 25 million total infections. It passed the devastating milestone on Sunday morning, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US has had well over twice as many overall cases as the next highest country, India, which has over 10 million cases. Nearly 420,000 Americans have died from the virus, almost double that of Brazil, the second highest. On Friday, US president Joe Biden warned the worst could be yet to come: ""The virus is surging. We're 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000."" It is now a race between the virus and the vaccine, as the new administration aims for 100 million jabs in its first 100 days. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Conservative MPs, publicly and
privately, are pressing for a clearer route-map out of lockdown. And in some
cases, frustration is boiling over; one Tory MP told me earlier that they were
âlividâ about the ongoing situation with schools. Matt Hancock was never likely
to come out and bind the government to a timeline today. But at the Downing Street press conference, he did talk about
these four âfactorsâ that ministers will be looking at when it comes to lifting
restrictions. Namely - the death rate, hospitalisations, any new variants that
affect the pandemic and the success of the vaccine rollout. Ministers may feel they need some room for manoeuvre in these
uncertain times. But a number of their own backbenchers will likely keep trying
to pin down some detail. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The falling numbers of infections being reported and rising
rate of vaccination are incredibly promising - even if the drop in infections
reported on Monday may have been partly an artefact of fewer people coming
forward for a test because of the snow. But that does not offer any guarantees of a rapid lifting of
lockdown. What is concerning ministers though are the high numbers in
hospital. The number of new admissions seems to have plateaued - but
at a very high rate. Close to 4,000 patients a day are being admitted to

Asked how effective vaccines are against new coronavirus variants, Hancock says there's a ""high degree of confidence"" it works with the one first detected in Kent. The ban on foreign travel for most people is because the government does not want more people arriving ""at risk"" of having other strains. Susan Hopkins says it's ""reassuring"" that the vaccines work with the Kent variant. She said work is starting on testing its effect on the South African strain. Jenny Harries says mutations are normal for viruses and the ""majority"" will not be ""a cause of concern"". It's unlikely that vaccines will not work, to some extent, on new strains, she adds.

"There are 37,899 people in hospital in the UK with coronavirus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock says, including 4,076 on ventilators Almost four-in-five of people aged 80 and over have been vaccinated, Hancock says The new variant of the virus first identified in South East England is spreading 30-70% faster than the original, he says There are ""early signs that the actions we are taking are working"", with the rise in case numbers slowing and falling in some areas, he adds Ministers are holding discussions about what tier system will replace the current lockdown once it is lifted, Hancock says A further 592 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, new daily figures show Schools reopening is a priority but nobody wants restrictions lifted so quickly while the rate of infection is still very high, the prime minister says Thanks for joining us today. We'll be wrapping up our live coverage shortly. Here are some of the main stories we've been covering this Monday:  We'll be back tomorrow. Today's live page has been brought to you by James Clarke, Alex Kleiderman, Victoria Lindrea, Cherry Wilson, Jennifer Meierhans, Lauren Turner, Justin Parkinson and Sam Cabral.   Whenever President Donald Trump spoke about his administration's Covid response, he was often flanked by two of the nation's top doctors - Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx. Now the duo are revealing just how difficult it was to work under him. Ina long interview with the New York Times,external, Dr Fauci - the chief infectious disease specialist in the country - said the then president would often tell him he was too negative. ""I always felt that if I did walk away, the skunk at the picnic would no longer be at the picnic,"" explained Dr Fauci. Often contradicting the administration, he said he could not bring himself to resign because there was far too much Covid denialism - including from within the White House. ""Even if I wasn't very effective in changing everybody's minds, the idea 
that they knew that nonsense could not be spouted without my pushing 
back on it, I felt was important."" Ina separate interview with CBS,external, Dr Birx - the White House's Covid task force coordinator - confirmed that there was a ""parallel set of data and graphics"" presented to the president that she wasn't privy to. Dr Birx has since retired from public service, but Dr Fauci has joined the Biden administration as the new president's chief medical adviser. Home schooling can be tough. It's difficult to concentrate, there's emotional exhaustion, boredom, a lack of motivation and it's really hard not going out to see friends. And that's just the parents. This winter lockdown is taking its toll on families, now struggling even more on the black ice of uncertainty as no-one can say when schools in England are going to reopen for most pupils again. ""There's a sense of fatigue,"" says Jacqueline Smallwood, who is at home with three secondary-school children. She says her own ""concentration levels have fallen dramatically"". ""It's so repetitive that it just makes you feel tired,"" she says of the latest lockdown and the ""silent struggle"" facing both parents and their children to try to get motivated. Sound familiar?

Under the round-the-clock curfew, citizens who are not ""essential workers"" have been barred from leaving their homes since 14 January. Laila, 12, is in Beirut trying to study while her family works from home. ""We all have our own work to do and when we have meetings we hear each other. It can be a real distraction and stop you from finishing your work on time,"" she says. ""Sometimes I can't study well because I get stressed with all the work they're giving us. It is definitely not the same studying online as it is in the physical world."" For hairdresser Walid Kanaan this year has been ""extremely difficult psychologically and economically"". ""I own my shop but still I cannot afford it. I pay the workers' salary so I am really broke,"" says the 45-year-old. ""It is hitting hard. You can't go out at all or do anything. My wife works in a bank and she is also collapsing. She doesn't know if she will still have her job or not. ""We don't trust the government that if they bring a vaccine it will be safe to take it. We can only pray for God to protect us."" Read more stories from people in lockdown in Lebanonhere. All of the residents in Manchesterâs care homes for older people have received their first Covid-19 vaccinations, according to the city's council. People living in the city's 56 care homes were prioritised for the vaccine rollout - with NHS teams aiming to have completed the first jabs by 24 January. Carolyn Ball, general manager of Belong Morris Feinmann Care Village in Didsbury, said she was ""delighted"" all their residents had been vaccinated. âThis is the additional protection we have long been waiting for and itâs great to be starting the new year knowing that our residents are at reduced risk,"" she added.  Reality Check At the daily briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that, âunder this lockdown, it is illegal to travel abroad unless you have a reasonable excuseâ. Under Englandâs lockdown rules, people must only go abroad for âessential reasonsâ. These are the same as the ""reasonable excuses"" for domestic travel, including:  The police can stop people to ask if they have a âreasonable excuseâ to travel, but it is not the responsibility of airlines to check. A handful of jobs and professions are also exempt from some of the travel restrictions, if they are making the journey for work reasons -  including pilots and coach drivers. Read more here:What are the UK travel rules? The UK government has confirmed it is considering using hotels to quarantine people arriving in the UK from countries with dangerous variants of coronavirus. But as that was revealed, shares in airlines and travel companies fell sharply. Both Easyjet and British Airways' parent company, IAG, saw their shares fall more than 7%.

It passed the devastating milestone on Sunday morning, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US has had well over twice as many overall cases as the next highest country, India, which has over 10 million cases. Nearly 420,000 Americans have died from the virus, almost double that of Brazil, the second highest. On Friday, US president Joe Biden warned the worst could be yet to come: ""The virus is surging. We're 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000."" It is now a race between the virus and the vaccine, as the new administration aims for 100 million jabs in its first 100 days. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Conservative MPs, publicly and
privately, are pressing for a clearer route-map out of lockdown. And in some
cases, frustration is boiling over; one Tory MP told me earlier that they were
âlividâ about the ongoing situation with schools. Matt Hancock was never likely
to come out and bind the government to a timeline today. But at the Downing Street press conference, he did talk about
these four âfactorsâ that ministers will be looking at when it comes to lifting
restrictions. Namely - the death rate, hospitalisations, any new variants that
affect the pandemic and the success of the vaccine rollout. Ministers may feel they need some room for manoeuvre in these
uncertain times. But a number of their own backbenchers will likely keep trying
to pin down some detail. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The falling numbers of infections being reported and rising
rate of vaccination are incredibly promising - even if the drop in infections
reported on Monday may have been partly an artefact of fewer people coming
forward for a test because of the snow. But that does not offer any guarantees of a rapid lifting of
lockdown. What is concerning ministers though are the high numbers in
hospital. The number of new admissions seems to have plateaued - but
at a very high rate. Close to 4,000 patients a day are being admitted to
hospital. To put that in context, that is four times the total number
of all types of respiratory admissions the NHS would normally see in winter. It means the numbers in hospital are at nearly twice the
level they were at the peak in the spring during the first wave. With better treatments available, patients are spending
longer in hospital. So come mid February the pressures in hospital are likely to
be very high, leaving ministers little wriggle-room to relax restrictions. The big unknown, however, is what impact and how quickly
vaccination will have an effect on admissions. There is encouraging early news from Israel that
hospitalisation really start to drop three weeks after the first dose. If that is repeated here, the picture could quickly change. But until that happens the government - in the words of Health
Secretary Matt Hancock - is urging the country to hold its nerve. A couple have been fined for making a 130-mile (209km) round trip from Derbyshire to York for a roast dinner. North Yorkshire Police said the couple, who were in their 20s, told officers one of their mothers was going to cook lunch on Sunday, but ""let them down"". They decided to make the trip to York in search of a takeaway lunch instead. The pair were given Covid fixed penalty notices, with police saying: ""We know nobody does Yorkshire puddings better than us here in Yorkshire... but they're really not worth getting into trouble for."" Read the full storyhere.  As a winter Covid surge batters California, scientists wondered if the contagious UK variant had landed in their state. Two independent research groups - in Los Angeles and San Francisco - are now confirming the existence of a homegrown variant of the virus. Data suggests it appears to be spreading faster than any other variant in the state. Both sets of researchers confirmed they had been looking for the UK strain when they stumbled upon the new mutation. A single instance of the strain was detected back in July but it lay dormant for months. It has since exploded across the state, likely contributing to a brutal holiday season that has strained hospital capacity to its limits and doubled the state's death toll. California has now recorded over three million total cases and more than 37,000 deaths. The daily press conference was given by Health Secretary Matt Hancock. He was joined by Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, and Dr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England. Here's what they told us: Reducing wastage of vaccines when dealing with the pandemic is crucial, Matt Hancock says. Asked if he will publish detailed wastage rates, he says he is ""very happy"" to look into giving more details. That concludes today's Downing Street press conference. Dan O'Donoghue from the Press and Journal asks why Scotland has the lowest vaccination rate in the UK. He also wants to know, following recent polls on Scottish independence, if the case for the union is helped or hindered by the government's performance over the past year. Echoing his earlier statement at the press conference, Matt Hancock says the case for the union is ""undoubtedly strengthened"" and the pandemic response has shown ""we are stronger as one United Kingdom"". He says the vaccine rollout is a case in point and that, other than Israel and the UAE, the UK has the fastest vaccine rollout in the world. ""It shows what the United Kingdom can do when we pull together,"" he said. Hancock adds that colleagues in Scotland are ""working incredibly hard"" to roll out the vaccines and ""the NHS in Scotland is doing an absolutely terrific job"". ""If this pandemic has taught us anything, it's that we all rely on each other,"" he adds. Matt Hancock says the proportion of people declining vaccinations is ""very, very low"". The programme is ""going well"" and the uptake is ""getting to really high levels"", he adds. Getting a jab is ""the right thing"", Hancock says, calling the media ""absolutely brilliant"" for ""supporting the science on this one"". Jenny Harries adds that with more information, take-up increases. Communities are getting the ""real level of data"" needed to support people, she says. She said the steroid Dexamethasone should also still work ""perfectly"" as a treatment for new variants. Channel 5's question about possible enforced hotel quarantine for people arriving from aboard was a reference to the prime minister's confirmation earlier in the day that the government was considering such a move. Incoming travellers already have to show evidence of a recent negative coronavirus test. At present, all travellers must provide contact details and theirUK address,external. They can then travel - by public transport if necessary - to their home or to the place where they plan to self-isolate. Here's everything you need to know about the UK travel and quarantine rules. Andy Bell at Channel 5 asks if Matt Hancock believes the time has come for enforced hotel quarantine for anyone coming into the UK. The health secretary says it is ""incredibly important"" that ""we are cautious at the border"". He notes travel corridors have now been removed and that lockdown rules mean travel abroad is illegal without a reasonable excuse, for example medical reasons. He says it is right to take a ""precautionary"" approach while analysis is continuing around the world on the virus. Dr Harries is asked if it was wrong to say, earlier in the pandemic, that there was no point in controlling the people coming in to the UK once the virus was already here. She says once there was a significant infection rate, the proportion coming in through borders was very small. But now new variants are being identified, other measures need to be put in place.  Matt Hancock says new virus variants from South Africa and Brazil are in ""very small numbers"" in the UK at present. The government is using ""enhanced contact tracing"" to deal with these, he adds, to ensure people affected and their contacts self-isolate. Asked how effective vaccines are against new coronavirus variants, Hancock says there's a ""high degree of confidence"" it works with the one first detected in Kent. The ban on foreign travel for most people is because the government does not want more people arriving ""at risk"" of having other strains. Susan Hopkins says it's ""reassuring"" that the vaccines work with the Kent variant. She said work is starting on testing its effect on the South African strain.

"Bethany and her two children have been on a waiting list for more than a year There is a ""shocking"" lack of places for traveller families to live in England, according to a charity. Only 18 out of 251 registered traveller sites have any spaces available, research from Friends, Families and Travellers (FFT) suggests. It says the government must ""do more"" to identify land for the community to live on. The government says councils are ""best placed"" to assess the local need for permanent traveller sites. In October, FFT wrote to all local authorities and private registered site providers in England to ask how many pitches they had available. It received responses relating to 251 out of 266 traveller sites - which represented 3,482 permanent pitches and 304 transit pitches. A transit pitch is a short-term place where people can stay for a set period of usually up to three months. The research,externalfound: There were 13 permanent sites and five transit sites with available pitches There were 59 permanent pitches and 42 transit pitches available At least 1,696 households are on waiting lists for pitches on traveller sites Bethany says she's near the bottom of the waiting list for a pitch in her local area Bethany Rose, 26, and her two children have been on a waiting list for a pitch in West Sussex for more than a year. She is currently staying with her parents in their caravan on a registered traveller site. But this is against the rules of their tenancy contract and she will have to move out once the coronavirus pandemic is over. Bethany has a health condition which means she can often be paralysed from the waist down and she needs to be close to her mum who is her carer. ""It's frustrating, annoying, aggravating, I feel let down,"" she says. ""I'm disabled. I'm homeless and I have two kids. ""For anyone normally it would just be like, 'Boof, there you go, there's a property, go and live there'. But I can't do that. I can't even get a house, I can't buy a plot of land, I can't do anything."" Bethany and her children are currently living with her parents on a traveller site in West Sussex It's estimatedabout 1.1 million households,externalare on local authority housing waiting lists, but Bethany believes it would be easier for her to get a home if she wasn't a traveller. She says being a traveller is a huge part of her identity and she wants to live on a site so she can continue to be connected to her heritage. ""A whole community is there if you need something or something happens,"" she said. ""If you fall or you go to hospital, you can guarantee your neighbour will watch the kids until you come back. If you need a cup of sugar, you can just go round."" The research from FFT comes as MPs were due todebate a petition on Monday,externalagainst government proposals to criminalise trespassing. However, this has been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The new measures could see travellers facing a fine or prison if they set up unauthorised encampments - currently it's a civil offence. In aconsultation paper published in 2019,external, the Home Office said there had been ""long-standing concerns"" about the distress they caused to local communities. This video can not be played Sarah Tanner posted a video saying she was ""disgusted"" by mess left by travellers in Dorset In June 2020, residents in Dorset complained aboutmess left by travellers on a local park- which included a car being abandoned in the middle of a cricket pitch, rubbish dumped in green spaces and human waste deposited in the pond and lake. FFT says councils are failing to provide enough sites for travellers to live on. In January 2019, plans to spend Â£5m on new traveller pitches in Milton Keyneswere put on holdafter a ""heated"" meeting with local residents. Bethany believes councils are not doing more to provide extra sites because of discrimination towards travellers. ""They're building 50,000 new houses in West Sussex, not one of those places is having a site,"" she said. ""So you've got the Nimby (Not In My Back Yard) culture attached to that. ""For every 50 houses, they could put a site of five which is a whole little community that they can get used to and go, 'Yeah, OK, they're not as bad as people say.' ""That also means we're not pulling up the side of the roads. We're not being moved off. We're just trying to live like everyone else."" Milton Keynes Council changed its plan to build a new traveller site after listening to residents West Sussex County Council says when a vacancy comes up on a permanent site all those who have expressed an interest in that location are considered for the pitch. The FFT wants the government to reintroduce pitch targets and a statutory duty on local authorities to meet the assessed need for Gypsy and traveller sites. It also calls on the government to abandon its proposal to criminalise trespassing. Sarah Sweeney, policy and communications manager at FFT, said: ""It is deeply unfair that while the government is dramatically failing to identify enough land for Gypsy and traveller families to live on, the home secretary is working to create laws to imprison, fine and remove the homes of families living on roadside camps for the 'crime' of having nowhere else to go."" The Local Government Association says it wants the government to publish ""better data"" on the scale of unauthorised encampments and the availability of authorised sites to help councils in England meet their planning obligations. A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""Unauthorised encampments cause distress and disruption for many people across the country so it's right we are giving the police the powers they need to address this issue. ""Councils are best placed to assess the local need for permanent traveller sites and decide where they should be, and can apply for funding through our Shared Ownership and Affordable Homes Programme to help build them.""

"There are 37,899 people in hospital in the UK with coronavirus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock says, including 4,076 on ventilators Almost four-in-five of people aged 80 and over have been vaccinated, Hancock says The new variant of the virus first identified in South East England is spreading 30-70% faster than the original, he says There are ""early signs that the actions we are taking are working"", with the rise in case numbers slowing and falling in some areas, he adds Ministers are holding discussions about what tier system will replace the current lockdown once it is lifted, Hancock says A further 592 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, new daily figures show Schools reopening is a priority but nobody wants restrictions lifted so quickly while the rate of infection is still very high, the prime minister says Thanks for joining us today. We'll be wrapping up our live coverage shortly. Here are some of the main stories we've been covering this Monday:  We'll be back tomorrow. Today's live page has been brought to you by James Clarke, Alex Kleiderman, Victoria Lindrea, Cherry Wilson, Jennifer Meierhans, Lauren Turner, Justin Parkinson and Sam Cabral.   Whenever President Donald Trump spoke about his administration's Covid response, he was often flanked by two of the nation's top doctors - Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx. Now the duo are revealing just how difficult it was to work under him. Ina long interview with the New York Times,external, Dr Fauci - the chief infectious disease specialist in the country - said the then president would often tell him he was too negative. ""I always felt that if I did walk away, the skunk at the picnic would no longer be at the picnic,"" explained Dr Fauci. Often contradicting the administration, he said he could not bring himself to resign because there was far too much Covid denialism - including from within the White House. ""Even if I wasn't very effective in changing everybody's minds, the idea 
that they knew that nonsense could not be spouted without my pushing 
back on it, I felt was important."" Ina separate interview with CBS,external, Dr Birx - the White House's Covid task force coordinator - confirmed that there was a ""parallel set of data and graphics"" presented to the president that she wasn't privy to. Dr Birx has since retired from public service, but Dr Fauci has joined the Biden administration as the new president's chief medical adviser. Home schooling can be tough. It's difficult to concentrate, there's emotional exhaustion, boredom, a lack of motivation and it's really hard not going out to see friends. And that's just the parents. This winter lockdown is taking its toll on families, now struggling even more on the black ice of uncertainty as no-one can say when schools in England are going to reopen for most pupils again. ""There's a sense of fatigue,"" says Jacqueline Smallwood, who is at home with three secondary-school children. She says her own ""concentration levels have fallen dramatically"". ""It's so repetitive that it just makes you feel tired,"" she says of the latest lockdown and the ""silent struggle"" facing both parents and their children to try to get motivated. Sound familiar? Read more from other parents ""at the end of their tether"". People in Lebanon are living under one of the world's strictest lockdowns. Under the round-the-clock curfew, citizens who are not ""essential workers"" have been barred from leaving their homes since 14 January. Laila, 12, is in Beirut trying to study while her family works from home. ""We all have our own work to do and when we have meetings we hear each other. It can be a real distraction and stop you from finishing your work on time,"" she says. ""Sometimes I can't study well because I get stressed with all the work they're giving us. It is definitely not the same studying online as it is in the physical world."" For hairdresser Walid Kanaan this year has been ""extremely difficult psychologically and economically"". ""I own my shop but still I cannot afford it. I pay the workers' salary so I am really broke,"" says the 45-year-old. ""It is hitting hard. You can't go out at all or do anything. My wife works in a bank and she is also collapsing. She doesn't know if she will still have her job or not. ""We don't trust the government that if they bring a vaccine it will be safe to take it. We can only pray for God to protect us."" Read more stories from people in lockdown in Lebanonhere. All of the residents in Manchesterâs care homes for older people have received their first Covid-19 vaccinations, according to the city's council. People living in the city's 56 care homes were prioritised for the vaccine rollout - with NHS teams aiming to have completed the first jabs by 24 January. Carolyn Ball, general manager of Belong Morris Feinmann Care Village in Didsbury, said she was ""delighted"" all their residents had been vaccinated. âThis is the additional protection we have long been waiting for and itâs great to be starting the new year knowing that our residents are at reduced risk,"" she added.  Reality Check At the daily briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that, âunder this lockdown, it is illegal to travel abroad unless you have a reasonable excuseâ. Under Englandâs lockdown rules, people must only go abroad for âessential reasonsâ. These are the same as the ""reasonable excuses"" for domestic travel, including:  The police can stop people to ask if they have a âreasonable excuseâ to travel, but it is not the responsibility of airlines to check. A handful of jobs and professions are also exempt from some of the travel restrictions, if they are making the journey for work reasons -  including pilots and coach drivers. Read more here:What are the UK travel rules? The UK government has confirmed it is considering using hotels to quarantine people arriving in the UK from countries with dangerous variants of coronavirus. But as that was revealed, shares in airlines and travel companies fell sharply. Both Easyjet and British Airways' parent company, IAG, saw their shares fall more than 7%. Read more hereon the hotel quarantine plans which are going to be discussed. Barely one year after its first coronavirus case was detected, the US has now surpassed 25 million total infections. It passed the devastating milestone on Sunday morning, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US has had well over twice as many overall cases as the next highest country, India, which has over 10 million cases. Nearly 420,000 Americans have died from the virus, almost double that of Brazil, the second highest. On Friday, US president Joe Biden warned the worst could be yet to come: ""The virus is surging. We're 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000."" It is now a race between the virus and the vaccine, as the new administration aims for 100 million jabs in its first 100 days. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Conservative MPs, publicly and
privately, are pressing for a clearer route-map out of lockdown. And in some
cases, frustration is boiling over; one Tory MP told me earlier that they were
âlividâ about the ongoing situation with schools. Matt Hancock was never likely
to come out and bind the government to a timeline today. But at the Downing Street press conference, he did talk about
these four âfactorsâ that ministers will be looking at when it comes to lifting
restrictions. Namely - the death rate, hospitalisations, any new variants that
affect the pandemic and the success of the vaccine rollout. Ministers may feel they need some room for manoeuvre in these
uncertain times. But a number of their own backbenchers will likely keep trying
to pin down some detail. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The falling numbers of infections being reported and rising
rate of vaccination are incredibly promising - even if the drop in infections
reported on Monday may have been partly an artefact of fewer people coming
forward for a test because of the snow. But that does not offer any guarantees of a rapid lifting of
lockdown. What is concerning ministers though are the high numbers in
hospital. The number of new admissions seems to have plateaued - but
at a very high rate. Close to 4,000 patients a day are being admitted to
hospital. To put that in context, that is four times the total number
of all types of respiratory admissions the NHS would normally see in winter. It means the numbers in hospital are at nearly twice the
level they were at the peak in the spring during the first wave. With better treatments available, patients are spending
longer in hospital. So come mid February the pressures in hospital are likely to
be very high, leaving ministers little wriggle-room to relax restrictions. The big unknown, however, is what impact and how quickly
vaccination will have an effect on admissions. There is encouraging early news from Israel that
hospitalisation really start to drop three weeks after the first dose. If that is repeated here, the picture could quickly change. But until that happens the government - in the words of Health
Secretary Matt Hancock - is urging the country to hold its nerve. A couple have been fined for making a 130-mile (209km) round trip from Derbyshire to York for a roast dinner. North Yorkshire Police said the couple, who were in their 20s, told officers one of their mothers was going to cook lunch on Sunday, but ""let them down"". They decided to make the trip to York in search of a takeaway lunch instead. The pair were given Covid fixed penalty notices, with police saying: ""We know nobody does Yorkshire puddings better than us here in Yorkshire... but they're really not worth getting into trouble for."" Read the full storyhere.  As a winter Covid surge batters California, scientists wondered if the contagious UK variant had landed in their state. Two independent research groups - in Los Angeles and San Francisco - are now confirming the existence of a homegrown variant of the virus. Data suggests it appears to be spreading faster than any other variant in the state. Both sets of researchers confirmed they had been looking for the UK strain when they stumbled upon the new mutation. A single instance of the strain was detected back in July but it lay dormant for months. It has since exploded across the state, likely contributing to a brutal holiday season that has strained hospital capacity to its limits and doubled the state's death toll. California has now recorded over three million total cases and more than 37,000 deaths. The daily press conference was given by Health Secretary Matt Hancock. He was joined by Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, and Dr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England. Here's what they told us: Reducing wastage of vaccines when dealing with the pandemic is crucial, Matt Hancock says. Asked if he will publish detailed wastage rates, he says he is ""very happy"" to look into giving more details. That concludes today's Downing Street press conference. Dan O'Donoghue from the Press and Journal asks why Scotland has the lowest vaccination rate in the UK. He also wants to know, following recent polls on Scottish independence, if the case for the union is helped or hindered by the government's performance over the past year. Echoing his earlier statement at the press conference, Matt Hancock says the case for the union is ""undoubtedly strengthened"" and the pandemic response has shown ""we are stronger as one United Kingdom"". He says the vaccine rollout is a case in point and that, other than Israel and the UAE, the UK has the fastest vaccine rollout in the world. ""It shows what the United Kingdom can do when we pull together,"" he said. Hancock adds that colleagues in Scotland are ""working incredibly hard"" to roll out the vaccines and ""the NHS in Scotland is doing an absolutely terrific job"". ""If this pandemic has taught us anything, it's that we all rely on each other,"" he adds. Matt Hancock says the proportion of people declining vaccinations is ""very, very low"". The programme is ""going well"" and the uptake is ""getting to really high levels"", he adds. Getting a jab is ""the right thing"", Hancock says, calling the media ""absolutely brilliant"" for ""supporting the science on this one"". Jenny Harries adds that with more information, take-up increases. Communities are getting the ""real level of data"" needed to support people, she says. She said the steroid Dexamethasone should also still work ""perfectly"" as a treatment for new variants. Channel 5's question about possible enforced hotel quarantine for people arriving from aboard was a reference to the prime minister's confirmation earlier in the day that the government was considering such a move. Incoming travellers already have to show evidence of a recent negative coronavirus test. At present, all travellers must provide contact details and theirUK address,external. They can then travel - by public transport if necessary - to their home or to the place where they plan to self-isolate. Here's everything you need to know about the UK travel and quarantine rules. Andy Bell at Channel 5 asks if Matt Hancock believes the time has come for enforced hotel quarantine for anyone coming into the UK. The health secretary says it is ""incredibly important"" that ""we are cautious at the border"". He notes travel corridors have now been removed and that lockdown rules mean travel abroad is illegal without a reasonable excuse, for example medical reasons. He says it is right to take a ""precautionary"" approach while analysis is continuing around the world on the virus. Dr Harries is asked if it was wrong to say, earlier in the pandemic, that there was no point in controlling the people coming in to the UK once the virus was already here. She says once there was a significant infection rate, the proportion coming in through borders was very small. But now new variants are being identified, other measures need to be put in place.  Matt Hancock says new virus variants from South Africa and Brazil are in ""very small numbers"" in the UK at present. The government is using ""enhanced contact tracing"" to deal with these, he adds, to ensure people affected and their contacts self-isolate. Asked how effective vaccines are against new coronavirus variants, Hancock says there's a ""high degree of confidence"" it works with the one first detected in Kent. The ban on foreign travel for most people is because the government does not want more people arriving ""at risk"" of having other strains. Susan Hopkins says it's ""reassuring"" that the vaccines work with the Kent variant. She said work is starting on testing its effect on the South African strain. Jenny Harries says mutations are normal for viruses and the ""majority"" will not be ""a cause of concern"". It's unlikely that vaccines will not work, to some extent, on new strains, she adds.

"Some Barclaycard customers will see their minimum repayments rise from Tuesday, at a time when finances are already stretched owing to Covid and Christmas. The new requirements are tailored to each customer, although some may see a significant rise in demands. But the changes will also see charges for exceeding a credit limit scrapped. January is a pinch point for many in debt and borrowers are being urged to seek help if they are in trouble. Barclaycard signalled the changes to their pricing structures in November, although some borrowers may have missed the notice, which was titled ""changes to your terms and conditions"". Thenew repayment rates,externalwill affect those with Platinum, Initial, Freedom, Forward, Cashback, Littlewoods, Rewards and Hilton Honors cards, but not Premier or Woolwich cards. For cardholders who started using their cards in the last decade, the minimum repayment each month has been calculated as the highest of 2.25% of the full balance, 1% of the balance plus interest, or Â£5. This differed slightly for longer-standing customers. The new charges mean minimum repayments will be the highest of between 2% and 5% of the full balance, between 1% and 3% of the balance plus interest, or Â£5. Covid means UK 'sleep-walking into a debt crisis' Missed Klarna payments may soon hit credit scores This means some people could see the minimum repayment rise, although some other charges - such as the late payment fee - will be limited. The exact percentage depends on the customer and would have been outlined in the November message. A Barclaycard spokesman said: ""We are increasing minimum payments for some customers to help them pay off debt quicker and reduce the overall interest they pay. ""This is part of our ambition to ensure that no Barclaycard customer gets into persistent debt - where they pay more in interest and charges than reducing their debt and take a long time to pay this debt off - and is being put in place to support our customers."" Sara Williams, who writes theDebt Camel blog,external, said that the higher minimum payment may well come as a ""nasty shock"". ""January is always the tightest month for money for most people. December pay is often early, so the money has to stretchÂ further, and if you put any Christmas presents or expenses on your Barclaycard, this month's bill will be high anyway,"" she said.Â ""For people who were hardly managingÂ before, the increase to the minimum payments may tip the bill over into being unaffordable."" Debt charities had already warned that the coronavirus pandemic meant theÂ UK was ""sleepwalking into a debt crisis"". The government-backed Money and Pensions Service -which offers free guidance,external- said it was expecting a call about debt at least every four minutes throughout January. Barclaycard said the timing of the changes - which coincide with lockdown and many people on a reduced furlough income - was unintentional and had been signalled some time ago. Any borrowers who feel the new repayment levels are unaffordable are being asked to contact the company. More broadly, anyone struggling to make debt repayments of any kind is being urged to face their difficulties and seek help. ""Financial worries negatively affect our 'cognition', which are the thinking processes that support and maintain our mental health. When in a poor state, financial worries cause stress and our cognition fails,"" said Keiron Sparrowhawk, a cognition expert from the Being Well Group, which runs the MyCognition app. This could lead to depression and hasty, ill-thought-out decisions, he said. ""Together, depression and anxiety are distressing and disabling, causing us to spiral out of control and enter a pit of hell,"" he said. Open up to someone and talk about the problems Work out your debts by writing down everything you owe Pay debts in the right order, starting with priority bills and debts such as mortgage, rent and energy payments ahead of overdrafts, personal loans, credit cards and Buy Now Pay Later arrangements Avoid high-cost credit. It is better to shop around and consider more affordable options like credit unions Set a budget by writing down what your income is and list all your expenditure Seek professional help quickly if you are struggling with debt, as the sooner you act, the easier it will be to manage.

"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: 'Weâre throwing absolutely everything at it' Fewer than 2,000 young people have so far started new roles under the government's Â£2bn Kickstart jobs scheme, data shows. The programme, which launched in September, has created 120,000 temporary jobs to date. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC coronavirus restrictions were making it harder for more young people to get started. However, he expected the number to rise once restrictions are lifted. ""Obviously because of the lockdowns and restrictions, that hampers businesses' ability to bring people into work,"" said Mr Sunak, ""What we can look forward to, as the restrictions ease, is more of these young people starting those placements. ""But taking a step back, we announced this scheme first week of July, it went live the first week of September and here we are, just a few months later, with 120,000 jobs having being vetted, funded and created."" 'My new job is a godsend - I was giving up hope' Sunak unveiling 'kickstart jobs scheme' for 16-24s The Chancellor insisted that the government had moved at an ""enormous pace"" to set up the programme, which targets youths at risk of long-term unemployment. ""I've always said my priority through this crisis is to protect, support and create as many jobs as possible, and young people in particular have been at the forefront of my mind,"" said Mr Sunak. ""We know that they're most likely to work in affected sectors, they're twice as likely to be furloughed, and the ones leaving college are entering a really difficult labour market."" Youth unemployment rose to 14.5% between August to October 2020, with 597,000 people aged 16 to 24 unemployed, up from 11% in the same period in 2019. Latest data from the Department of Work Pensions shows that as of 15 January, 1,868 young people had begun their placements. Hayden Finlayson, recipient of a Kickstart work placement with Whistl in Bedford Hayden Finlayson, 24, is one of them. He was made redundant from a retail job last summer. Looking for work during the pandemic proved difficult: ""You start thinking about things - whether you're going to find work again."" He has secured a Kickstart placement at a Whistl distribution centre in Bedford, an opportunity for which he is grateful. ""I gave it a go. It's a new experience and I want to do new things,"" he said. ""[I'm learning] different skills every day, things I've never done before."" Businesses apply to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to create Kickstart places, which are then vetted for suitability. Young people aged between 16 and 24 who are on Universal Credit are matched to roles by their job centre work coaches. They are then interviewed by the prospective employer, which decides whether to take them on. For each successful placement, the government covers the National Minimum Wage for a six-month period, at 25 hours per week. A further Â£1,500 grant is available per placement to help cover setup costs and assist in the development of employability skills. The current Â£2bn budget allows for around 250,000 roles. FSB's Craig Beaumont says the decision to allow small firms offer placements through a faster, more direct process is four months late Following criticism from small businesses, firms who wish to create just a handful of roles will have the option of applying direct to the Department for Work and Pensions. Previously, small firms who wanted to create fewer than 30 Kickstart jobs had to group together, or use a ""gateway"" provider as an intermediary. More than 600 gateways have now been approved, but small businesses complained that they found the process slow and difficult. ""The decision should have been made in September,"" said Craig Beaumont, chief of external affairs at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). ""There is now a backlog of cases of people who've been appointed through intermediaries, who've not been able to access that work yet. So we need a real focus from the government to clear that."" Asked if the scheme would need extending because continuing restrictions could prevent its aims being achieved this year, Mr Sunak left the possibility open. Anna Szymanowska runs Fighter Shots, which makes ginger-based remedy drinks.  She is keen to create three digital marketing Kickstart roles as soon as possible. However, she says her application - which was done in a pool with other businesses - took a long time. Small business owner Anna Szymanowska would like to hire three young people for digital marketing roles ""It was a little bit lengthy, because the first time I heard of the scheme was July or August,"" she told the BBC. ""We applied within a month [of hearing about it], and just yesterday we received a contract to sign. So it was lengthy but otherwise well managed."" The Chancellor told the BBC that the changes hadn't been made earlier because Kickstart had been set up ""at speed"". He pointed out other interventions aimed at supporting young people's jobs, including investment in employment support schemes, training and apprenticeships. Tracy Fishwick is the managing director of Transform Lives Company, a social enterprise which helps people into work. She believes that the young people chosen to have Kickstart placements will be very important. ""The young people who really probably would already get a job with a little bit of help - we don't want all the Kickstart jobs going to those young people,"" said Ms Fishwick, who previously worked with the Future Jobs Fund - a scheme for young people created by Labour in 2009. ""We need to be able to put things in place to support those young people who were already unemployed before Covid.""

"Fashion retailer Boohoo has bought the Debenhams brand and website for Â£55m. However, it will not take on any of the firm's remaining 118 High Street stores or its workforce. Boohoo said it was a ""transformational deal"" and a ""huge step"". But the deal means that up to 12,000 jobs at the department store chain are set to go. The 242-year-old Debenhams chain is already in the process of closing down, after administrators failed to secure a rescue deal for the business. In a separate development,Asos says it is in ""exclusive"" talksto buy the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT brands out of administration. But the online retailer said it only wanted the brands, not their shops, suggesting any deal would cost jobs. The current owner of the brands, Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group, fell into administration last November putting 13,000 jobs at risk. A closing-down sale at 124 Debenhams stores began in December, as the administrators continued to seek offers for all or parts of the business. The company announced recently that six shops would not reopen after lockdown, including its flagship department store on London's Oxford Street. The administrators of Debenhams UK, FRP Advisory, said they had undertaken a ""thorough and robust process"" to achieve ""the best outcome for Debenhams' stakeholders"". ""This transaction will allow a new Debenhams-branded business to emerge under strong new ownership, including an online operation and the opportunity to secure an international franchise network that will operate under licence using the Debenhams name,"" they added. What went wrong at Debenhams? Five things you didn't know about Boohoo Asos frontrunner to buy Topshop and Miss Selfridge Debenhams pictured through the years Boohoo has already bought a number of High Street brands out of administration. It snapped up Oasis, Coast and Karen Millen, but not the associated stores. Its executive chairman, Mahmud Kamani, said: ""This is a transformational deal for the group, which allows us to capture the fantastic opportunity as ecommerce continues to grow. Our ambition is to create the UK's largest marketplace. ""Our acquisition of the Debenhams brand is strategically significant as it represents a huge step which accelerates our ambition to be a leader, not just in fashion ecommerce, but in new categories including beauty, sport and homeware."" Boohoo said Debenhams was expected to relaunch on Boohoo's web platform later this year. In the meantime, Debenhams will continue to operate its website for an agreed period. Boohoo's fast-fashion model has come under scrutiny Boohoo has recently come under fire over workers' pay and conditions and its ultra-low pricing. As well as facing questions about the environmental impact of its fast-fashion business model, there have been accusations of  widespread abuse of employment law at some of Boohoo's suppliers in Leicester. Investigations last year suggested workers were being paid below the minimum wage. After an independent review of the claims found a series of failings, Mr Kamani said last month that the firm was working to fix the problems, adding:""We will make a better Boohoo."" While online retailers have been whittling away at their High Street rivals for years, few could have predicted how quickly bricks-and-mortar stalwarts have collapsed. The pandemic has fatally undermined their already parlous finances. Businesses that appeared to have a chance of survival just a year ago have been wiped out and their brands bought by online players. The scale of the change is profound: when Debenhams listed on the stock exchange in 2011, investors valued it at Â£1.6bn. Boohoo, which was founded only in 2006, already has a stock market value of Â£4.4bn. Asos, a bit player two decades ago when Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group was riding high and toying with a bid for Marks & Spencer, is now valued by the stock market at Â£5bn. Neither Boohoo or Asos see any value in the Debenhams or Topshop High Street estates. Instead, they will concentrate on development of the brands and the associated customer data. This is bad news for the 19,000-odd people who work in the branches of Debenhams and Topshop, and will leave councils around the country wondering how they will fill town centres that were based on retail. But just as canny entrepreneurs and private equity companies are gearing up to buy struggling pub chains, in the hope of a recovery once lockdown restrictions are eased, so will some investors be wondering what next for the High Street. The British love affair with shopping will not end overnight and a well-placed punt now could have big rewards. Debenhams has struggled for years with falling profits and rising debts, as more shopping has moved online. It called in administrators twice in two years, most recently in April. However, its position became untenable during the coronavirus pandemic as non-essential retailers were forced to close for prolonged periods. The firm had already trimmed its store portfolio and cut about 6,500 jobs since May, as it struggled to stay afloat. Businessman Mike Ashley, who founded Sports Direct and also owns House of Fraser, had already made an offer for Debenhams after it was initially put up for sale in April. However, the takeover offer, thought to be in the region of Â£125m, was rejected as being too low. Meanwhile, one of House of Fraser's flagship outlets, the Jenners department store in Edinburgh, is to leave its Princes Street home after 183 years. It will close on 3 May with the loss of 200 jobs. The building's owner, Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, announced in November 2019 thathe intended to convert the site, replacing Jenners with a hotel, cafes, a rooftop restaurant and luxury shops. However, a spokesperson for Frasers Group said it had been ""unable to reach an agreement"" with Mr Povlsen and that the closure of Jenners would leave ""a vacant site for the foreseeable future with no immediate plans"".

"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: 'Weâre throwing absolutely everything at it' Fewer than 2,000 young people have so far started new roles under the government's Â£2bn Kickstart jobs scheme, data shows. The programme, which launched in September, has created 120,000 temporary jobs to date. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC coronavirus restrictions were making it harder for more young people to get started. However, he expected the number to rise once restrictions are lifted. ""Obviously because of the lockdowns and restrictions, that hampers businesses' ability to bring people into work,"" said Mr Sunak, ""What we can look forward to, as the restrictions ease, is more of these young people starting those placements. ""But taking a step back, we announced this scheme first week of July, it went live the first week of September and here we are, just a few months later, with 120,000 jobs having being vetted, funded and created."" 'My new job is a godsend - I was giving up hope' Sunak unveiling 'kickstart jobs scheme' for 16-24s The Chancellor insisted that the government had moved at an ""enormous pace"" to set up the programme, which targets youths at risk of long-term unemployment. ""I've always said my priority through this crisis is to protect, support and create as many jobs as possible, and young people in particular have been at the forefront of my mind,"" said Mr Sunak. ""We know that they're most likely to work in affected sectors, they're twice as likely to be furloughed, and the ones leaving college are entering a really difficult labour market."" Youth unemployment rose to 14.5% between August to October 2020, with 597,000 people aged 16 to 24 unemployed, up from 11% in the same period in 2019. Latest data from the Department of Work Pensions shows that as of 15 January, 1,868 young people had begun their placements. Hayden Finlayson, recipient of a Kickstart work placement with Whistl in Bedford Hayden Finlayson, 24, is one of them. He was made redundant from a retail job last summer. Looking for work during the pandemic proved difficult: ""You start thinking about things - whether you're going to find work again."" He has secured a Kickstart placement at a Whistl distribution centre in Bedford, an opportunity for which he is grateful. ""I gave it a go. It's a new experience and I want to do new things,"" he said. ""[I'm learning] different skills every day, things I've never done before."" Businesses apply to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to create Kickstart places, which are then vetted for suitability. Young people aged between 16 and 24 who are on Universal Credit are matched to roles by their job centre work coaches. They are then interviewed by the prospective employer, which decides whether to take them on. For each successful placement, the government covers the National Minimum Wage for a six-month period, at 25 hours per week. A further Â£1,500 grant is available per placement to help cover setup costs and assist in the development of employability skills. The current Â£2bn budget allows for around 250,000 roles. FSB's Craig Beaumont says the decision to allow small firms offer placements through a faster, more direct process is four months late Following criticism from small businesses, firms who wish to create just a handful of roles will have the option of applying direct to the Department for Work and Pensions. Previously, small firms who wanted to create fewer than 30 Kickstart jobs had to group together, or use a ""gateway"" provider as an intermediary. More than 600 gateways have now been approved, but small businesses complained that they found the process slow and difficult. ""The decision should have been made in September,"" said Craig Beaumont, chief of external affairs at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). ""There is now a backlog of cases of people who've been appointed through intermediaries, who've not been able to access that work yet. So we need a real focus from the government to clear that."" Asked if the scheme would need extending because continuing restrictions could prevent its aims being achieved this year, Mr Sunak left the possibility open. Anna Szymanowska runs Fighter Shots, which makes ginger-based remedy drinks.  She is keen to create three digital marketing Kickstart roles as soon as possible. However, she says her application - which was done in a pool with other businesses - took a long time. Small business owner Anna Szymanowska would like to hire three young people for digital marketing roles ""It was a little bit lengthy, because the first time I heard of the scheme was July or August,"" she told the BBC. ""We applied within a month [of hearing about it], and just yesterday we received a contract to sign. So it was lengthy but otherwise well managed."" The Chancellor told the BBC that the changes hadn't been made earlier because Kickstart had been set up ""at speed"". He pointed out other interventions aimed at supporting young people's jobs, including investment in employment support schemes, training and apprenticeships. Tracy Fishwick is the managing director of Transform Lives Company, a social enterprise which helps people into work. She believes that the young people chosen to have Kickstart placements will be very important. ""The young people who really probably would already get a job with a little bit of help - we don't want all the Kickstart jobs going to those young people,"" said Ms Fishwick, who previously worked with the Future Jobs Fund - a scheme for young people created by Labour in 2009. ""We need to be able to put things in place to support those young people who were already unemployed before Covid.""

"The public's trust in the way the UK is run is breaking down, former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown has warned. He said Covid-19 had exposed ""tensions"" between Whitehall and the nations and regions, who were often treated by the centre as if they were ""invisible"". Mr Brown is urging Boris Johnson to set up a commission to review how the country is governed and powers shared. But the PM said his focus was on the pandemic, stressing the benefits of the union could be ""seen everywhere"". Recent opinion polls have suggestedrising support for Scottish independenceandpotentially for a border vote in Northern Ireland. Mr Brown's intervention comes amid a looming clash between Mr Johnson and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who has demanded the UK agree to another Scottish independence referendum if the SNP wins a majority in May's Holyrood elections. SNP reveal 'roadmap' to another independence vote What's going on with Scottish independence? Border poll would be 'absolutely reckless' The Court of Session is hearing arguments about whether Holyrood can legislate to hold oneeven if the UK government continues to object. Writing inthe Daily Telegraph,external, Mr Brown -who advocates a federal system with more power for nations and regions- says the pandemic has ""brought to the surface tensions and grievances that have been simmering for years"" between Downing Street and the various parts of the UK. This video can not be played The Conservatives election win was not 'a signal that the country is at ease' warns Brown He points to ""bitter disputes"" over issues such as lockdown restrictions and furlough and said unless underlying tensions were resolved, the UK risked becoming a ""failed state"". In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today, he said at a time ""when all should be pulling together and intensifying co-operation across the UK"" there was division and claims by the leaders of Scotland and Wales and the English regions that they were not being properly consulted. Last year there wererows between the government and local authorities over coronavirus tiers, with the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, objecting to plans to put the region into the strictest level of restrictions. Mr Brown told Today that while he was ""confident"" that Scotland would still be part of the UK in ten years time, the way the UK was governed had to change. ""I think the public are fed up. I think in many ways, they feel they are being treated as second class citizens, particularly in the outlying areas, that they are invisible and forgotten."" ""Something has broken down in trust and has to be repaired."" Mr Brown is advising the Labour Party on its devolution strategy - but has also held talks with government ministers including Michael Gove in recent weeks. Government sources say they are focused on taking tangible steps to demonstrate the value of the UK. The idea of a fundamental review of the UK's power structures has been suggested as one possible way to counter support for Scottish independence ahead of May's Holyrood election. But a series of polls now suggest support for independence is higher than support for the union - and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will demand another referendum if, as seems likely, her party - the SNP - wins in May. He is calling on Boris Johnson to immediately set up a commission on democracy to review how the UK is governed, something the Conservatives promised in theirmanifesto before the last general election. In his Telegraph article, he suggests it would find that the UK needs a Forum of the Nations and Regions, citizens' assemblies, and a greater focus on the benefits of cooperation in areas such as the NHS and the armed forces. The current Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmeralso supports devolving more powers from Westminster but opposes another Scottish independence referendum. The SNP said last week thatthere would be a ""legal referendum"" after the pandemicif May's Holyrood election returned a pro-independence majority. Asked if he would stand in the way of this, Mr Johnson said what the British public wanted was for its political leaders to focus on beating coronavirus, adding that the advantages of the UK's four nations working together ""spoke for themselves"". ""I think people can see everywhere in the UK the visible benefits of our wonderful union,"" he said. ""A vaccine programme that is being rolled out by a National Health Service, a vaccine that was developed in labs in Oxford and is being administered by the British Army."" But the SNP said the Scottish people, not Westminster-based politicians, should decide the country's future. ""No amount of constitutional tinkering from Labour would protect Scotland from Brexit or the Tory power grab - only independence can do that,"" said Kirsten Oswald, the party's deputy Westminster leader. ""The Scottish people will see right through this attempt to deny their democratic right."" Apoll commissioned by the Sunday Times,externalin Northern Ireland found 51% of people wanted a referendum on Irish unity in the next five years. DUP leader and Northern Irish First Minister Arlene Foster said such a vote would be""absolutely reckless"". Numbers supporting Wales breaking away from the UK also appear to be rising. The pro-independence campaign group Yes Cymru has saidmembership swelled from 2,000 at the start of 2020 to more than 17,000. Plaid Cymru has also promised to holdan independence referendum if it wins the next Senedd election. Responding to Mr Brown's intervention, the party's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said: ""It's been clear for many years that the UK doesn't work for Wales - I'm glad that the Labour Party are starting to see that.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says teachers and pupils will be told âas much as we can, as soon as we canâ about reopening schools The government will tell teachers and parents when schools in England can reopen ""as soon as we can"", the prime minister has said. MPs have called on the government to set out a ""route map"" for reopening amid concerns for children's education. Boris Johnson said he understood why people wanted a timetable but he did not want to lift restrictions while the infection rate was ""still very high"". He would not guarantee schools would reopen before April's Easter break. Mr Johnson said: ""We've now got the R [reproduction rate] down below 1 across the whole of the country, that's a great achievement, we don't want to see a huge surge of infection just when we've got the vaccination programme going so well and people working so hard. ""I understand why people want to get a timetable from me today, what I can tell you is we'll tell you, tell parents, tell teachers as much as we can as soon as we can."" He said the government would be ""looking at the potential of relaxing some measures"" before mid-February, with Downing Street clarifying that this meant looking at the data to decide ""what we may or may not be able to ease from 15 February onwards"". A further 592 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test and another 22,195 cases have been recorded,according to Monday's government figures,external. 'Knackered and confused.' That's just the parents. Will schools reopen before Easter? How is the BBC helping home-schooling families? At Monday's Downing Street press briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said almost four in five of the UK's over-80s have had the vaccine, with nearly 6.6m people in total having had their first dose. But he said the NHS continues to be under ""intense pressure"", with Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, saying there are ""twice the number of people in hospital than we had in the first wave"" of the pandemic. Robert Halfon, chairman of the education select committee, told BBC Breakfast there was ""enormous uncertainty"" and called for the government to set out what the conditions needed to be for pupils to return to schools. The Conservative MP for Harlow suggested the government could consider tighter restrictions in other parts of society and the economy, in order to enable schools to open. Tory MPs were enraged by reports over the weekend that schools might not re-open fully until after the Easter holidays. Ministers say it's the progress of the pandemic that will determine their decision rather than a pre-agreed timetable. Yet whenever the government speaks, parents hear dates. Whether it's that the situation will be reviewed at half-term. Or a pledge to give two weeks' notice when classes will come back. MPs are now pushing for more transparency from the government about how they'll assess the data, and for some ideas between school being mostly closed or totally open. This issue is a perfect metaphor for the situation facing the entire country. Too much hope breeds disappointment, but living with uncertainty is just as hard. And you can come up with a plan but it might have to be junked if the virus has other ideas. Children's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield joined the call for clarity and told the BBC: ""Children are more withdrawn, they are really suffering in terms of isolation, their confidence levels are falling, and for some there are serious issues."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the government wanted to ""see all children back at the very earliest moment"". Schools in England have been closed to most pupils since the national lockdown began on 5 January due to high levels of Covid transmission in the community. There have been calls for teachers to be vaccinated sooner, although it is not clear if that would allow schools to reopen earlier. The majority of pupils in England are learning from home with schools only open to the children of key workers, vulnerable children and those who cannot learn at home Covid death rates among educational professionals are not ""statistically significantly different"" to those in the general population, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data, but secondary school teachers appeared to have an elevated risk compared particularly with people working in office-type jobs. Among secondary school teachers Covid death rates were 39.2 deaths per 100,000 males, compared with 31.4 for all males aged 20 to 64, and 21.2 per 100,000 females, compared with 16.8, but the ONS said these were ""not statistically significantly different than those of the same age and sex in the wider population"". Schools will remain closed inNorthern Ireland, Scotland and Walesuntil at least the February half-term - with the Welsh first minister saying it is""unlikely"" all pupils will return after the break. Gemma Cocker with her children Charlie and Lyla Gemma Cocker from Brighton is one of the many parents struggling to balance childcare, home learning and work. She says she's having to share her work laptop with her son, who has already missed learning time after the family moved home and did not have internet access. ""We didn't have any internet. The school said they had reached their limit so couldn't take him,"" she says. And because her children are young, she says: ""They're never just going to watch a classroom by themselves, you have to be with them the whole time."" Kitty Jones, 11, is in her last year of primary school and she says home learning is ""tricky"" because she is not used to using different remote platforms like Google Classroom and she wants to return ""as soon as possible"". ""I still think that I'm learning a bit, but I don't think I'm learning as much as I would be in person,"" she tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. Holly Agbukor, 18, is studying for her A-levels, says it is ""quite stressful"" learning at home, as it is a ""different environment, so it is not as easy to be fully present in the lessons"". But, she says, while is it ""difficult"" working at home, ""I don't think it is worth the cost of reintroducing the virus into society and making things worse overall"".

"Fully jabbed travellers arriving in the UK from Francehave to quarantine, because of the Beta variant. The government is concerned jabs may not work as well against the variant. French authorities say most cases are from the overseas territories of La Reunion and Mayotte, rather than mainland France. How have summer holiday rules changed? Your travel guide to seven Mediterranean countries Beta, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351, has some significant genetic changes that experts are studying. It was first identified in South Africa. All viruses, including the one that causes Covid-19, constantly mutate into new versions or variants. These tiny genetic changes happen as the virus makes new copies of itself to spread and thrive. Most are inconsequential, and a few can even be harmful to the virus's survival, but some variants can make the virus more infectious or threatening to the host - humans. How worrying are the Covid variants? Some of the changes Beta has undergone involve the virus's spike protein - the part that gains the virus entry into human cells. It is also the bit that vaccines are designed around, which is why experts are concerned about these particular mutations. Beta, along with a few other variants of coronavirus, such as Delta and Alpha, have been labelled ""variants of concern"". These have some worrying changes experts want to keep a very close eye on. Beta carries a mutation, called N501Y, which appears to make it more contagious or easy to spread. Another mutation, called E484K, could help the virus dodge a person's immune system, and may affect how well vaccines work. There is no evidence that the South Africa variant causes more serious illness for the vast majority of people. As with the original version, the risk is still highest for elderly people and those with significant underlying health conditions. When will I get a Covid vaccine? Which children are being vaccinated and why? Vaccines are designed around original Covid, rather than new variants. There is some evidence they are less effective at stopping Beta infections. But experts say they should still work to stop severe illness. Trials ofNovavax,external,Janssen,externaland theOxford/AstraZeneca vaccinesin South Africa suggest the variant can overcome some built-up immunity Another study,external, also in South Africa, found the AstraZeneca vaccine was only 10% effective against mild-to-moderate Beta infections Areal-world data study in Israel,external- not yet peer-reviewed - found some people who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine still caught Beta Lab results from Modernasuggest its shot works against the South Africa variant, although the immune response may not be as strong or prolonged Data on Moderna use in Qatar,externalsuggests two doses is more than 96% effective against symptomatic Covid caused by Beta Data from the Pfizer rollout in Qatar,external, suggests immunisation is 97% effective at stopping severe cases of Beta Even in the worst case scenario, vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked to provide a better match in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary. Atrial of a new version of the AstraZeneca vaccine,external, designed against Beta, has begun in the UK. Some of the other Covid vaccines are also being updated. The Beta variant has been identified in more than 50 countries around the world. So far, theUK has recorded just over 1,000 cases,externalof Beta. That's a tiny fraction of all Covid cases. Another variant, called Delta, currently makes up more than 99% of Covid seen in the UK. South Africa hasreported higher cases of Beta.,external Covid map: Where are cases the highest? When it was first identified in the UK, the government recommendedsurge testing in the communityin some regions to help stop the spread. A system of foreign travel restrictions has also been introduced to minimise the chance of UK travellers spreading Beta as well as other variants of concern. Although adults who were fully jabbed in the UKnow no longer need to quarantine on return from amber list countries, double vaccinated travellers returning to England and Wales from France will still have to self-isolate for ten days. They will also have to take two PCR tests to ensure they are not infectious. UK scientists are tracking variants, including Beta, to learn more and are providinggenomic sequencing help to other countries,externalso that they can do the same.

"Bethany and her two children have been on a waiting list for more than a year There is a ""shocking"" lack of places for traveller families to live in England, according to a charity. Only 18 out of 251 registered traveller sites have any spaces available, research from Friends, Families and Travellers (FFT) suggests. It says the government must ""do more"" to identify land for the community to live on. The government says councils are ""best placed"" to assess the local need for permanent traveller sites. In October, FFT wrote to all local authorities and private registered site providers in England to ask how many pitches they had available. It received responses relating to 251 out of 266 traveller sites - which represented 3,482 permanent pitches and 304 transit pitches. A transit pitch is a short-term place where people can stay for a set period of usually up to three months. The research,externalfound: There were 13 permanent sites and five transit sites with available pitches There were 59 permanent pitches and 42 transit pitches available At least 1,696 households are on waiting lists for pitches on traveller sites Bethany says she's near the bottom of the waiting list for a pitch in her local area Bethany Rose, 26, and her two children have been on a waiting list for a pitch in West Sussex for more than a year. She is currently staying with her parents in their caravan on a registered traveller site. But this is against the rules of their tenancy contract and she will have to move out once the coronavirus pandemic is over. Bethany has a health condition which means she can often be paralysed from the waist down and she needs to be close to her mum who is her carer. ""It's frustrating, annoying, aggravating, I feel let down,"" she says. ""I'm disabled. I'm homeless and I have two kids. ""For anyone normally it would just be like, 'Boof, there you go, there's a property, go and live there'. But I can't do that. I can't even get a house, I can't buy a plot of land, I can't do anything."" Bethany and her children are currently living with her parents on a traveller site in West Sussex It's estimatedabout 1.1 million households,externalare on local authority housing waiting lists, but Bethany believes it would be easier for her to get a home if she wasn't a traveller. She says being a traveller is a huge part of her identity and she wants to live on a site so she can continue to be connected to her heritage. ""A whole community is there if you need something or something happens,"" she said. ""If you fall or you go to hospital, you can guarantee your neighbour will watch the kids until you come back. If you need a cup of sugar, you can just go round."" The research from FFT comes as MPs were due todebate a petition on Monday,externalagainst government proposals to criminalise trespassing. However, this has been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The new measures could see travellers facing a fine or prison if they set up unauthorised encampments - currently it's a civil offence. In aconsultation paper published in 2019,external, the Home Office said there had been ""long-standing concerns"" about the distress they caused to local communities. This video can not be played Sarah Tanner posted a video saying she was ""disgusted"" by mess left by travellers in Dorset In June 2020, residents in Dorset complained aboutmess left by travellers on a local park- which included a car being abandoned in the middle of a cricket pitch, rubbish dumped in green spaces and human waste deposited in the pond and lake. FFT says councils are failing to provide enough sites for travellers to live on. In January 2019, plans to spend Â£5m on new traveller pitches in Milton Keyneswere put on holdafter a ""heated"" meeting with local residents. Bethany believes councils are not doing more to provide extra sites because of discrimination towards travellers. ""They're building 50,000 new houses in West Sussex, not one of those places is having a site,"" she said. ""So you've got the Nimby (Not In My Back Yard) culture attached to that. ""For every 50 houses, they could put a site of five which is a whole little community that they can get used to and go, 'Yeah, OK, they're not as bad as people say.' ""That also means we're not pulling up the side of the roads. We're not being moved off. We're just trying to live like everyone else."" Milton Keynes Council changed its plan to build a new traveller site after listening to residents West Sussex County Council says when a vacancy comes up on a permanent site all those who have expressed an interest in that location are considered for the pitch. The FFT wants the government to reintroduce pitch targets and a statutory duty on local authorities to meet the assessed need for Gypsy and traveller sites. It also calls on the government to abandon its proposal to criminalise trespassing. Sarah Sweeney, policy and communications manager at FFT, said: ""It is deeply unfair that while the government is dramatically failing to identify enough land for Gypsy and traveller families to live on, the home secretary is working to create laws to imprison, fine and remove the homes of families living on roadside camps for the 'crime' of having nowhere else to go."" The Local Government Association says it wants the government to publish ""better data"" on the scale of unauthorised encampments and the availability of authorised sites to help councils in England meet their planning obligations. A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""Unauthorised encampments cause distress and disruption for many people across the country so it's right we are giving the police the powers they need to address this issue. ""Councils are best placed to assess the local need for permanent traveller sites and decide where they should be, and can apply for funding through our Shared Ownership and Affordable Homes Programme to help build them.""
