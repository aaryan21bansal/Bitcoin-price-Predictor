"It is not clear why the BBC's Girmay Gebru was detained The BBC reporter in Ethiopia's conflict-hit region of Tigray has been detained by the military. Witnesses say Girmay Gebru, who works for BBC Tigrinya, was taken along with four other people from a cafÃ© in the regional capital, Mekelle. Mr Girmay is reported to have been taken to a military camp in Mekelle. The BBC is yet to establish the reason for his detention, but has expressed its concern to the Ethiopian authorities. A local journalist, Tamirat Yemane, and two translators - Alula Akalu and Fitsum Berhane, who were working for the Financial Times and the AFP news agency, respectively - have also been detained in recent days. US 'gravely concerned' about Ethiopia atrocities Tigray at risk of huge 'humanitarian disaster' Ethiopia's government has been fighting rebel forces in Tigray since November. After months of an effective media blackout since the start of the conflict in Tigray, the government granted access to some international media organisations last week. Both AFP and the Financial Times had received permission to cover the conflict. Eyewitnesses told the BBC the operation to detain Mr Girmay was carried out by soldiers in military uniform. A spokesperson for the BBC said: ""We have expressed our concern to the Ethiopian authorities and are awaiting their response."" This video can not be played What does the future hold for Ethiopia, and what challenges remain in the Tigray region? Fighting continues in Tigray despite the government declaring victory over the Tigray People's Liberation Front. Hundreds have been killed and tens of thousands displaced. There is international concern over growing reports of atrocities committed by all sides and the worsening humanitarian crisis, correspondents say. An official of Ethiopia's ruling party recently warned that measures would be taken against people they said were ""misleading international media"".

"This video can not be played The meteor lit up the sky over Somerset The hunt is on for meteorite fragments that are likely to have fallen to Earth over England on Sunday night. Many people across Northern Europe saw a fireball in the sky shortly before 22:00 GMT, and the streak of light was also caughton special cameras,external. Scientists think some pieces will have survived the intense heat of atmospheric entry and hit the ground. A computer model that analysed the camera data suggests the probable site of impact is just north of Cheltenham. ""We can track the fireball really well, but the 'black magic' starts when it goes dark - when the light goes out and it still has another 10-20km to reach the ground,"" explained Dr Ashley King from theUK Fireball Alliance (UKFAll),externaland London's Natural History Museum (NHM). ""Strong winds can blow the object off course of where you think it's going to land, and that's what we're working on now. But, yes, somewhere north of Cheltenham, out towards Stow-on-the-Wold,"" he told BBC News. Martian meteorite to head home to Red Planet Antarctic meteorites yield global bombardment rate The camera data indicates a favourable fall zone The fireball produced a sonic boom as it hurtled across the southern England sky. Eyewitness accounts describe the object breaking up into several defined streaks just before going dark. Any fragments that made it to the ground will be small, smaller than an orange, say, and are likely to be dark and shiny. Anyone who finds what they think might be a meteorite is asked to photograph it in situ, noting the GPS co-ordinates from a phone, if that's possible. The object should then be bagged without direct handling. And the absolute no-no: do not put a magnet near the object. This could destroy important information needed to study the rock. ""We've learned over the years that most meteorites carry a kind of intrinsic magnetic record within them from when they were in space,"" said Dr King. ""We can actually study that and learn about where these things came from and how they formed. But if you put a magnet on the object, it's a little bit like wiping your credit card with a magnet. We lose all of that information."" The object produced a sonic boom Some of the trajectory work from the camera data has already suggested the object originated in the outer asteroid belt, which is between Mars and Jupiter. ""Most of the asteroids further away from the Sun tend to be these carbonaceous type that have got water and volatile materials in them but until we actually get our hands on some fragments, we can't say for certain,"" Dr King told BBC News. Scientists from the UKFAll and meteorite experts from the universities of Glasgow and Manchester and the NHM are interested to hear from anyone who thinks they may have found something of interest. Even if you just have a photo or video of the event, the researchers requestyou upload and share it,external. Between 10 and 20 meteorites are estimated to fall to the ground in the UK each year, but it's rare that any fragments are actually picked up. The last recovered fall was in 1991 - the so called Glatton Meteorite, because it fell in the village of Glatton near Peterborough. Mr Arthur Pettifor was tending his onions in his garden when a 10cm rock fell into his hedge. Mr Pettifor would show off the Glatton Meteorite at the village fete LA fire chief warns of further destruction from high winds as 10 confirmed dead What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

"Nicolas Sarkozy appeared in court on Monday French ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy has been sentenced to three years in jail, two of them suspended, for corruption. He was convicted of trying to bribe a judge in 2014 - after he had left office - by suggesting he could secure a prestigious job for him in return for information about a separate case. Sarkozy, 66, is the first former French president to get a custodial sentence. His lawyer says he will appeal. Sarkozy will remain free during that process which could take years. In the ruling, Judge Christine MÃ©e said the conservative politician ""knew what [he] was doing was wrong"", adding that his actions and those of his lawyer had given the public ""a very bad image of justice"". The crimes were specified as influence-peddling and violation of professional secrecy. It is a legal landmark for post-war France. The only precedent was the trial of Sarkozy's predecessor Jacques Chirac, who got a two-year suspended sentence in 2011 for having arranged bogus jobs at Paris City Hall for allies when he was Paris mayor. Chirac died in 2019. If Sarkozy's appeal is unsuccessful, he could serve a year at home with an electronic tag, rather than go to prison. His wife, supermodel and singer Carla Bruni, reacted by describing the case as ""senseless persecution"", adding that ""the fight continued, and truth would come out"". Allow Instagram content?

Nicolas Sarkozy served one five-year term as president from 2007. He adopted tough anti-immigration policies and sought to reform France's economy during a presidency overshadowed by the global financial crisis. Critics nicknamed him ""bling-bling"", seeing his leadership style as too brash, celebrity-driven and hyperactive for a role steeped in tradition and grandeur. France's Nicolas Sarkozy: 'Bling' and legal woes His celebrity image was reinforced by his marriage to Bruni in 2008. In 2012 he lost his re-election bid to Socialist FranÃ§ois Hollande. Sarkozy began a much-publicised relationship with Carla Bruni after he took power in 2007 Since then he has been targeted by several criminal investigations. In 2017 he tried to make a political comeback, but failed as his centre-right Les RÃ©publicains party chose another presidential candidate instead. Sarkozy was on trial with two co-defendants, his lawyer Thierry Herzog and Gilbert Azibert, a senior judge. The case centred on phone conversations between Sarkozy and Herzog that were taped by police in 2014. Investigators were looking into claims that Sarkozy had accepted illicit payments from the L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt for his 2007 presidential campaign. The prosecution convinced the court that Sarkozy and Herzog had sought to bribe Azibert with a prestigious job in Monaco in return for information about that investigation. French media reported that Sarkozy was heard telling Herzog: ""I'll get him promoted, I'll help him."" The phone line police tapped was a secret number set up in a fictional name, Paul Bismuth, through which Sarkozy communicated with his lawyer. On Monday Herzog and Azibert were also sentenced to three years in jail, two of them suspended. Nicolas Sarkozy is no stranger to legal investigations - since he left the presidency he has been the object of half a dozen - but up until now his record sheet has been clean. There was plenty of mud, but none of it stuck. Half an hour in a courtroom in Paris's new Palais de Justice changed all that. Judge MÃ©e read out a verdict that spared nothing, and no-one. Sarkozy, Thierry Herzog and Gilbert Azibert all knew perfectly well what they were doing, she said. They were trading confidential information for professional favours. And that was corruption in any book. It is not the end of the affair, by any stretch. The appeal could take years. His team will continue to argue that the case rested on ill-gotten evidence - chance eavesdroppings on confidential phone-chats between a man and his lawyer. But from today Sarkozy cuts a different figure. Before he was the wronged ex-president, fighting back against a left-wing judicial cabal. Now he has been convicted in a court of law. He is due to go on trial next month over the so-called Bygmalion affair, in which he is accused of having overspent in his unsuccessful 2012 campaign. Prosecutors are also investigating claims that Sarkozy received funding for his 2007 campaign from Libya's then-leader Muammar Gaddafi. Sarkozy has already been cleared in connection with the Bettencourt case. He had said all investigations against him were politically motivated. Despite his legal woes he has remained popular in right-wing circles, a year away from another presidential election.

"A website that collates recipes from the internet has been taken down hours after it launched, following a backlash from food bloggers. Recipeasly said it wanted to ""fix online recipes"" by removing ""ads and life stories"" when users imported external links. But content creators criticised the platform for breaching copyright and accused it of ""stealing"" revenue. The website was removed after a deluge of complaints on social media. âWe're sorry,â a message on the homepage reads. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""We have nothing but respect and admiration for the time, money and effort that go into creating great recipes & websites. We don't want to minimise the results for all that hard work. ""We realise we're not demonstrating the huge respect we have for recipe creators. We missed the mark big time today and we're sorry."" The website says its aim is to remove âads, clutter and long pages of content (designed for the search engine rather than humans)â. A lot of food blogs contain text before the recipe, often writing about a personal connection to the meal or the history behind it. Many people responding to Recipeasly's launch on social media said it was a useful tool. âPlease donât bow to the criticism, this site is an answer to my prayers,â one tweet said. âWe all hate shifting through lifestyle guru stuff to see if we need one egg or two,â another wrote. However, food bloggers have complained that the stories accompanying recipes are relevant. Binny Shah-Patel says she shares recipes that have a personal connection to her late grandmother Binny Shah-Patel, food writer and creator of Binny's Food and Travel blog, said it took the âheart and soulâ out of recipes. âIf I shared a recipe that was inspired by something my grandmother fondly made for me growing up in Kenya, it is now one of the ways I remember my grandmother now that she has passed away, and I can't even go home because of Covid. âI would want others to know about the inspiration behind the recipe and what it means to me every time I make it and eat it, so that they too can appreciate it that much more and perhaps learn a little about my background and grandmother in the process.â Critics said the website was taking advertising revenue away from predominately female creators. Kacie Morgan says websites like Recipeasly could mean she loses money from her food blog âAs recipe development is one of the major services I offer, these platforms present a real threat to my income as they could be seen to undermine my work,â Kacie Morgan, food blogger at The Rare Welsh Bit, said. Money made from advertising on her blog was largely dependent on the number of people visiting the site each month, she added. âAds help me have a job that I can work around my condition and being a mum,â Jenna Farmer, who blogs about her experience with Crohn's disease, said. âThey're a way of supporting a blogger whose recipes you love, without having to spend a penny on a recipe book in the traditional way.""

Tom Redman, one of the creators of the platform, emphasised that Recipeasly had no revenue or profit, and that it drove blog traffic through links on the platform.

Recipes scraped off a website and republished without consent could be a breach of copyright, Mark Blunden, head of technology at law firm Boyes Turner, said. âIf someone has created a recipe and put it into writing, then like any other literary work it will automatically attract copyright protection. âImages are also the copyright of the creator, and reproducing them online without consent is a copyright infringement. âHowever, if someone were to adapt an existing recipe and change it sufficiently, it will be a fresh copyright work and non-infringing.""

"The report was written by a commission headed by ex-Google chief Eric Schmidt for use by President Biden and other lawmakers The US and its allies should reject calls for a global ban on AI-powered autonomous weapons systems, according to an official report commissioned for the American President and Congress. Itsays that artificial intelligence,externalwill ""compress decision time frames"" and require military responses humans cannot make quickly enough alone. And it warns Russia and China would be unlikely to keep to any such treaty. But critics claim the proposals risk driving an ""irresponsible"" arms race. ""This is a shocking and frightening report that could lead to the proliferation of AI weapons making decisions about who to kill,"" said Prof Noel Sharkey, spokesman for the Campaign To Stop Killer Robots. ""The most senior AI scientists on the planet have warned them about the consequences, and yet they continue. ""This will lead to grave violations of international law."" The report counters that if autonomous weapons systems have been properly tested and are authorised for use by a human commander, then they should be consistent with International Humanitarian Law. The National Security Commission on AI's members voted unanimously to pass the report The recommendations were made by the National Security Commission on AI - a body headed by ex-Google chief Eric Schmidt and ex-Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work, who served under Presidents Obama and Trump. Other members include Andy Jassy, Amazon's next chief executive, Google and Microsoft AI chiefs Dr Andrew Moore and Dr Eric Horvitz, and Oracle chief executive Safra Catz. Much of the 750-page report focuses on how to counter China's ambition to be a world leader in AI by 2030. It says that senior military leaders have warned the US could ""lose its military-technical superiority in the coming years"" if China leapfrogs it by adopting AI-enabled systems more quickly - for example by using swarming drones to attack the US Navy. The report suggests AI systems be used as part of future major war games exercises ""The DoD [Department of Defense] has long been hardware-oriented toward ships, planes, and tanks [and] is now trying to make the leap to a software-intensive enterprise,"" the report says. ""If our forces are not equipped with AI-enabled systems guided by new concepts that exceed those of their adversaries, they will be outmatched and paralysed by the complexity of battle."" The report predicts AI will transform ""all aspects of military affairs"", and talks of rival algorithms battling it out in the future. And while it warns that badly-designed AI systems could increase the risk of war, it adds that ""defending against AI-capable adversaries without employing AI is an invitation to disaster"". It does, however, draw the line at nuclear weapons, saying these should still require the explicit authorisation of the president. And it says the White House should press Moscow and Beijing to issue public commitments of their own over this matter. The US Army is already testing various robotic systems, but much of the AI proposed would be involved in planning and co-ordinating operations The commission began its review in March 2019 and this marks its final report. It says previous warnings about national security threats posed to the US by AI were ignored, but there is still ""a window"" to carry out proposed changes if President Biden and other politicians act with speed. But not all its proposals focus on the military, suggesting that the US's non-defence spending on AI-related research and development be doubled to reach $32bn (Â£23bn) a year by 2026. Other proposals include: creating a new body to help the president guide the US's wider AI policies relaxing immigration laws to help attract talent from abroad, including an effort to increase a ""brain drain"" from China creating a new university to train digitally-talented civil servants accelerating the adoption of new technologies by the US's intelligence agencies While the members of the commission serve in a personal capacity, many of the companies they work for have bid for Pentagon and other government AI contracts. These include a $10bn deal awarded to Microsoft,which Amazon is challenging in court. The report also focuses on the US's need to restrict China's ability to manufacture state-of-the-art computer chips. ""If a potential adversary bests the United States in semiconductors over the long term or suddenly cuts off US access to cutting-edge chips entirely, it could gain the upper hand in every domain of warfare,"" the report states. It advises that the US must keep at least two generations ahead of China's micro-electronics manufacturing capabilities. China has a growing chip industry, but it still relies on imports from abroad for the most advanced products To do this, it says the government needs to offer large tax credits to companies which build new chip fabrication plants on US soil. And it says export restrictions need to be put in place to prevent China being able to import the photolithography machines required to make the most advanced types of chips with the smallest transistors. This, it says, will require the co-operation of the governments of the Netherlands and Japan, whose companies specialise in these tools. In addition, the report says US firms that export chips to China should be compelled to certify they are not used to ""facilitate human rights abuses"", and should submit quarterly reports to the Department of Commerce listing all chip sales to China. This follows allegations that chips from American firms Intel and Nvidia were used to conduct mass surveillance against China's Uighur ethnic minority in its Xinjiang region. President Biden has already ordered a review of the US semiconductor industry, and last week pledged support for a $37bn plan by Congress to boost local output. A car industry chip shortage prompted President Biden to discuss the industry last week Minds are being focused by a current shortage of chips affecting the automobile industry. But China also views the matter as critical to its own ambitions, and earlier on Monday its Ministry of Industry and Information Technology promised to ""vigorously support""its own chip-makers.,external Beijing has previously said it wants to produce 70% of locally-used chips by 2025. China's semiconductor-makers have been seeking out second-hand photolithography equipment to do this,buying up as much as 90% of available stock, according to a report in Nikkei Asia.,external However, these older machines are not capable of producing the most advanced chips, which are prized for use in both the latest smartphones and other consumer gadgets, as well as military applications.

"Zoom founder Eric Yuan Zoom boss Eric Yuan, whose business exploded during the pandemic, says working from home is here to stay. The video conferencing company expects sales to rise more than 40% this year, reaching more than $3.7bn (Â£2.66bn). The forecast pushed shares in the company up more than 6% in after-hours trade in New York. Investors have been watching for clues as to how the firm would fare as more people get vaccinated and social distancing restrictions lift. Zoom said it did not expect growth to continue at the pace it enjoyed last year, but so far business remains strong. The firm's sales in the last three months of 2020 were up 370% compared to the same period in 2019, hitting $882.5m. ""The fourth quarter marked a strong finish to an unprecedented year for Zoom,"" company boss Eric Yuan said. ""As the world emerges from the pandemic, our work has only begun."" The pandemic, which prompted an abrupt shift to remote work for many businesses around the world, transformed Zoom into a household name practically overnight. The firm, which charges businesses for its remote meeting software in addition to more limited free use for the general public, saw sales soar 326% to $2.6bn in 2020. Profits jumped from just $21.7m in 2019 to $671.5m. This video can not be played ""I'm here live, I'm not a cat"" While some companies have started to ease staff back into the office, many others have said they expect that some of the increased flexibility introduced during the pandemic will linger. ""The future is here with the rise of remote and work from anywhere trends,"" Mr Yuan said in prepared remarks for investors. ""We recognize this new reality and are helping to empower our own employees and those of our customers to work and thrive in a distributed manner."" Susannah Streeter, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Zoom's fate would depend on how it manages to compete against firms such as Microsoft and Google, which have introduced similar features. ""Although it stole an early march on other players in the first few months of the crisis, it does now have much stiffer competition from the likes of Microsoft and Google who have significantly upped their game,"" she wrote in a research note. ""It may be that we have become so used to pandemic habits that we will stick with our virtual social lives, particularly for long distance friendships and work relationships. But just how large a slice of the live video pie Zoom manages to hang on to will depend on how it matches up to its powerful rivals.""

"Most of Yemen's population needs humanitarian assistance to survive Britain has drastically cut its aid to Yemen, which has been devastated by conflict for six years, saying the pandemic created ""a difficult financial context for us all"". The UK government said it would provide ""at least"" Â£87m ($120m) this year, down from Â£164m pledged last year. Aid officials have condemned the cut. The UN chief, AntÃ³nio Guterres, said reducing aid was a ""death sentence"". The situation in Yemen has been called the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The conflict began in late 2014, when rebels seized control of much of the west of the country and a Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched a military operation to restore President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi's rule. The conflict in 400 words The rise of the Houthi rebels Coronavirus aid loss 'harming Yemeni children' An estimated 20 million people - two-thirds of the Yemeni population - depend on humanitarian assistance. Some two million children are acutely malnourished. In addition to conflict, Yemen has seen a collapse of its health system, leaving it incapable of coping with the coronavirus pandemic. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told parliament that the UK remains ""as we have over the last five years, between the third and the fifth highest donor into Yemen"". It's true that the UK has consistently ranked in the top five sources of aid funding to Yemen, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which tracks humanitarian spending between countries. The UN database recorded more than $200m from the UK to the war torn country last year, the third highest amount behind Saudi Arabia ($459m) and the United States ($697m). Aid from all nations to Yemen has been falling in recent years though. It decreased from more than $5bn in 2018  to about $2bn in 2020, according to the UN. The cut in the UK's contribution was announced on Monday at a virtual donors' conference by Minister of State for the Middle East and North Africa James Cleverly. He said ""recent global challenges"" had ""meant a difficult financial context for us all"". Funding has fallen off in recent years, just as the pandemic has made needs more acute. This video can not be played Yemen: Death by war or pandemic Speaking at the event, UN officials warned that if the UN failed to meet its $3.85bn target for 2021, millions of Yemenis could face starvation. It is unclear how much has been raised so far. David Beasley, Executive Director of UN's World Food Programme, told the conference: ""We've got famine knocking on the door."" Mr Gurerres said that generous donations had averted a famine in 2018, but that ""today, reducing aid is a death sentence"". The US pledged an extra $191m at the event - bringing its total aid for Yemen to $350m this year. An earlier version of the story gave a higher figure (Â£214m) for the total amount donated by the UK in 2020, which was the pledge (Â£164m) made at the aid conference last year plus additional spending LA fire chief warns of further destruction from high winds as 10 confirmed dead What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

Its chief executive, Paul Reed, said: ""The Prime Minister has set out a road map and a 'no earlier than' date for festivals, and audiences have responded, demonstrating a huge appetite to be back in the fields this summer. ""But we need government interventions on insurance and VAT before the end of this month when festivals will need to decide whether they can commit to serious amounts of upfront capital.

"The three people who tested positive flew into Aberdeen airport from Brazil via Paris and London Heathrow An enhanced contact tracing effort is under way after the Brazilian variant of Covid-19 was detected in Scotland. Three Scottish residents tested positive for the new strain after flying into Aberdeen from Brazil, via Paris and London. National clinical director Professor Jason Leitch said they were oil workers who were returning to their families. Other passengers who were on the same British Airways flight from London on 29 January are now being contacted. Experts believe this variant (P1) - first detected in northern Brazil in January - could be more contagious. However Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said there was ""currently no reason to believe"" the variant was circulating in the community in Scotland. A total of 20 passengers who were on flight BA1312 have already been contacted, and Ms Freeman said work was under way to get in touch with others. Prof Leitch toldBBC Scotland's The Ninethat situation in Aberdeen had been ""well-handled"" by the individuals, their families and employer. Asked if he was concerned the north-east was a gateway to new variants via the oil industry, he said: ""It's certainly a part of the country we need to be concerned about"". Three other cases have also been detected in England, but they are not linked to the Scottish cases. Officials are still trying totrack down one of those who tested positivefor the new variant in England. The three travellers to Scotland had all tested negative for Covid-19 before leaving Brazil Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said the three Scottish travellers had arrived in Aberdeen in early February, beforenew rules on hotel quarantine,externalcame into force. She toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programmethey had isolated together for 10 days after arrival in accommodation provided by their employer. They tested positive while in isolation, having developed symptoms after arriving there. How worrying is the Brazil coronavirus variant? Ms Evans said that health protection specialists were now following up ""contacts of their contacts"" in an effort to ensure that any further cases were found quickly. Anyone traced will be offered a Covid-19 test. ""That's not standard procedure, that's going one stage further,"" she said. ""But of course they have been quarantined for 10 days in managed isolation for that period of time, so you would think that they wouldn't have many contacts to follow up. ""Nonetheless, that's an added precaution that's been taken by health protection specialists."" Prof Leitch, said it was the first time the Brazilian variant had been detected in Scotland, but told BBC Scotland there was ""no evidence"" of community spread. He said the three travellers had tested negative before leaving Brazil. ""The measures that were in place at the time of this were really quite rigorous,"" he said. ""These individuals self-isolated. They were from a high risk country, so they followed the instructions and there is no suggestion of any blame or concern about their behaviour. I think that's very important."" Prof Leitch added that ""enhanced"" contact tracing was necessary in this case because of concerns about the Brazil strain's resistance to immunity. ""The reason why we're worried scientifically is we're not absolutely certain that this version is amenable to the natural immunity some people already have and the artificial immunity we are creating with vaccination,"" he said. ""Everything we know says it's still very effective, but we just can't be sure yet because it hasn't been around long enough and the trials haven't completed."" Both the Scottish government and Public Health England said the variant had been designated ""of concern"" as it shared some important mutations with the variant first identified in South Africa - known as B.1.351. One of these mutations - called E484K - may help the virus evade parts of the immune system called antibodies. Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith said it was important to be ""vigilant"" for changes to the virus, with the vaccine programme placing greater pressure on it. He said: ""We must continue to suppress transmission to the lowest possible level - the more virus there is around, the more likely these mutations are to appear.""

Historically, a much higher proportion of black South Africans have lived in poverty. In the first half of the last decade, the proportion of black and coloured (theterm used in the country for people who are mixed-race) people in poverty increased, according to the government's own data.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock hails data which shows a single shot of the main UK Covid vaccines cuts hospitalisations by 80% Number of new cases is coming down, but rate of decline has slowed, he says, but number of hospitalisations falling faster The number of Covid patients aged over 80 admitted to intensive care in the UK has dropped to single figures in the last couple of weeks English health officials are tying to trace a person who tested positive for the Brazilian variant of Covid-19, but did not get their result Dr Hopkins says Public Health England needs to trace a passenger who was on Swiss flight LX318 on 12 February Six cases of the P1 coronavirus variant first detected in Brazil have been found in England and Scotland Passengers complain of queues of up to seven hours long at Heathrow Airport's border control African countries start mass Covid inoculation drives using vaccines supplied through a scheme set up to share doses fairly with poorer nations Edited by Vanessa Barford That's all from today's live page team - Ashitha Nagesh, Claire Heald, Jennifer Meierhans, Joseph Lee, Kate Whannel, Lauren Turner, Vanessa Barford and Victoria Lindrea. Have a good evening and we will be back with more updates tomorrow. Here is a brief round-up of the main developments today. During the coronavirus lockdowns last year, fitness apps such as Strava and Freeleticsrecorded an increasein people using them. But how should you get started? And what are some of the things you need to focus on? Radio 1 Newsbeat has been chatting to personal trainer Cara Meehan on the dos and don'ts of joining the world of runners. Her tips include to start slowly, fuel yourself properly and remember those all-important stretches. Read more here. The chair of the Transport Select Committee believes the introduction of vaccine passports is ""inevitable"" in light of the European Commission's announcement of an equivalent scheme. ""It just makes sense now to make sure it's workable and will include everything that's needed to give people confidence to fly again,"" Conservative MP Hugh Merriman told Radio 4's PM. He added that he hoped the UK would not  ""tag along"" to the EU scheme but ""play a really big lead"". ""We can do that because our vaccine programme puts us further ahead, so we should be right at the start of this exercise, along with the likes of Israel."" He said the goal was to end up with a standardised app ""that is recognised by all."" He added that he was""frustrated"" by recent images of long queues of passengers at Border Control at Heathrowairport and he had raised the issue of Border Control staff last year and been given assurances. ""If we start to increase the numbers who can fly, once the vaccination programme is rolled out, then we've got to make sure we get it right. ""That means staff at the airports and the apps we've been talking about."" Earlier former health secretary Jeremy Hunt said the discovery of six cases of the Brazilian P1 variant of the coronavirus in the UK showed the need for tighter controls. ""Absolutely we have got to look at what has gone wrong,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme. ""It shows that it needs to be tightened up still further because if we are going to protect the road map out of lockdown then the name of the game is going to be stop new variants coming in, some of which may end up being immune to the new vaccines,"" he says. ""Where we need to get to is a much, much more thorough combination of test and trace and genetic sequencing so we are not just testing the people who have been near someone who tested positive, but we also are working out where the original infection happened and which variant it is. You can only do that if you bring the cases right down."" However, Hunt - who now chairs the Commons Health and Social Care Committee - says the country was in a much better situation than it was last year. ""The fact that we are going to this trouble over one person who has gone missing says to me that we are in much better shape than we were three months ago, six months ago, where we wouldn't have been anywhere near that,"" he says. Israel's Supreme Court has banned the government from tracking the mobile phones of coronavirus carriers. The technology, developed by counter-terrorism agency Shin Bet, has been used on and off since March 2020 as part of efforts to curb the spread of the virus. It uses the locations of people with Covid to track others they have come into contact with. In its ruling today, the Supreme Court said it feared the surveillance technology - which was initially imposed as an emergency measure - is gradually becoming permanent, and that the government is heading down a ""slippery slope of using extreme and undemocratic means in the fight against the epidemic"". Deputy Health Minister Yoav Kisch later tweeted that the ruling was ""a crime against the health of Israeli citizens"". The government now has two weeks to stop using the technology. England's deputy chief medical officer said the latest scientific data had ""vindicated"" the UK's decision to give the AstraZeneca vaccine to older people. Some countries,such as Germanyand France, have refused to administer the vaccine to the over-65s because of a lack of testing data on older age groups. Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation ""took a view that it almost certainly would work"", after agreeing it was ""not immunologically plausible"" the vaccine would be effective among younger people but not older ones. ""The PHE (Public Health England) data have clearly vindicated that approach today,"" he said. ""I am not here to criticise other countries, but to say that I think in time the data emerging from our programme will speak for itself and other countries will doubtless be very interested in it."" Officials in Japan have asked China to stop carrying out anal swab tests on Japanese citizens who enter the country, saying people have complained that it caused them ""psychological distress"". China started carrying out anal swabs for Covid in January. The tests involve inserting a cotton swab 3-5cm (1.2-2.0 inches) into the anus and gently rotating it. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said they made the request through the embassy in Beijing, and noted that the use of anal swabs ""has not been confirmed anywhere else in the world"". China has yet to respond to the request, he added. Last week, Chinese officialsdenied that they had made US diplomats undergo anal testingafter US media reported that some had complained about the procedure. Read more about this story here The health secretary hailed new data highlighting the ability of the Covid vaccines to reduce serious illness - and fielded questions about the ongoing search for a missing case of the Brazil variant in the UK. About 26,000 police officers and 3,800 soldiers have been deployed in the Czech Republic to enforce new lockdown measures. The country is currently seeing the worst Covid surge in the world, with the highest per capita infection rate over the last week. Prime Minister Andrej Babis has warned that the healthcare system could collapse without the new lockdown restrictions, as a record number of Covid patients in the country are in a serious condition. Under the new rules, which are in place for three weeks, people are being confined to their home districts, and the two school year groups that were still attending in-person classes - pre-school and second grade - are switching to home learning. However, people who need to travel for work are exempt from the travel restrictions. Factories are also still open - a decision that Babis has faced criticism for. BBC Radio 5 Live Farzana Hussain says there is 'historical mistrust' around vaccines More than 20 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. But vaccine hesitancy is still a big issue in some communities. In the over 80s, 93% of white people have had the jab, compared to 76% of South Asian people and 61% of black
 people. GP Farzana Hussain told BBC Radio 5 Liveâs Naga Munchetty that ""for black Africans and Afro-Carribeans, it does seem to be a historical mistrust in the system"". ""For South Asians...there's
 a lot of myths around the vaccine containing animal products which doesn't help them if they want to comply with their faith, and also a real myth about infertility. Both of which are of course completely untrue,"" she said. Ima Miah is the CEO of
 the misinformation-tackling Asian Resource Centre (ARC) in Croydon. She told Naga that theyâve had to work hard to bust myths about the virus. ""There were myths around: Why did this happen? Where did this virus come from? Was it something intentional? Was it something targeted at the BAME people? Was it something to get rid of old people
 because they didn't matter?"" she said. Ima added that the distrust is stronger in certain communities because of the âdisproportionate impact on BAME
 communities in the first place"". Listen

""The president also raised the issue of Polish-Chinese cooperation in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, including the possibility of purchasing vaccines produced in China,"" aide Krzysztof Szczerski told the agency. Poland wouldn't be the first EU nation to buy Chinese vaccines before they're given EU approval. Last week, Hungary became the first country in the union to start using vaccines produced by Chinese state-owned company Sinopharm. Hungary also gave emergency approval to Russia's Sputnik V vaccine in January, and has already rolled it out - despite it not being approved by the EMA either. The EU has beencriticised for the slow pace of vaccinations in its member states. A boy cycles past a mural of Covid-19 virus There's been lots of talk today about the P1 Brazil variant after six cases were found in the UK. There have been concerns vaccines may not be as effective against this variant, but NHS England's Prof Stephen Powis said vaccines could be ""rapidly adapted"". Understanding how new variants of the coronavirus in Brazil,
South Africa and the UK are altering the behaviour of the virus will be crucial in our vaccine arms race against Covid-19. This is how new Covid-19 variants are changing the pandemic. Asked which step in the roadmap he is most concerned about, as children return to school on Monday, the health secretary says it's all about ""safe steps"". ""We have set out the tests precisely so we can be sure the data still allows for safe steps down the roadmap."" He adds he is ""highly confident""  the opening of schools on 8 March is ""the right thing to do"". Dr Hopkins says the slow strategy - and the five-week gaps between each measure - are needed ""to give time after each event to monitor the impact"" particularly on hospitalisations and deaths. Professor Van-Tam joins her in stating the importance of having time ""to consider the effect of each step before we move on"". He stresses the need to relax measures ""in a very long-term way."" He says instead of ""stuttering steps... I would rather take much slower, more pronounced steps that always go in one direction.""  Jill Lawless from Associated Press asks what Matt Hancock thinks of the digital ""green pass"" the EU is proposing to prove Covid-free travel and which steps of the roadmap he is most concerned about. Hancock says: ""This already exists because you need to have a test before you can travel to the UK...and the EU proposal is that certification includes whether you've had the vaccine and whether you've recently had the test. Therefore it's something that we are working with them and others on and it matters that we get the details of this right for international travel."" He says: ""The roadmap is designed to be able to see the data before we take each step and we've done it that way in order to be able to have the assurance that we are taking a cautious but irreversible path out of this pandemic."" Macer Hall from the Express asks if ""double masking"" is a good idea. He also asks how the UK will ensure people get the second vaccine dose. ""The more layers you have the better,"" replies Dr Hopkins, adding that the recommendation is for ""at least two layers and ideally three in a mask"". On the second question, Hancock says he hasn't seen reticence among the population to get their second jab. Prof Van-Tam emphasises the importance of getting the second dose saying there is a ""significant likelihood that a second dose will mature your immune response possibly make it broader, and almost certainly make it longer than just having a first dose"". Thomas Moore at Sky says there is a missing case of the P1 variant but we do not know who or where or whether they've self-isolated. He asks how such a concerning new variant has been allowed to slip through the net? He also asks Prof Jonathan Van-Tam to level with him over any prospect of a holiday abroad this summer when new variants are crossing our borders and there's still no vaccine with in-built universal protection against all strains of the virus. Matt Hancock says there's a high chance the identification of the sixth case came through the surge testing used in places where they were looking for other variants of concern. Without this huge surveillance we wouldn't know about it and about 30% of cases are being sequenced, he says. On holidays, Prof Van-Tam says ""we are still in a zone of great uncertainty about what the virus will do next"". Many of the vaccination programmes in Europe are running behind ours and whether we can go on holiday depends on what other countries will say and do in terms of foreign tourism, he says. ""There has to be great uncertainty at the moment,"" he says. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said people studying the new data should see that both vaccines are ""extremely effective"" after one dose. ""I absolutely hope that, right round the world, people study the data and understand that getting the Pfizer or AstraZeneca jab is the right thing to do - and it could save your life"". Matt Hancock has denied that delays in imposing quarantine on travellers to the UK has put people at risk. ""We had already put in place measures against people travelling from Brazil,"" he said, adding that the rules - self-isolating at home - had been followed by the five people detected. And the health secretary added that there was ""no evidence the sixth case did not follow those rules."" He said it showed the system that was in place had managed to control the spread so far, and he pointed to the stricter measures now in place. Professor Van-Tam was asked what impact the new data would have on our everyday lives, but said it was ""going to take time until we can apply the results in a more generalised way"". He said, ultimately, he expected vaccine to lower levels of disease across the country, to reduce the likelihood of infection among the older and more vulnerable. He added that those given the vaccine would be less likely to suffer ""severe consequences"" of Covid once vaccinated. ""The ratio of mild to severe cases should increase in favour of mild cases over time."" ""The problem isn't fixed yet, but we have identified how to fix it.""   The next question comes from ITV's Romilly Weeks who asks if the health secretary is reconsidering reopening schools in England given the presence of the Brazil variant in the UK. ""We do not think there is a need to change approach on schools because of the new variant,"" replies Hancock. ""Our goal is to contain transmission to these six people,"" he adds. Dr Susan Hopkins says the ONS and React studies have not found any P1 cases. The data is ""reassuring"" she says but adds ""we are still on guard"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"The three people who tested positive flew into Aberdeen airport from Brazil via Paris and London Heathrow An enhanced contact tracing effort is under way after the Brazilian variant of Covid-19 was detected in Scotland. Three Scottish residents tested positive for the new strain after flying into Aberdeen from Brazil, via Paris and London. National clinical director Professor Jason Leitch said they were oil workers who were returning to their families. Other passengers who were on the same British Airways flight from London on 29 January are now being contacted. Experts believe this variant (P1) - first detected in northern Brazil in January - could be more contagious. However Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said there was ""currently no reason to believe"" the variant was circulating in the community in Scotland. A total of 20 passengers who were on flight BA1312 have already been contacted, and Ms Freeman said work was under way to get in touch with others. Prof Leitch toldBBC Scotland's The Ninethat situation in Aberdeen had been ""well-handled"" by the individuals, their families and employer. Asked if he was concerned the north-east was a gateway to new variants via the oil industry, he said: ""It's certainly a part of the country we need to be concerned about"". Three other cases have also been detected in England, but they are not linked to the Scottish cases. Officials are still trying totrack down one of those who tested positivefor the new variant in England. The three travellers to Scotland had all tested negative for Covid-19 before leaving Brazil Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said the three Scottish travellers had arrived in Aberdeen in early February, beforenew rules on hotel quarantine,externalcame into force. She toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programmethey had isolated together for 10 days after arrival in accommodation provided by their employer. They tested positive while in isolation, having developed symptoms after arriving there. How worrying is the Brazil coronavirus variant? Ms Evans said that health protection specialists were now following up ""contacts of their contacts"" in an effort to ensure that any further cases were found quickly. Anyone traced will be offered a Covid-19 test. ""That's not standard procedure, that's going one stage further,"" she said. ""But of course they have been quarantined for 10 days in managed isolation for that period of time, so you would think that they wouldn't have many contacts to follow up. ""Nonetheless, that's an added precaution that's been taken by health protection specialists."" Prof Leitch, said it was the first time the Brazilian variant had been detected in Scotland, but told BBC Scotland there was ""no evidence"" of community spread. He said the three travellers had tested negative before leaving Brazil. ""The measures that were in place at the time of this were really quite rigorous,"" he said. ""These individuals self-isolated. They were from a high risk country, so they followed the instructions and there is no suggestion of any blame or concern about their behaviour. I think that's very important."" Prof Leitch added that ""enhanced"" contact tracing was necessary in this case because of concerns about the Brazil strain's resistance to immunity. ""The reason why we're worried scientifically is we're not absolutely certain that this version is amenable to the natural immunity some people already have and the artificial immunity we are creating with vaccination,"" he said. ""Everything we know says it's still very effective, but we just can't be sure yet because it hasn't been around long enough and the trials haven't completed."" Both the Scottish government and Public Health England said the variant had been designated ""of concern"" as it shared some important mutations with the variant first identified in South Africa - known as B.1.351. One of these mutations - called E484K - may help the virus evade parts of the immune system called antibodies. Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith said it was important to be ""vigilant"" for changes to the virus, with the vaccine programme placing greater pressure on it. He said: ""We must continue to suppress transmission to the lowest possible level - the more virus there is around, the more likely these mutations are to appear.""

"Tomahawk has restaurants in Yorkshire, the north east of England and London A restaurant chain has asked furloughed employees to loan the firm part of their wages or possibly face the sack, a union claims. Tomahawk Steakhouse wants staff to sign an agreement to lend 10% of their pay to cover pension and national insurance contributions, the GMB Union says. Staff who refuse have been told their ""suitability for the role will have to be reviewed"", it is claimed. Tomahawk has denied the claim staff were told they might lose their job. More stories from around Yorkshire In a letter to staff seen by the BBC, Tomahawk, which has restaurants in Yorkshire and the north east of England and recently opened a branch in London, says it has a ""short-term cash flow issue and it requires your help and support"". It says that as it must make the National Insurance and pension payments itself the ""only viable alternative is to ask for your agreement to a loan arrangement"". It adds that the interest-free loan will be repaid ""once the lockdown is eased sufficiently for the company to trade"". GMB regional secretary Neil Derrick said it was an ""abuse of the furlough scheme"" GMB regional secretary Neil Derrick said: ""It's never been easier or cheaper for businesses to borrow money than it is at the moment during the pandemic, but this business, Tomahawk, want it for free and they have solved their cash flow problem by giving a cash flow problem to their staff. ""It stinks and we think it is an abuse of the furlough scheme, we think it is an abuse of the job retention scheme and we've asked HMRC to investigate. ""Staff have been told that if they do not agree to the loan agreement their suitability for the role will have to be reviewed, and we all know what that means, that's a threat of dismissal."" Tomahawk has branches in places including York, Middlesbrough, Beverley, Newcastle, Durham and Hoxton, in east London. One member of staff, who did not want to be identified, said employees had been told about the proposal via video call. ""I logged on to the meeting and they explained that we would have to sign a new contract,"" they said. ""They said if you don't sign it we will have to see if this job's right for you. ""It made me very angry. Everybody is already worried about money, but then to be taking more off us for the company when the company has just opened a new restaurant in London, surely they must have money behind them rather than just relying on staff to give them a loan."" Rachael Maskell MP wrote to the Treasury to raise the matter Labour MP for York Central Rachael Maskell has described the company's behaviour as ""disgraceful"". She said: ""If it isn't illegal it certainly is immoral and it is certainly punitive to the staff that they employ."" In a response to a written question tabled by Ms Maskell,external, Treasury Minister Jesse Norman said employers are required to pay staff ""all the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) grant they receive from HMRC to cover 80% of wages"" and ""cannot enter into any transaction with the worker which reduces the wages below the amount claimed"". A spokesperson for Tomahawk said: ""At no point has Tomahawk Steakhouse suggested that members of staff would be sacked if they did not sign a loan agreement."" As with the rest of this hospitality industry, they said they had faced a ""challenging year"" but that the company's priority was to ""protect our people and our business"". They said since putting the proposal forward ""every single employee chose to sign up to this agreement."" A spokesman for HMRC said it would ""support any taxpayer in financial distress as a result of Covid-19 and we would urge any employer that may struggle to pay its outstanding tax liabilities to contact us as soon as possible."" He encouraged anyone concerned their employer ""might be abusing the scheme"" to contact HMRC. Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Reporters were gathered outside Barcelona's offices as they were searched by police on Monday Catalan police say they have made four arrests after searching the offices of Spanish side Barcelona. The identity of those involved have not yet been confirmed by police, who said their investigation is continuing. The police operation was conducted on Monday after an investigation into financial issues at Barcelona. Those issues are thought to be related to the 'Barcagate' scandal in 2020 when the club denied hiring a firmto attack their own players on social media. The club's presidential elections take place on Sunday after their previous president,Josep Maria Bartomeu, announced his resignation in October. According to Spanish media reports, Bartomeu is among those arrested - although police have not confirmed this. In a statement, Barcelonasaid,externalthe police searches related to the ""contacting of monitoring services on social networks"". ""FC Barcelona have offered up their full collaboration to the legal and police authorities to help make clear facts which are subject to investigation,"" the club said. ""The information and documentation requested by the judicial police force relate strictly to the facts relative to this case. ""FC Barcelona expresses its utmost respect for the judicial process in place and for the principle of presumed innocence for the people affected within the remit of this investigation."" Police said they also searched four other properties as part of their investigation, ""which has been going on for almost a year"". Barcelona: Six board members resign and criticise club Andy West, Barcelona-based football writer The idea that one of the world's most prestigious football clubs would hire a social media company to run an undercover smear campaign against its own players and their families seems far-fetched beyond belief. But considering the battering that Barca's reputation took under former president Josep Maria Bartomeu, it's perhaps almost a logical development. This story has been rumbling around for more than a year, and was one of the sources of a deep rift between the old board and the playing squad that led captain Lionel Messi to launch an aborted attempt to quit the Nou Camp last summer, and ultimately led to Bartomeu's overdue resignation. Perhaps the saddest thing is that nobody around Barcelona would be particularly surprised if the accusations proved to be accurate. The timing of Monday's police action is ironic, coming just a few days before the disgraced Bartomeu's successor is anointed in the presidential elections. Whoever wins that vote of the club's members, Monday's news makes it painfully clear that, in addition to rebuilding a world-class team on the field of play, the task of restoring Barca's ruined reputation for being 'more than a club' is equally enormous.

"People are keen to return to the office because working from home has left many ""fatigued"", says a boss at Britain's biggest office and retail complex. Howard Dawber, head of strategy at Canary Wharf Group, said people will still want to divide time between the workplace and home. But they are missing office and city-centre life, he told the BBC. The Canary Wharf financial complex, in London, has only about 6,000 people on site, against 100,000 pre-Covid. Canary Wharf Group is the developer behind roughly 7.5 million square feet of office space and would stand to benefit financially if there is a surge in demand once lockdown restrictions ease. But Mr Dawber argued on the BBC's Today programme that people will be eager to get back in the office after so long away from the workplace. ""We've got to the point where there is a lot of fatigue out there,"" he said. ""Working from home for the first couple of months of last year when the sun was shining and people were enjoying perhaps a more flexible environment, there was a sense that this was going to be a short-term process. ""I think now people are really missing that opportunity to collaborate with and just see their friends in the office, to get your hair cut, to go and get a good coffee at lunchtime, and to do all the life admin things you can do in a city centre."" In the government'sroadmap for ending coronavirus restrictions,external, it recommends that people in England continue to work from home where possible It is hoped, however, that all legal limits on social contact can be removed from 21 June. What's the roadmap for lifting lockdown? Around 6,000 people are currently working at Canary Wharf compared to a pre-Covid 100,000 While Mr Dawber said Canary Wharf expects occupancy levels to return to where they were before the pandemic, the increase will be gradual and people will still want to work from home on some days. ""I think it is going to be more socially acceptable for people to take the occasional day working from home,"" he said. ""So it may well be that people have a desk at Canary Wharf but some people will choose to work at home one day a week or a couple of days a month and that's a good thing."" Some companies expect home working to continue once coronavirus restrictions have been lifted. Lloyds Banking Group is set to reduce its office space by 20% over two years after a staff survey found that nearly 80% wanted to work at home for at least three days a week. However, others such as investment bankGoldman Sachs have rejected remote working as the ""new normal"", with chairman and chief executive, David Solomon, calling it an ""aberration"". Last month, Barclays' chief executive Jes Staley said that working from home was ""not sustainable"". At a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum, he said: ""It will increasingly be a challenge to maintain the culture and collaboration that these large financial institutions seek to have and should have.""

"Nicolas Sarkozy appeared in court on Monday French ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy has been sentenced to three years in jail, two of them suspended, for corruption. He was convicted of trying to bribe a judge in 2014 - after he had left office - by suggesting he could secure a prestigious job for him in return for information about a separate case. Sarkozy, 66, is the first former French president to get a custodial sentence. His lawyer says he will appeal. Sarkozy will remain free during that process which could take years. In the ruling, Judge Christine MÃ©e said the conservative politician ""knew what [he] was doing was wrong"", adding that his actions and those of his lawyer had given the public ""a very bad image of justice"". The crimes were specified as influence-peddling and violation of professional secrecy. It is a legal landmark for post-war France. The only precedent was the trial of Sarkozy's predecessor Jacques Chirac, who got a two-year suspended sentence in 2011 for having arranged bogus jobs at Paris City Hall for allies when he was Paris mayor. Chirac died in 2019. If Sarkozy's appeal is unsuccessful, he could serve a year at home with an electronic tag, rather than go to prison. His wife, supermodel and singer Carla Bruni, reacted by describing the case as ""senseless persecution"", adding that ""the fight continued, and truth would come out"". Allow Instagram content?

Nicolas Sarkozy served one five-year term as president from 2007. He adopted tough anti-immigration policies and sought to reform France's economy during a presidency overshadowed by the global financial crisis. Critics nicknamed him ""bling-bling"", seeing his leadership style as too brash, celebrity-driven and hyperactive for a role steeped in tradition and grandeur. France's Nicolas Sarkozy: 'Bling' and legal woes His celebrity image was reinforced by his marriage to Bruni in 2008. In 2012 he lost his re-election bid to Socialist FranÃ§ois Hollande. Sarkozy began a much-publicised relationship with Carla Bruni after he took power in 2007 Since then he has been targeted by several criminal investigations. In 2017 he tried to make a political comeback, but failed as his centre-right Les RÃ©publicains party chose another presidential candidate instead. Sarkozy was on trial with two co-defendants, his lawyer Thierry Herzog and Gilbert Azibert, a senior judge. The case centred on phone conversations between Sarkozy and Herzog that were taped by police in 2014. Investigators were looking into claims that Sarkozy had accepted illicit payments from the L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt for his 2007 presidential campaign. The prosecution convinced the court that Sarkozy and Herzog had sought to bribe Azibert with a prestigious job in Monaco in return for information about that investigation. French media reported that Sarkozy was heard telling Herzog: ""I'll get him promoted, I'll help him."" The phone line police tapped was a secret number set up in a fictional name, Paul Bismuth, through which Sarkozy communicated with his lawyer. On Monday Herzog and Azibert were also sentenced to three years in jail, two of them suspended. Nicolas Sarkozy is no stranger to legal investigations - since he left the presidency he has been the object of half a dozen - but up until now his record sheet has been clean. There was plenty of mud, but none of it stuck. Half an hour in a courtroom in Paris's new Palais de Justice changed all that. Judge MÃ©e read out a verdict that spared nothing, and no-one. Sarkozy, Thierry Herzog and Gilbert Azibert all knew perfectly well what they were doing, she said. They were trading confidential information for professional favours. And that was corruption in any book. It is not the end of the affair, by any stretch. The appeal could take years. His team will continue to argue that the case rested on ill-gotten evidence - chance eavesdroppings on confidential phone-chats between a man and his lawyer. But from today Sarkozy cuts a different figure. Before he was the wronged ex-president, fighting back against a left-wing judicial cabal. Now he has been convicted in a court of law. He is due to go on trial next month over the so-called Bygmalion affair, in which he is accused of having overspent in his unsuccessful 2012 campaign. Prosecutors are also investigating claims that Sarkozy received funding for his 2007 campaign from Libya's then-leader Muammar Gaddafi. Sarkozy has already been cleared in connection with the Bettencourt case. He had said all investigations against him were politically motivated. Despite his legal woes he has remained popular in right-wing circles, a year away from another presidential election.

Around 6,000 people are currently working at Canary Wharf compared to a pre-Covid 100,000 While Mr Dawber said Canary Wharf expects occupancy levels to return to where they were before the pandemic, the increase will be gradual and people will still want to work from home on some days. ""I think it is going to be more socially acceptable for people to take the occasional day working from home,"" he said. ""So it may well be that people have a desk at Canary Wharf but some people will choose to work at home one day a week or a couple of days a month and that's a good thing."" Some companies expect home working to continue once coronavirus restrictions have been lifted. Lloyds Banking Group is set to reduce its office space by 20% over two years after a staff survey found that nearly 80% wanted to work at home for at least three days a week. However, others such as investment bankGoldman Sachs have rejected remote working as the ""new normal"", with chairman and chief executive, David Solomon, calling it an ""aberration"". Last month, Barclays' chief executive Jes Staley said that working from home was ""not sustainable"". At a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum, he said: ""It will increasingly be a challenge to maintain the culture and collaboration that these large financial institutions seek to have and should have.""

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock hails data which shows a single shot of the main UK Covid vaccines cuts hospitalisations by 80% Number of new cases is coming down, but rate of decline has slowed, he says, but number of hospitalisations falling faster The number of Covid patients aged over 80 admitted to intensive care in the UK has dropped to single figures in the last couple of weeks English health officials are tying to trace a person who tested positive for the Brazilian variant of Covid-19, but did not get their result Dr Hopkins says Public Health England needs to trace a passenger who was on Swiss flight LX318 on 12 February Six cases of the P1 coronavirus variant first detected in Brazil have been found in England and Scotland Passengers complain of queues of up to seven hours long at Heathrow Airport's border control African countries start mass Covid inoculation drives using vaccines supplied through a scheme set up to share doses fairly with poorer nations Edited by Vanessa Barford That's all from today's live page team - Ashitha Nagesh, Claire Heald, Jennifer Meierhans, Joseph Lee, Kate Whannel, Lauren Turner, Vanessa Barford and Victoria Lindrea. Have a good evening and we will be back with more updates tomorrow. Here is a brief round-up of the main developments today. During the coronavirus lockdowns last year, fitness apps such as Strava and Freeleticsrecorded an increasein people using them. But how should you get started? And what are some of the things you need to focus on? Radio 1 Newsbeat has been chatting to personal trainer Cara Meehan on the dos and don'ts of joining the world of runners. Her tips include to start slowly, fuel yourself properly and remember those all-important stretches. Read more here. The chair of the Transport Select Committee believes the introduction of vaccine passports is ""inevitable"" in light of the European Commission's announcement of an equivalent scheme. ""It just makes sense now to make sure it's workable and will include everything that's needed to give people confidence to fly again,"" Conservative MP Hugh Merriman told Radio 4's PM. He added that he hoped the UK would not  ""tag along"" to the EU scheme but ""play a really big lead"". ""We can do that because our vaccine programme puts us further ahead, so we should be right at the start of this exercise, along with the likes of Israel."" He said the goal was to end up with a standardised app ""that is recognised by all."" He added that he was""frustrated"" by recent images of long queues of passengers at Border Control at Heathrowairport and he had raised the issue of Border Control staff last year and been given assurances. ""If we start to increase the numbers who can fly, once the vaccination programme is rolled out, then we've got to make sure we get it right. ""That means staff at the airports and the apps we've been talking about."" Earlier former health secretary Jeremy Hunt said the discovery of six cases of the Brazilian P1 variant of the coronavirus in the UK showed the need for tighter controls. ""Absolutely we have got to look at what has gone wrong,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme. ""It shows that it needs to be tightened up still further because if we are going to protect the road map out of lockdown then the name of the game is going to be stop new variants coming in, some of which may end up being immune to the new vaccines,"" he says. ""Where we need to get to is a much, much more thorough combination of test and trace and genetic sequencing so we are not just testing the people who have been near someone who tested positive, but we also are working out where the original infection happened and which variant it is. You can only do that if you bring the cases right down."" However, Hunt - who now chairs the Commons Health and Social Care Committee - says the country was in a much better situation than it was last year. ""The fact that we are going to this trouble over one person who has gone missing says to me that we are in much better shape than we were three months ago, six months ago, where we wouldn't have been anywhere near that,"" he says. Israel's Supreme Court has banned the government from tracking the mobile phones of coronavirus carriers. The technology, developed by counter-terrorism agency Shin Bet, has been used on and off since March 2020 as part of efforts to curb the spread of the virus. It uses the locations of people with Covid to track others they have come into contact with. In its ruling today, the Supreme Court said it feared the surveillance technology - which was initially imposed as an emergency measure - is gradually becoming permanent, and that the government is heading down a ""slippery slope of using extreme and undemocratic means in the fight against the epidemic"". Deputy Health Minister Yoav Kisch later tweeted that the ruling was ""a crime against the health of Israeli citizens"". The government now has two weeks to stop using the technology. England's deputy chief medical officer said the latest scientific data had ""vindicated"" the UK's decision to give the AstraZeneca vaccine to older people. Some countries,such as Germanyand France, have refused to administer the vaccine to the over-65s because of a lack of testing data on older age groups. Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation ""took a view that it almost certainly would work"", after agreeing it was ""not immunologically plausible"" the vaccine would be effective among younger people but not older ones. ""The PHE (Public Health England) data have clearly vindicated that approach today,"" he said. ""I am not here to criticise other countries, but to say that I think in time the data emerging from our programme will speak for itself and other countries will doubtless be very interested in it."" Officials in Japan have asked China to stop carrying out anal swab tests on Japanese citizens who enter the country, saying people have complained that it caused them ""psychological distress"". China started carrying out anal swabs for Covid in January. The tests involve inserting a cotton swab 3-5cm (1.2-2.0 inches) into the anus and gently rotating it. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said they made the request through the embassy in Beijing, and noted that the use of anal swabs ""has not been confirmed anywhere else in the world"". China has yet to respond to the request, he added. Last week, Chinese officialsdenied that they had made US diplomats undergo anal testingafter US media reported that some had complained about the procedure. Read more about this story here The health secretary hailed new data highlighting the ability of the Covid vaccines to reduce serious illness - and fielded questions about the ongoing search for a missing case of the Brazil variant in the UK. About 26,000 police officers and 3,800 soldiers have been deployed in the Czech Republic to enforce new lockdown measures. The country is currently seeing the worst Covid surge in the world, with the highest per capita infection rate over the last week. Prime Minister Andrej Babis has warned that the healthcare system could collapse without the new lockdown restrictions, as a record number of Covid patients in the country are in a serious condition. Under the new rules, which are in place for three weeks, people are being confined to their home districts, and the two school year groups that were still attending in-person classes - pre-school and second grade - are switching to home learning. However, people who need to travel for work are exempt from the travel restrictions. Factories are also still open - a decision that Babis has faced criticism for. BBC Radio 5 Live Farzana Hussain says there is 'historical mistrust' around vaccines More than 20 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. But vaccine hesitancy is still a big issue in some communities. In the over 80s, 93% of white people have had the jab, compared to 76% of South Asian people and 61% of black
 people. GP Farzana Hussain told BBC Radio 5 Liveâs Naga Munchetty that ""for black Africans and Afro-Carribeans, it does seem to be a historical mistrust in the system"". ""For South Asians...there's
 a lot of myths around the vaccine containing animal products which doesn't help them if they want to comply with their faith, and also a real myth about infertility. Both of which are of course completely untrue,"" she said. Ima Miah is the CEO of
 the misinformation-tackling Asian Resource Centre (ARC) in Croydon. She told Naga that theyâve had to work hard to bust myths about the virus. ""There were myths around: Why did this happen? Where did this virus come from? Was it something intentional? Was it something targeted at the BAME people? Was it something to get rid of old people
 because they didn't matter?"" she said. Ima added that the distrust is stronger in certain communities because of the âdisproportionate impact on BAME
 communities in the first place"". Listen
 to 5 Live on the free BBC Sounds app. Polish President Andrzej Duda has spoken with Chinese leader Xi Jinping about possibly purchasing China's Covid-19 vaccines, his aide has told state news agency PAP, despite them not yet being approved by the European Medical Agency (EMA). ""The president also raised the issue of Polish-Chinese cooperation in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, including the possibility of purchasing vaccines produced in China,"" aide Krzysztof Szczerski told the agency. Poland wouldn't be the first EU nation to buy Chinese vaccines before they're given EU approval. Last week, Hungary became the first country in the union to start using vaccines produced by Chinese state-owned company Sinopharm. Hungary also gave emergency approval to Russia's Sputnik V vaccine in January, and has already rolled it out - despite it not being approved by the EMA either. The EU has beencriticised for the slow pace of vaccinations in its member states. A boy cycles past a mural of Covid-19 virus There's been lots of talk today about the P1 Brazil variant after six cases were found in the UK. There have been concerns vaccines may not be as effective against this variant, but NHS England's Prof Stephen Powis said vaccines could be ""rapidly adapted"". Understanding how new variants of the coronavirus in Brazil,
South Africa and the UK are altering the behaviour of the virus will be crucial in our vaccine arms race against Covid-19. This is how new Covid-19 variants are changing the pandemic. Asked which step in the roadmap he is most concerned about, as children return to school on Monday, the health secretary says it's all about ""safe steps"". ""We have set out the tests precisely so we can be sure the data still allows for safe steps down the roadmap."" He adds he is ""highly confident""  the opening of schools on 8 March is ""the right thing to do"". Dr Hopkins says the slow strategy - and the five-week gaps between each measure - are needed ""to give time after each event to monitor the impact"" particularly on hospitalisations and deaths. Professor Van-Tam joins her in stating the importance of having time ""to consider the effect of each step before we move on"". He stresses the need to relax measures ""in a very long-term way."" He says instead of ""stuttering steps... I would rather take much slower, more pronounced steps that always go in one direction.""  Jill Lawless from Associated Press asks what Matt Hancock thinks of the digital ""green pass"" the EU is proposing to prove Covid-free travel and which steps of the roadmap he is most concerned about. Hancock says: ""This already exists because you need to have a test before you can travel to the UK...and the EU proposal is that certification includes whether you've had the vaccine and whether you've recently had the test. Therefore it's something that we are working with them and others on and it matters that we get the details of this right for international travel."" He says: ""The roadmap is designed to be able to see the data before we take each step and we've done it that way in order to be able to have the assurance that we are taking a cautious but irreversible path out of this pandemic."" Macer Hall from the Express asks if ""double masking"" is a good idea. He also asks how the UK will ensure people get the second vaccine dose. ""The more layers you have the better,"" replies Dr Hopkins, adding that the recommendation is for ""at least two layers and ideally three in a mask"". On the second question, Hancock says he hasn't seen reticence among the population to get their second jab. Prof Van-Tam emphasises the importance of getting the second dose saying there is a ""significant likelihood that a second dose will mature your immune response possibly make it broader, and almost certainly make it longer than just having a first dose"". Thomas Moore at Sky says there is a missing case of the P1 variant but we do not know who or where or whether they've self-isolated. He asks how such a concerning new variant has been allowed to slip through the net? He also asks Prof Jonathan Van-Tam to level with him over any prospect of a holiday abroad this summer when new variants are crossing our borders and there's still no vaccine with in-built universal protection against all strains of the virus. Matt Hancock says there's a high chance the identification of the sixth case came through the surge testing used in places where they were looking for other variants of concern. Without this huge surveillance we wouldn't know about it and about 30% of cases are being sequenced, he says. On holidays, Prof Van-Tam says ""we are still in a zone of great uncertainty about what the virus will do next"". Many of the vaccination programmes in Europe are running behind ours and whether we can go on holiday depends on what other countries will say and do in terms of foreign tourism, he says. ""There has to be great uncertainty at the moment,"" he says. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said people studying the new data should see that both vaccines are ""extremely effective"" after one dose. ""I absolutely hope that, right round the world, people study the data and understand that getting the Pfizer or AstraZeneca jab is the right thing to do - and it could save your life"". Matt Hancock has denied that delays in imposing quarantine on travellers to the UK has put people at risk. ""We had already put in place measures against people travelling from Brazil,"" he said, adding that the rules - self-isolating at home - had been followed by the five people detected. And the health secretary added that there was ""no evidence the sixth case did not follow those rules."" He said it showed the system that was in place had managed to control the spread so far, and he pointed to the stricter measures now in place. Professor Van-Tam was asked what impact the new data would have on our everyday lives, but said it was ""going to take time until we can apply the results in a more generalised way"". He said, ultimately, he expected vaccine to lower levels of disease across the country, to reduce the likelihood of infection among the older and more vulnerable. He added that those given the vaccine would be less likely to suffer ""severe consequences"" of Covid once vaccinated. ""The ratio of mild to severe cases should increase in favour of mild cases over time."" ""The problem isn't fixed yet, but we have identified how to fix it.""   The next question comes from ITV's Romilly Weeks who asks if the health secretary is reconsidering reopening schools in England given the presence of the Brazil variant in the UK. ""We do not think there is a need to change approach on schools because of the new variant,"" replies Hancock. ""Our goal is to contain transmission to these six people,"" he adds. Dr Susan Hopkins says the ONS and React studies have not found any P1 cases. The data is ""reassuring"" she says but adds ""we are still on guard"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Police handed out 20 fixed penalty notices on Saturday Police at a Merseyside beauty spot had to turn cars back from as far as away as Leeds and Manchester at the weekend. Officers at Formby beach turned away more than 100 cars and issued 20 people with fines for breaching Covid-19 rules on Saturday, Merseyside Police said. Supt Graeme Robson said travelling from West Yorkshire and Greater Manchester was ""totally unacceptable"" and showed a ""complete disregard"" for the guidance. MP for Sefton Central, Bill Esterson, called their actions ""reckless"". Supt Robson said the good weather at the weekend had seen a ""large increase in people travelling to the Formby beach area, some of whom had travelled a significant distance to get there"". ""Individuals from as far as Leeds, Manchester and Stockport were found which is quite frankly astounding,"" he said. ""Now more than ever people should be taking heed of the advice, so that infection rates can continue to drop, and we can meet the criteria necessary for easing lockdown in the upcoming weeks and months.""

"The NHS's ""insufficient"" critical care capacity has been laid bare by the pandemic, with the UK having one of the lowest number of beds per head in Europe, NHS Providers has said. The group, which represents trusts in England, is calling for a review of the health service's capacity. The UK has 7.3 critical care beds per 100,000 people, compared to Germany's 33.8 and the US's 34.3, analysis found. The government said it was investing Â£72bn in the next two years in the NHS. The east of England, South West and South East are areas of key concern. Some critical care wards full across England' 'Record number' of Covid hospital transfers NHS pressure 'at a really dangerous point' ""The UK is towards the bottom of the European League table for critical care beds per head of population,"" NHS Providers said. The group added that the UK had comparatively fewer critical care beds than France, Italy, Australia and Spain. ""It's neither safe nor sensible to rely on NHS hospital trusts being able to double or triple their capacity at the drop of a hat as they've had to over the last two months, with all the disruption to other care and impossible burdens on staff that involves."" Seeking a review into critical care capacity in England, the organisation said it wanted the government to commit to providing additional finances in areas where it was needed. ""There have been too many reviews of NHS capacity in the past where huge amounts of time have been wasted because the government has not been willing to fund the results of what's been found,"" the group said. When reviews and a public inquiry at some stage look at lessons to be learned from the handling of the pandemic in the UK, the question of the readiness of the NHS is sure to be considered. NHS Providers has highlighted one key part of this - the relative lack of critical care beds in hospitals, reflecting in part insufficient investment going back many years. The UK has fewer hospital beds for seriously ill patients relative to the population than leading European economies such as France, Germany, Italy and Spain. So going into the pandemic the health service was in some ways not as well resourced as it might have been. The NHS coped astonishingly well last April and in the most recent surge, and hospitals were not overwhelmed. But sufficient critical care beds were created for Covid patients only by using wards which could not therefore be used by others - much routine and non urgent care had to be postponed. The argument now being made is that there needs to be a review of what is needed as a safety net for future crises - and funding to go with it. A  Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""The government is determined to back the NHS in every possible way in its fight against this virus, investing Â£52bn this year and Â£20bn next. ""This is on top of Â£9.4bn capital funding to build and upgrade 40 new hospitals and Â£3bn earmarked for supporting recovery and reducing the NHS waiting list."" They added that the government was on track to deliver 50,000 more nurses by the end of this parliament. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end?

"Police handed out 20 fixed penalty notices on Saturday Police at a Merseyside beauty spot had to turn cars back from as far as away as Leeds and Manchester at the weekend. Officers at Formby beach turned away more than 100 cars and issued 20 people with fines for breaching Covid-19 rules on Saturday, Merseyside Police said. Supt Graeme Robson said travelling from West Yorkshire and Greater Manchester was ""totally unacceptable"" and showed a ""complete disregard"" for the guidance.

"What happens to shop workers after the shutters are pulled down for the last time and the lights are switched off as another store closes? What was once a bustling shop and a way of life for its workers is now left to a bunch of mannequins in darkness. ""It was just strange. It didn't feel real, locking the doors and saying goodbye and just thinking I'm never ever going to be here again,"" says Tamsin Lynham, who worked at the now closed Topshop in west London's Westfield shopping centre. For the last week, when they were clearing out the shop, she says she cried every night on the way home on the Tube. ""It's the first time something like this has happened to me. I went into absolute panic mode. It wasn't really just a job, it was like you've got a little extended family. It was a huge part of my life,"" she says. Tamsin is 35 and has been working in shops for more than half her life, starting at Topshop with a Saturday job when she was 16. The closure, she says, has been ""heartbreaking"". Like so many people whose jobs have been threatened in the pandemic, Tamsin is standing nervously at a crossroads. What happens next? Where will all the shop workers go if more retail jobs are lost? Who is going to retrain them? The closure of Topshop branches is a business headline, but it's also a piece of people's lives disappearing. Will it be a case, to use the phrase attributed to football manager Tommy Docherty, that when one door closesâ¦ another one slams in your face? According to Neil Carberry, head of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, this is the ""fastest-changing jobs market for a generation"". Recruiters have seen big collapses in demand in sectors such as retail, hospitality and the leisure industry - and growth in other areas including social care, construction and home delivery. The biggest year-on-year fall has been for bar staff, while demand has soared for bricklayers. The impact of the pandemic cuts across generations. While mid-career shop workers are worrying about reinventing themselves, young people are struggling to get a first job. Isabel Scavetta, aged 23 from Maidenhead, in Berkshire, has seen her expectations about jobs turned upside down. But not necessarily for the worst. ""In some ways I'm strangely grateful for having to re-evaluate,"" she says, describing a ""complete career pivot"". Isabel is part of Generation Covid, leaving university last summer. Or maybe it would be fairer to say that university left them, because their student days ended with such abruptness. She has a degree in European social and political studies from University College London, but with so many graduate schemes closed by the pandemic, her direction ""radically changed"". She taught herself coding and began volunteering work for an online project calledClass of 2020,external, which provides free training for young graduates trying to get into work. Her new digital skills have got her a paid internship in artificial intelligence at Rolls Royce, working remotely. ""The entire trajectory of my career looks completely different from what I would have thought a year ago,"" says Isabel. But she is keenly aware of how tough it has become in the quicksand of the current jobs market. Even knowing where to start can be overwhelming, she says, so that it becomes a kind of ""decision fatigue that's almost paralysing"". Isabel Scavetta learned coding in the pandemic and completely changed her career direction Deirdre Hughes, careers consultant and former chair of the National Careers Council, says it can feel very confusing for people looking for advice, particularly if they're shell-shocked as a result of a redundancy. ""How do you take that first step?"" she says. She argues that there needs to be a public information campaign about where to find job advice - and warns the current system in England is too fragmented and ""not good enough"". Tamsin from Topshop, is still trying to readjust to what's happened - and the loss of a job she ""really loved"". ""I would never have seen that coming. I'm still in shock if I'm honest. I never thought there wouldn't be a Topshop on the High Street,"" says Tamsin. ""It's all I've ever known. I feel like I've been robbed, I had so many big plans. I put everything into that job, I really did."" Her colleague Milly Vaja, aged 27, says it is ""mind boggling"" to see such shops closing, and is still staggered by what has happened during the pandemic. High Street brands, as ""unsinkable"" as the Titanic, are disappearing. Now Tamsin and Milly are facing tough choices. They say their main source of advice has been other people they've worked with. Redundancy rates are higher now in the pandemic, according to Office for National Statistics figures, than they were in the economic shockwave that followed the financial crash of 2008. It's the end of an era for Tamsin and all her creative work on Topshop's shop displays ""Do I stay in retail? Do I stick with what I know?"" Tamsin is considering whether it would be safer to move into more ""high-end fashion"". ""I absolutely loved it, but do I look for something else now?"" says Milly. Tamsin might make a complete change of direction and has thought about retraining as a dog groomer. ""Where do I start? I haven't been to a careers advice person since I was at school,"" says Tamsin, who worked her way up to be the store's visual manager. ""A lot of people won't even look at your CV if there's no degree. It closes a lot of doors,"" she says. She says other people in retail have retrained as carers, and is upset when she hears about former shop workers having applications turned down as they look for new careers. ""People need a second chance. It's not about whether they tick all the boxes,"" says Tamsin. ""The interview process is so hard, they make it so difficult. 'You need five years experience.' But how do I get experience if no-one gives you a chance?"" says Milly. She is moving out of London to Leicester, to get an affordable house, but that means finding a secure job for the mortgage. Milly says she'd booked an interview for packing orders for a delivery firm but decided that wasn't for her, and went back to searching online for other jobs. Her life is suddenly full of uncertainty, and she's not alone. The recruitment website LinkedIn says it has seen a 24% year-on-year drop in hiring for retail jobs, with jobs in recreation and travel even harder hit, down by 52% compared with January 2020. The biggest two growth areas for jobs are in healthcare, up 28% year-on-year, and transportation and logistics, up 11%. All those deliveries at the door are a warning bell for a changing jobs market. Amina Dahir, in Birmingham, is one of those people changing to become a carer. Her job as a cleaner in a shopping mall disappeared in the lockdown. ""It was really hard, but we just had hope that it was going to come back. But it's like there's no more security, if you understand. That's how I felt,"" says Amina, 40. ""So many people have lost their jobs."" But she's got a positive new direction. A work coach at the JobCentre Plus directed her to the care sector and the free training available. She says it will be rewarding to care for old people as well as getting qualifications for a more secure job. Amina expects it to be even harder after the pandemic, with more people chasing fewer jobs. ""When you lose your job you need training. You don't know what happens next. Lots of people don't even know where to look,"" she says. This video can not be played Ten tips for getting your dream job Across BBC News, as part of National Careers Week, we're hearing from people at a crossroads in their career and will aim to give tips and advice. How do I find a new job and who is hiring? Five things to focus on in your CV BBC Bitesize: Find some advice As part of the week, BBC 5live's Naga Munchetty will host a careers clinic from 13:15-14:00 GMT on Tuesday 2 March on theBBC News LinkedIn page,external. Amina's training, funded by the government, is being carried out by the adult education organisation the WEA, the Workers Educational Association, which has trained 36,000 people during the pandemic. ""It's worrying and frightening for many people at the moment, given the rapid rise in unemployment,"" says Simon Parkinson, the WEA's chief executive. ""It's hard enough at any stage of your career, but if you've been in a single industry for 15 or 20 years, it's devastating."" He says there can be stress and anxiety that starts ""spiralling downwards"". The challenge is to turn this round, he says, and show the ""world of work has changed massively"" - and there are new opportunities. ""It's about raising people's confidence, reminding people it's not too late. They need food on their table. They're the engine room of the economy. It's not the graduate jobs, it's the millions of people, 35- to 55-year-olds, that have worked in some of the backbone sectors of the country."" He says very practical barriers to recruitment are often overlooked - such as everything being online, including Zoom interviews. ""It is not true to think that everybody in the country has got a solid broadband connection and access to a laptop."" This video can not be played Shanique says she has applied for more than 50 graduate jobs While Amina was looking for training after losing her cleaning job, across the city Harriet Ferguson was graduating from the University of Birmingham. ""It's hard to know what's available,"" says the 23-year-old, ""and you can't go to careers events to go for an interview and meet people."" She been job hunting in the pandemic. Employment figures in February showed it was her age group that has been hardest hit - withalmost three-fifths of job losses falling on the under-25s. Harriet, from High Wycombe, wanted to work with young people and has got a six-month contract with the St John Ambulance cadet programme. But she is concerned about other young graduates struggling to find jobs, with worries about loneliness and being ""completely in the dark"" about what comes next. She has been volunteering to help other young jobseekers on the Class of 2020 website, and hears about their problems. ""It's so isolating,"" she says. ""The standard story is people sending in hundreds of applications. There's the sense that it's only you that's struggling, trying to be resilient, when it's rejection after rejection after rejection."" The pandemic has also shown up the vulnerability of those relying on insecure, temporary contracts. Ritu Panchal worked regularly for years as a teaching assistant, but through an agency. When her work in schools suddenly stopped in the lockdown, she had nothing to replace it. ""I didn't expect to be like this,"" says the 43-year-old from Hemel Hempstead. ""I never missed a day. Wherever they told me to go I went."" Ritu is training for qualifications to improve her chances of getting another teaching assistant job on a more permanent basis. A theme that keeps recurring, for young and old job hunters, is the uncertainty about where to get advice. There are no shortages of warnings about a ""perfect storm"" for jobs in the pandemic, but where do you look for the rescue boats? There are thousands of retraining courses offered online - many of them expensive - but which ones are really going to make a difference? Amina, part of the wave of people being retrained as carers, says advice should be offered when people are still working, before ""waiting for a crisis to come"". There is a wider issue of how much has been invested in adult careers advice, whether it has been taken seriously and how it is delivered. A probably apocryphal story, suggesting the lack of priority, is that when a senior minister was asked about careers advice, he joked that if careers advisers were so good how had they ended up as careers advisers? Many retraining schemes are reached through the Job Centre Plus system, including for those in work. Simon Parkinson at the WEA suggests there should be more ways of ""connecting with people"". ""People don't necessarily want to walk straight into a Job Centre. Particularly older workers, if they managed to come through the 1980s,"" he says. There are a growing number of government responses. TheNational Careers Service,externalhas free advice and a helpline, there's aSkills Toolkit,externalto find courses and 16-week ""boot camps"" teaching specific skills, such as coding and software development. Starting next month, the government's ""lifetime skills guarantee"" will include 400 free training courses for adults whose qualifications are below A-levels, in areas such as social care, childcare and construction. Under the ""Plan for Jobs"" scheme, there are initiatives such as Kickstart to create new jobs for 16- to 24-year-olds and Restart, which will have Â£400m in 2021-22 to provide support for the unemployed. Shop workers who have seen their store closing down will now have to start again For Tamsin Lynham, her shop is gone but she says she's feeling more positive and getting out her CV. ""To be honest, it's been a hard year."" She remembers the moment when they had a last cheer as they shut the shop, and the sadness afterwards. ""You think about all the people you've worked with, it was such a great place to work. I thought to myself: 'How much did these four walls stress me?' ""And people will think we were only selling clothes."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9994974

The Crown was the big winner in the television categories, winning four prizes in total, including best drama series. Josh O'Connor and Emma Corrin both won acting honours for their performances as Prince Charles and Princess Diana respectively. Emma Corrin won for her portrayal of Princess Diana in The Crown As she accepted her prize, Corrin said: ""Most of all, thank you so much to Diana, you have taught me compassion and empathy beyond any measure I could ever imagine."" O'Connor said: ""I'm very lucky to be able to work in this period, and there are so many people who are unable to work, who are alone and isolated, and I hope we can all collectively put mental health at the forefront our minds."" Gillian Anderson was named best supporting actress for her portrayal of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher in the series. The Queen's Gambit won best limited series, while its star Anya Taylor-Joy, who has lived in the UK since she was six, was named best actress in a limited series. Schitt's Creek was named best comedy series, and one of its stars, Catherine O'Hara, was named best TV comedy actress. Catherine O'Hara was named best comedy actress for Schitt's Creek Elsewhere, Chadwick Boseman was posthumously named best actor in a drama film for his performance in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. His wife, Taylor Simone Ledward, accepted the award on his behalf, after the Black Panther star's death last summer from colon cancer at the age of 43. In one of the ceremony's surprises, The United States vs Billie Holiday star Andra Day was named best actress in a drama film for her portrayal of the jazz singer. Aaron Sorkin paid tribute to the three women who were nominated for best director as he accepted best screenplay for The Trial of the Chicago 7. ""You are the reason my college-age daughter wants to be a film-maker, and I'm never going to forgive you for that,"" he joked. Speaking before the ceremony, Regina King, who was nominated for her directorial debut One Night in Miami, said: ""This was another year of powerful work from women with strong voices, so it feels good, and I hope this is the beginning of a true shift."" Other winners included Mark Ruffalo for best actor in a limited series, and Pixar's Soul, which won best animated film. The ceremony, which recognises excellence in film and television, was held virtually this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. While nominees dialled in from home, the live audience was made up of frontline workers and first responders of the Covid-19 pandemic. Frontline workers and first responders made up the live audience, in place of nominees The Golden Globes are the first major event of awards season, and often a good indicator of which films will go on to Oscar glory. Former Saturday Night Live stars Tina Fey and Amy Poehler returned to hosting duties this year, but they were in New York and Los Angeles respectively, marking the first time the Golden Globes have been bicoastal. The nominees and winners were voted for by the 87 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), a group of international journalists based in California. After a recent investigation by the LA Times found the HFPA had no black members, representatives from the organisation said during the ceremony they planned to address the issue. ""Tonight, while we celebrate the work of artists from around the globe, we recognise we have our own work to do,"" said Helen Hoehne, vice president of the HFPA. ""Just like in film and television, black representation is vital. We must have black journalists in our organisation."" But inseparate letters to the HFPA and the Globes' network sponsor NBC,externalissued after the ceremony's conclusion, Time's Up president and CEO Tina Chen criticised the response as ""cosmetic"". ""Change only occurs from an awareness of larger cultural problems, as well as a long-term commitment to systemic change"", she wrote. Chen also called on NBC to take action and meet their public commitment to reform. ""As leaders of NBCUniversal television"", her letter read, ""your power as stakeholders makes you an effective force of change."" Allow Facebook content?

"Bank of Ireland operates across the Republic of Ireland and the UK Bank of Ireland has announced it will close 15 branches in Northern Ireland, which is more than half of its 28 branches currently operating in NI. It is part of a wider cost-cutting exercise that includes the closure of 88 banks in the Republic of Ireland, where 169 banks will remain open. The Dublin-based bank operates across the Republic and the UK. It is one of NI's ""big four"" banks. The bank's UK head office will also relocate from London to Belfast. The bank has been reviewing its Northern Ireland operations and there had been speculation that it could withdraw from the market. That has not happened, but Chief Executive Francesca McDonagh said the Northern Ireland business will undergo ""a material restructure"". The branch closures will affect the roles of about 120 staff in Northern Ireland but will not result in compulsory redundancies, according to Ian McLaughlin, Chief Executive of Bank of Ireland UK. A geographical breakdown of Bank Of Ireland branches earmarked for closure in Northern Ireland The branches earmarked for closure are: Ballymena Banbridge Belfast (Lisburn Road) Belfast (Ormeau Road) Belfast (University Road) Crossmaglen Londonderry (Strand Road) Downpatrick Dungannon Keady Limavady Lisburn Lisnaskea Portadown Strabane The bank would work to identify staff who could be redeployed to other roles within the company, as an alternative to redundancy, said Mr McLaughlin. Branch closures will not start for 12 weeks and customers will be contacted individually about the changes, he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. Aside from closing 15 branches, the restructuring of its Northern Ireland business will include simplifying its range of products with a greater focus on car finance and mortgages. The bank will also continue with its strategy of withdrawing from less profitable lending across the UK. It said this would mean its UK loan book shrinking by about 10% during 2021. Bank of Ireland said its customers' usage of cash and branch services is falling substantially The bank's UK division made a loss of Â£15m in 2020, compared to a profit of Â£152m in 2019. The loss was due to impairment charges - money which must be set aside to cover loans which may not be repaid in full. All banks have seen increased impairment charges due to the economic impact of the pandemic. The bank as a whole showed an annual loss of â¬760m (Â£657m), again due to impairment charges. ""We've announced some rather eye-watering numbers this morning, like most banks,"" Mr McLaughlin told Good Morning Ulster. ""It's been a really tough time and anyone who tells you differently isn't really paying attention, but we've got a really solid business here,"" he insisted. Mr McLaughlin added that the relocation of the bank's UK office to Belfast was ""really good news and a sign of our commitment to Northern Ireland"". He said the branch closures were in response to changes in customer behaviour over the last four years. He argued that as the popularity of digital services like online shopping had increased, banks could not be ""insulated"" from the switch to digital. ""Our customers are using our branches less and less and we've reached a bit of a tipping point,"" Mr McLaughlin said. ""Our cash usage and customer visits in the closing branches is down 70% since 2017 and commensurately our digital banking up 50% over the same period so we need to adapt and we need to change."" Retail NI Chief Executive Glyn Roberts said the number of closures ""seems a step too far"". Acknowledging ""the significant increase in online banking"", Mr Roberts said Monday's news will have a ""negative impact"" on high streets across Northern Ireland when the lockdown ends. ""I have also particular concerns of the impact on rural communities, with further reduced ATM provision and the ability to access cash,"" he added. The Consumer Council has said the closures risk isolating consumers by removing access to essential services. Financial Services Director Scott Kennerley said many consumers and small businesses still rely on face-to-face banking. ""We know that some consumers in Northern Ireland still prefer to use cash so the decision by Bank of Ireland to close half of its branch network will have a negative impact on consumers and their access to cash services,"" he said. ""We will continue to engage with Bank of Ireland to understand how it is supporting consumers affected by this decision."" Bank of Ireland had already closed several branches over the last decade. In 2011, it had 44 branches in Northern Ireland. In August last year, the bank said it wasaiming to cut 1,400 jobs from its UK and Ireland operations. Last week, Ulster Bank confirmed it wouldclose its Republic of Ireland businessover the next few years.

"Poorer students in England are up to three A-level grades behind more affluent students, research suggests. The Education Policy Institute (EPI) said lower GCSE grades, then fewer and lower level qualifications aged 16-19, causes a ""disadvantage gap"". It found in some areas, poorer students were up to five grades behind. The Department for Education says it provided over Â£530m in 2020-21 to support college students. Students from poorer families begin their A-level or vocational courses already behind more affluent students, and continue to fall further behind, according to analysis by the EPI. In the first ever study to measure the education ""disadvantage gap"" among students aged 16-19, provisional findings show that across all qualifications, poorer students are the equivalent of three A-level grades behind similar students from richer families. Lockdown pupils 'three months behind in learning' Disadvantaged pupils 'stuck 18 months behind' Poor pupils face 'two-year catch up after lockdown' But there were variations across England, with poorer students the equivalent of around five A-level grades behind in areas including Knowsley on Merseyside, North Somerset  and Stockton-on-Tees. In sharp contrast in many London areas, poorer students are level with or even slightly ahead of their more affluent peers. The EPI looked at students' free school meal status during their last six years of school and their attainment, based on qualifications and grades between the end of secondary school and by the age of 19. It finds the gap is bigger in A-levels than vocational qualifications. The researchers say there was no progress in closing the gap between 2017 to 2019, and suggest it is likely to get worse due the impact of the pandemic which has effected poorer communities more severely. Sam Tuckett, senior researcher at the EPI, said: ""For the very first time, this exploratory research gives us a clear understanding of how disadvantaged sixth form and college students are progressing with their learning compared to their peers. ""Our findings demonstrate very plainly that deep-seated inequalities follow poorer teenagers from school through to sixth form and college, and continue to widen further compared to otherwise similar students, as they work towards their qualifications."" The big gaps in grades is largely explained by poorer students already having lower grades at the end of their GCSEs, the researchers say. Disadvantaged students are also more likely to take fewer and lower-level qualifications which adds to the gap in results. There is a ""strong case"" for extra funding for 16-19 education to stop poor pupils falling further behind, the report suggests. And targeted support is urgently needed to address learning losses caused by the pandemic, which is likely to impact the poorest students the most. David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, called for the pupil premium which gives extra money to schools to help poorer pupils, to be extended beyond the age of 16. ""Young people in England's school sixth forms and colleges have lower hours of teaching, less support and less enrichment than their peers in other countries, and less than those in private schools. That needs to change. Bill Watkin, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said the report provides a welcome perspective on the ""chronic underfunding"" of sixth form education. ""There is now a broad consensus that young people need additional support to recover from the disruption to their education caused by Covid, but as this report illustrates, sixth forms and colleges have been helping students to recover from a range of disadvantages for many years."" A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""We are determined to ensure disadvantaged students are properly supported while studying at college or sixth form so they can gain the skills they need to progress. ""This includes providing extra funding for disadvantaged 16 to 19-year-old students, specifically those with low prior attainment or who live in the most disadvantaged areas.""

"What happens to shop workers after the shutters are pulled down for the last time and the lights are switched off as another store closes? What was once a bustling shop and a way of life for its workers is now left to a bunch of mannequins in darkness. ""It was just strange. It didn't feel real, locking the doors and saying goodbye and just thinking I'm never ever going to be here again,"" says Tamsin Lynham, who worked at the now closed Topshop in west London's Westfield shopping centre. For the last week, when they were clearing out the shop, she says she cried every night on the way home on the Tube. ""It's the first time something like this has happened to me. I went into absolute panic mode. It wasn't really just a job, it was like you've got a little extended family. It was a huge part of my life,"" she says. Tamsin is 35 and has been working in shops for more than half her life, starting at Topshop with a Saturday job when she was 16. The closure, she says, has been ""heartbreaking"". Like so many people whose jobs have been threatened in the pandemic, Tamsin is standing nervously at a crossroads. What happens next? Where will all the shop workers go if more retail jobs are lost? Who is going to retrain them? The closure of Topshop branches is a business headline, but it's also a piece of people's lives disappearing. Will it be a case, to use the phrase attributed to football manager Tommy Docherty, that when one door closesâ¦ another one slams in your face? According to Neil Carberry, head of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, this is the ""fastest-changing jobs market for a generation"". Recruiters have seen big collapses in demand in sectors such as retail, hospitality and the leisure industry - and growth in other areas including social care, construction and home delivery. The biggest year-on-year fall has been for bar staff, while demand has soared for bricklayers. The impact of the pandemic cuts across generations. While mid-career shop workers are worrying about reinventing themselves, young people are struggling to get a first job. Isabel Scavetta, aged 23 from Maidenhead, in Berkshire, has seen her expectations about jobs turned upside down. But not necessarily for the worst. ""In some ways I'm strangely grateful for having to re-evaluate,"" she says, describing a ""complete career pivot"". Isabel is part of Generation Covid, leaving university last summer. Or maybe it would be fairer to say that university left them, because their student days ended with such abruptness. She has a degree in European social and political studies from University College London, but with so many graduate schemes closed by the pandemic, her direction ""radically changed"". She taught herself coding and began volunteering work for an online project calledClass of 2020,external, which provides free training for young graduates trying to get into work. Her new digital skills have got her a paid internship in artificial intelligence at Rolls Royce, working remotely. ""The entire trajectory of my career looks completely different from what I would have thought a year ago,"" says Isabel. But she is keenly aware of how tough it has become in the quicksand of the current jobs market. Even knowing where to start can be overwhelming, she says, so that it becomes a kind of ""decision fatigue that's almost paralysing"". Isabel Scavetta learned coding in the pandemic and completely changed her career direction Deirdre Hughes, careers consultant and former chair of the National Careers Council, says it can feel very confusing for people looking for advice, particularly if they're shell-shocked as a result of a redundancy. ""How do you take that first step?"" she says. She argues that there needs to be a public information campaign about where to find job advice - and warns the current system in England is too fragmented and ""not good enough"". Tamsin from Topshop, is still trying to readjust to what's happened - and the loss of a job she ""really loved"". ""I would never have seen that coming. I'm still in shock if I'm honest. I never thought there wouldn't be a Topshop on the High Street,"" says Tamsin. ""It's all I've ever known. I feel like I've been robbed, I had so many big plans. I put everything into that job, I really did."" Her colleague Milly Vaja, aged 27, says it is ""mind boggling"" to see such shops closing, and is still staggered by what has happened during the pandemic. High Street brands, as ""unsinkable"" as the Titanic, are disappearing. Now Tamsin and Milly are facing tough choices. They say their main source of advice has been other people they've worked with. Redundancy rates are higher now in the pandemic, according to Office for National Statistics figures, than they were in the economic shockwave that followed the financial crash of 2008. It's the end of an era for Tamsin and all her creative work on Topshop's shop displays ""Do I stay in retail? Do I stick with what I know?"" Tamsin is considering whether it would be safer to move into more ""high-end fashion"". ""I absolutely loved it, but do I look for something else now?"" says Milly. Tamsin might make a complete change of direction and has thought about retraining as a dog groomer. ""Where do I start? I haven't been to a careers advice person since I was at school,"" says Tamsin, who worked her way up to be the store's visual manager. ""A lot of people won't even look at your CV if there's no degree. It closes a lot of doors,"" she says. She says other people in retail have retrained as carers, and is upset when she hears about former shop workers having applications turned down as they look for new careers. ""People need a second chance. It's not about whether they tick all the boxes,"" says Tamsin. ""The interview process is so hard, they make it so difficult. 'You need five years experience.' But how do I get experience if no-one gives you a chance?"" says Milly. She is moving out of London to Leicester, to get an affordable house, but that means finding a secure job for the mortgage. Milly says she'd booked an interview for packing orders for a delivery firm but decided that wasn't for her, and went back to searching online for other jobs. Her life is suddenly full of uncertainty, and she's not alone. The recruitment website LinkedIn says it has seen a 24% year-on-year drop in hiring for retail jobs, with jobs in recreation and travel even harder hit, down by 52% compared with January 2020. The biggest two growth areas for jobs are in healthcare, up 28% year-on-year, and transportation and logistics, up 11%. All those deliveries at the door are a warning bell for a changing jobs market. Amina Dahir, in Birmingham, is one of those people changing to become a carer. Her job as a cleaner in a shopping mall disappeared in the lockdown. ""It was really hard, but we just had hope that it was going to come back. But it's like there's no more security, if you understand. That's how I felt,"" says Amina, 40. ""So many people have lost their jobs."" But she's got a positive new direction. A work coach at the JobCentre Plus directed her to the care sector and the free training available. She says it will be rewarding to care for old people as well as getting qualifications for a more secure job. Amina expects it to be even harder after the pandemic, with more people chasing fewer jobs. ""When you lose your job you need training. You don't know what happens next. Lots of people don't even know where to look,"" she says. This video can not be played Ten tips for getting your dream job Across BBC News, as part of National Careers Week, we're hearing from people at a crossroads in their career and will aim to give tips and advice. How do I find a new job and who is hiring? Five things to focus on in your CV BBC Bitesize: Find some advice As part of the week, BBC 5live's Naga Munchetty will host a careers clinic from 13:15-14:00 GMT on Tuesday 2 March on theBBC News LinkedIn page,external. Amina's training, funded by the government, is being carried out by the adult education organisation the WEA, the Workers Educational Association, which has trained 36,000 people during the pandemic. ""It's worrying and frightening for many people at the moment, given the rapid rise in unemployment,"" says Simon Parkinson, the WEA's chief executive. ""It's hard enough at any stage of your career, but if you've been in a single industry for 15 or 20 years, it's devastating."" He says there can be stress and anxiety that starts ""spiralling downwards"". The challenge is to turn this round, he says, and show the ""world of work has changed massively"" - and there are new opportunities. ""It's about raising people's confidence, reminding people it's not too late. They need food on their table. They're the engine room of the economy. It's not the graduate jobs, it's the millions of people, 35- to 55-year-olds, that have worked in some of the backbone sectors of the country."" He says very practical barriers to recruitment are often overlooked - such as everything being online, including Zoom interviews. ""It is not true to think that everybody in the country has got a solid broadband connection and access to a laptop."" This video can not be played Shanique says she has applied for more than 50 graduate jobs While Amina was looking for training after losing her cleaning job, across the city Harriet Ferguson was graduating from the University of Birmingham. ""It's hard to know what's available,"" says the 23-year-old, ""and you can't go to careers events to go for an interview and meet people."" She been job hunting in the pandemic. Employment figures in February showed it was her age group that has been hardest hit - withalmost three-fifths of job losses falling on the under-25s. Harriet, from High Wycombe, wanted to work with young people and has got a six-month contract with the St John Ambulance cadet programme. But she is concerned about other young graduates struggling to find jobs, with worries about loneliness and being ""completely in the dark"" about what comes next. She has been volunteering to help other young jobseekers on the Class of 2020 website, and hears about their problems. ""It's so isolating,"" she says. ""The standard story is people sending in hundreds of applications. There's the sense that it's only you that's struggling, trying to be resilient, when it's rejection after rejection after rejection."" The pandemic has also shown up the vulnerability of those relying on insecure, temporary contracts. Ritu Panchal worked regularly for years as a teaching assistant, but through an agency. When her work in schools suddenly stopped in the lockdown, she had nothing to replace it. ""I didn't expect to be like this,"" says the 43-year-old from Hemel Hempstead. ""I never missed a day. Wherever they told me to go I went."" Ritu is training for qualifications to improve her chances of getting another teaching assistant job on a more permanent basis. A theme that keeps recurring, for young and old job hunters, is the uncertainty about where to get advice. There are no shortages of warnings about a ""perfect storm"" for jobs in the pandemic, but where do you look for the rescue boats? There are thousands of retraining courses offered online - many of them expensive - but which ones are really going to make a difference? Amina, part of the wave of people being retrained as carers, says advice should be offered when people are still working, before ""waiting for a crisis to come"". There is a wider issue of how much has been invested in adult careers advice, whether it has been taken seriously and how it is delivered. A probably apocryphal story, suggesting the lack of priority, is that when a senior minister was asked about careers advice, he joked that if careers advisers were so good how had they ended up as careers advisers? Many retraining schemes are reached through the Job Centre Plus system, including for those in work. Simon Parkinson at the WEA suggests there should be more ways of ""connecting with people"". ""People don't necessarily want to walk straight into a Job Centre. Particularly older workers, if they managed to come through the 1980s,"" he says. There are a growing number of government responses. TheNational Careers Service,externalhas free advice and a helpline, there's aSkills Toolkit,externalto find courses and 16-week ""boot camps"" teaching specific skills, such as coding and software development. Starting next month, the government's ""lifetime skills guarantee"" will include 400 free training courses for adults whose qualifications are below A-levels, in areas such as social care, childcare and construction. Under the ""Plan for Jobs"" scheme, there are initiatives such as Kickstart to create new jobs for 16- to 24-year-olds and Restart, which will have Â£400m in 2021-22 to provide support for the unemployed. Shop workers who have seen their store closing down will now have to start again For Tamsin Lynham, her shop is gone but she says she's feeling more positive and getting out her CV. ""To be honest, it's been a hard year."" She remembers the moment when they had a last cheer as they shut the shop, and the sadness afterwards. ""You think about all the people you've worked with, it was such a great place to work. I thought to myself: 'How much did these four walls stress me?' ""And people will think we were only selling clothes."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.0077450275

Who is going to retrain them? The closure of Topshop branches is a business headline, but it's also a piece of people's lives disappearing. Will it be a case, to use the phrase attributed to football manager Tommy Docherty, that when one door closesâ¦ another one slams in your face? According to Neil Carberry, head of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, this is the ""fastest-changing jobs market for a generation"". Recruiters have seen big collapses in demand in sectors such as retail, hospitality and the leisure industry - and growth in other areas including social care, construction and home delivery. The biggest year-on-year fall has been for bar staff, while demand has soared for bricklayers. The impact of the pandemic cuts across generations. While mid-career shop workers are worrying about reinventing themselves, young people are struggling to get a first job. Isabel Scavetta, aged 23 from Maidenhead, in Berkshire, has seen her expectations about jobs turned upside down. But not necessarily for the worst. ""In some ways I'm strangely grateful for having to re-evaluate,"" she says, describing a ""complete career pivot"". Isabel is part of Generation Covid, leaving university last summer. Or maybe it would be fairer to say that university left them, because their student days ended with such abruptness. She has a degree in European social and political studies from University College London, but with so many graduate schemes closed by the pandemic, her direction ""radically changed"". She taught herself coding and began volunteering work for an online project calledClass of 2020,external, which provides free training for young graduates trying to get into work. Her new digital skills have got her a paid internship in artificial intelligence at Rolls Royce, working remotely. ""The entire trajectory of my career looks completely different from what I would have thought a year ago,"" says Isabel. But she is keenly aware of how tough it has become in the quicksand of the current jobs market. Even knowing where to start can be overwhelming, she says, so that it becomes a kind of ""decision fatigue that's almost paralysing"". Isabel Scavetta learned coding in the pandemic and completely changed her career direction Deirdre Hughes, careers consultant and former chair of the National Careers Council, says it can feel very confusing for people looking for advice, particularly if they're shell-shocked as a result of a redundancy. ""How do you take that first step?"" she says. She argues that there needs to be a public information campaign about where to find job advice - and warns the current system in England is too fragmented and ""not good enough"". Tamsin from Topshop, is still trying to readjust to what's happened - and the loss of a job she ""really loved"". ""I would never have seen that coming. I'm still in shock if I'm honest. I never thought there wouldn't be a Topshop on the High Street,"" says Tamsin. ""It's all I've ever known. I feel like I've been robbed, I had so many big plans. I put everything into that job, I really did."" Her colleague Milly Vaja, aged 27, says it is ""mind boggling"" to see such shops closing, and is still staggered by what has happened during the pandemic. High Street brands, as ""unsinkable"" as the Titanic, are disappearing. Now Tamsin and Milly are facing tough choices. They say their main source of advice has been other people they've worked with. Redundancy rates are higher now in the pandemic, according to Office for National Statistics figures, than they were in the economic shockwave that followed the financial crash of 2008. It's the end of an era for Tamsin and all her creative work on Topshop's shop displays ""Do I stay in retail? Do I stick with what I know?"" Tamsin is considering whether it would be safer to move into more ""high-end fashion"". ""I absolutely loved it, but do I look for something else now?"" says Milly. Tamsin might make a complete change of direction and has thought about retraining as a dog groomer. ""Where do I start? I haven't been to a careers advice person since I was at school,"" says Tamsin, who worked her way up to be the store's visual manager. ""A lot of people won't even look at your CV if there's no degree. It closes a lot of doors,"" she says. She says other people in retail have retrained as carers, and is upset when she hears about former shop workers having applications turned down as they look for new careers. ""People need a second chance. It's not about whether they tick all the boxes,"" says Tamsin. ""The interview process is so hard, they make it so difficult. 'You need five years experience.' But how do I get experience if no-one gives you a chance?"" says Milly. She is moving out of London to Leicester, to get an affordable house, but that means finding a secure job for the mortgage. Milly says she'd booked an interview for packing orders for a delivery firm but decided that wasn't for her, and went back to searching online for other jobs. Her life is suddenly full of uncertainty, and she's not alone. The recruitment website LinkedIn says it has seen a 24% year-on-year drop in hiring for retail jobs, with jobs in recreation and travel even harder hit, down by 52% compared with January 2020. The biggest two growth areas for jobs are in healthcare, up 28% year-on-year, and transportation and logistics, up 11%. All those deliveries at the door are a warning bell for a changing jobs market. Amina Dahir, in Birmingham, is one of those people changing to become a carer. Her job as a cleaner in a shopping mall disappeared in the lockdown. ""It was really hard, but we just had hope that it was going to come back. But it's like there's no more security, if you understand. That's how I felt,"" says Amina, 40. ""So many people have lost their jobs."" But she's got a positive new direction. A work coach at the JobCentre Plus directed her to the care sector and the free training available. She says it will be rewarding to care for old people as well as getting qualifications for a more secure job. Amina expects it to be even harder after the pandemic, with more people chasing fewer jobs. ""When you lose your job you need training. You don't know what happens next. Lots of people don't even know where to look,"" she says. This video can not be played Ten tips for getting your dream job Across BBC News, as part of National Careers Week, we're hearing from people at a crossroads in their career and will aim to give tips and advice. How do I find a new job and who is hiring? Five things to focus on in your CV BBC Bitesize: Find some advice As part of the week, BBC 5live's Naga Munchetty will host a careers clinic from 13:15-14:00 GMT on Tuesday 2 March on theBBC News LinkedIn page,external. Amina's training, funded by the government, is being carried out by the adult education organisation the WEA, the Workers Educational Association, which has trained 36,000 people during the pandemic. ""It's worrying and frightening for many people at the moment, given the rapid rise in unemployment,"" says Simon Parkinson, the WEA's chief executive. ""It's hard enough at any stage of your career, but if you've been in a single industry for 15 or 20 years, it's devastating."" He says there can be stress and anxiety that starts ""spiralling downwards"". The challenge is to turn this round, he says, and show the ""world of work has changed massively"" - and there are new opportunities. ""It's about raising people's confidence, reminding people it's not too late. They need food on their table. They're the engine room of the economy. It's not the graduate jobs, it's the millions of people, 35- to 55-year-olds, that have worked in some of the backbone sectors of the country."" He says very practical barriers to recruitment are often overlooked - such as everything being online, including Zoom interviews. ""It is not true to think that everybody in the country has got a solid broadband connection and access to a laptop."" This video can not be played Shanique says she has applied for more than 50 graduate jobs While Amina was looking for training after losing her cleaning job, across the city Harriet Ferguson was graduating from the University of Birmingham. ""It's hard to know what's available,"" says the 23-year-old, ""and you can't go to careers events to go for an interview and meet people."" She been job hunting in the pandemic. Employment figures in February showed it was her age group that has been hardest hit - withalmost three-fifths of job losses falling on the under-25s. Harriet, from High Wycombe, wanted to work with young people and has got a six-month contract with the St John Ambulance cadet programme. But she is concerned about other young graduates struggling to find jobs, with worries about loneliness and being ""completely in the dark"" about what comes next. She has been volunteering to help other young jobseekers on the Class of 2020 website, and hears about their problems. ""It's so isolating,"" she says. ""The standard story is people sending in hundreds of applications. There's the sense that it's only you that's struggling, trying to be resilient, when it's rejection after rejection after rejection."" The pandemic has also shown up the vulnerability of those relying on insecure, temporary contracts. Ritu Panchal worked regularly for years as a teaching assistant, but through an agency. When her work in schools suddenly stopped in the lockdown, she had nothing to replace it. ""I didn't expect to be like this,"" says the 43-year-old from Hemel Hempstead. ""I never missed a day. Wherever they told me to go I went."" Ritu is training for qualifications to improve her chances of getting another teaching assistant job on a more permanent basis. A theme that keeps recurring, for young and old job hunters, is the uncertainty about where to get advice. There are no shortages of warnings about a ""perfect storm"" for jobs in the pandemic, but where do you look for the rescue boats? There are thousands of retraining courses offered online - many of them expensive - but which ones are really going to make a difference? Amina, part of the wave of people being retrained as carers, says advice should be offered when people are still working, before ""waiting for a crisis to come"". There is a wider issue of how much has been invested in adult careers advice, whether it has been taken seriously and how it is delivered. A probably apocryphal story, suggesting the lack of priority, is that when a senior minister was asked about careers advice, he joked that if careers advisers were so good how had they ended up as careers advisers? Many retraining schemes are reached through the Job Centre Plus system, including for those in work. Simon Parkinson at the WEA suggests there should be more ways of ""connecting with people"". ""People don't necessarily want to walk straight into a Job Centre. Particularly older workers, if they managed to come through the 1980s,"" he says. There are a growing number of government responses. TheNational Careers Service,externalhas free advice and a helpline, there's aSkills Toolkit,externalto find courses and 16-week ""boot camps"" teaching specific skills, such as coding and software development. Starting next month, the government's ""lifetime skills guarantee"" will include 400 free training courses for adults whose qualifications are below A-levels, in areas such as social care, childcare and construction. Under the ""Plan for Jobs"" scheme, there are initiatives such as Kickstart to create new jobs for 16- to 24-year-olds and Restart, which will have Â£400m in 2021-22 to provide support for the unemployed. Shop workers who have seen their store closing down will now have to start again For Tamsin Lynham, her shop is gone but she says she's feeling more positive and getting out her CV. ""To be honest, it's been a hard year."" She remembers the moment when they had a last cheer as they shut the shop, and the sadness afterwards. ""You think about all the people you've worked with, it was such a great place to work. I thought to myself: 'How much did these four walls stress me?' ""And people will think we were only selling clothes."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.99996424
"The prime minister says he has ""no doubt"" there will be a strong jobs-led recovery from coronavirus. Mr Johnson said it had ""been expensive"" to look after everyone during the pandemic and the chancellor would be ""frank"" about state of the economy in Wednesday's Budget. 45 Conservative MPs have urged Mr Sunak to cut business rates in England to help ""save the High Streets"". Labour has accused ministers of ""short-termism"". Writing to the chancellor ahead of the Budget, the MPs from constituencies in the North of England,  said the tax should be cut from 50% of market rent to 35%. Rishi Sunak has promised to offer businesses support while Covid-19 restrictions remain in place. But in a pre-Budget speech, Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the chancellor had no plan and had spent the crisis ""looking for the escape hatch"" rather than setting out a strategy to take the country forward. She said coronavirus had exposed ""the weaknesses of 10 years of Conservative mismanagement of our economy"". 'If I have to pay Â£13,000, it will destroy my shop' Tesco calls for online stores to pay sales tax Sunak pledges help in 'remaining stages of crisis' On Wednesday, Mr Sunak will use the Budget to set out the government's tax and spending plans following a year of financial disturbance and high government borrowing brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. He is facing pressure - including from the former Conservative Chancellor Ken Clarke - to raise taxes in order to repair public finances. However, others have argued that taxes could hinder the country's recovery from Covid-19. And now a group of MPs from the chancellor's own party - known as the Northern Research Group - have urged him to cut the tax paid by shops. The tax is calculated based on the value of a business's property. As part of emergency pandemic measures introduced last year, the government brought in a business rates holiday, but this is currently due to end in April. In a letter to Mr Sunak, the MPs - many of whom represent traditional Labour seats won by the Conservatives at the last election - argue that the burden of business rates is falling on areas most in need of support. They say cutting the tax, when it is reintroduced, would ""ensure retailers have the confidence to invest in their bricks and mortar stores and save High Streets across the country"". Although they acknowledge that the business rates holiday ""undoubtedly saved hundreds of retail businesses"", they also call for ""longer-term fundamental reform"" to help High Street shops compete against online retailers. On Sunday,the government announced a Â£5bn grant schemeto help High Street shops and hospitality reopen as the lockdown is eased. Asked about introducing a sales tax to target online retailers such as Amazon, Mr Sunak said he was trying to reach an international agreement with other countries ""on how to tax these large multinational digital companies properly"". A report from the treasury committee says now""is not the time for tax rises"". The cross-party group of MPs says increasing taxes could undermine the UK's economic recovery from Covid-19, but they may be needed at a later date. The main focus of the Budget will be support for people and businesses in, what the government hope will be, the last, difficult part of the Covid-19 crisis. That's why the Treasury has already announced another Â£5bn of grants for businesses that are still closed. Despite the publication of the roadmap for lifting the lockdown in England, there's still uncertainty about the future. And so the Chancellor will ""level with"" people about ""the challenges"" ahead for the public finances rather than setting out specific plans for raising more money and reducing borrowing. They will come later in the year, and will almost certainly include a gradual increase in corporation tax. Although the Treasury isn't commenting on that now. The economy performed better than expected at the end of last year, then worse at the start of this year because of the new lockdown. But the Bank of England is predicting bumper economic growth, thanks to a combination of the vaccine and households raring to spend money they've saved. That could make the chancellor's job a bit easier. This video can not be played The shadow chancellor says Wednesday's Budget's is a ""test of character for Rishi Sunak"". In a speech to Bloomberg, Anneliese Dodds accused the chancellor of looking for ""a quick fix"" and presiding over ""12 months of irresponsible decision making"". She said businesses and families had been ""left in the lurch"" because Mr Sunak had ""failed to make the link between health and the economy"". She called on the government to extend Covid-19 support measures including the furlough scheme, the business rates holiday, the reduced rate of VAT and the Â£500 payment for those self-isolating. Ms Dodds also accused Mr Sunak of implementing ""a triple hammer blow of council tax rises, social security cuts and pay freezes"". And she attacked the government for wasting money citing ""Â£22bn spent on the Test and Trace system, Â£150m spent on unsafe PPE and Â£2bn on contracts to businesses with clear links to the Conservative party, with no tender at all"". WATCH:What to expect EXPLAINED:What is the Budget and when will it happen? CLIMATE:Chancellor 'must use Budget to make finance green' ANALYSIS:Will the vaccine be a Budget recovery blueprint? She said a Labour government would bring forward Â£30bn of planned investment ""to support the creation of 400,000 new green jobs"" and would support 100,000 new businesses by expanding start-up loans. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday, Mr Sunak said he had responded to the pandemic ""generously and comprehensively"". ""We went big, we went early and there's more to come,"" he said. ""My priority is to keep supporting British families, businesses and people through this crisis - I said at the beginning I would do whatever it took to do exactly that and I remain committed to that and you'll see more of that in the Budget.""

"Poorer students in England are up to three A-level grades behind more affluent students, research suggests. The Education Policy Institute (EPI) said lower GCSE grades, then fewer and lower level qualifications aged 16-19, causes a ""disadvantage gap"". It found in some areas, poorer students were up to five grades behind. The Department for Education says it provided over Â£530m in 2020-21 to support college students. Students from poorer families begin their A-level or vocational courses already behind more affluent students, and continue to fall further behind, according to analysis by the EPI. In the first ever study to measure the education ""disadvantage gap"" among students aged 16-19, provisional findings show that across all qualifications, poorer students are the equivalent of three A-level grades behind similar students from richer families. Lockdown pupils 'three months behind in learning' Disadvantaged pupils 'stuck 18 months behind' Poor pupils face 'two-year catch up after lockdown' But there were variations across England, with poorer students the equivalent of around five A-level grades behind in areas including Knowsley on Merseyside, North Somerset  and Stockton-on-Tees. In sharp contrast in many London areas, poorer students are level with or even slightly ahead of their more affluent peers. The EPI looked at students' free school meal status during their last six years of school and their attainment, based on qualifications and grades between the end of secondary school and by the age of 19. It finds the gap is bigger in A-levels than vocational qualifications. The researchers say there was no progress in closing the gap between 2017 to 2019, and suggest it is likely to get worse due the impact of the pandemic which has effected poorer communities more severely. Sam Tuckett, senior researcher at the EPI, said: ""For the very first time, this exploratory research gives us a clear understanding of how disadvantaged sixth form and college students are progressing with their learning compared to their peers. ""Our findings demonstrate very plainly that deep-seated inequalities follow poorer teenagers from school through to sixth form and college, and continue to widen further compared to otherwise similar students, as they work towards their qualifications."" The big gaps in grades is largely explained by poorer students already having lower grades at the end of their GCSEs, the researchers say. Disadvantaged students are also more likely to take fewer and lower-level qualifications which adds to the gap in results. There is a ""strong case"" for extra funding for 16-19 education to stop poor pupils falling further behind, the report suggests. And targeted support is urgently needed to address learning losses caused by the pandemic, which is likely to impact the poorest students the most. David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, called for the pupil premium which gives extra money to schools to help poorer pupils, to be extended beyond the age of 16. ""Young people in England's school sixth forms and colleges have lower hours of teaching, less support and less enrichment than their peers in other countries, and less than those in private schools. That needs to change. Bill Watkin, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said the report provides a welcome perspective on the ""chronic underfunding"" of sixth form education. ""There is now a broad consensus that young people need additional support to recover from the disruption to their education caused by Covid, but as this report illustrates, sixth forms and colleges have been helping students to recover from a range of disadvantages for many years."" A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""We are determined to ensure disadvantaged students are properly supported while studying at college or sixth form so they can gain the skills they need to progress. ""This includes providing extra funding for disadvantaged 16 to 19-year-old students, specifically those with low prior attainment or who live in the most disadvantaged areas.""

"Cumbria County Council is still considering approval for the mine near Whitehaven Boris Johnson has been warned by some of his foreign ambassadors that a planned coal mine in Cumbria is damaging his reputation. The PM wantsto lead the world on climate change, but the ambassadors say his tacit support for the mine is bringing accusations of hypocrisy. The issue has flared as the UKco-hosts a coalition of nationspledging to phase out coal in power generation. The Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA) was initiated by the UK. Supporters of the Cumbria mine argue it should be encouraged because it will produce special coking coal for steel making, not thermal coal for power. But that's too fine a distinction for some developing nations. They have accused the UK of hypocrisy for shunning one type of coal while backing another. I understand some of the UK's ambassadors have told the government the Cumbria controversy is making it harder for them to persuade other nations to contribute fully to the UN climate summit Mr Johnson will host in November. Opponents of the mine say the government must support clean technologies to make steel without using coking coal. What is the Cumbria coal mine controversy about? It's a prickly dilemma for the PM. Around 85% of the coal from Cumbria will be exported but the project will create well-paid employment in so-called Red Wall constituencies whose Conservative MPs have promised to increase job prospects. Themine area has slightly below average unemployment,but it's forecast that manufacturing jobs in the north of England will be especially vulnerable as the UK economy moves away from fossil fuels. The government has a challenge to replace these with new jobs in clean industries. The UK's stance on coal will fall under the spotlight on Tuesday when the UK and Canada co-host the first virtual summit of the PPCA, which will be addressed by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. The Cabinet Office hopes the Cumbria problem can be resolved by then. If the mine goes ahead, it fears climate talks will be soured through the year as the UK invites other nations to abandon coal. In any event, the fate of the mine is in limbo. Cumbria County Council first approved it, then withdrew the decision to consider the latest advice from the UK's independent Climate Change Committee. This says the UK should abandon the use of coking coal by 2035, unless its emissions are captured and buried underground. Europe's major steel producers are already striving to make low-carbon steel, but Mark Jenkinson, a Conservative MP in the constituency next to the Whitehaven mine, thinks that will not be economical by 2035. He and other Conservative MPs have criticised the Labour party for trying to block the mine on climate change grounds. The council will make a new decision on the mine in coming months. If it grants permission again, the issue will bounce back to the Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick to decide on it.First time round he said it was purely a local issue. One solution might be for the government to introduce new rules obliging local councils to take climate change implications into account when they consider planning applications for high-carbon projects. Other nations are still investing in new coal mines and power plants The UK is not alone in wrestling with policy tensions in the transition to a low-carbon economy, especially as fossil projects approved years ago come to fruition in a new era when permission is likely to have been denied. Germany is also a member of the PPCA, yetit opened a new coal-fired power plant last year.,external Canada has committed to phase out coal-fired electricity by 2030, but there areplans for new and expanded coal mining production in the west of the country.,external It all comes asmajor emitters are again accused by the UN of not doing enoughto combat climate change.

"First Minister Mark Drakeford hosting a Welsh Government coronavirus news conference A poll suggests the Welsh public are more likely to believe the Welsh Government has handled the coronavirus outbreak better than UK ministers. The findings are in the annual St David's Day poll for BBC Wales carried out by ICM Unlimited. It suggests that seven in 10 (70%) people in Wales say the Cardiff government has dealt with things very or fairly well. Two in five (41%) say the same about the Westminster government. All adults in Wales to be offered jab by 31 July Tories demand Welsh Covid roadmap after PM's plan Wales 'first in UK to hit February vaccine target' Gregor Jackson from ICM says the pattern is similar to research commissioned by BBC Scotland in November which shows stronger approval of the Edinburgh parliament's performance than Westminster's. He added: ""The stronger backing of the Welsh rather than the UK Government's approach is likely to partly explain the drop in support for the Conservative Party, which is also suggested in the poll."" Responding to the poll findings, the Welsh Government said it had been working closely with the health service, councils and business ""as one Team Wales, to help save lives and livelihoods"". Meanwhile the UK Government said it had been ""tackling the pandemic as one United Kingdom, working closely with the devolved administrations and following the best scientific advice"". The poll also suggests that a majority of Welsh citizens feel that their income has been unaffected by the coronavirus crisis. The poll indicates most citizens in Wales feel their income has been unaffected by coronavirus Fifty-five per cent of respondents said there has been neither a positive nor negative impact as a result of the pandemic. However, there are nearly three times as many people who feel that the pandemic has negatively affected their personal finances compared to those who say the pandemic has positively affected them (32% vs 12%). ICM says these findings are broadly consistent with UK data from November last year. Thirty-nine per cent of respondents said the NHS should be the top priority after the pandemic The poll also indicates that the National Health Service is viewed as the most important area to prioritise once the emergency phase is over. Thirty-nine per cent of respondents chose the NHS as their top choice. After the health service, the economy and jobs are seen as the next priority for investment (32%), followed by education and schools (16%). A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""Our focus throughout the pandemic has been to keep Wales safe. ""We've introduced an unprecedented series of made-in-Wales measures, working closely with the Welsh NHS, local government, businesses and others, as one Team Wales, to help save lives and livelihoods. ""We know the last year has been a huge challenge for so many. We thank the people of Wales for their sacrifices and efforts during periods of lockdown, which have been key in driving down infection rates, and helped save so many lives."" A UK Government spokesperson said: ""From the very start we have been tackling the pandemic as one United Kingdom, working closely with the devolved administrations and following the best scientific advice. ""The UK Government acted quickly to deliver one of the most generous and comprehensive economic packages in the world, supporting more than 500,000 jobs in Wales and providing the Welsh Government with more than Â£6bn for its own pandemic response. ""The UK Government has also set up more than 50 testing sites in Wales, supplied additional PPE, set up mass testing when required and provided the support of the UK Armed Forces.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock hails data which shows a single shot of the main UK Covid vaccines cuts hospitalisations by 80% Number of new cases is coming down, but rate of decline has slowed, he says, but number of hospitalisations falling faster The number of Covid patients aged over 80 admitted to intensive care in the UK has dropped to single figures in the last couple of weeks English health officials are tying to trace a person who tested positive for the Brazilian variant of Covid-19, but did not get their result Dr Hopkins says Public Health England needs to trace a passenger who was on Swiss flight LX318 on 12 February Six cases of the P1 coronavirus variant first detected in Brazil have been found in England and Scotland Passengers complain of queues of up to seven hours long at Heathrow Airport's border control African countries start mass Covid inoculation drives using vaccines supplied through a scheme set up to share doses fairly with poorer nations Edited by Vanessa Barford That's all from today's live page team - Ashitha Nagesh, Claire Heald, Jennifer Meierhans, Joseph Lee, Kate Whannel, Lauren Turner, Vanessa Barford and Victoria Lindrea. Have a good evening and we will be back with more updates tomorrow. Here is a brief round-up of the main developments today. During the coronavirus lockdowns last year, fitness apps such as Strava and Freeleticsrecorded an increasein people using them. But how should you get started? And what are some of the things you need to focus on? Radio 1 Newsbeat has been chatting to personal trainer Cara Meehan on the dos and don'ts of joining the world of runners. Her tips include to start slowly, fuel yourself properly and remember those all-important stretches. Read more here. The chair of the Transport Select Committee believes the introduction of vaccine passports is ""inevitable"" in light of the European Commission's announcement of an equivalent scheme. ""It just makes sense now to make sure it's workable and will include everything that's needed to give people confidence to fly again,"" Conservative MP Hugh Merriman told Radio 4's PM. He added that he hoped the UK would not  ""tag along"" to the EU scheme but ""play a really big lead"". ""We can do that because our vaccine programme puts us further ahead, so we should be right at the start of this exercise, along with the likes of Israel."" He said the goal was to end up with a standardised app ""that is recognised by all."" He added that he was""frustrated"" by recent images of long queues of passengers at Border Control at Heathrowairport and he had raised the issue of Border Control staff last year and been given assurances. ""If we start to increase the numbers who can fly, once the vaccination programme is rolled out, then we've got to make sure we get it right. ""That means staff at the airports and the apps we've been talking about."" Earlier former health secretary Jeremy Hunt said the discovery of six cases of the Brazilian P1 variant of the coronavirus in the UK showed the need for tighter controls. ""Absolutely we have got to look at what has gone wrong,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme. ""It shows that it needs to be tightened up still further because if we are going to protect the road map out of lockdown then the name of the game is going to be stop new variants coming in, some of which may end up being immune to the new vaccines,"" he says. ""Where we need to get to is a much, much more thorough combination of test and trace and genetic sequencing so we are not just testing the people who have been near someone who tested positive, but we also are working out where the original infection happened and which variant it is. You can only do that if you bring the cases right down."" However, Hunt - who now chairs the Commons Health and Social Care Committee - says the country was in a much better situation than it was last year. ""The fact that we are going to this trouble over one person who has gone missing says to me that we are in much better shape than we were three months ago, six months ago, where we wouldn't have been anywhere near that,"" he says. Israel's Supreme Court has banned the government from tracking the mobile phones of coronavirus carriers. The technology, developed by counter-terrorism agency Shin Bet, has been used on and off since March 2020 as part of efforts to curb the spread of the virus. It uses the locations of people with Covid to track others they have come into contact with. In its ruling today, the Supreme Court said it feared the surveillance technology - which was initially imposed as an emergency measure - is gradually becoming permanent, and that the government is heading down a ""slippery slope of using extreme and undemocratic means in the fight against the epidemic"". Deputy Health Minister Yoav Kisch later tweeted that the ruling was ""a crime against the health of Israeli citizens"". The government now has two weeks to stop using the technology. England's deputy chief medical officer said the latest scientific data had ""vindicated"" the UK's decision to give the AstraZeneca vaccine to older people. Some countries,such as Germanyand France, have refused to administer the vaccine to the over-65s because of a lack of testing data on older age groups. Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation ""took a view that it almost certainly would work"", after agreeing it was ""not immunologically plausible"" the vaccine would be effective among younger people but not older ones. ""The PHE (Public Health England) data have clearly vindicated that approach today,"" he said. ""I am not here to criticise other countries, but to say that I think in time the data emerging from our programme will speak for itself and other countries will doubtless be very interested in it."" Officials in Japan have asked China to stop carrying out anal swab tests on Japanese citizens who enter the country, saying people have complained that it caused them ""psychological distress"". China started carrying out anal swabs for Covid in January. The tests involve inserting a cotton swab 3-5cm (1.2-2.0 inches) into the anus and gently rotating it. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said they made the request through the embassy in Beijing, and noted that the use of anal swabs ""has not been confirmed anywhere else in the world"". China has yet to respond to the request, he added. Last week, Chinese officialsdenied that they had made US diplomats undergo anal testingafter US media reported that some had complained about the procedure. Read more about this story here The health secretary hailed new data highlighting the ability of the Covid vaccines to reduce serious illness - and fielded questions about the ongoing search for a missing case of the Brazil variant in the UK. About 26,000 police officers and 3,800 soldiers have been deployed in the Czech Republic to enforce new lockdown measures. The country is currently seeing the worst Covid surge in the world, with the highest per capita infection rate over the last week. Prime Minister Andrej Babis has warned that the healthcare system could collapse without the new lockdown restrictions, as a record number of Covid patients in the country are in a serious condition. Under the new rules, which are in place for three weeks, people are being confined to their home districts, and the two school year groups that were still attending in-person classes - pre-school and second grade - are switching to home learning. However, people who need to travel for work are exempt from the travel restrictions. Factories are also still open - a decision that Babis has faced criticism for. BBC Radio 5 Live Farzana Hussain says there is 'historical mistrust' around vaccines More than 20 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. But vaccine hesitancy is still a big issue in some communities. In the over 80s, 93% of white people have had the jab, compared to 76% of South Asian people and 61% of black
 people. GP Farzana Hussain told BBC Radio 5 Liveâs Naga Munchetty that ""for black Africans and Afro-Carribeans, it does seem to be a historical mistrust in the system"". ""For South Asians...there's
 a lot of myths around the vaccine containing animal products which doesn't help them if they want to comply with their faith, and also a real myth about infertility. Both of which are of course completely untrue,"" she said. Ima Miah is the CEO of
 the misinformation-tackling Asian Resource Centre (ARC) in Croydon. She told Naga that theyâve had to work hard to bust myths about the virus. ""There were myths around: Why did this happen? Where did this virus come from? Was it something intentional? Was it something targeted at the BAME people? Was it something to get rid of old people
 because they didn't matter?"" she said. Ima added that the distrust is stronger in certain communities because of the âdisproportionate impact on BAME
 communities in the first place"". Listen
 to 5 Live on the free BBC Sounds app. Polish President Andrzej Duda has spoken with Chinese leader Xi Jinping about possibly purchasing China's Covid-19 vaccines, his aide has told state news agency PAP, despite them not yet being approved by the European Medical Agency (EMA). ""The president also raised the issue of Polish-Chinese cooperation in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, including the possibility of purchasing vaccines produced in China,"" aide Krzysztof Szczerski told the agency. Poland wouldn't be the first EU nation to buy Chinese vaccines before they're given EU approval. Last week, Hungary became the first country in the union to start using vaccines produced by Chinese state-owned company Sinopharm. Hungary also gave emergency approval to Russia's Sputnik V vaccine in January, and has already rolled it out - despite it not being approved by the EMA either. The EU has beencriticised for the slow pace of vaccinations in its member states. A boy cycles past a mural of Covid-19 virus There's been lots of talk today about the P1 Brazil variant after six cases were found in the UK. There have been concerns vaccines may not be as effective against this variant, but NHS England's Prof Stephen Powis said vaccines could be ""rapidly adapted"". Understanding how new variants of the coronavirus in Brazil,
South Africa and the UK are altering the behaviour of the virus will be crucial in our vaccine arms race against Covid-19. This is how new Covid-19 variants are changing the pandemic. Asked which step in the roadmap he is most concerned about, as children return to school on Monday, the health secretary says it's all about ""safe steps"". ""We have set out the tests precisely so we can be sure the data still allows for safe steps down the roadmap."" He adds he is ""highly confident""  the opening of schools on 8 March is ""the right thing to do"". Dr Hopkins says the slow strategy - and the five-week gaps between each measure - are needed ""to give time after each event to monitor the impact"" particularly on hospitalisations and deaths. Professor Van-Tam joins her in stating the importance of having time ""to consider the effect of each step before we move on"". He stresses the need to relax measures ""in a very long-term way."" He says instead of ""stuttering steps... I would rather take much slower, more pronounced steps that always go in one direction.""  Jill Lawless from Associated Press asks what Matt Hancock thinks of the digital ""green pass"" the EU is proposing to prove Covid-free travel and which steps of the roadmap he is most concerned about. Hancock says: ""This already exists because you need to have a test before you can travel to the UK...and the EU proposal is that certification includes whether you've had the vaccine and whether you've recently had the test. Therefore it's something that we are working with them and others on and it matters that we get the details of this right for international travel."" He says: ""The roadmap is designed to be able to see the data before we take each step and we've done it that way in order to be able to have the assurance that we are taking a cautious but irreversible path out of this pandemic."" Macer Hall from the Express asks if ""double masking"" is a good idea. He also asks how the UK will ensure people get the second vaccine dose. ""The more layers you have the better,"" replies Dr Hopkins, adding that the recommendation is for ""at least two layers and ideally three in a mask"". On the second question, Hancock says he hasn't seen reticence among the population to get their second jab. Prof Van-Tam emphasises the importance of getting the second dose saying there is a ""significant likelihood that a second dose will mature your immune response possibly make it broader, and almost certainly make it longer than just having a first dose"". Thomas Moore at Sky says there is a missing case of the P1 variant but we do not know who or where or whether they've self-isolated. He asks how such a concerning new variant has been allowed to slip through the net? He also asks Prof Jonathan Van-Tam to level with him over any prospect of a holiday abroad this summer when new variants are crossing our borders and there's still no vaccine with in-built universal protection against all strains of the virus. Matt Hancock says there's a high chance the identification of the sixth case came through the surge testing used in places where they were looking for other variants of concern. Without this huge surveillance we wouldn't know about it and about 30% of cases are being sequenced, he says. On holidays, Prof Van-Tam says ""we are still in a zone of great uncertainty about what the virus will do next"". Many of the vaccination programmes in Europe are running behind ours and whether we can go on holiday depends on what other countries will say and do in terms of foreign tourism, he says. ""There has to be great uncertainty at the moment,"" he says. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said people studying the new data should see that both vaccines are ""extremely effective"" after one dose. ""I absolutely hope that, right round the world, people study the data and understand that getting the Pfizer or AstraZeneca jab is the right thing to do - and it could save your life"". Matt Hancock has denied that delays in imposing quarantine on travellers to the UK has put people at risk. ""We had already put in place measures against people travelling from Brazil,"" he said, adding that the rules - self-isolating at home - had been followed by the five people detected. And the health secretary added that there was ""no evidence the sixth case did not follow those rules."" He said it showed the system that was in place had managed to control the spread so far, and he pointed to the stricter measures now in place. Professor Van-Tam was asked what impact the new data would have on our everyday lives, but said it was ""going to take time until we can apply the results in a more generalised way"". He said, ultimately, he expected vaccine to lower levels of disease across the country, to reduce the likelihood of infection among the older and more vulnerable. He added that those given the vaccine would be less likely to suffer ""severe consequences"" of Covid once vaccinated. ""The ratio of mild to severe cases should increase in favour of mild cases over time."" ""The problem isn't fixed yet, but we have identified how to fix it.""   The next question comes from ITV's Romilly Weeks who asks if the health secretary is reconsidering reopening schools in England given the presence of the Brazil variant in the UK. ""We do not think there is a need to change approach on schools because of the new variant,"" replies Hancock. ""Our goal is to contain transmission to these six people,"" he adds. Dr Susan Hopkins says the ONS and React studies have not found any P1 cases. The data is ""reassuring"" she says but adds ""we are still on guard"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Now is ""not the time for tax rises"" as they could undermine the UK's economic recovery from Covid - but they may be needed at a later date, MPs have said. Ahead of the Budget announcement on Wednesday, a Treasury Committee report says public finances are on an ""unsustainable long-term trajectory"". It says some tax rises may not harm recovery, but advises against others. The committee's chairman, Mel Stride, told the BBC it was ""almost inevitable"" that some tax rises would occur. There has been much speculation that the rate of corporation tax might rise, and Mr Stride told the BBC's Today programme: ""Putting up taxes is in general not a great thing to do but we are where we are and I think the committee view is that looking at income tax and looking at corporation tax is... the right way to go."" Mr Stride added: ""Each 1% increase in corporation tax raises about Â£3bn so I think... [it] is almost inevitable that some level of rise in going to occur."" He added that the UK had cut corporation tax rates from 28% to 19% and was extremely competitive with the rest of the world so ""there seems to be scope for some modest increase"". The Conservatives' election promise was not to raise rates of national insurance, income tax or VAT, but Mr Stride said that did not include the level at which people started paying tax, and those levels could be frozen. Freezing thresholds would mean more people paying more tax as wages rose. The Treasury Committee's report said: ""With our public finances on an unsustainable long-term trajectory, our clear message is that Budget 2021 is not the time for tax rises or fiscal consolidation, which could undermine the economic recovery. ""But we will probably need to see significant fiscal measures, including revenue raising, in the future."" The report, published as part of the Tax After Coronavirus inquiry, comes afterRishi Sunak said he must ""level with people""about the economy. On Wednesday, Mr Sunak will use the Budget to set out the government's tax and spending plans following a year of financial disturbance and high government borrowing brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. The huge amounts of money spent on pandemic support schemes have meant that government borrowing for this financial year has now reached Â£270.6bn, which is Â£222bn more than a year ago,according to the Office for National Statistics.,external More than Â£46bn has been spent covering salaries as part of the furlough scheme, for example, and tens of billions of pounds on guaranteeing loans to businesses. The committee recommends a number of actions it says could raise additional money for the government without hampering economic recovery. As well as mentioning corporation tax rises and income tax thresholds, it suggested that stamp duty, a tax paid by people buying properties, is ""economically inefficient"" and causes damage to the economy by ""affecting when and how often people buy homes"". The government should also look at introducing a ""loss carry-back"" for trading losses, it said. This would allow losses made during the pandemic to be set against up to three previous profitable years, generating a tax refund for both incorporated and unincorporated firms. Budget 2021: The challenges facing Rishi Sunak Mortgage guarantee to help buyers with 5% deposit BBC editors on what to expect in the Budget It also called a review of the tax treatment of the self-employed ""long overdue"" and said the current system is ""confused, unfair and unsustainable"". The chancellor has said he ""is preparing a Budget that provides support for people"" as Covid lockdown rules are eased. At the earliest, restrictions in England are set to be fully lifted by 21 June. However, Mr Sunak also said he wanted to ""be honest"" with the public about the pandemic's impact on the economy and ""clear about what our plan to address that is"". This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak says the shock to the economy cannot be fixed overnight He warned high levels of borrowing had meant the UK was ""more sensitive to interest rate changes"" and that debt could ""rise indefinitely"" if borrowing continued after the recovery. A Treasury spokesman said that, since the start of the pandemic, more than Â£280bn had been invested to protect jobs and businesses. ""We've been able to respond comprehensively and generously through this crisis because of our strong public finances,"" he said. ""The chancellor has made clear that once our economy recovers, we should look to return the public finances to a more sustainable footing. ""We will level with people about how we'll do that - and at the Budget this week we'll set out support for the economic recovery while being up front about the need to repair the public finances once the recovery takes hold."" What is the Budget and when will it happen? 'If I have to pay Â£13,000, it will destroy my shop' Chancellor 'must use Budget to make finance green' 'Furlough is a lifeline, I hope they extend it' Sunak pledges help in 'remaining stages of crisis' Budget 2021: The challenge facing Sunak What to expect in the Budget.

""Change only occurs from an awareness of larger cultural problems, as well as a long-term commitment to systemic change"", she wrote.
