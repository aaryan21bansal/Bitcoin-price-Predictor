"Josh Rivers became Gay Times Editor last month The newly appointed Gay Times editor Josh Rivers has been suspended over offensive tweets he posted in the past. The tweets, some of which have now been deleted, have been described as racist, transphobic, homophobic and anti-Semitic. Mr Rivers, whohas since apologised,external, also made remarks about obese people and children with disabilities. The magazine said the tweets ""do not align with the values of Gay Times, or any of our employees"". It added: ""Josh has been suspended with immediate effect while we investigate the facts. Appropriate action will be taken in due course."" Rivers was appointed editor in October. In a statement he said: ""I have long taken steps to address the issues that prevented me from treating people with the respect and kindness I value so dearly now. ""It is because of my past and my own awakening that I've since pivoted everything in my life towards supporting and empowering our community."" He expressed sadness that ""the damage I caused before has now resurfaced to cause more pain"". Benjamin Cohen, Chief Executive of LGBT news organisation PinkNews, told the BBC: ""I am frankly appalled at the litany of offensive Twitter posts that Josh Rivers made over a number of years. ""It is beyond surprising that the level of inappropriate and hurtful comments were not uncovered by Gay Times during the recruitment process for the appointment of the key role of editor. ""As someone who for many years wrote a column for Gay Times, I'm saddened that what was a great institution has had its brand so recklessly damaged by someone who was in office for just a few weeks.""

"New powers to fund house-building have been announced, as ministers promised more measures in next week's Budget. Housing associations will be reclassified as private bodies allowing their Â£70bn debt to be removed from the government's balance sheet. They said the technical change would allow them to build more affordable homes. But Labour said the government had no coherent plan to address the ""housing crisis"". Latest figures show 217,350 ""additional dwellings"" in England last year, which includes new builds, conversions and changes of use. This was up by 27,700 up on 2015-16. Labour said any increase was welcome but that house-building had still not returned to the level it reached before the global financial crisis. Kuenssberg: Ministers debate way forward on housing McDonnell demands 'emergency budget' May unveils Â£2bn council homes plan House price 'north-south divide' narrows Visiting a north London housing estate, Prime Minister Theresa May pledged to take ""personal charge"" of the government's strategy to address what is widely regarded as the chronic shortage of new affordable homes being built, particularly for rent. There have been reports of tensions within the cabinet about whether the government should be borrowing tens of billions to directly fund more schemes. In a speech in Bristol, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said the decision by the Office for National Statistics to remove housing association debt from the UK balance sheet would help create a more ""stable investment environment"" for the thousands of providers. Housing associations were classified as public bodies in 2015 because of the way they were funded - a move that led to warnings it would hamper their ability to fund new house-building. Analysis By BBC home editor Mark Easton In 2015, the Office for National Statistics shocked the government by announcing that ministerial control of housing associations had become so intrusive they could no longer be seen as charities or private businesses. Overnight, all their borrowing was added to the public debt. Now, after the drafting of new regulations currently going through Parliament, the ONS has agreed the government has become hands-off enough again to take all that debt away. The announcement of the change, before the new regulations have come into law, appears to be part of a move to encourage Philip Hammond to offer more help to the housing sector. Whether such pressure will move the Treasury to loosen the purse strings remains to be seen. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said it strongly supported the reclassification. It said housing associations built nearly 50,000 new homes last year, including social and affordable rental properties. The federation added: ""This change will allow them to build on their strong track record and secure the long-term finance needed to build even more affordable homes."" Mr Javid said the rethink would help ""lay the foundation"" for thousands and thousands of new homes. But he warned new thinking is required to stop ""a rootless generation"" of tenants drifting from one short-term tenancy to another. ""There are many, many faults in our housing market, dating back many many years. If you only fix one you will make some progress but not enough. This is a big problem and we have to think big."" He also said the government would be intervening in the case of 15 local authorities which have failed to produce a local plan for housing development in their area. More than 1.2 million families in England are currently on the waiting for council accommodation while in 2015-6 only 6,800 social rented homes were completed. The Local Government Association said councils should be given the same freedom to borrow to build.

"Matthew Herbert destroyed some instruments on BBC Radio 3's Between the Ears A musician who wants to tour Europe to heal the ""huge divisions"" caused by Brexit has been given a grant by the UK Department for International Trade. Matthew Herbert said he wanted to correct the impression created by Leave campaigners that the UK was ""retreating into an absurd little enclave"". He said he wanted to get the message out: ""We are still listening, we want to be friends, we want to collaborate."" Herbert has also set Article 50 to music and plans Brexit-themed concerts. The experimental musician, who also gets funding from the British Council, is one of 12 artists sharing Â£181,944 grant money from the department headed by Liam Fox, who was one of the key campaigners for a Leave vote in the UK's 2016 EU referendum. BBC Radio 3: Matthew Herbert - sound pioneer Making music from the sounds of Abbey Road,external So far the department - which aims to promote international trade and is seeking to agree free trade agreements after Brexit - has handed out Â£2.4m to support British acts in their bid to ""become the next Adele or Ed Sheeran"". As well as Matthew Herbert, the twice Mercury prize-nominated Ghostpoet and Public Service Broadcasting have also been named as the latest recipients of the grants under the Music Export Growth Scheme, although the department would not say how much each has received. Herbert, who was last year commissioned by BBC Radio 3 to deconstruct Beethoven - see the tweet below for how he did it - is known for his use of sampled sounds. On one previous album he chronicled the life cycle of a pig through the noises it made. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Sir Bradley Wiggins won five Olympic gold medals, as well as a silver medal and two bronze medals Sir Bradley Wiggins said his life was ""a living hell"" during an investigation into allegations of wrongdoing at British Cycling and Team Sky. On Wednesday, UK Anti-Doping saidthere would be no chargesover a ""mystery"" medical package delivered for Wiggins at the Criterium du Dauphine in 2011. Wiggins, 37, said the investigation ""felt nothing less than a witch hunt"". He added: ""Being accused of any doping indiscretion is the worst possible thing for any professional sportsman."" Wiggins won five Olympic gold medals and the 2012 Tour de France before retiring fromcycling in December 2016. It was alleged that the package that was the focus of the investigation contained a banned substance  - but the doctor involved, Dr Richard Freeman, said it was a legal decongestant, Fluimucil. The 14-month investigation has been closed and a Ukad statement said it would only ""revisit matters if new and material information were to come to light"". Ukad said it was unable to ""definitively confirm the contents of the package"" because of a ""lack of contemporaneous evidence"". Its chief executive Nicole Sapstead said the investigation was hindered by the ""lack of accurate medical records"" held by British Cycling. Wiggins, British Cycling and Team Sky have always denied any wrongdoing. March 2017 Q&A on cycling inquiry Wiggins said in a statement:,external""I welcome Ukad's confirmation that no anti-doping charges are to be brought regarding the so-called 'jiffy-bag' allegations. ""It has always been the case that no such charges could be brought against me as no anti-doping violations took place. I am pleased this has finally been confirmed publicly. ""This period of time has been a living hell for me and my family, full of innuendo and speculation. At times it has felt nothing less than a malicious witch hunt."" Wiggins, who said he would assess potential legal options, was unhappy with Ukad's statement and questioned the body's decision to begin an investigation. ""To say I am disappointed by some of the comments made by Ukad this morning is an understatement,"" added Wiggins. ""No evidence exists to prove a case against me and in all other circumstances this would be an unqualified finding of innocence. ""Where did the information come from to launch the investigation? ""Who was the source? What exactly did that person say and to whom? ""Why did Ukad deem it appropriate to treat it as a credible allegation?"" BBC sports editor Dan Roan With no clarity over what was in the now-infamous jiffy bag delivered to Team Sky in 2011, this represents a wholly unsatisfactory end to a saga that has tainted some of the biggest reputations in British sport, and exposed Ukad's lack of power. Its statement is deliberately nuanced, falling short of an exoneration of those involved, much to Sir Bradley Wiggins' dismay in a blistering statement, despite Britain's most decorated Olympian facing no charges. But while the end of the investigation will come as a relief to many in the sport, the lack of medical records, the inaccuracies in Team Sky's initial explanations for the mystery delivery, the unavailability of key witness Dr Richard Freeman to Ukad investigators, the theft of his laptop, and the medical exemptions that Wiggins had before major races, all mean that suspicion will linger. The close relationship between Team Sky and the governing body (who still share headquarters in Manchester) is also again under scrutiny. And at best, the attention to detail that was once the mantra of Team Sky and British Cycling has been exposed as hollow. In October 2016,the Daily Mail reported,externalthat Team Sky's Dr Richard Freeman had received a package from Simon Cope, then working as a coach for British Cycling's women's teams, on the final day of the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine. The package was alleged to be for Sir Bradley Wiggins, who won the race. Ukad then began an investigation into the contents of the package. At a Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee hearing in December 2016, Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford - already facing questions afterhackers had revealedWiggins had received a therapeutic use exemption (TUE) to take banned anti-inflammatory drug triamcinolone for allergies and respiratory issues before key races -said that he had been told by Dr Freeman that the package contained Fluimucil. Freeman, who was simultaneously employed by British Cycling and Team Sky between 2009 and 2015, missed the hearing through ill health but the DCMS committee was told that in 2014 he had a laptop containing medical records stolen while he was on holiday. Freeman was off work from British Cycling with a stress-related illness before resigning last month. Brailsford's testimony was widely questioned. Cope was alleged to have flown into Geneva Airport and driven for two hours to France to deliver the package, but 2008 Olympic champion Nicole Cooke pointed out that Fluimucil is available freely over the counter in France, and that there were eight pharmacies located within five kilometres of where the team received the package. David Kenworthy, the previous chairman of Ukad,told the BBCin January the answers given by figures within British Cycling and Team Sky to the DCMS committee were ""very disappointing"". In an interview with the BBC in January,Brailsford refused to confirm or deny whether he or anyone else at Team Sky had been able to provide paperwork to prove the package contained Fluimucil. ""I will give what I have got to Ukad,"" he said. ""I said what I had to say in the DCMS and I am leaving it there."" Team Sky subsequently said that they were ""confident"" no wrongdoing would be found when the inquiry was concluded.

"Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has demanded ""an emergency Budget for our public services"", which he says are in crisis. He is promising to spend about Â£17bn a year extra on the NHS, social care, schools and local government. The extra spending would be paid for by tax rises for companies and ""the rich"", while tackling tax avoidance. The government said Labour's plans would lead to more debt, higher taxes and fewer jobs. Chancellor Philip Hammond is due to give his Budget speech next Wednesday afternoon. What to watch for in next week's Budget Borrowing boost for social housing In a speech at Church House in Westminster, Mr McDonnell called for an end to austerity by the government and set out five main proposals: Pause the roll-out of Universal Credit to fix delays in benefits payments Fund public sector pay rises Put more money into infrastructure such as road and rail projects Increase funding for health, education, and local government Launch a large-scale house-building programme. He said the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, was out of touch with the lives of ordinary people and there was growing anger after seven years of austerity. ""They were told austerity was the solution to the economic crisis,"" he said. ""So it's understandable that after seven years of the austerity solution, they are angry when they queue for hours at A&E, see their school laying off teaching assistants, their Surestart centre closing and the local neighbourhood police withdrawn from their streets. ""Especially, while at the same time, they learn about the Paradise Papers and the tax avoidance of the super-rich."" Mr McDonnell said the Conservatives were giving away about Â£76bn in cuts to corporation tax, capital gains tax and ""the rich"" during the life of this Parliament. He said Labour had already calculated Â£6.5bn could be raised from clamping down on tax avoidance, but he believed that could be significantly higher after the leaking of the Paradise Papers. A global investigation looked at 13.4 million previously secret documents that revealed offshore investments made by companies, politicians and wealthy individuals. John McDonnell wants to create a clear red line between him and the present incumbent of Number 11, Philip Hammond. A week ahead of the Budget, the shadow chancellor has said that more should be spent on health, education and housing and that the public sector pay cap of 1% should be lifted. The controversial introduction of the new benefits system - the universal credit - should also be delayed after evidence that some recipients were being left without payments for several weeks. To pay for the new policies, Mr McDonnell will say he is willing to borrow more to invest in infrastructure, arguing it is a good time to do so as interest rates are at historic lows. It is a position rejected by the Conservatives, with Mr Hammond saying that more borrowing now simply means more debts to be repaid in the future. It is expected that he will focus any new spending on health and housing in the Budget, next Wednesday. Mr McDonnell said more action was needed to tackle what he called the ""housing crisis"". The government is towipe about Â£70bn worth of debt from housing associations' balance sheets,allowing them to raise money more cheaply. But Mr McDonnell described it as ""accountancy tricks"" and called for more funding. ""The scale of the crisis demands action on an equal scale. We need at least 100,000 new social homes a-year funded and built by this government, to even begin to address the problem."" He said Mr Hammond could do far more. ""He wants to pretend he cannot invest on the scale needed, yet he has already borrowed more in his first year as chancellor than any of his predecessors in their first year at the Treasury."" Responding to Mr McDonnell's proposals, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said: ""The shadow chancellor has today admitted Labour would borrow billions more and hike up taxes to record levels. ""The costs would rack up and up - putting economic growth at risk and hitting ordinary working people in the pocket. ""Only the Conservatives can build a country that is fit for the future.""

"Private Conor McPherson died during a night-time ""live fire"" exercise A soldier killed in a training exercise was shot by a colleague who mistook him for a target, a report has found. Private Conor McPherson was critically injured during a night-time ""live fire"" exercise at Otterburn, Northumberland. The Defence Safety Authority's Service Inquiry report identified a number of Army failings in the run-up to the incident. The Army has said it ""deeply regrets"" the death the young soldier, which was ""a terrible, terrible tragedy"". Private McPherson, 24, from The Black Watch, 3rd Battalion, the Royal Regiment of Scotland, was pronounced dead at the scene on 22 August last year. The report stated that soldiers using live rounds had been stumbling about in the dark. Lieutenant General Richard Felton, director general of the Defence Safety Authority, said he could not understand why the trainees were subjected to an 18-hour plus day. It also emerged the opening day of Exercise Wessex Storm at the Heely Dod Range featured nine different shooting sequences. But Lieutenant General Felton said the safety risk present that night ""was neither recognised - nor the potential consequences understood - by the Fire Team, supervising staff or Battalion leadership"". While it was ""highly likely"" Private McPherson, from Paisley, Renfrewshire, was shot by one of his colleagues, another soldier did not fire a single round because he found it impossible to identify any targets in the gloom. Lieutenant General Felton said: ""The tragic death of Pte Conor McPherson serves as a reminder of the dangers inherent in Military training."" But he added:"" Military training must continue to test and challenge, with progression through a unit's training cycle correctly adding complexity and greater levels of Safety Risk. ""To not do so would reduce the value of training and the preparedness of our soldiers to fight and win in future conflicts."" Private McPherson had already trained in France and Kenya by the time he joined the fatal exercise with colleagues from 3 Platoon A Company 3 Scots. Their final mission that day was to negotiate a firing range, using live ammo as the infantrymen moved towards rigid targets, without any fixed illumination. A reconstruction ordered by the inquiry found that the LUCIE Universal night vision goggles and ear plugs worn by Pte McPherson were not cleared for use in this type of exercise. The probe into the incident has identified eight ""contributory factors"" that made the accident more likely to happen that night, including a lack of effective supervision of the soldier who fired the shot. The investigating panel said it is highly likely a solder named only as ""firer 2"" - a private who had been in the military for five and a half years - misidentified Private McPherson as a target and fired the fatal round. Colonel Jim Taylor of HQ Field Army, Training branch welcomed the inquiry's findings, saying: ""It has done outstanding work to identify what went wrong. ""In particular, their reconstruction of the events that night has been invaluable in helping us identify what caused the accident and the factors which contributed to it.  We are now carefully considering its recommendations. ""We care about our soldiers above all else and we do everything we can to reduce the risks to them as they conduct the essential training required to prepare them for combat operations."" A spokeswoman for Northumbria Police said:""The death is still being investigated and Northumbria Police is working with the Health and Safety Executive and the Coroner.""

"This video can not be played The painting has been cleaned and restored from the image on the left to the one on the right A 500-year-old painting of Christ believed to have been painted by Leonardo da Vinci has been sold in New York for a record $450m (Â£341m). The painting is known as Salvator Mundi (Saviour of the World). It is the highest auction price for any work of art and brought cheers and applause at the packed Christie's auction room. Leonardo da Vinci died in 1519 and there are fewer than 20 of his paintings in existence. Read aboutLeonardo da Vinci (1452 -1519) 'Mona Lisa nude sketch' found in France Can buying paintings make you rich? Salvator Mundi, believed to have been painted sometime after 1505, is the only work thought to be in private hands. Bidding began at $100m and the final bid for the work was $400m, with fees bringing the full price up to $450.3m. The unidentified buyer was involved in a bidding contest, via telephone, that lasted nearly 20 minutes. Excitement in the auction room rose as the bids by telephone came in The painting shows Christ with one hand raised, the other holding a glass sphere. In 1958 it was sold at auction in London for a mere Â£45. By then the painting was generally reckoned to be the work of a follower of Leonardo and not the work of Leonardo himself. It apparently was part of King Charles I of England's collection in the 1600s and got lost, but was ""rediscovered"" in 2005. Analysis by Arts Editor Will Gompetz $450m for Salvator Mundi is an astonishing price to have realised, given both its condition and authenticity have been questioned. It shows that ultimately art comes down to belief. And there were plenty of bidders last night who were suitably convinced by its Leonardo da Vinci attribution to drive the price up to such stratospheric heights. As yet, the new owner is unknown. Speculation will be rife. Which I will contribute to, by noting the newly opened Louvre Abu Dhabi will have a Leonardo shaped hole in its displays when the decade-long loan deal with the French museums comes to an end. Wherever it ends up, you've got to hand it to Christie's for its masterclass in the art of selling art. Art agents celebrated when the sale was completed In a bold move, without a hint of irony, the painting was sold in its Post-War and Contemporary Art Evening Sale alongside a Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol. Why not in the Old Masters Sale? Because that's not where the elephant bucks are. The big money comes into the room nowadays when Pollocks and Twomblys are on the block, and promptly leaves when the Reynolds and Winterhalters arrive. Read more of Will Gompertz's blogs here. This video can not be played Salvator Mundi was discovered hidden under layers of paint Dr Tim Hunter, who is an expert in Old Master and 19th Century art, told the BBC the painting is ""the most important discovery in the 21st Century"". ""It completely smashes the record for the last Old Masters painting to sell - Van Gogh's Sunflowers in 1988. Records get broken from time to time but not in this way. ""Da Vinci painted less than 20 oil paintings and many are unfinished so it's incredibly rare and we love that in art."" Before the auction it was owned by Russian billionaire collector Dmitry E Rybolovlev, who is reported to have bought it in a private sale in May 2013 for $127.5m (Â£98m). The painting has had major cosmetic surgery - its walnut panel base has been described as ""worm-tunnelled"" and at some point it seems to have been split in half - and efforts to restore it resulted in abrasions. BBC arts correspondent Vincent Dowd said that even now attribution to Leonardo is not universally accepted. One critic has described the surface of the painting to be ""inert, varnished, lurid, scrubbed over and repainted so many times that it looks simultaneously new and old"". ""Any private collector who gets suckered into buying this picture and places it in their apartment or storage, it serves them right,"" Jerry Saltz wrote on Vulture.com. But Christie's has insisted the painting is authentic and billed it as ""the greatest artistic rediscovery of the 20th Century"". Georgina Adam, who is an Art Market specialist, told the BBC the price of the piece is ""fuelled by the sheer amount of money that billionaires have."" ""This is the last Leonardo painting you can buy. This isn't as a store of value, it's the ultimate trophy - only one person in the world can own this. ""If you think of the wealth of some billionaires, Bill Gates is worth 87 billion, and I'm not saying it's him, but near to half a billion would not be a colossal chunk out of his income for example."" The auction house has not revealed who purchased the picture, but Hunter speculates it could be a buyer from Asia or even be on the way to the newLouvre in Abu Dhabi. Could the painting be headed for Abu Dhabi's new Louvre Museum? ""It's the sort of painting you can imagine as a star piece in a private collection and as billionaire collectors like to set up their own museums, it could be a good piece for them,"" Hunter said. Adam also thinks the piece could have gone to an Asian market. ""We don't know who bought it, I went to the Louvre in Abu Dhabi and I did wonder whether the Gulf could be responsible. ""People are thinking the Far East, the picture was taken to Hong Kong before it was put up for sale to show to possible buyers there so that is possible.

"Richard Ratcliffe told a press conference he raised the issue of diplomatic protection for his wife The Foreign Office is still considering whether it will give diplomatic protection to a British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held by Tehran since April 2016 after being accused of spying - charges she denies. Her husband raised the issue of her being given diplomatic protection in a meeting with the foreign secretary. The Foreign Office said lawyers would discuss the issue but said the question was whether it would help her case. Richard Ratcliffe met with Boris Johnson after the foreign secretary said during a Commons committee hearing that Mrs Zhagari-Ratcliffe was in Iran to ""train journalists"" - which could lead to her five-year jail term being doubled. He has since apologised for the remarks - made on 1 November - and retracted ""any suggestion she was there in a professional capacity"". Her family have always maintained she was on holiday with her daughter. Mr Ratcliffe told a press conference after the meeting that diplomatic protection - which allows a state to take diplomatic action on behalf of a national - would be ""important and helpful"". The protection would signal that the UK is treating the case as a formal, legal dispute between the UK and Iran. But he said the Foreign Office expressed reservations about whether the protection would help his wife's case. ""They have agreed to answer the questions and then for the lawyers to sit down and talk it through. Both legally and then also practically. ""But certainly, I think it is an important thing for us to be pushing for."" The Foreign Office said its lawyers would meet in the coming fortnight to discuss the issue further. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Caught in Iran power struggle Johnson 'sorry' over jailed mother remarks Medical concern for Briton held in Iran What is diplomatic protection? By James Landale, BBC News Diplomatic Correspondent When a British citizen is jailed overseas they normally get basic consular help from the local embassy, including contacting family, legal support and medical help. Conferring diplomatic protection on the citizen would ratchet up their status, so that diplomats working on the case would no longer treat it as a consular matter but a formal, legal dispute between Britain and that country, conducted under the rules of international law. The citizen's interests would be taken as those of the state. Diplomatic protection is very different from diplomatic immunity. The latter is something given to diplomats to ensure their safe passage and protection from prosecution. What is diplomatic protection? Richard Ratcliffe and Boris Johnson met at the Commonwealth office Mr Ratcliffe said he discussed with the foreign secretary the possibility of a joint trip to Iran before the end of the year. He said Mr Johnson had no fixed date for his planned visit to Iran, but the foreign secretary was ""keen"" for him to travel with him. He also spoke about the health of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who he said had found lumps in her breasts. ""She talks about being on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I absolutely believe that's true. ""I think it's important I don't exaggerate anything in the media and I'm not melodramatic, but she is in a difficult place."" Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been visiting Iran with her daughter Gabriella when she was arrested Mr Ratcliffe's MP, Tulip Siddiq, who joined him in the meeting, said he had failed to obtain a visa to visit Iran over the last 19 months and had not seen his daughter Gabriella, who is living in the country with her maternal grandparents, during that time. She said they had communicated over Skype but his daughter had lost the ability to speak English. ""So, if he gets to go with the foreign secretary, he gets to see his daughter for the first time in 19 months. And if he's there, he has the right to visit Nazanin in prison as her relative,"" she said. Ms Siddiq added that Mr Johnson had made clear he would ""certainly"" push to see Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe himself in prison if he goes to Iran. This video can not be played Mr Ratcliffe previously rejected suggestions that Boris Johnson should resign over his comments The Foreign Office said the meeting had been ""positive"". It said the British ambassador in Iran had raised the case with the country again, urging for consular access, appropriate medical treatment, a decision on Mr Ratcliffe's visa application and access for him to visit his wife if a trip takes place. ""The foreign secretary concluded the meeting by saying that no stone would be left unturned in the case of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, and that of our other dual nationals detained in Iran,"" the Foreign Office added.

"Sir Bradley Wiggins won five Olympic gold medals, as well as a silver medal and two bronze medals Sir Bradley Wiggins said his life was ""a living hell"" during an investigation into allegations of wrongdoing at British Cycling and Team Sky. On Wednesday, UK Anti-Doping saidthere would be no chargesover a ""mystery"" medical package delivered for Wiggins at the Criterium du Dauphine in 2011. Wiggins, 37, said the investigation ""felt nothing less than a witch hunt"". He added: ""Being accused of any doping indiscretion is the worst possible thing for any professional sportsman."" Wiggins won five Olympic gold medals and the 2012 Tour de France before retiring fromcycling in December 2016. It was alleged that the package that was the focus of the investigation contained a banned substance  - but the doctor involved, Dr Richard Freeman, said it was a legal decongestant, Fluimucil. The 14-month investigation has been closed and a Ukad statement said it would only ""revisit matters if new and material information were to come to light"". Ukad said it was unable to ""definitively confirm the contents of the package"" because of a ""lack of contemporaneous evidence"". Its chief executive Nicole Sapstead said the investigation was hindered by the ""lack of accurate medical records"" held by British Cycling. Wiggins, British Cycling and Team Sky have always denied any wrongdoing. March 2017 Q&A on cycling inquiry Wiggins said in a statement:,external""I welcome Ukad's confirmation that no anti-doping charges are to be brought regarding the so-called 'jiffy-bag' allegations. ""It has always been the case that no such charges could be brought against me as no anti-doping violations took place. I am pleased this has finally been confirmed publicly. ""This period of time has been a living hell for me and my family, full of innuendo and speculation. At times it has felt nothing less than a malicious witch hunt."" Wiggins, who said he would assess potential legal options, was unhappy with Ukad's statement and questioned the body's decision to begin an investigation. ""To say I am disappointed by some of the comments made by Ukad this morning is an understatement,"" added Wiggins. ""No evidence exists to prove a case against me and in all other circumstances this would be an unqualified finding of innocence. ""Where did the information come from to launch the investigation? ""Who was the source? What exactly did that person say and to whom? ""Why did Ukad deem it appropriate to treat it as a credible allegation?"" BBC sports editor Dan Roan With no clarity over what was in the now-infamous jiffy bag delivered to Team Sky in 2011, this represents a wholly unsatisfactory end to a saga that has tainted some of the biggest reputations in British sport, and exposed Ukad's lack of power. Its statement is deliberately nuanced, falling short of an exoneration of those involved, much to Sir Bradley Wiggins' dismay in a blistering statement, despite Britain's most decorated Olympian facing no charges. But while the end of the investigation will come as a relief to many in the sport, the lack of medical records, the inaccuracies in Team Sky's initial explanations for the mystery delivery, the unavailability of key witness Dr Richard Freeman to Ukad investigators, the theft of his laptop, and the medical exemptions that Wiggins had before major races, all mean that suspicion will linger. The close relationship between Team Sky and the governing body (who still share headquarters in Manchester) is also again under scrutiny. And at best, the attention to detail that was once the mantra of Team Sky and British Cycling has been exposed as hollow. In October 2016,the Daily Mail reported,externalthat Team Sky's Dr Richard Freeman had received a package from Simon Cope, then working as a coach for British Cycling's women's teams, on the final day of the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine. The package was alleged to be for Sir Bradley Wiggins, who won the race. Ukad then began an investigation into the contents of the package. At a Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee hearing in December 2016, Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford - already facing questions afterhackers had revealedWiggins had received a therapeutic use exemption (TUE) to take banned anti-inflammatory drug triamcinolone for allergies and respiratory issues before key races -said that he had been told by Dr Freeman that the package contained Fluimucil. Freeman, who was simultaneously employed by British Cycling and Team Sky between 2009 and 2015, missed the hearing through ill health but the DCMS committee was told that in 2014 he had a laptop containing medical records stolen while he was on holiday. Freeman was off work from British Cycling with a stress-related illness before resigning last month. Brailsford's testimony was widely questioned. Cope was alleged to have flown into Geneva Airport and driven for two hours to France to deliver the package, but 2008 Olympic champion Nicole Cooke pointed out that Fluimucil is available freely over the counter in France, and that there were eight pharmacies located within five kilometres of where the team received the package. David Kenworthy, the previous chairman of Ukad,told the BBCin January the answers given by figures within British Cycling and Team Sky to the DCMS committee were ""very disappointing"". In an interview with the BBC in January,Brailsford refused to confirm or deny whether he or anyone else at Team Sky had been able to provide paperwork to prove the package contained Fluimucil. ""I will give what I have got to Ukad,"" he said. ""I said what I had to say in the DCMS and I am leaving it there."" Team Sky subsequently said that they were ""confident"" no wrongdoing would be found when the inquiry was concluded.

"Sir James Dyson thanked Mr Conze when he stepped down last month Electrical firm Dyson is suing former chief executive Max Conze for allegedly leaking company secrets and using company resources for his own benefit. Max Conze stepped down in October and was thanked by the British firm's founder, Sir James Dyson. But the BBC has learned that, according to the company, Mr Conze was sacked for an alleged series of breaches. Mr Conze denied the allegations and said it would cause an ""unnecessary distraction"" for Dyson staff. The allegations include ""the disclosure of confidential information, and a breach of his fiduciary duties"". A spokesman for the company said: ""The Dyson board has decided to bring a claim against Max Conze at the High Court of Justice in London in relation to his actions while chief executive."" Mr Conze was appointed to the role in 2011 after a stint running Dyson's US business. His period as chief executive coincided with a huge increase in sales of Dyson's products. Profits at the vacuum cleaner and air purifier maker rose 41% last year to Â£631m. The breaches are said to include: ""Disclosing confidential product information to third parties, breaching Dyson's confidentiality rules. ""Using Dyson resources and information to evaluate an investment opportunity for his own benefit and/or for the benefit of a venture capital firm, rather than for Dyson's benefit - breaching his fiduciary duties. ""Failing to follow lawful and reasonable instructions regarding his conduct and focus of attention."" In response, Mr Conze said: ""I did nothing of the sort. During my six years as CEO of Dyson, the sales and profits will have tripled with the company growing from 2,500 to 10,000 staff."" He said Dyson sold 13 million machines last year, up from five million in 2010. ""This couldn't have happened without my total commitment to the business and its people,"" he said. Mr Conze added: ""This ridiculous allegation is merely trying to distract attention from the claims that Dyson know I am about to issue."" Dyson would not comment on whether the breaches were in connection with its project to build a new electric car, which had been long under wraps and only recently revealed.

"This video can not be played Darryll Rowe told one of his victims 'I got you. Burn, you have it' A man has been convicted of trying to infect 10 men with HIV in a ""campaign"" to infect as many as possible. Daryll Rowe infected five men he had unprotected sex with and sabotaged the condoms of another five in Brighton and Northumberland. After sex with some of the men he texted mocking messages, including ""I have HIV LOL. Oops!"" and ""I'm riddled"". During the trial hairdresser Rowe, 27, claimed to believe months of drinking his own urine cured him of the virus. He was convicted at Lewes Crown Court of five counts of causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) and five of attempted GBH. Daryll Rowe met his partners on dating app Grindr, jurors at Lewes Crown Court were told During the six-week trial the prosecution described Rowe's actions as a ""campaign"" to infect as many men as possible over a four-month period starting in October 2015 across the Brighton area. He had relations with eight men he met on dating app Grindr, before moving to Northumberland and having unprotected sex with another two men later in 2016. Speaking after the verdict, Nigel Pilkington, deputy chief crown prosecutor in the South East, said he believed there ""may well be more men out there"" who had fallen victim to Rowe, of no fixed address. Throughout the case Rowe was described as a ""control freak"" who would shift between being charming and ""jealous"". Mr Pilkington said he was a ""cruel and callous man"" whose crimes were ""akin to stabbing or shooting somebody"". Mr Pilkington added: ""The absolute deliberate infection of other men by a man, is not something I've ever come across in 25 years as a prosecutor and I don't expect to ever come across a case like it again. ""This is a man who, after the event, having known what was he was doing, sent mocking and abusive texts to some of his victims. It must have been traumatic."" Deborah Gold, chief executive of the National Aids Trust (NAT), said Rowe's behaviour was ""utterly exceptional and vanishingly rare"". She added that the majority of HIV transmissions are by people who are unaware they have the virus. Speaking after the hearing, one of Rowe's victims, whose biological parents both had HIV and later died, said the news of his condition drove him to a suicide attempt. ""I was always so careful,"" he said. ""My dad was a junkie and she was a very young mother. I was always trying to run away from that lifestyle, That's why I always insisted on condoms."" He added it was a ""reminder of my past"". ""I feel it's come full-circle, and has made this my new life, which is very unfair,"" he added. ""[Rowe] called me over and over. He admitted to ripping the condom. ""He said, 'I got you. Burn, you have it' and he was laughing at me. There was menace in his voice, it was an insane conversation. It was horrific to hear. I was in a dark place. ""It's a violation. I could only describe it as feeling like you've been raped, not the physical side of it, but the mental side."" Rowe will be sentenced on 29 January. Det Insp Andy Wolstenholme of Sussex Police said: ""Daryll Rowe was consistent in lying to his victims about having HIV, he was persistent and aggressive in wanting unprotected sex in order to infect people, and when he didn't get what he wanted, he deliberately damaged condoms to achieve his aim. At the end of the trial it emerged two dock officers were sacked after falling asleep while evidence was being given.

"This video can not be played Flames and smoke hit multiple floors at Coolmoyne House One person was rescued from a burning tower block and a number of residents were led to safety after a fire broke out at high-rise flats outside Belfast. Firefighters were called to Coolmoyne House in Dunmurry at about 17:30 GMT as flames and smoke hit multiple floors. On arrival, crews were faced with ""a well-developed fire on the ninth floor"" the NI Fire and Rescue Service said. The flats were evacuated, and four people were treated by paramedics. The fire was extinguished by 18:10 GMT. Pictures posted on social media showed flames and smoke at Coolmoyne House Lagan Valley Hospital said that two people - a man and a woman - were stable after being admitted following the fire. Geoff Somerville, group commander with the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service, said firefighters rescued a man from the flat in which the fire started. He said they believed the fire was ""accidental"" and that the man ""was making toast at the time"". This video can not be played Geoff Somerville from NIFRS says it's believed the fire was accidental ""He had moved into his bedroom and then heard his smoke detectors operate in his flat and that alerted him to the fire,"" he said. ""I'm very relieved there's been no loss of life and that's only because of the courageous actions of our firefighters here today."" Tower block residents told a BBC reporter at the scene that they felt shocked but ""lucky to be alive"". They added that all they could think about was the Grenfell Tower tragedy in London during the summer. Susanne Berrill said she lived in the flat above where the fire had started Susanne Berrill, another tower block resident, told the BBC that she had lost everything in the blaze. ""I've literally only started life again after a big trauma and this has happened,"" she said, speaking from a local community centre. The fire started in a flat on the ninth floor of the tower block Some residents expressed anger and said that they had not heard fire alarms on their floors. One told the BBC: ""The alarms went off on the floor where the fire was but why didn't it go off on all the floors with such a big fire?"" However, Group Commander Somerville said that the fire alarms had worked ""as expected"". ""The residents should not have concerns about that (the fire alarms),"" he said. ""The alarm in the gentleman's flat operated and sounded and that is the correct configuration. ""There is a communal fire alarm system in the hallway that is to operate and automatically open vents to the common hallway and that also successfully operated. Emergency vehicles were sent to the scene of the fire on Wednesday evening ""There would be no sounders in the common hallway nor should their be. ""It is important of course to emphasise to everybody that each flat would have a self-contained fire alarm system, this individual flat itself had three smoke detectors and they operated and worked. ""Their (other residents) alarms should not go off unless they detected smoke."" He added that the fire service would now assess whether residents can return to their homes but that ""some flats and all flats may not be safe to enter tonight"". The blaze damaged flats on the ninth and tenth floors before it was brought under control, according to local community worker Julie Ann Jackson. ""They got everybody out,"" she told the BBC's Evening Extra programme. Ms Jackson said safety drills had been carried out at the block, following the Grenfell fire in June. Some of the flats on the upper floors have been damaged A total of eleven fire appliances and four ambulances were sent to Coolmoyne House. The tower block on the Seymour Hill housing estate is owned and operated by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. ""Staff have been on site following the fire in a flat this evening and are on hand to offer emergency accommodation to any resident who requires it,"" it said in a statement, ""The cause of the fire is now under investigation by the NIFRS and we will be co-operating with them fully. ""We would like to commend the Northern Ireland Fire And Rescue Service, the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and the Police Service of Northern Ireland for their immediate response."" A large number of emergency workers attended the incident Dunmurry resident Sam Waide was driving past Coolmoyne House when he saw what he first believed was steam coming from the top of the building. He pulled his car over and realised the tower block was on fire. ""It was sort of frightening,"" he told BBC News NI. ""After what happened in England, you think to yourself, is this another one?"" Mr Waide said emergency vehicles were at the scene ""very, very quickly"". A cordon was put in place around the tower block Robert Cullen was driving towards his sister's house in Seymour Hill when he saw ""lots and lots of smoke"". ""One side of the flats was all in flames, from about half way up,"" he told BBC News NI. He said within minutes, fire appliances started to arrive ""left, right and centre"". ""As far as I'm aware, everybody got out,"" Mr Cullen added. He said that after about 20 minutes, firefighters had doused all the flames and ""there was just smoke"".

"UK actor Keith Barron, who starred in sitcom Duty Free, has died aged 83 after a short illness. Barron, who was from South Yorkshire, rose to fame in the 1960s as Detective Sergeant Swift in The Odd Man. He also appeared in Coronation Street, Doctor Who, Benidorm and Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased). Barron is best-remembered for his role in Yorkshire Television sitcom, Duty Free, where he played David Pearce. A statement from his agent said Barron enjoyed ""a long and varied career, of which he was immensely proud. ""He is survived by his wife Mary to whom he was married for 58 years and his son, Jamie, also an actor."" Duty Free saw Keith Barron star alongside Neil Stacy, Carlos Douglas, Gwen Taylor, and Joanna Van Gyseghem Set in Spain, Duty Free ran for three series from 1984 until 1986 with Barron starring as a lead character. The show was about two couples - David and Amy Pearce and Robert and Linda Cochran, who meet on holiday in the same hotel in Marbella.

"Eighteen of the 20 Premier League clubs offer specific discounts for teenagers and young adults The BBC Price of Football study has found the majority of ticket prices have been frozen or have fallen for a third year - yet a poll of young adult football fans suggests the cost is still putting them off. This year BBC Sport asked more than 200 clubs across the United Kingdom for information on ticket prices and found almost two thirds of price categories have been reduced or remained the same across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In a separate poll, we asked 1,000 18- to 24-year-old fans living in Britain how they engage with football, and four in five (82%) said the cost of tickets was an obstacle to them going to more matches. The annual study found 135 clubs out of 190 in England, Scotland and Wales offer reduced prices for teenagers and young adults - separate from any student concessions - but 55% of the fans we polled said they had stopped going completely or go to fewer games because it was too expensive. Young adult fans can save, on average, Â£146.94 on season tickets in the English Premier League and Football League, while in the top four divisions in Scotland the average saving on a season ticket is Â£143.66. How much could you pay? Enter your team in the calculator Analysis: What does it mean for clubs and fans? Premier League cuts or freezes majority of prices Take the Price of Football quiz According to figures from the Premier League, young adult fans bought 4% of all season tickets this year. A report in 2015 suggested the average age of an adult supporter in the Premier League was 41. Rob Wilson, football finance expert at Sheffield Hallam University, says top clubs need to do more to attract young adults. ""These fans are the next generation of season ticket holders but they have been brought up in a sanitised and expensive environment,"" he told BBC Sport. ""With this in mind, they are reluctant to pay so much to watch their teams play and these findings should act as a warning to the Premier League elite - they ignore this group of fans at their peril."" Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger admitted he was worried by the findings. ""I think nothing is better than to share the experience of a stadium,"" he said. ""There are many ingredients in the modern game that stopped people going. The lifestyle is different, they play less, they play more computers. ""The security of gathering people is a problem. Can you afford to go when you are young? There are many ingredients we have to take care of in the game."" This video can not be played Home ground v home comforts - how young fans watch football In a statement, the Premier League said: ""Clubs engage with their fans in many ways and hugely appreciate their loyal and passionate support. ""For young fans specifically, all clubs offer concession prices, including discounted junior season tickets."" The online poll, conducted by ComRes, also showed young fans are more likely to engage with football by playing games on a console or PC (61%) than in a football team (37%). More young football fans bet on the sport (44%) than play in a team (37%), but more fans play in a team than have a fantasy football team (33%). Only one in four fans (26%) said they go to watch football live more than once a month. Are young people being priced out of football? Watch our live debate,external Two thirds (65%) of young football fans said the cost of travel was an obstacle to attending more matches. Three quarters (74%) of young fans said they get their football news from social media - 24% from print newspapers. Three in five fans aged 18-24 go to a sport app or mobile site (59%) for football news while at least half access it via a TV results service (53%). 70% of supporters agreed football clubs did value their fans, but more than half of the teenagers and young adults (56%) said professional football was not run with them in mind. Similar numbers of football fans asked said they go to a football match at least once a week (11%), two to three times a month (15%) or five to 10 times a season (14%). One in six (16%) male football fans aged 18-24 said they go to a match at least once a week, compared to 7% of women in this group. Of the top four leagues inEngland,92% of clubs offer special prices for young adults, separate from any student concessions. The age ranges vary from 16-24 years old, with most targeting the 18-21 bracket. The biggest discounts come in the Premier League, where an Arsenal member aged 16-19 can purchase a season ticket for Â£384 compared to the cheapest adult season ticket at Â£891 - a saving of Â£507. Chelsea offer the biggest discount on single matchday tickets for their under 20s, who can pay Â£15.50 instead of Â£47 - a saving of Â£31.50. But despite these discounts, 81% of the young adult football fans living in England who were polled say they feel the cost of tickets is stopping them from going to more matches. InScotland,27 of the 42 clubs offer young adult discounts. In the poll, 79% of fans say cost is an obstacle to them attending football matches. A third of the clubs in the Welsh Premier League offer special discounts for young adults. Of the young adults asked inWales,90% say the cost of tickets puts them off going to watch football. The Price of Football: Results in full Young adult ticket data in full How we produced the Price of Football 2017 Rob Wilson, football finance expert, Sheffield Hallam University: E-sports are becoming big business and this is the next key challenge for clubs. How do you convert e-sport players into terrace-goers? Can you link the e-game to the actual one? How can mobile technologies support this at half-time, for example? Moreover, the way young fans consume information is changing - clubs need to engage fans much more effectively when it comes to social media. We've seen big reductions in subscriptions to the pay TV platforms so it's unsurprising young people think twice about live football. There are also lots of options for young people to spend their leisure pound (the cinema, gym, university, cars etc) so football clubs need to work much harder to engage them. There is no magic bullet but they need to do more and communicate that more effectively. The long-term impact of young fans feeling priced out is yet to be truly felt. Kevin Rowles, economics expert: What we are seeing, especially with young people, is that incomes are being squeezed in real terms and this will lead to a decrease in demand, particularly as there are alternative leisure opportunities. The number of fans attending football will also respond to rise and fall in prices because of the price elasticity of demand for tickets. Support for a team is often a matter of loyalty and hence lower prices may not attract many new fans. If young people find their finances are stretched, they may make a rational choice to follow a team by other means such as screened matches. Young people tend to be in work but with the very slow growth in wages in the past 10 years, their income is lagging behind living costs. Real wages are not rising and young people are also saddled with student debt. Rent and utility bills have to be paid and they are rising faster than other prices. Then, when you have to pay for food on top, it means things like sport and paying to watch football are not a priority. Dr Rachel Andrew, clinical psychologist: There are a number of different, interacting factors that play a part in young people's decision making. These factors are relevant to decisions made about leisure (and in particular football). These include factors such as: 1) temperament and personality and 2) past history - including childhood memories, parents' interests & values, and past teachers or peer influence. However, there are some interesting trends around leisure also. Young people are drinking less. Young people are more thoughtful about what they want to do with their time and money. Superficially it looks like they have increased choice about what they may do, but in reality they also have less money and less time. As a young person gets older, it often becomes more important to make decisions that will not alienate them from a social group of friends when compared to decisions that their parents may not like or may be unhealthy. I am not surprised young people are engaging with football online through videos/fantasy football and probably through social media & apps too - as this is a trend we are seeing across the board with leisure. I feel sad and disappointed that young people are playing less football as there are so many physical and mental health benefits to this. It is sad that the big drive to increase football in schools is not having a long-term effect once children leave school. Do you attend football matches regularly? If so, what keeps you coming back?

"The UK Supreme Court has ruled that Scotland can set a minimum price for alcohol, rejecting a challenge by the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA). Legislation was approved by the Scottish Parliament five years ago but has been tied up in court challenges. In a unanimous judgment, seven Supreme Court judges said the legislation did not breach European Union law. The judges ruled the measure was a ""proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim"". Ministers said a 50p-per-unit minimum would help tackle Scotland's ""unhealthy relationship with drink"" by raising the price of cheap, high-strength alcohol. The whisky association had claimed the move was a ""restriction on trade"" and there were more effective ways of tackling alcohol misuse. After the Supreme Court verdict, ministers are expected to make Scotland the first country in the world to establish a minimum price per unit of alcohol, possibly early next year. A small number of countries, including Canada and Russia, have some form of minimum price structure, according to the Institute for Alcohol Studies. Many others have rules aimed at restricting cheap alcohol sales. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ""Absolutely delighted that minimum pricing has been upheld by the Supreme Court. ""This has been a long road - and no doubt the policy will continue to have its critics - but it is a bold and necessary move to improve public health."" The Scotch Whisky Association said it accepted the Supreme Court's ruling. The Scottish government believes cracking down on cheap alcohol will help tackle the country's binge-drinking culture The Scottish government's aim is to reduce the amount that problem drinkers consume simply by raising the price of the strongest, cheapest alcohol. The move is not a tax or duty increase. It is a price hike for the cheapest drink, with any extra cash going to the retailer. Last year, Alcohol Focus Scotland claimed the maximum recommended weekly intake of alcohol (14 units) could be bought for just Â£2.52. It said super-strength cider and own-brand vodka and whisky could be purchased for as little as 18p per unit of alcohol. The 50p-per-unit minimum outlined by the legislation would raise the price of the cheapest bottle of red wine (9.4 units of alcohol) to Â£4.69, a four-pack of 500ml cans of 4% lager (8 units) would cost at least Â£4 and a 70cl bottle of whisky (28 units of alcohol) could not be sold for less than Â£14. Normal strength cider (5% ABV) would cost at least Â£2.50 a litre but a super-strength version (7.5% ABV) would have to cost a minimum of Â£3.75 for a litre. Minimum pricing will not raise the prices of all alcoholic drinks because many are already above the threshold. Pubs and bars are unlikely to be affected as they usually charge much more than 50p per unit. The aim is to hit consumption of strong alcohol which is sold at low prices. The new laws would be ""experimental"" and expire after six years unless renewed. Supporters of minimum pricing,externalbelieve the move is necessary to tackle the country's binge drinking culture, withScots buying 20% more alcohol on averagethan people in England or Wales. The judges delivered their ruling at the Supreme Court in London The judges at the Supreme Court rejected the Scotch Whisky Association's claim that an excise duty or tax would be an equally effective way of achieving the government's objectives. Their judgment said minimum pricing targeted ""the health hazards of cheap alcohol and the groups most affected in a way that an increase in excise or VAT does not"". The judges said a tax would increase prices ""across the board"" and not just the cheap, strong alcohol which is the focus of the legislation. They also agreed that minimum pricing was ""easier to understand and simpler to enforce"". Minimum pricing would not allow retailers to ""absorb"" the cost in the way a duty rise would, they said. The Scottish government said it would move as quickly as possible to implement the legislation Scotland's health minister Shona Robison said: ""This is a historic and far-reaching judgment and a landmark moment in our ambition to turn around Scotland's troubled relationship with alcohol. ""In a ruling of global significance, the UK Supreme Court has unanimously backed our pioneering and life-saving alcohol pricing policy."" Scotch Whisky Association chief executive Karen Betts said: ""We will now look to the Scottish and UK governments to support the industry against the negative effects of trade barriers being raised in overseas markets that discriminate against Scotch Whisky as a consequence of minimum pricing, and to argue for fair competition on our behalf."" Scottish Conservative health spokesman Miles Briggs said the Scottish government would have his party's support on implementing the legislation. He said: ""We look forward to seeing whether or not minimum pricing can make any impact on Scotland's complex and damaging relationship with alcohol."" Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, said the decision was a ""massive victory for Scotland's health"". She said: ""Minimum unit pricing is effective because it targets the kind of drinking most likely to lead to the greatest harm. ""The price of a pint in the pub won't change but the price of strong white ciders and own brand spirits that are mainly bought by dependent drinkers will rise markedly."" Dr Peter Bennie, chairman of the British Medical Association Scotland, said: ""As doctors we see every day the severe harms caused by alcohol misuse and the damage it causes to individuals and their families. ""There are no easy solutions, but minimum unit pricing can make a significant contribution to reducing these harms and saving lives."" Cancer Research UK's cancer prevention expert Linda Bauld said: ""Alcohol is linked to seven types of cancer including breast and bowel cancer, and the more you drink the greater your risk of cancer. ""It's a shame expensive legal action has delayed this welcome measure."" Canada is one of the very few countries to have brought in a form of minimum pricing for alcohol, where it's known as a ""Social Reference Price"". Each of Canada's 10 provinces is able set the lowest price per litre that alcoholic drinks can be sold for in shops. Canadian academic studies suggest that the policy has successfully reduced alcohol consumption. According toresearch by Tim Stockwell at the University of Victoria's Centre for Addictions Research of British Columbia,,externala 10% increase in average minimum prices in one province led to an 8% decrease in alcohol consumption per person. The price rise was also associated with a 9% decrease in patients being hospitalised for alcohol related diseases. But other factors could also be contributing, such as the ageing population.Older Canadians tend to drink less,external, which might also explain the fall in consumption. It is also difficult to draw a direct comparison between Canada and Scotland. In Canada the extra revenue generated by the minimum pricing goes to the government rather than the retailers. This means retailers in Scotland may have an extra incentive to increase sales because they will profit directly. The Supreme Court ruling was the final stage of a five-year legal battle, with the cases already passing through courts in Edinburgh and Luxembourg. After an initial challenge at the Court of Session failed in 2013, the SWA appealed to the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The European court said the legislation might break EU law if other tax options would prove as effective, but said it was ""ultimately for the national court to determine"" whether they did. The Scottish court subsequently backed the measures for a second time, ruling that tax measures ""would be less effective than minimum pricing"". However, in December 2016 the Court of Session judges then allowed the SWA to go to the Supreme Court to challenge their ruling. May 2012:MSPs pass Scots booze price plan May 2013:Minimum drink price challenge fails December 2015:Minimum drink price 'may breach EU law' October 2016:Courts back minimum alcohol price December 2016:Whisky firms allowed minimum price appeal July 2017:Supreme Court judges retire to consider minimum pricing appeal The legislation to bring in a minimum price of 50p per unit was passed by the Scottish Parliament in May 2012 The UK government supported the devolved Scottish administration during the legal process, arguing that minimum pricing was compatible with EU law. In 2012, then Prime Minister David Cameronpledged to introduce minimum pricing- but the plan was shelved a year later in the face of fierce opposition from the drinks industry. The Home Office has said the policy remains under review and calls for its reintroduction in England are likely to be reignited when it is implemented in Scotland. Legislation to establish a minimum price is currently under active consideration by the National Assembly for Wales. In Northern Ireland, former Health Minister Jim Wells had been seeking to introduce minimum pricing before resigning in April 2015.

"This video can not be played The painting has been cleaned and restored from the image on the left to the one on the right A 500-year-old painting of Christ believed to have been painted by Leonardo da Vinci has been sold in New York for a record $450m (Â£341m). The painting is known as Salvator Mundi (Saviour of the World). It is the highest auction price for any work of art and brought cheers and applause at the packed Christie's auction room. Leonardo da Vinci died in 1519 and there are fewer than 20 of his paintings in existence. Read aboutLeonardo da Vinci (1452 -1519) 'Mona Lisa nude sketch' found in France Can buying paintings make you rich? Salvator Mundi, believed to have been painted sometime after 1505, is the only work thought to be in private hands. Bidding began at $100m and the final bid for the work was $400m, with fees bringing the full price up to $450.3m. The unidentified buyer was involved in a bidding contest, via telephone, that lasted nearly 20 minutes. Excitement in the auction room rose as the bids by telephone came in The painting shows Christ with one hand raised, the other holding a glass sphere. In 1958 it was sold at auction in London for a mere Â£45. By then the painting was generally reckoned to be the work of a follower of Leonardo and not the work of Leonardo himself. It apparently was part of King Charles I of England's collection in the 1600s and got lost, but was ""rediscovered"" in 2005. Analysis by Arts Editor Will Gompetz $450m for Salvator Mundi is an astonishing price to have realised, given both its condition and authenticity have been questioned. It shows that ultimately art comes down to belief. And there were plenty of bidders last night who were suitably convinced by its Leonardo da Vinci attribution to drive the price up to such stratospheric heights. As yet, the new owner is unknown. Speculation will be rife. Which I will contribute to, by noting the newly opened Louvre Abu Dhabi will have a Leonardo shaped hole in its displays when the decade-long loan deal with the French museums comes to an end. Wherever it ends up, you've got to hand it to Christie's for its masterclass in the art of selling art. Art agents celebrated when the sale was completed In a bold move, without a hint of irony, the painting was sold in its Post-War and Contemporary Art Evening Sale alongside a Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol. Why not in the Old Masters Sale? Because that's not where the elephant bucks are. The big money comes into the room nowadays when Pollocks and Twomblys are on the block, and promptly leaves when the Reynolds and Winterhalters arrive. Read more of Will Gompertz's blogs here. This video can not be played Salvator Mundi was discovered hidden under layers of paint Dr Tim Hunter, who is an expert in Old Master and 19th Century art, told the BBC the painting is ""the most important discovery in the 21st Century"". ""It completely smashes the record for the last Old Masters painting to sell - Van Gogh's Sunflowers in 1988. Records get broken from time to time but not in this way. ""Da Vinci painted less than 20 oil paintings and many are unfinished so it's incredibly rare and we love that in art."" Before the auction it was owned by Russian billionaire collector Dmitry E Rybolovlev, who is reported to have bought it in a private sale in May 2013 for $127.5m (Â£98m). The painting has had major cosmetic surgery - its walnut panel base has been described as ""worm-tunnelled"" and at some point it seems to have been split in half - and efforts to restore it resulted in abrasions. BBC arts correspondent Vincent Dowd said that even now attribution to Leonardo is not universally accepted.

"This video can not be played The painting has been cleaned and restored from the image on the left to the one on the right A 500-year-old painting of Christ believed to have been painted by Leonardo da Vinci has been sold in New York for a record $450m (Â£341m). The painting is known as Salvator Mundi (Saviour of the World). It is the highest auction price for any work of art and brought cheers and applause at the packed Christie's auction room. Leonardo da Vinci died in 1519 and there are fewer than 20 of his paintings in existence. Read aboutLeonardo da Vinci (1452 -1519) 'Mona Lisa nude sketch' found in France Can buying paintings make you rich? Salvator Mundi, believed to have been painted sometime after 1505, is the only work thought to be in private hands. Bidding began at $100m and the final bid for the work was $400m, with fees bringing the full price up to $450.3m. The unidentified buyer was involved in a bidding contest, via telephone, that lasted nearly 20 minutes. Excitement in the auction room rose as the bids by telephone came in The painting shows Christ with one hand raised, the other holding a glass sphere. In 1958 it was sold at auction in London for a mere Â£45. By then the painting was generally reckoned to be the work of a follower of Leonardo and not the work of Leonardo himself. It apparently was part of King Charles I of England's collection in the 1600s and got lost, but was ""rediscovered"" in 2005. Analysis by Arts Editor Will Gompetz $450m for Salvator Mundi is an astonishing price to have realised, given both its condition and authenticity have been questioned. It shows that ultimately art comes down to belief. And there were plenty of bidders last night who were suitably convinced by its Leonardo da Vinci attribution to drive the price up to such stratospheric heights. As yet, the new owner is unknown. Speculation will be rife. Which I will contribute to, by noting the newly opened Louvre Abu Dhabi will have a Leonardo shaped hole in its displays when the decade-long loan deal with the French museums comes to an end. Wherever it ends up, you've got to hand it to Christie's for its masterclass in the art of selling art. Art agents celebrated when the sale was completed In a bold move, without a hint of irony, the painting was sold in its Post-War and Contemporary Art Evening Sale alongside a Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol. Why not in the Old Masters Sale? Because that's not where the elephant bucks are. The big money comes into the room nowadays when Pollocks and Twomblys are on the block, and promptly leaves when the Reynolds and Winterhalters arrive. Read more of Will Gompertz's blogs here. This video can not be played Salvator Mundi was discovered hidden under layers of paint Dr Tim Hunter, who is an expert in Old Master and 19th Century art, told the BBC the painting is ""the most important discovery in the 21st Century"". ""It completely smashes the record for the last Old Masters painting to sell - Van Gogh's Sunflowers in 1988. Records get broken from time to time but not in this way. ""Da Vinci painted less than 20 oil paintings and many are unfinished so it's incredibly rare and we love that in art."" Before the auction it was owned by Russian billionaire collector Dmitry E Rybolovlev, who is reported to have bought it in a private sale in May 2013 for $127.5m (Â£98m). The painting has had major cosmetic surgery - its walnut panel base has been described as ""worm-tunnelled"" and at some point it seems to have been split in half - and efforts to restore it resulted in abrasions. BBC arts correspondent Vincent Dowd said that even now attribution to Leonardo is not universally accepted. One critic has described the surface of the painting to be ""inert, varnished, lurid, scrubbed over and repainted so many times that it looks simultaneously new and old"". ""Any private collector who gets suckered into buying this picture and places it in their apartment or storage, it serves them right,"" Jerry Saltz wrote on Vulture.com.

"This video can not be played Mugabe: From war hero to resignation Robert Mugabe, the man who became synonymous with Zimbabwe, has resigned as president after 37 years in power. For some, he will always remain a hero who brought independence and an end to white-minority rule. Even those who forced him out blamed his wife and ""criminals"" around him. But to his growing number of critics, this highly educated, wily politician became the caricature of an African dictator, who destroyed an entire country in order to keep his job. In the end, it was the security forces, who had been instrumental in intimidating the opposition and keeping him in power, who made him go. They were incensed when he sacked his long-time ally, Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, paving the way for his much younger wife Grace to succeed him, fearing it meant the end for them as the powers behind the throne. He had survived numerous previous crises and predictions of his demise but with his powers failing at the age of 93, his former comrades-in-arms turned on him, favouring Mr Mnangagwa. Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Before the 2008 elections, Mr Mugabe said: ""If you lose an election and are rejected by the people, it is time to leave politics."" But after coming second to Morgan Tsvangirai, Mr Mugabe displayed more characteristic defiance, swearing that ""only God"" could remove him from office. And just to be sure, violence was unleashed to preserve his grip on power. In order to save the lives of his supporters, Mr Tsvangirai pulled out of the second round and although Mr Mugabe was forced to share power with his long-time rival for four years, he remained president. He even won another election, in 2013, as Mr Tsvangirai had lost a lot of credibility during his years working with Mr Mugabe. The key to understanding Mr Mugabe is the 1970s guerrilla war where he made his name. President Mugabe (L) has given his support to his wife Grace (R) for the vice-presidency 1924:Born Later trained as a teacher 1964:Imprisoned by Rhodesian government 1980:Wins post-independence elections 1996:Marries Grace Marufu 2000:Loses referendum, pro-Mugabe militias invade white-owned farms and attack opposition supporters 2008:Comes second in first round of elections to Tsvangirai who pulls out of run-off amid nationwide attacks on his supporters 2009:Amid economic collapse, swears in Tsvangirai as prime minister, who served in uneasy government of national unity for four years 2017:Sacks long-time ally Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, paving the way for his wife Grace to succeed him. Army intervenes and forces him to step down Grace Mugabe profile: Who is Zimbabwe's first lady? Zimbabwe under Mugabe - in 10 numbers Even after 37 years in power, Mr  Mugabe still maintained the same worldview - the patriotic socialist forces of his Zanu-PF party were still fighting the twin evils of capitalism and colonialism. Any critics were dismissed as ""traitors and sell-outs"" - a throwback to the guerrilla war, when such labels could be a death sentence. Robert Mugabe (L), seen here in 1960, was greatly influenced by pan-Africanist ideals He always blamed Zimbabwe's economic problems on a plot by Western countries, led by the UK, to oust him because of his seizure of white-owned farms. His critics firmly blamed him, saying he had no understanding of how a modern economy worked. He always concentrated on the question of how to share out the national cake, rather than how to make it grow. Protesters in 2016 burn worthless currency in a show of defiance against the introduction of new bond notes Mr Mugabe once famously said that a country could never go bankrupt - with the world's fastest-shrinking economy and annual inflation of 231 million per cent in July 2008, it seemed as though he was determined to test his theory to the limit. Professor Tony Hawkins of the University of Zimbabwe once observed that with Zimbabwe's former leader: ""Whenever economics gets in the way of politics, politics wins every time."" In 2000, faced with a strong opposition for the first time, he wrecked what was one of Africa's most diversified economies in a bid to retain political control. He seized the white-owned farms which were the economy's backbone and scared off donors but in purely political terms, Mr Mugabe outsmarted his enemies - he remained in power for another 17 years. And the tactics he and his supporters used were straight from the guerrilla war. After he suffered the first electoral defeat of his career, in a 2000 referendum, Mr Mugabe unleashed his personal militia - the self-styled war veterans, backed by the security forces - who used violence and murder as an electoral strategy. Mr Mugabe says he is fighting for the rights of black Zimbabweans Eight years later, a similar pattern was followed after Mr Mugabe lost the first round of a presidential election to his long-time rival Morgan Tsvangirai. When needed, all the levers of state - the security forces, civil service, state-owned media - which are mostly controlled by Zanu-PF, were used in the service of the ruling party. The man who fought for one-man, one-vote introduced a requirement that potential voters prove their residence with utility bills, which the young, unemployed opposition core electorate were unlikely to have. In fact, the signs of his attitude to opposition were there from the early 1980s, when members of the North-Korea trained Fifth Brigade of the army were sent to Matabeleland, home to his then rival, Joshua Nkomo. Thousands of civilians were killed before Mr Nkomo agreed to share power with Mr Mugabe - a precursor of what happened with Mr Tsvangirai. One of the undoubted achievements of the former teacher's 33 years in power was the expansion of education. Zimbabwe still has one of the highest literacy rates in Africa, at 89% of the population. The now deceased political scientist Masipula Sithole once said that by expanding education, the president was ""digging his own grave"". Mr Mugabe has not been afraid to use violence to stay in power The young beneficiaries were able to analyse Zimbabwe's problems for themselves and most blamed government corruption and mismanagement for the lack of jobs and rising prices. He often claimed to be fighting on behalf of the rural poor but much of the land he confiscated ended up in the hands of his cronies. Archbishop Desmond Tutu once said that Zimbabwe's long-time president had become a cartoon figure of the archetypal African dictator. During the 2002 presidential campaign, he started wearing brightly coloured shirts emblazoned with his face - a style copied from many of Africa's authoritarian rulers. For the preceding 20 years, this conservative man was only seen in public with either a stiff suit and tie or safari suit. Robert Mugabe celebrated his 93rd birthday earlier this year He professes to be a staunch Catholic, and worshippers at Harare's Catholic Cathedral were occasionally swamped by security guards when he turned up for Sunday Mass. However, Mr Mugabe's beliefs did not prevent him from having two children by Grace, then his secretary, while his popular Ghanaian first wife, Sally, was dying from cancer. But it was his second wife Grace, 40 years his junior, who ultimately proved his downfall. Although Mr Mugabe outlived many predictions of his demise, the increasing strain of recent years took its toll and his once-impeccable presentation has begun to look rather worn at times. In 2011, a US diplomatic cable released byWikileaks suggested that he was suffering from prostate cancer,external. Wife Grace said Mr Mugabe woke at 05:00 for his exercise But he certainly led a healthy lifestyle. Grace once said that he woke up at 05:00 for his daily exercises, including yoga. He did not drink alcohol or coffee and was largely vegetarian. Mr Mugabe was 73 when she gave birth to their third child, Chatunga. If nothing else, Mr Mugabe has always been an extremely proud man. He often said he would only step down when his ""revolution"" was complete. He was referring to the redistribution of white-owned land but he also wanted to hand-pick his successor, who would of course have had to come from the ranks of Zanu-PF. Didymus Mutasa, once one of Mr Mugabe's closest associates but who has since fallen out with him, once told the BBC that in Zimbabwean culture, kings were only replaced when they die ""and Mugabe is our king"". But even his closest allies were not ready for Zimbabwe to be turned into a monarchy, with power retained by a single family.

"Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, the man known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political cunning, achieved a long-held ambition to succeed Robert Mugabe as Zimbabwe's president in November last year. He has now won a disputed presidential election to legitimise his rule, promising voters his efforts to woo foreign investors will bring back the economy from the brink of collapse. Mr Mugabe resigned following a military takeover and mass demonstrations - all sparked by his sacking of Mr Mnangagwa as his vice-president. ""The crocodile"", who lived up to his name and snapped back, may have unseated Zimbabwe's only ruler, but he is also associated with some of the worst atrocities committed under the ruling Zanu-PF party since independence in 1980. One veteran of the liberation struggle, who worked with him for many years, once put it simply: ""He's a very cruel man, very cruel."" But his children see him as a principled, if unemotional, man. His daughter, Farai Mlotshwa - a property developer and the eldest of his nine children by two wives - told BBC Radio 4 that he was a ""softie"". As if to reinforce this softer image of the new leader, a cuddly crocodile soft toy was passed among the Zanu-PF supporters who welcomed him back to the country after Mr Mugabe's resignation. Emmerson Mnangagwa is known as ""Ngwena"", the Shona word for crocodile And what he lacks in charisma and oratory prowess, he makes up for in pragmatism, says close friend and Zanu-PF politician Josiah Hungwe. ""Mnangagwa is a practical person. He is a person who recognises that politics is politics but people must eat,"" he told the BBC, adding that reforming Zimbabwe's disastrous economy will be the focus of his leadership. This video can not be played Emmerson Mnangagwa: Who is the man known as the âcrocodileâ? Known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political shrewdness - his Zanu-PF faction is ""Lacoste"" Received military training in China and Egypt Tortured by Rhodesian forces after his ""crocodile gang"" staged attacks Helped direct Zimbabwe's war of independence in the 1960s and 1970s Became the country's spymaster during the 1980s civil conflict, in which thousands of civilians were killed, but has denied any role in the massacres Accused of masterminding attacks on opposition supporters after 2008 election Says he will deliver jobs, and seen as open to economic reforms Survived several alleged assassination attempts, blamed on Mugabe supporters Find out more on BBC Radio 4's Profile. The exact year of Mr Mnangagwa's birth is not known - but he is thought to be 75, which would make him nearly 20 years younger than his predecessor who left power aged 93. Born in the central region of Zvishavane, he is a Karanga - the largest clan of Zimbabwe's majority Shona community. Some Karangas felt it was their turn for power, following 37 years of domination by Mr Mugabe's Zezuru clan, though Mr Mnangagwa was accused of profiting while under Mr Mugabe. According to a United Nations report in 2001, he was seen as ""the architect of the commercial activities of Zanu-PF"". This largely related to the operations of the Zimbabwean army and businessmen in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Zimbabwean troops intervened in the DR Congo conflict on the side of the government and, like those of other countries, were accused of using the conflict to loot some of its rich natural resources such as diamonds, gold and other minerals. More recently military officials - many behind his rise to power -have been accused of benefiting from the rich Marange diamond fields in eastern Zimbabwe, with reports of killings and human rights abuses there. Despite his money-raising role, Mr Mnangagwa, a lawyer who grew up in Zambia, was not always well-loved by the rank and file of his own party. A Zanu-PF official posed an interesting question when asked about Mr Mnangagwa's prospects: ""You think Mugabe is bad, but have you thought that whoever comes after him could be even worse?"" The opposition candidate who defeated Mr Mnangagwa in the 2000 parliamentary campaign in Kwekwe Central, Blessing Chebundo, might agree. During a bitter campaign, Mr Chebundo escaped death by a whisker when the Zanu-PF youths who had abducted him and doused him with petrol were unable to light a match. Those who fought in Zimbabwe's war of independence have long monopolised power Mr Mnangagwa's fearsome reputation was made during the civil war which broke out in the 1980s between Mr Mugabe's Zanu party and the Zapu party of Joshua Nkomo. As national security minister, he was in charge of the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), which worked hand in glove with the army to suppress Zapu. Thousands of civilians - mainly ethnic Ndebeles, seen as Zapu supporters - were killed in a campaign known as Gukurahundi, before the two parties merged to form Zanu-PF. Among countless other atrocities carried out by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade of the army, villagers were forced at gunpoint to dance on the freshly dug graves of their relatives and chant pro-Mugabe slogans. Mr Mnangagwa has denied any role in the massacres, but the wounds are still painful and many party officials, not to mention voters, in Matabeleland might find it hard to back Mr Mnangagwa. He does enjoy the support of many of the war veterans who led the campaign of violence against the white farmers and the opposition from 2000. They remember him as one of the men who, following his military training in China and Egypt, directed the fight for independence in the 1960s and 1970s. He also attended the Beijing School of Ideology, run by the Chinese Communist Party. Mr Mnangagwa's official profile says he was the victim of state violence after being arrested by the white-minority government in the former Rhodesia in 1965, when the ""crocodile gang"" he led helped blow up a train near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo). ""He was tortured, severely resulting in him losing his sense of hearing in one ear,"" the profile says. ""Part of the torture techniques involved being hanged with his feet on the ceiling and the head down. The severity of the torture made him unconscious for days."" As he said he was under 21 at the time, he was not executed but instead sentenced to 10 years in prison. ""He has scars from that period. He was young and brave,"" a close friend of Mr Mnangagwa once said, asking not to be named. ""Perhaps that explains why he is indifferent. Horrible things happened to him when he was young."" Have Zimbabwe's generals turned into democrats? The crusader taking on Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' Zimbabwe's exiled white farmers return Snapping at the heels of Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' The age factor His ruthlessness, which it could be argued he learnt from his Rhodesian torturers, is said to have been seen again in 2008 when he reportedly masterminded Zanu-PF's response to Mr Mugabe losing the first round of the president election to long-time rival Morgan Tsvangirai. The military and state security organisations unleashed a campaign of violence against opposition supporters, leaving hundreds dead and forcing thousands from their homes. Mr Tsvangirai then pulled out of the second round and Mr Mugabe was re-elected. Mr Mnangagwa has not commented on allegations he was involved in planning the violence, but an insider in the party's security department later confirmed that he was the political link between the army, intelligence and Zanu-PF. He was seen as Mr Mugabe's right-hand man - that is until the former first lady Grace Mugabe became politically ambitious and tried to edge him out. Their rivalry took a bizarre turn when he fell ill in August 2017 at a political rally led by former President Mugabe and had to be airlifted to South Africa. Grace Mugabe (right) bit off more than she could chew by taking on Mr Mnangagwa His supporters suggested that a rival group within Zanu-PF had poisoned him and appeared to blame ice cream from Mrs Mugabe's dairy firm. In his first words to cheering supporters after Mr Mugabe's resignation, he spoke about this plot and another plan to ""eliminate"" him. He has also blamed a group linked to the former first lady for an explosion in June at a Zanu-PF rally in Bulawayo in which two people died. But in a BBC interview, he said the country was safe, told foreign investors not to worry and sought to dispel his ruthless reputation: ""I am as soft as wool. I am a very soft person in life."" This video can not be played Mnangagwa: Criminal will be hounded down, but Zimbabwe is safe His youngest son, a Harare DJ known as St Emmo, blames his reticence for his fearsome reputation. ""He was a good father, very very strict. He doesn't say much and I think that's what frightens people - like: 'What is he thinking?'"" Nick Mangwana, Zanu-PF representative in the UK, accepts that the Zimbabwe's new leader is ""not the most eloquent"". ""He's not pally-pally but more of a do-er, more of a technocrat."" But in his six months in power he has fully embraced Twitter and Facebook - after the Bulawayo blast he posted a message reiterating the strength his Christian faith gives him.

We are ending our live coverage of the army's seizure of power in Zimbabwe. We'll be back if there is any dramatic development. In the meantime, get the latest news from ourour website. We leave you with this photo, which captures the contradiction of the military takeover in Zimbabwe: Mr Mugabe is in office, but not in power: Shingai NyokaBBC Africa, Harare Following guns and explosions on Tuesday night, many thought it was the end for Zimbabwe's long-time leader, Robert Mugabe. But the violence has been replaced by an almost surreal normal. Mr Mugabe  has not yet reached a deal with the military about his future, and does not seem to be losing any sleep over it. For the first time since his arrest, he appeared in public today, conferring degrees on university students in the capital, Harare. Robert Mugabe conferred degrees on more than 3,000 students Sources suggest that he wants to continue as a figurehead until the ruling Zanu-PF party's national congress next month. The catalyst of this crisis, his wife, Grace Mugabe, has not been seen in public. Many suggest that she is confined to their private residence in the capital. It's her ambition to take over as vice-president that set off these events. Mr Mugabe sacked Vice-President Emmerson  Mnangagwa last week and Zanu-PF expelled him, in what was seen as a move to ease his wife's path to power. With Mr Mnangagwa being a former defence minister and a veteran of the war for independence, the military intervened, saying it was targeting ""criminals"" around the president. Read: How to spot a coup Robert Mugabe was widely respected in Africa Where do world leaders go when they're cast out of power and need to find a safe haven fast? President Robert Mugabe famously declared that he would cling to power in Zimbabwe ""until God says 'Come'"". And at the age of 93, he might have expected that hour to arrive before a human intervention. Nonetheless, following the military takeover, the leader of 37 years' standing must now barter himself a future. Even now, the military is still negotiating with Mr Mugabe about his possible resignation, but when - or if - he goes, can he expect a villa in the sun like fallen strongmen of the past? Read full story Stanley KwendaBBC Africa, Kutama To get to President Robert Mugabe's rural home, you drive
along the Robert Mugabe Highway. It is probably one of the most well-maintained roads in
Zimbabwe. It is like driving on a carpet. Along the way you are greeted by a
plaque erected in his honour. Kutama Village is home to the 93-year-old. It is a small and
tightly connected village where everyone knows each other. You cannot  really tell if they have been rattled by the
current political crisis. As we arrived, there was an air of uncertainty. Mr Mugabe
is respected here. To many, he is a father and a friend. Speaking to me at his compound, a 65-year-old neighbour
told me: He's kind, he's a good man and he understands people's plight.""  The man goes to St Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church with Mr Mugabe, a devout Christian, whenever he visits.   He never demands special treatment. He visits people to check on their welfare.""  Nevertheless, he supported the intervention by the army to remove Mr Mugabe from office, saying it is meant to correct a broken system:  If his term goes out then there's nothing wrong.""  When I approached other villagers, I attracted immediate suspicion. They were not keen to talk. But it seems to me that Mr Mugabe is seen as a hero in the village. It is easy to spot people wearing clothes emblazoned with his face. Police officers are patrolling the area around Mr Mugabe's home. You can't really peep inside the compound because of tight security. Students at the University of Zimbabwe in the capital Harare are hopeful that the country will emerge from its current political crisis stronger, and will be able to deal with its myriad economic and social problems, as BBC Focus on Africa radio heard from them: Kim ChakanetsaBBC World Service President Robert Mugabe, seen here with his wife Grace and daughter Bona, comes from the Shona ethnic group Great weight is placed on respecting your elders among the Shona, which are Zimbabwe's biggest ethnic group. It is one of the fundamental values. At a young age you are taught to greet, speak and interact with elders in a particular manner. For example, when arriving at someone's house, an exchange of greetings will be led by the younger party, who must enquire about the health of every adult present. For girls or women, this could involve kneeling and clapping, then asking each individual in turn about their health. Boys and men will do much the same, but crouching. Failing to do so is frowned upon, and taken as a sign of a poor upbringing or lack of respect. Within the household, grandparents wield considerable influence. This reverence for elders extends beyond your family. Any older woman or man is to be treated in the same way. All 10 provincial committees of Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF party have resolved to remove President Robert Mugabe from office, a UK-based representative of the party has said. The decision is expected to be endorsed by the party's top leadership body, the central committee, which will then elect the man Mr Mugabe sacked as vice-president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, as the acting leader, Nick Mangwana said. Mr Mnangagwa will then be endorsed as the next president at Zanu-PF's national congress, next month, he added in a tweet:  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Schoolchildren formed this mosaic of Robert Mugabe at Independence Day celebrations in April President Robert Mugabe's first public appearance after the military takeover in Zimbabwe will have puzzled some. Here he was at a university graduation ceremony given the authority to hand students their degrees, almost as if nothing had happened. It tells us two things. Firstly, this was political theatre. The suggestion being that behind-the-scenes negotiations over his exit deal are cordial. But it was also more than spectacle. It showed that President Mugabe's opponents want to treat the elder statesman with dignity. As in much of Africa, respecting your elders is ingrained in Zimbabwe's culture. And 93-year-old Robert Mugabe, a liberation fighter who became the country's leader at independence in 1980, is seen as the father of the nation. Read full story Zimbabwe's  #ThisFlag protest movement leader Evan Mawarire has urged people to attend tomorrow's planned rally to demand President Robert Mugabe's resignation so that the southern African state could make a ""fresh start"". Mr Mawarire, a pastor, is currently holding a livestream on his Twitter account to encourage Zimbabweans to show up at the rally: Allow Twitter content?

First Lady Grace Mugabe wanted to be the next president A ""palace revolution"" has taken place in Zimbabwe, after a split in the ruling Zanu-PF party over who will succeed President Robert Mugabe, South African political analyst Anthoni van Nieuwkerk has said. Mr Mugabe sacked his deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, in what was seen as a move to anoint his wife, Grace, as his successor. Mr Mnangagwa, a former defence minister, vowed to fight back, leading to the current crisis. His allies were grouped in Zanu-PF faction known as Lacoste, while Mrs Mugabe's allies were G-40. Mr Van Nieuwkerk told AFP: It is a palace revolution where one section of the ruling Zanu-PF party is using elements of the military, but not all of the security services - the police for example - to bring change within the ruling party.  Grace Mugabe was trying to get rid of her opponents, who were using aspects of the military to get rid of her.  So it is a limited military intervention with political purposes. The coup is against G-40  The calculation that the military is making is 'let's treat him with dignity and respect as we search for the way forward'. That is why he made the appearance at the university.""  Stanley KwendaBBC Africa, Kutama Villager says that Robert Mugabe understands the plight of people  There is no military presence of in Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's home village of Kutama, some 90km (55 miles) from the capital, Harare. Many here are aware of the political crisis unfolding but
are reluctant to talk about it. A villager, who did not want to be named, said that people are fond of the nonagenarian president. Mr Mugabe is a good man ""who understands people's plight and likes to mingle with people in the area when he visits"", he said. However, he would not mind if the president, in power since 1980, was forced out of office, the villager added. The military has ended 36 years of loyalty to President Mugabe US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has called for a ""a quick return to civilian rule"" in Zimbabwe, following the army takeover on Wednesday, Reuters news agency reports. He described the situation as ""a concern"", adding: Zimbabwe has an opportunity to set itself on a new path, one that must include democratic elections and respect for human rights.""  Mr Tillerson made the comments to African foreign ministers in Washington, Reuters reports. The US is seeking ""a new era"" in Zimbabwe, the State Department's top official for Africa has said, Reuters news agency reports. Donald Yamamoto added: It's a transition to a new era for Zimbabwe, that's really what we're hoping for.""  Mr Mugabe was a fierce critic of Western powers Regional mediators have been mediating between Mr Mugabe and the army to end the crisis. The army says it has not staged a coup, despite the fact that Mr Mugabe is in its custody. He was allowed to attend a university graduation ceremony earlier today. The army is deployed on the streets of Zimbabwe's capital, Harare China has called for the political crisis in  Zimbabwe to be legally resolved, Reuters news agency reports. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters: China calls on all sides in Zimbabwe to keep their eyes on the country's long-term and fundamental interests, and uphold dialogue and consultations to bridge differences, to promote a peaceful and appropriate resolution to the issue under a legal framework.""  China was a key ally of Mr Mugabe, who increasingly pursued a ""Look East"" policy after Western powers condemned his controversial land seizure programme and treatment of the opposition. China gave Mr Mugabe strong backing during the 1970s war for independence, and has invested heavily in the southern African state. Last week, Zimbabwe's army chief Gen Constantino Chiwenga was on an official visit to China when Mr Mugabe fired his deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa. Gen Chiwenga is allied with Mr Mnangagwa, and put Mr Mugabe under house arrest on Wednesday.  The military detained President Robert Mugabe on Wednesday Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was not accompanied by the presidential guard when he attended a university graduation ceremony in the capital, Harare, opposition politician David Coltart has said. The MDC senator said he had been reliably informed that Mr Mugabe's convoy was made of only three a cars. By allowing him to attend the event, the army generals who put him under house arrest on Wednesday were signalling to the regional bloc, the Southern African Development Community (Sadc), that Mr Mugabe was fine - but at the same time they were ""keeping him in his place"", he said. Sadc is trying to mediate an end to the crisis. Ivory Coast's President Alassane Ouattara has added his voice to calls for President Robert Mugabe, 93, to resign, AFP news agency reports. He praised Mr Mugabe's role  in the fight against colonialism, saying he ""has been the object of respect and  even adulation from many Africans and young Africans"". However, the ""world has changed""  and  because of his age and the ""long  time he has spent in office, everyone is aware that it is time for him to hand  over his seat to a new generation"", Mr Ouattara added. President Robert Mugabe's wife, Grace, 52, harboured ambitions to succeed him Mr Khama has been a strong critic of Mr Mugabe Botswana's President Ian Khama has backed calls for Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe to step down, the Reuters news agency reports. He says that the military intervention was ""an opportunity to put Zimbabwe on a path to peace and prosperity"". He added: I don't think anyone should be president for that amount of time [37 years]. We are presidents, we are not monarchs. It's just common sense.""  Botswana is among regional countries working to find a solution to resolve the ongoing political crisis. Mr Khama is a long-standing critic of Mr Mugabe, and has previously called for him to step down. Read: Mugabe - hero or wrecker? Analysis Joseph WinterBBC News website Africa editor Zimbabwe's security chiefs have worked with Mr Mugabe since they fought together in the 1970s war of independence Although the army is obviously calling
the shots in Zimbabwe, in public they still refer to Robert Mugabe as ""his
excellency, the president"" and even ""commander-in-chief"". This is why he has been allowed to
attend the graduation ceremony. This is partly to keep up the pretence that
they have not staged a coup but they also have a genuine, deeply felt respect
for him going back more than 40 years. All of Zimbabwe's security chiefs have
worked with Mr Mugabe since they fought together in the 1970s war of
independence - and the bonds forged in that struggle are difficult to break. In many ways, Zimbabwe's military
remains the armed wing of Zanu-PF, as it was when they were all rebels fighting
white-minority rule in the then Rhodesia. Furthermore, in Zimbabwean culture, the
elderly are treated with respect and no-one wants to be seen to be treating a
93-year-old in an undignified manner, especially a man even opposition figures
refer to as the ""father of the nation"". Zimbabwe's only independent MP - Temba Mliswa - has shared a video message expressing his hope for change in the country. He calls on Zimbabweans who want ""change"" to attend a rally planned to take place tomorrow in the capital, Harare: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Zimbabwe's military has placed President Robert Mugabe under house arrest in the capital Harare, South African President Jacob Zuma says. Mr Mugabe told Mr Zuma in a phone call that he was fine, the South African leader's office said. Troops are patrolling the capital, Harare, after they seized state TV and said they were targeting ""criminals"". The move may be a bid to replace Mr Mugabe with his sacked deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, BBC correspondents say. Mr Mnangagwa's dismissal last week left Mr Mugabe's wife Grace as the president's likely successor. Latest reaction and updates What we know so far The rise of Grace Mugabe Mr Mugabe, 93, has dominated the country's political scene since it gained independence from the UK in 1980. After days of tension and rumour, soldiers seized the state broadcaster ZBC late on Tuesday. A Zimbabwean army officer, Major General Sibusiso Moyo, went on air and denied there was a coup, but said the military was targeting ""criminals"" around President Mugabe. Maj Gen Moyo also said Mr Mugabe and his family were ""safe and sound and their security is guaranteed"". It is not clear who is leading the military action. Since then military vehicles have been out on the streets of Harare, while gunfire has been heard from northern suburbs where Mr Mugabe and a number of government officials live.

Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Zimbabwe media slow to cover takeover By Andrew Harding, BBC Southern Africa correspondent A quick show of military force, a few arrests... and then what? These are, of course, unpredictable times for Zimbabwe and yet there is a chance that the army's extraordinary overnight gamble will pay off, and that President Robert Mugabe, humiliated and powerless, will nonetheless be allowed to retire with at least the pretence of dignity. It is important to remember that Mr Mugabe is not being challenged by the Western governments he has warned against for decades, or by Zimbabwe's political opposition, or by a mass uprising against economic hardship. This is, fundamentally, an internal power struggle within Zanu-PF and whoever emerges victorious can expect a newly purged party to fall obediently into line. Mr Mugabe's mistake, at 93, was to assume he was still powerful enough to build a dynasty to back his wife, Grace, to succeed him. Instead, his once loyal deputy, Emerson Mnangagwa, may be poised to take control. If so, many foreign governments are likely to give him the benefit of the doubt and hope he can rescue Zimbabwe from years of misrule. In his statement Maj Gen Moyo said ""this is not a military takeover of government"". But despite the Zimbabwean military's denials, to many observers their actions bore many of the hallmarks of a coup. Armed vehicles have been patrolling in Harare There has been no direct comment from President Mugabe, nor his wife Grace, whose whereabouts are unclear. Key regional blocs the African Union (AU) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) do not look favourably on unconstitutional changes of power, which might explain the Zimbabwean military's wording. How can you tell a coup is happening? In Harare, some were delighted. ""We are going to have a good life, we are looking forward to Christmas, because of what has happened,"" one woman told BBC News. This video can not be played Zimbabweans react to the news that troops had taken control The leader of the war veterans, Chris Mutsvangwa, told Reuters: ""It's the end of a very painful and sad chapter in the history of a young nation, in which a dictator, as he became old, surrendered his court to a gang of thieves around his wife."" Both the UK Foreign Office and US embassy in Harare has advised its citizens to remain indoors until the situation becomes clearer. China, Zimbabwe's biggest trading partner, says it is closely watching the situation and hopes that the relevant parties can properly handle their internal affairs. Did Mugabe go too far?

"This video can not be played Zimbabweans react to the news that troops have taken control The Zimbabwean military's takeover of power and detention of President Robert Mugabe ""seems like a coup"", key regional bloc the African Union says.

"Police say a number of students had to be medically evacuated from the school A California man killed his wife and hid her body in their home before he fatally shot four people during a gun rampage, police have said. ""We believe that's probably what started this whole event,"" Tehama County Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston told reporters on Wednesday. Kevin Janson Neal, 43, fired into an elementary school in Rancho Tehama, but was stopped from entering by teachers. His wife's body was found hidden under floorboards, police say. Investigators said they believe Neal shot and killed his wife on Monday night, sparking the gun rampage early on Tuesday. Mr Johnston said police also found two neighbours shot dead. The victims were involved in an ongoing dispute with Neal that lead to an assault with a deadly weapon charge against him last January, authorities said. He killed two others who police said appeared to have been shot at random. A motive for the attack is still unclear, but Mr Johnston added: ""I think he had a desire to kill as many people as he could."" The attacker's mum said he worked as a marijuana farmer At one point Neal crashed a stolen vehicle through the Rancho Tehama Reserve School's locked gate before class began, firing dozens of shots through windows and walls when he was unable to enter the building. Mr Johnston praised teachers for issuing a lockdown and securing the school after hearing gunshots, adding that their actions prevented a ""horrific bloodbath"". Police said 14 people were injured in total, including seven children. America's gun culture in 10 charts Why are US mass shootings getting more deadly? Trump rejects stricter gun checks One child at the school was shot in the chest while other children were mainly hurt by broken glass, Mr Johnston said. The family of Alejandro Hernandez, 6, created a GoFundMe account to help raise money for his healthcare costs after he was shot in the chest and foot. Alejandro Hernandez was shot in the chest at the school Police said two semi-automatic rifles that were used by the gunman were recovered from one of the crime scenes. Mr Johnston said the guns were obtained ""in an illegal manner"" and manufactured illegally. According to court documents, a restraining order taken out against him following an incident with his neighbours in January would have required him to forfeit any firearms. During the attack, Neal also wore a military-style assault vest capable of storing multiple rounds of ammunition. Police said he was out on bail after he posted a $160,000 (Â£121,000) bond for an assault with a deadly weapon charge, which stemmed from an incident with his neighbours. A woman, who identified herself as Neal's mother, told the Associated Press news agency,externalthat Neal called her before the attack and said: ""I'm on a cliff and there's nowhere to go."" She said Neal was in a long-running dispute with neighbours who he believed were cooking methamphetamine. She added that Neal, who was raised in North Carolina, had been working as a cannabis farmer and had recently married his long-time girlfriend. His sister, Sheridan Orr, told the AP that she believed her brother was addicted to drugs and struggled with mental illness and a violent temper. ""We're stunned and we're appalled that this is a person who has no business with firearms, whatsoever,"" Ms Orr said.

"This video can not be played Darryll Rowe told one of his victims 'I got you. Burn, you have it' A man has been convicted of trying to infect 10 men with HIV in a ""campaign"" to infect as many as possible. Daryll Rowe infected five men he had unprotected sex with and sabotaged the condoms of another five in Brighton and Northumberland. After sex with some of the men he texted mocking messages, including ""I have HIV LOL. Oops!"" and ""I'm riddled"". During the trial hairdresser Rowe, 27, claimed to believe months of drinking his own urine cured him of the virus. He was convicted at Lewes Crown Court of five counts of causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) and five of attempted GBH. Daryll Rowe met his partners on dating app Grindr, jurors at Lewes Crown Court were told During the six-week trial the prosecution described Rowe's actions as a ""campaign"" to infect as many men as possible over a four-month period starting in October 2015 across the Brighton area. He had relations with eight men he met on dating app Grindr, before moving to Northumberland and having unprotected sex with another two men later in 2016. Speaking after the verdict, Nigel Pilkington, deputy chief crown prosecutor in the South East, said he believed there ""may well be more men out there"" who had fallen victim to Rowe, of no fixed address. Throughout the case Rowe was described as a ""control freak"" who would shift between being charming and ""jealous"". Mr Pilkington said he was a ""cruel and callous man"" whose crimes were ""akin to stabbing or shooting somebody"". Mr Pilkington added: ""The absolute deliberate infection of other men by a man, is not something I've ever come across in 25 years as a prosecutor and I don't expect to ever come across a case like it again. ""This is a man who, after the event, having known what was he was doing, sent mocking and abusive texts to some of his victims. It must have been traumatic."" Deborah Gold, chief executive of the National Aids Trust (NAT), said Rowe's behaviour was ""utterly exceptional and vanishingly rare"". She added that the majority of HIV transmissions are by people who are unaware they have the virus. Speaking after the hearing, one of Rowe's victims, whose biological parents both had HIV and later died, said the news of his condition drove him to a suicide attempt. ""I was always so careful,"" he said. ""My dad was a junkie and she was a very young mother. I was always trying to run away from that lifestyle, That's why I always insisted on condoms."" He added it was a ""reminder of my past"". ""I feel it's come full-circle, and has made this my new life, which is very unfair,"" he added. ""[Rowe] called me over and over. He admitted to ripping the condom. ""He said, 'I got you. Burn, you have it' and he was laughing at me. There was menace in his voice, it was an insane conversation. It was horrific to hear. I was in a dark place. ""It's a violation. I could only describe it as feeling like you've been raped, not the physical side of it, but the mental side."" Rowe will be sentenced on 29 January. Det Insp Andy Wolstenholme of Sussex Police said: ""Daryll Rowe was consistent in lying to his victims about having HIV, he was persistent and aggressive in wanting unprotected sex in order to infect people, and when he didn't get what he wanted, he deliberately damaged condoms to achieve his aim. At the end of the trial it emerged two dock officers were sacked after falling asleep while evidence was being given. Loud snoring disturbed the hearing on 5 October and they were both removed from the proceedings.

"This video can not be played In a recent documentary Benedict Allen described his experiences of living in Papua New Guinea A search has been mounted for British explorer Benedict Allen, whose family say has gone missing during an expedition to Papua New Guinea. The 57-year-old was travelling on his own to try to find the reclusive Yaifo tribe, whom he first met 30 years ago. His sister says she was expecting to hear from him by Monday - and he hasn't taken planned flights home. A helicopter pilot, who dropped Mr Allen off several weeks ago, is trying to find him, the BBC has learned. Our security correspondent Frank Gardner, who recently travelled through Papua New Guinea with Mr Allen for a BBC documentary, said he understood the pilot was tracking Benedict's route from his starting point in a remote place called Bisorio. They have spoken to local police chiefs, and were looking to locate him by helicopter and get him out, our correspondent said. He added that the former UK high commissioner to Papua New Guinea, David Gordon-Macleod, said ""huge areas of the country have no mobile coverage"", meaning that even if Mr Allen had reached a village, he is likely to still be out of contact with the outside world. Mr Allen's older sister, Katie Pestille, said it was ""out of character"" for him to miss his scheduled flight out of Papua New Guinea to Hong Kong. ""It's ghastly,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""For everybody else, it's very exciting - all the expeditions and all the things he does, but for his sister and his wife, it's more of a worry,"" she explained. First solo adventure:To the Amazon at 22, during which he was shot at by two hitmen Tough time:An initiation into manhood in Papua New Guinea. He was kept in a ""crocodile nest"" with 20 others, and repeatedly cut with bamboo blades to leave scars that looked like crocodile scales Low moment:Eating his own dog to survive Travel habit:Always keeps loo paper in a back pocket. ""You know how it is,""he tells the Lonely Planet.,external Philosophy:""For me personally, exploration isn't about conquering nature, planting flags or leaving your mark. It's about the opposite: opening yourself up and allowing the place to leave its mark on you."" Career:Six TV series for the BBC, author, motivational speaker Family:Lives with family in Czech Republic Mr Allen, from London, has previously crossed the Amazon Basin on foot and in a dug out canoe, and participated in a six-week male initiation ceremony in which crocodile marks were carved onto his body. He has filmed a number of his adventures for BBC documentaries and written books on exploration. The Foreign Office said its staff were assisting family members and were in contact with local authorities. By BBC Security Correspondent Frank Gardner Travelling in Papua New Guinea is hugely unpredictable and normal schedules don't apply, so there is a good chance that Benedict Allen has been detained by natural causes. Landslides, torrential downpours and sometimes an eruption of fighting between local tribes can all throw itineraries off-course. Foreign travellers though, are rarely targeted outside the main towns. Knowing Benedict, it is also quite possible that he has accepted an invitation to stay on longer for a tribal ceremony - it can also be considered an insult to refuse. The Yaifo tribe who Benedict visited in the 1980s initially greeted him with suspicion and hostility but then accepted him. He told me last month, just before he set off, that he had no idea how they would receive him, or even if he would be able to find them in such a remote part of the country. In a blog posted in September,external, Mr Allen described his plan to assemble a group at an abandoned mission station in Bisorio before heading into the remote jungle. His aim, he said, was to create a brief record of the lives of the Yaifo and track down some of those he met on his last visit. ""Last time, the Yaifo 'greeted' me with a terrifying show of strength, an energetic dance featuring their bows and arrows,"" he said. ""On this occasion who knows if the Yaifo will do the same, or run off, or be wearing jeans and T shirts traded eons ago from the old mission station. ""But of course I may not even make it there - even aged 26, it was a very hard hike up through rather treacherous terrain."" He said his journey out of the jungle was unplanned. ""Either I must paddle down river for a week or so - or enlist the help of the Yaifo, as I did last time,"" he said. He added that he would be travelling without a satellite phone, GPS or companion, ""because this is how I do my journeys of exploration"". In his last tweet from 11 October, Mr Allen wrote: ""Marching off to Heathrow. I may be some time."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Police say a number of students had to be medically evacuated from the school A gunman who killed four people on Tuesday in rural California fired into an elementary school but was stopped from entering by teachers, police say. Staff at Rancho Tehama Reserve School went into lockdown, securing school doors after hearing nearby gunshots. Authorities praised the teachers' actions as ""monumental"" in saving ""countless"" lives. Police confirmed one child was shot at the school after the gunman fired into it. Others were hurt by broken glass. Police later confronted the gunman in a stolen vehicle, shooting and killing him. He was named locally as 43-year-old Kevin Neal. It is believed the shooting spree began after a domestic row with the gunman's neighbours in Rancho Tehama, a rural community about 120 miles (195km) from Sacramento, on Tuesday morning. America's gun culture in 10 charts Why are US mass shootings getting more deadly? Trump rejects stricter gun checks Police said they believed he went on a ""bizarre and murderous rampage"" after the dispute escalated and he killed a neighbour. Officials confirmed the gunman had ""prior contacts with law enforcement"". The Tehama district attorney told the Sacramento Bee he was being prosecuted on charges relating to a stabbing and assault in January,externalin an incident involving two of his neighbours. He had also reportedly been the subject of a domestic violence call on the eve of the gun spree. A semi-automatic rifle and two handguns were recovered from one of the crime scenes, police said. At least 10 people were injured in the shootings at multiple locations. Police said he chose most of the victims at random, and reportedly shot into the school but became frustrated after the teachers locked the doors and left after six minutes. It is believed the school was alerted after a mother was shot at in her car while driving her children to school. She was reportedly seriously wounded but not killed. The child who was shot has undergone surgery after being struck in the leg and chest, reports say. Other children at the school were reportedly injured by broken glass, and some were evacuated from the school and transported to hospital by helicopter. Police examine a vehicle that was involved in the string of shootings in Rancho Tehama ""This individual shooter was bent on engaging and killing people at random. I have to say this incident, as tragic and as bad as it is, could have been so much worse,"" Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston said. The Redding Record Searchlight newspaper spoke to a man who said he was a neighbour of the gunman.,external Brian Flint said his neighbour ""has been shooting a lot of bullets lately, hundreds of rounds, large magazines"". ""We made it aware [to police] that this guy is crazy and he's been threatening us,"" he told the newspaper.

"This video can not be played Torrential rain overnight created fast-flowing torrents of red mud Flash floods caused by heavy overnight rain have killed at least 15 people and caused destruction in central Greece. The industrial towns of Mandra, Nea Peramos and Megara, west of the capital Athens, were the most affected. Many of the dead were elderly people whose bodies were found inside their homes, reports say. Fast-flowing torrents of red mud flooded roads. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras declared a period of national mourning in the wake of the tragedy. ""Everything is lost. The disaster is biblical,"" Mandra Mayor Yianna Krikouki told state broadcaster ERT. At least 37 people have been taken to hospital, the broadcaster said, and some are still missing. Grim weather warning for Europe's future Bad weather has hit parts of Greece for about a week, but particularly heavy rain overnight caused the sudden flooding, for which locals said they were unprepared. The force of the water moved vehicles, damaged walls and roofing, and left many homeless as their homes flooded to a life-threatening level. By Wednesday afternoon, Greece's fire service said it had received over 600 calls for help and dispatched almost 200 firefighters in 55 vehicles to the towns, which have a combined population in the tens of thousands. ""The water came down the mountain, millions of tonnes,"" Stavros Fotiou, the deputy mayor of Nea Peramos, told ERT. ""Our roads are completely destroyed... 1,000 homes have been flooded, that's a third of the town,"" he added. Some roads were inundated by more than 1m (3ft) of water The region's deputy governor, Yiannis Vassileiou, told the broadcaster that emergency services had been prepared for poor weather, but then ""the Niagara Falls came down and could not be stopped"". Prime Minister Tsipras said that declaring a period of national mourning was ""the least we can do"". He also vowed to provide aid to the victims and ensure they were housed safely.

"Anti-gun violence demonstrators outside the the National Rifle Association in Washington DC About 1,300 US children under the age of 17 die from gun-related injuries per year, a government study has found. Researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also found that guns seriously wounded about 5,800 children each year. Boys accounted for 82% of all child firearm deaths while black children were 10 times more likely to be killed by a gun, according to the study. More than half of these deaths were homicides while 38% were ruled suicide. The study,published in Pediatrics,externalon Monday, also found 6% of firearm-related deaths were fatalities from accidental gun injuries. Are US shootings involving children on the rise? ""Firearm injuries are a leading cause of death among US children aged one to 17 years and contribute substantially each year to premature death, illness and disability of children,"" said CDC's Katherine Fowler, who led the study. ""About 19 children a day die or are medically treated in an emergency department for a gunshot wound in the US,"" she told Reuters. CDC researchers examined national data in what they describe as ""the most comprehensive examination of current firearm-related deaths and injuries among children in the United States to date"". The study found a 60% increase in gun suicides from 2007-15, according an analysis of national injury records. Trump reassures US gun owners Chicago goes high-tech in search of answers to gun crime surge Suicide was most likely to occur when children were dealing with stressful circumstances or relationship problems with a boyfriend, girlfriend or family member, the study revealed. White children and Native American children were four to five times more likely to die by firearm suicide. Accidental gun deaths appeared to happen most frequently among children playing with firearms. This video can not be played Mr Obama told the BBC that gun control was his biggest frustration The study comes as a four-year-old Pennsylvania boy shot himself in the face and died on Sunday. Police in Monroe County have not charged anyone in the boy's death. Lexie Antonini, the boy's 21-year-old mother and volunteer firefighter, said she didn't ""know how to feel"". ""I never thought I would see the day i would get the news my only son has passed away...my poor baby,"" shewrote in a Facebook post,external. ""I don't know how to feel. I don't know what to do. I lost my everything,"" The CDC analysis also looked at deaths on a state level and found District of Columbia and Louisiana to have the highest rates of child firearm deaths. Delaware, Hawaii, Maine and New Hampshire had 20 or fewer child gun-related deaths, according to the study. Researchers also pointed out that children were rarely injured or killed by guns in other developed countries. In fact, more than 90% of all children ages 14 and up who were killed by guns in high-income countries resided in the US.

"A summertime flood in the Austrian Tyrol in 2005 Climate change has had a significant impact on the timing of river floods across Europe over the past 50 years, according to a new study. In some regions, such as southern England, floods are now occurring 15 days earlier than they did half a century ago. But the changes aren't uniform, with rivers around the North Sea seeing floods delayed by around eight days. Thestudy has been published,externalin the journal Science. Floods caused by rivers impact more people than any other natural hazard, and the estimated global damages run to over a $100bn a year. Researchers have long predicted that a warming world would have direct impacts on these events but until now the evidence has been hard to establish. Floods are affected by many different factors in addition to rainfall, such as the amount of moisture already in the soil and other questions such as changes in land-use that can speed up water run-off from hillsides. This new study looks at this issue in some depth, by creating a Europe-wide database of observations from 4,262 hydrometric stations in 38 countries, dating back to 1960. The analysis finds a clear but complex impact of climate change on river flooding. The blue arrows indicate earlier flooding due to changes in the soil moisture levels. The yellow and green indicate earlier floods due to earlier snow melt The most consistent changes are in north-eastern Europe around Scandinavia where earlier snow melt due to warmer temperatures is leading to earlier spring floods. Around 50% of monitoring stations are seeing floods eight days earlier than they did 50 years ago. The biggest changes are seen along the western edge of Europe, from Portugal up to Southern England. Half the stations recorded floods at least 15 days earlier than previously. A quarter of the stations saw flooding more than 36 days earlier than in 1960. In these regions, the issue isn't snow melt - it's more about saturated soils.  Maximum rainfall tends to occur in the autumn and gets stored in the soils. Heavier and earlier rain means that the groundwater reaches capacity earlier. ""It's the interplay between extreme rainfall and the abundance of rainfall,"" lead author Prof GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl, from the Technical University of Vienna, told BBC News. ""In southern England, it has been raining more, longer and more intensely than in the past. This has created a rising groundwater table and higher soil moisture than usual and combined with intense rainfall this produces earlier river floods."" However, around the North Sea, in the Netherlands, Denmark and Scotland, the trend is towards later floods. The scientists believe this is due to changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the weather phenomenon that pushes storms across the ocean into Europe. Across Europe, regions experienced different shifts in the timing of floods, both earlier and later The NAO is driven by differences in atmospheric pressure between the North Pole and the Equator. Recent, rapid changes in temperatures in the Arctic are interfering with these pressure levels and changing the track of the oscillation and storms as well. According to this study, the storms are arriving later and as a result some river flooding happens later too. Prof BlÃ¶schl says that this study shows clear evidence of the impact of human-induced climate change in many regions - but there are still some areas of uncertainty. ""Where the human imprint is obvious is in the northeast of Europe. It is quite a direct link, with a warming climate and earlier snow melt,"" he said. ""However, the areas impacted by the NAO are more difficult to attribute to anthropogenic global warming. The jury is still out on that aspect."" The study foresees subtle but significant impacts that could arise from the change in flood timing. There could be effects on river ecosystems with salmon spawning later in the year. There could also be implications for hydropower stations, and for agriculture if fields stay wetter for longer. The UK has experienced severe flooding on many rivers in recent years, including on the Thames ""The more serious concern is that if warming impacts the seasonality it may also impact the scale of flooding,"" said Prof BlÃ¶schl. ""You could think of timing changes as the harbinger of future changes of flood magnitude. That is the more serious concern. If that happens, flood risk management will have to adapt and that will be different in different parts of Europe."" Other experts believe that the changes in flood timing identified by this study have significant implications for how we understand the risk of river floods and how we deal with them. ""Nearly every major city and town in Europe is built on a river and we protect this urban infrastructure by using past floods as a gauge of the potential risk,"" said Mark Maslin, Professor of Climatology at University College London. ""The study shows that this approach underestimates the risk, as climate change has made European floods occur earlier in the year, increasing their potential impact. ""This means all the infrastructure that we have built to protect our cities needs to be reviewed as much of it will be inadequate to protect us from future climate change-induced extreme flooding.""

"Sir James Dyson thanked Mr Conze when he stepped down last month Electrical firm Dyson is suing former chief executive Max Conze for allegedly leaking company secrets and using company resources for his own benefit. Max Conze stepped down in October and was thanked by the British firm's founder, Sir James Dyson. But the BBC has learned that, according to the company, Mr Conze was sacked for an alleged series of breaches. Mr Conze denied the allegations and said it would cause an ""unnecessary distraction"" for Dyson staff. The allegations include ""the disclosure of confidential information, and a breach of his fiduciary duties"". A spokesman for the company said: ""The Dyson board has decided to bring a claim against Max Conze at the High Court of Justice in London in relation to his actions while chief executive."" Mr Conze was appointed to the role in 2011 after a stint running Dyson's US business. His period as chief executive coincided with a huge increase in sales of Dyson's products. Profits at the vacuum cleaner and air purifier maker rose 41% last year to Â£631m. The breaches are said to include: ""Disclosing confidential product information to third parties, breaching Dyson's confidentiality rules. ""Using Dyson resources and information to evaluate an investment opportunity for his own benefit and/or for the benefit of a venture capital firm, rather than for Dyson's benefit - breaching his fiduciary duties. ""Failing to follow lawful and reasonable instructions regarding his conduct and focus of attention."" In response, Mr Conze said: ""I did nothing of the sort. During my six years as CEO of Dyson, the sales and profits will have tripled with the company growing from 2,500 to 10,000 staff."" He said Dyson sold 13 million machines last year, up from five million in 2010. ""This couldn't have happened without my total commitment to the business and its people,"" he said. Mr Conze added: ""This ridiculous allegation is merely trying to distract attention from the claims that Dyson know I am about to issue."" Dyson would not comment on whether the breaches were in connection with its project to build a new electric car, which had been long under wraps and only recently revealed. The action will be lodged in the High Court on Wednesday.

"Greggs the bakers has apologised for swapping Jesus for a sausage roll in a promotional image for its advent calendar. It shows a nativity scene with three wise men gathered around a pastry instead of Christ. Christian Twitter users said the advert was disrespectful to their religion. ""I'm glad Christians kicked off and Greggs apologised,"" wrote one Twitter user. ""No other religion would stand for that nonsense."" Other people joined in calls for organisations to ""respect all faiths equally"". Greggs has apologised for the image, saying it hadn't planned to upset anyone. ""We're really sorry to have caused any offence, this was never our intention,"" the firm said in a statement. The image was issued to promote a Â£24 advent calendar which has vouchers to spend in its stores behind each door. The Greggs advent calendar celebrates 24 days of pasties, pies and other baked goods The UK Evangelical Alliance tell Newsbeat it is ""not too outraged"" about the Greggs nativity scene, but that it does raise issues of companies using the Bible story to sell products. ""Every year some company creates a Christmas controversy for commercial gain. It seems to get earlier each year,"" says Daniel Webster, spokesperson for the organisation. He says Jesus is what should be the focus of Christmas celebrations, not advent calendars and marketing to sell sausage rolls. ""That's the scandal that should be talked about this Christmas, not processed outrage to sell processed food.""

"The Loch Ness monster has had a busy 2017, with more ""official"" sightings than any other year this century. Admittedly, the number of official sightings logged is eight, but that's a lot for a mythical beast. The eighth sighting is a photo of a strange ""fin"" in the water, taken by Dr Jo Knight from Lancaster University, after a recent visit to the loch. She had taken her nine-year-old son to visit Loch Ness because of his interest in the monster. ""My son is interested in all sorts of 'possible' creatures like yetis and Tasmanian tigers,"" Jo tells Newsbeat. ""Scotland is slightly easier to get to than the places he wanted to go to look for yetis."" But she doesn't think they spotted a pre-historic animal. ""There aren't enough fish available for a large creature to be eating,"" she says. ""However, there is a possibility there might be some kind of eel or sturgeon which is causing the sightings, that's maybe grown bigger than they usually do. ""I think there's some kind of creature but possibly not a monster."" This famous 1924 ""photo"" of the Loch Ness monster was revealed as a hoax by one of the people who staged it A woman on her honeymoon in October spotted a creature moving in the water, while a group of friends holidaying in August spotted ""something huge"" in the water which apparently ""arched out of the water"". There were three sightings in June, one in May and one in April which were all deemed ""official"" sightings. The myth of the Loch Ness Monster has captured the imagination for decades These sightings, and many more, are recorded by Gary Campbell who assesses and logs sightings of the Loch Ness monster. ""This is the most we have had this century,""he told The Express newspaper this week,external. He says that his team was ""50/50"" on the photo taken by Dr Knight, but they decided to give her snap ""the benefit of the doubt"". ""In recent years the most sightings in a year we have had is 17 - and that was in 1996. ""Before that the 1960s and 1930s were the times that had most sightings - sometimes more than 20 in a year."" A 9m model of the Loch Ness Monsterbuilt in 1969 for a Sherlock Holmes movie was found almost 50 years after it sank in the loch last year. A Kongsberg Maritime image of the lost Nessie model Loch Ness expert Adrian Shine said the shape, measurements and location pointed to the object being the prop.

"Naomi Coleman was deported from Sri Lanka A woman who was deported from Sri Lanka for having a tattoo of the Buddha on her arm has won compensation. Naomi Coleman, from Coventry, was detained for four days in April 2014. Granting her compensation of 800,000 Sri Lankan rupees - about Â£4,000 - the country's Supreme Court said her treatment  was ""scandalous and horrifying"" and ruled her rights had been violated. Ms Coleman told the BBC Sinhala Service she was ""overwhelmed"" by the ruling. Officers involved in her arrest were also ordered to pay her compensation. Midlands Live: Music mogul's 'ghost' E-type auctioned off; Police funding concerns revealed in leaked document Ms Coleman, a mental health nurse, took legal action against the Sri Lankan authorities after her return to the UK. The court ruled there was ""no legal basis"" for her arrest and said she had been subject to ""degrading treatment"" by some officers and a prison guard. In particular, one guard had ""made several lewd, obscene and disparaging remarks of a sexually-explicit nature"" towards Ms Coleman, while some police officers had forced her to give them money. Her lawyer JC Weliamuna told the BBC her deportation had been ""contrary to the law governing immigration and emigration"". Ms Coleman, who was arrested at Bandaranaike International Airport in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo, said previously the detention had left her ""really frightened"". She told the BBC on Wednesday she was ""shocked"" and ""emotional"" on hearing the news. ""Finally the court has actually seen it that I didn't do anything wrong,"" Ms Coleman said. Asked whether she would go back to Sri Lanka, she replied: ""I'm not sure, I don't know. Probably not. ""I'm very happy. I just wouldn't want it to happen to anybody else."" After an order was made to have her deported, Ms Coleman spent a night in prison in Negombo and two nights in a detention centre while security checks were carried out. She said she told police she practised Buddhism and had attended meditation retreats and workshops in Thailand, India, Cambodia and Nepal.

"The army is upset about recent purges in the ruling party The military in Zimbabwe has taken control of the country, putting veteran President Robert Mugabe under house arrest and announcing it was targeting ""criminals"" around him. It has denied it is staging a coup, while Mr Mugabe, 93, has been pictured smiling beside army chiefs and left the house for a scheduled appearance on Friday. However on Sunday,Mr Mugabe was removed as the leader of Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF partyand ex-vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa, who had been fired by Mr Mugabe two weeks before, was appointed in his place. Military officials had feared Mr Mugabe was planning to install his wife, Grace, as his successor. So what does this mean for Mr Mugabe and the country he has led since independence in 1980? Here is what we know. Do you have a question about the situation in Zimbabwe?haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Military vehicles were spotted on roads leading to Harare on Tuesday, sparking rumours that something was afoot. Later, soldiers seized the headquarters of Zimbabwe's national broadcaster ZBC and explosions and gunfire were heard. Maj-Gen Sibusiso Moyo then read out a statement on national television, assuring the nation that President Mugabe and his family were safe. This video can not be played Maj Gen Sibusiso Moyo read out a statement on national TV early on Wednesday The military was only targeting what he called ""criminals"" around the president, he said, denying that there had been a coup. ""As soon as we have accomplished our mission we expect that the situation will return to normalcy,"" he added. President Mugabe was being held at his home and was ""fine"", according to a statement by South Africa's President Jacob Zuma, who spoke to him on Wednesday. On Thursday,he was pictured taking part in talks with Gen Constantino Chiwengaand South African government ministers at State House. The South African envoy has been trying to help the two sides reach a deal on Mr Mugabe's future, but sources suggest he may be resisting pressure to resign. On Friday, the president gave out degrees at a university of which he is chancellor, thereby meeting a prior commitment. The military said on Friday that they had detained some ""criminals"", but they did not give names. On Saturday, tens of thousands of Zimbabweans took to the streets of Harare to urge Mr Mugabe to go. It was led by veterans of the country's war of independence, who last year turned against him. ""There's no going back about Mugabe,"" said veterans leader Christopher Mutsvangwa. ""He must leave."" On Sunday, Zanu-PF sacked Mr Mugabe as its leader. Meanwhile main opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who has been receiving cancer treatment in South Africa, returned to Zimbabwe amid suggestions that his Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) could form part of a possible transitional government. There has not been any official government response to events. Nor have we heard directly from President Mugabe or his wife Grace which, according to analysts, suggests they have lost control. When Mr Mugabe spoke at the university on Friday, he did not make any political comment. And there are no reports of any members of the security forces who remain loyal to Mr Mugabe intervening to defend him. Zimbabwe takeover: Five things you should know SA delegation tries to find resolution This is all about the leadership succession, as Mr Mugabe's powers finally falter. The people who fought in the 1970s guerrilla war against white minority rule still dominate Zimbabwe's government, and especially its security forces, and they are worried about losing that power, and the wealth it generates. Last week, the army chief Gen Chiwenga warned the military could intervene to halt purges of the governing Zanu-PF that were ""clearly targeting members of the party with a liberation background"". This video can not be played Who is Grace Mugabe? This was obviously a reference to the sacking last week of Mr Mnangagwa, Mr Mugabe's once loyal deputy and a former defence minister, spy chief and veteran of the war of independence. Mrs Mugabe's supporters are known as ""Generation 40"" or ""G40"" - a name which signals a changing of the guard in Zimbabwe, at least partially, 37 years after independence. So this military action is the old guard reasserting its authority. Mr Mugabe was the political leader of the guerrilla war so the army has always professed loyalty to him, until he explicitly came out in favour of his wife taking over from him. The rise of Grace Mugabe Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Most observers think so. The army's denial it was carrying out a coup has been mocked on social media. The BBC's southern Africa correspondent Andrew Harding called the move an ""extraordinary gamble"". He sees it as an internal power struggle within Zanu-PF ""and whoever emerges victorious can expect a newly purged party to fall obediently into line"". He says it is important to remember that Mr Mugabe is not being challenged by Western governments, or by Zimbabwe's political opposition, or by a mass uprising against economic hardship. How can you tell a coup is happening? There appears to have been no dramatic effect on normal life. People say shops have opened as normal. The military thanked the public ""for remaining patient and peaceful as they carry out the operation"". Some Zimbabweans told the BBC that they welcomed the news, with one man expressing his thanks to the army for ""taking out the tyrant"". This video can not be played Zimbabweans react to the news that troops had taken control One resident of Harare though told the Press Association: ""I don't think I see how anything could possibly be different. If we wanted to see any change we would have to assassinate about 5,000 people all feeding from the same trough."" The head of the key regional bloc the African Union, Guinea's president Alpha Conde, said that the crisis ""seems like coup"". He said the AU demanded that ""constitutional order be restored immediately"". In his statement, South Africa's President Zuma said that he was sending a delegation to Zimbabwe to meet President Mugabe and the Zimbabwean Defence Force. Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari has urged ""respect for the constitution"", and said every attempt should be made to save the country from ""political instability"". The leaders of Botswana and the Ivory Coast called on Mr Mugabe to leave his post, both focusing on his age and the amount of time he had been president. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called for a ""quick return to civilian rule"" and the UK - Zimbabwe's former colonial ruler - said it hoped elections scheduled for 2018 would take place as planned.

"Tony Blair pulled out of talks to fund Robert Mugabe's controversial land reforms in 1997 Britain's relationship with Zimbabwe has always been complex. A former imperial power can feel torn between a responsibility towards its ex-colony and a reluctance to interfere in what is now an independent state. And a freshly minted nation can feel resentment towards its former ruler while also hoping to maintain longstanding trade and cultural links. Thus it has been for London and Harare. Take, for example, President Mugabe. For years, he has railed against Britain and its political leaders as they opposed his disastrous land reforms, his persecution of white farmers and his calamitous management of Zimbabwe's economy. But Mr Mugabe is also an Anglophile who loves cricket, the Royal Family and Savile Row suits. He developed a surprising friendship with Lord Soames, the last British governor of what was then Rhodesia, whose son, Nicholas, the Conservative MP, he saw only a few weeks ago. And when Mr Mugabe's cabinet colleagues were celebrating the fall of Margaret Thatcher in 1990, he rebuked them, reportedly saying: ""Who organised our independence? Let me tell you - if it hadn't been for Mrs Thatcher none of you would be here today. I'm sorry she's gone."" Zimbabwe began life as a colony of the British South African Company in the late 19th Century, run by the British empire-builder, Cecil Rhodes. The moment Zimbabwean MPs hear Mugabe has resigned - BBC News In the 1920s, Southern Rhodesia, as it was then known, was annexed by the United Kingdom but with an element of self-government. The white minority ruled for decades, but were increasingly challenged by nationalist campaigners. Eventually, in 1965, the government led by Ian Smith unilaterally declared independence from Britain. UDI, as it was known, prompted international outrage and sanctions. Years of guerrilla warfare in the bush led to pressure for a negotiated settlement in Rhodesia, and, in 1979, Britain hosted all-party talks at Lancaster House in London. And from this process emerged a peace agreement, a new constitution and a former guerrilla fighter and leader called Robert Mugabe - the first prime minister of a newly independent Zimbabwe. Robert Mugabe has said he trusted Margaret Thatcher - in contrast to Tony Blair Even then, Britain's relations with Mr Mugabe were ambiguous. Politicians and diplomats at the time placed a huge amount of faith in him as exactly the kind of strong, pro-western leader that Zimbabwe would need to embed its new-found independence and democracy. But he nevertheless was still able to wind them up. Robert Mugabe: Hero or villain? Lord Carrington, Britain's foreign secretary who chaired the Lancaster House talks, described him as ""devious and clever, he was the archetypal cold fish"". On a dull moment in the talks, Lord Carrington rejoiced with glee when he discovered that Mugabe reads backwards as ""E ba gum"". Lord Hurd, another British foreign secretary, told The Africa Report that: ""Mugabe was one of those people the British Empire created who specialised in knowing how to twist the British government's tail. He was well-trained in the art of annoying the British if he needed to. He knew our ways."" At first, Britain was hopeful about Zimbabwe's prospects. And normal relations were maintained. The Princess of Wales visited Mr Mugabe in Harare in 1993. The England cricket team, led by Michael Atherton, played Zimbabwe in Harare in 1996. But over the decades of Mr Mugabe's rule, as the country slipped into greater autocracy and economic decline, relations deteriorated. Campaigner Peter Tatchell protested regularly in London against Robert Mugabe In 1997, Tony Blair's government pulled out of talks to fund Mr Mugabe's controversial land reforms. The Zimbabwean president accused the British of meddling in his country's affairs by funding his political opponents. Britain began to withdraw development aid and sanctions were imposed on the president and his inner circle. Campaigners such as Peter Tatchell would protest regularly against Mr Mugabe's homophobia outside the hotel in St James' where the president stayed on his frequent visits to London. Yet through all this, Mr Mugabe still hoped Britain might help revive his country's ailing economy. As he told a crowd a few years ago when he was celebrating his 90th birthday: ""The British, we don't hate you, we only love our country better.""

"This video can not be played Mugabe: From war hero to resignation Robert Mugabe, the man who became synonymous with Zimbabwe, has resigned as president after 37 years in power. For some, he will always remain a hero who brought independence and an end to white-minority rule. Even those who forced him out blamed his wife and ""criminals"" around him. But to his growing number of critics, this highly educated, wily politician became the caricature of an African dictator, who destroyed an entire country in order to keep his job. In the end, it was the security forces, who had been instrumental in intimidating the opposition and keeping him in power, who made him go. They were incensed when he sacked his long-time ally, Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, paving the way for his much younger wife Grace to succeed him, fearing it meant the end for them as the powers behind the throne. He had survived numerous previous crises and predictions of his demise but with his powers failing at the age of 93, his former comrades-in-arms turned on him, favouring Mr Mnangagwa. Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Before the 2008 elections, Mr Mugabe said: ""If you lose an election and are rejected by the people, it is time to leave politics."" But after coming second to Morgan Tsvangirai, Mr Mugabe displayed more characteristic defiance, swearing that ""only God"" could remove him from office. And just to be sure, violence was unleashed to preserve his grip on power. In order to save the lives of his supporters, Mr Tsvangirai pulled out of the second round and although Mr Mugabe was forced to share power with his long-time rival for four years, he remained president. He even won another election, in 2013, as Mr Tsvangirai had lost a lot of credibility during his years working with Mr Mugabe. The key to understanding Mr Mugabe is the 1970s guerrilla war where he made his name. President Mugabe (L) has given his support to his wife Grace (R) for the vice-presidency 1924:Born Later trained as a teacher 1964:Imprisoned by Rhodesian government 1980:Wins post-independence elections 1996:Marries Grace Marufu 2000:Loses referendum, pro-Mugabe militias invade white-owned farms and attack opposition supporters 2008:Comes second in first round of elections to Tsvangirai who pulls out of run-off amid nationwide attacks on his supporters 2009:Amid economic collapse, swears in Tsvangirai as prime minister, who served in uneasy government of national unity for four years 2017:Sacks long-time ally Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, paving the way for his wife Grace to succeed him. Army intervenes and forces him to step down Grace Mugabe profile: Who is Zimbabwe's first lady? Zimbabwe under Mugabe - in 10 numbers Even after 37 years in power, Mr  Mugabe still maintained the same worldview - the patriotic socialist forces of his Zanu-PF party were still fighting the twin evils of capitalism and colonialism. Any critics were dismissed as ""traitors and sell-outs"" - a throwback to the guerrilla war, when such labels could be a death sentence. Robert Mugabe (L), seen here in 1960, was greatly influenced by pan-Africanist ideals He always blamed Zimbabwe's economic problems on a plot by Western countries, led by the UK, to oust him because of his seizure of white-owned farms. His critics firmly blamed him, saying he had no understanding of how a modern economy worked. He always concentrated on the question of how to share out the national cake, rather than how to make it grow. Protesters in 2016 burn worthless currency in a show of defiance against the introduction of new bond notes Mr Mugabe once famously said that a country could never go bankrupt - with the world's fastest-shrinking economy and annual inflation of 231 million per cent in July 2008, it seemed as though he was determined to test his theory to the limit. Professor Tony Hawkins of the University of Zimbabwe once observed that with Zimbabwe's former leader: ""Whenever economics gets in the way of politics, politics wins every time."" In 2000, faced with a strong opposition for the first time, he wrecked what was one of Africa's most diversified economies in a bid to retain political control. He seized the white-owned farms which were the economy's backbone and scared off donors but in purely political terms, Mr Mugabe outsmarted his enemies - he remained in power for another 17 years. And the tactics he and his supporters used were straight from the guerrilla war. After he suffered the first electoral defeat of his career, in a 2000 referendum, Mr Mugabe unleashed his personal militia - the self-styled war veterans, backed by the security forces - who used violence and murder as an electoral strategy. Mr Mugabe says he is fighting for the rights of black Zimbabweans Eight years later, a similar pattern was followed after Mr Mugabe lost the first round of a presidential election to his long-time rival Morgan Tsvangirai. When needed, all the levers of state - the security forces, civil service, state-owned media - which are mostly controlled by Zanu-PF, were used in the service of the ruling party. The man who fought for one-man, one-vote introduced a requirement that potential voters prove their residence with utility bills, which the young, unemployed opposition core electorate were unlikely to have. In fact, the signs of his attitude to opposition were there from the early 1980s, when members of the North-Korea trained Fifth Brigade of the army were sent to Matabeleland, home to his then rival, Joshua Nkomo. Thousands of civilians were killed before Mr Nkomo agreed to share power with Mr Mugabe - a precursor of what happened with Mr Tsvangirai. One of the undoubted achievements of the former teacher's 33 years in power was the expansion of education. Zimbabwe still has one of the highest literacy rates in Africa, at 89% of the population. The now deceased political scientist Masipula Sithole once said that by expanding education, the president was ""digging his own grave"". Mr Mugabe has not been afraid to use violence to stay in power The young beneficiaries were able to analyse Zimbabwe's problems for themselves and most blamed government corruption and mismanagement for the lack of jobs and rising prices. He often claimed to be fighting on behalf of the rural poor but much of the land he confiscated ended up in the hands of his cronies. Archbishop Desmond Tutu once said that Zimbabwe's long-time president had become a cartoon figure of the archetypal African dictator. During the 2002 presidential campaign, he started wearing brightly coloured shirts emblazoned with his face - a style copied from many of Africa's authoritarian rulers. For the preceding 20 years, this conservative man was only seen in public with either a stiff suit and tie or safari suit. Robert Mugabe celebrated his 93rd birthday earlier this year He professes to be a staunch Catholic, and worshippers at Harare's Catholic Cathedral were occasionally swamped by security guards when he turned up for Sunday Mass. However, Mr Mugabe's beliefs did not prevent him from having two children by Grace, then his secretary, while his popular Ghanaian first wife, Sally, was dying from cancer. But it was his second wife Grace, 40 years his junior, who ultimately proved his downfall. Although Mr Mugabe outlived many predictions of his demise, the increasing strain of recent years took its toll and his once-impeccable presentation has begun to look rather worn at times. In 2011, a US diplomatic cable released byWikileaks suggested that he was suffering from prostate cancer,external. Wife Grace said Mr Mugabe woke at 05:00 for his exercise But he certainly led a healthy lifestyle. Grace once said that he woke up at 05:00 for his daily exercises, including yoga. He did not drink alcohol or coffee and was largely vegetarian. Mr Mugabe was 73 when she gave birth to their third child, Chatunga. If nothing else, Mr Mugabe has always been an extremely proud man. He often said he would only step down when his ""revolution"" was complete. He was referring to the redistribution of white-owned land but he also wanted to hand-pick his successor, who would of course have had to come from the ranks of Zanu-PF. Didymus Mutasa, once one of Mr Mugabe's closest associates but who has since fallen out with him, once told the BBC that in Zimbabwean culture, kings were only replaced when they die ""and Mugabe is our king"". But even his closest allies were not ready for Zimbabwe to be turned into a monarchy, with power retained by a single family.

"Universities have been told to be more careful about advertising claims The advertising watchdog has told six UK universities to take down marketing claims that could be misleading. Leicester, East Anglia, Strathclyde, Falmouth, Teesside and the University of West London have all had complaints upheld against them. The Advertising Standards Authority is warning against exaggerated claims made to attract students. Chief executive Guy Parker says students need ""good evidence"" when making such a big financial commitment. ""Misleading would-be students is not only unfair, it can also lead them to make choices that aren't right for them,"" said Mr Parker. Universities face false adverts warning Institutions challenged on top 1% advert For the first time universities are going to be issued with guidance on avoiding misleading information. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said that intensifying competition between universities now has a ""touch of the Wild West about it"". ""Universities should be careful about their claims, which need to be robust, truthful and useful. ""But it is a good thing that they are telling potential applicants more than they used to in the past."" There are dozens of different university rankings Hundreds of thousands of young people are currently deciding their options for applications for courses next autumn. The Advertising Standards Authority says universities trying to recruit students have to be able to objectively prove the claims they are making about their high status. The watchdog wants to stop unjustified claims and offer a clearer explanation of achievement in rankings and league tables. Complaints were upheld against six universities: Falmouth University has been told to stop describing itself as ""the UK's number one arts university"" or ""the UK's number one creative university"". Teesside University had a complaint upheld for saying it was the ""Top university in England for long-term graduate prospects"". University of East Anglia has been told not to use the claim ""Top 5 for student satisfaction"". University of Leicester must stop claiming to be ""a top 1% world university"". University of Strathclyde has been told to change the claim ""We're ranked No. 1 in the UK"" for physics. University of West London must stop claiming to be ""London's top modern university - and one of the top 10 in the UK"". Many of the challenges from the watchdog have been about how information from rankings or comparison tables have been presented. ""If you're making claims about your national or global ranking, student satisfaction or graduate prospects, make sure you practise what you teach... by backing up your claims with good evidence,"" said the head of the watchdog, Mr Parker. The universities involved have argued that they have put forward accurate information - but there could be greater clarification. ""We don't set out to mislead or confuse prospective students,"" said a statement from the University of Leicester. The university says its claim to be in the top 1% in the world is based on figures from several international rankings. Universities are having to compete to recruit students ""While we disagree with the Advertising Standards Authority on their assessment methodology, we will abide by their ruling,"" said the University of Leicester. Teesside also defended its claims over graduate prospects. ""We strongly believe that the marketing message was accurate, but we respect the decision of the Advertising Standards Authority ,"" said a spokesman for Teesside University. The University of West London says it has fully complied with the ruling: ""The advertising that was the subject of investigation has been removed and will not appear in our future marketing materials."" Charles Heymann, a higher education communications adviser, had been head of communications at the University of Reading when it was told to stop using the claim to be in the top 1% of world universities. ""It's a wake-up call to the whole sector. I suspect it pretty much kills off ""top 1%"" as a strapline and sends a clear message that universities need to be whiter than white in their advertising."" Mr Heymann said that rankings could ""exaggerate very marginal differences between individual universities. ""It's tempting for marketing teams to push the boundaries as far as they can go in emphasising them. At some point, most universities will be in the top 10 or 25 for something."" A spokesman for Universities UK said: ""With a proliferation of university rankings, data and awards now in existence, there is a need for clearer guidelines for universities in how they use this in a way which is clearly understood by students.""

"The National Cyber Security Centre said the UK's energy sector had been targeted One of the UK's cyber-defence chiefs has accused Russia of having attacked Britain's media, telecommunications and energy sectors over the past year. Ciaran Martin, chief executive of GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), added that Russia was ""seeking to undermine the international system"". His comments were made at an event organised by the Times newspaper. Ahead of the speech, the paper reported that one of the attacks hadtargeted the UK's power supply,externalon election day. The Russian Embassy in London said it was concerned the assertions were misleading. The NCSC was established about a year ago. Last month, it revealed that it had already classed a total of 590 attacks - from a variety of perpetrators - as being ""significant"", and that more than 30 incidents had been judged serious enough to require a cross-government response. Mr Martin's accusations follow Prime Minister Theresa May's own claim that Russia had ""mounted a sustained campaign of cyber-espionage and disruption"". The NCSC chief referenced this in his own speech. ""The prime minister made the point on Monday night - international order as we know it is in danger of being eroded,"" he said. ""This is clearly a cause for concern and the NCSC is actively engaging with international partners, industry and civil society to tackle this threat."" However, Russia has suggested the accusations are ""non-transparent and biased"". ""We would be interested in finding out the details and seeing the original findings on which the statements are based,"" the country's London embassy said. ""It would be most unfortunate to see [Britain] informed by wrong intelligence."" The London-based National Cyber Security Centre was launched in October 2016 To coincide with its event, the Times also published details of a new study into how Russia used Twitter to influence 2016's Brexit referendum. The research indicates that more than 156,000 Russia-based accounts - many of them automated bots - mentioned #Brexit in original posts or retweets in the days surrounding the vote. Many were in favour of the UK leaving the European Union, but a minority were pro-Remain. The academics involved believed the posts were seen hundreds of millions of times. One of the researchers told the BBC that social media was providing Russia with a relatively cheap way to spread its propaganda. ""Ukraine experienced [a similar] information war in 2014 - and if it worked in Ukraine it can also work in Western democracies,"" said Prof Sasha Talavera from Swansea University. ""One can use it to split society and marginalise groups. Social media nowadays is a powerful tool."" He added that some form of regulation of the large social media firms might now be required. The Guardian reports details of a separate University of Edinburgh studythat also presents evidence of Russia using Twitter,externalto sway opinion in the lead-up to the Brexit vote. The Kremlin has previously denied trying to meddle in the referendum. But the chairman of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, Damian Collins, said he now wanted Twitter to share examples of tweets linked to a Russian ""troll factory"", known as the Internet Research Agency, about British politics.

"President Mugabe's ties to the military date from the liberation struggle Zimbabwe's military says its actions do not amount to a takeover. It still refers to Robert Mugabe as the commander-in-chief of the country's defence forces. But practically speaking, Mr Mugabe is not in charge if his forces can step in to usurp his authority. This is not a coup d'Ã©tat in name, but it appears to be in action. The military takeover of the national broadcaster, the presence of troops on the streets and major access points, and even forced entry into the presidential palace are traits of a military takeover - at least as we have seen them in Africa. One thing that is lacking is that the constitution has not been suspended. The cementing of democracy across Africa has led to a general regional and continent-wide aversion to violent takeovers of government. Even in the past, coup-stagers often promised a quick handover to civilian government through elections or a negotiated transition. The military says it has not taken control of the country So far in Zimbabwe, the military is not showing any intention of assuming a governing role. However, it has someone it would prefer to do that. Emmerson Mnangagwa, the recently sacked vice-president, is held in high regard in Zimbabwean military circles. The polarising Grace Mugabe Mnangagwa - the 'crocodile' who snapped back How can you tell a coup is happening? He was involved in the struggle for independence, and in 1980 created the Zimbabwe National Army by fusing the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (Zipra) and Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (Zanla) with the remnants of the former Rhodesian security forces. He was seen as the natural successor for the top office. President Mugabe sacked Mr Mnangagwa last week at the prompting of the First Lady Grace Mugabe, who has political aspirations and has publicly opposed the former vice president, but does not have support within a military where the liberation legacy is held in high esteem. Grace Mugabe is a divisive figure in Zimbabwe The top military officials were part of the liberation struggle, like their comrade and president Mr Mugabe, so they have supported his government over the years because he has served their interests. They did not act this way in 2014, when Mr Mugabe sacked his previous Vice President Joice Mujuru, a former independence fighter, in a similar power struggle. This time though, there is a sense the president might have gone too far. Gen Chiwenga said that the military would not allow the purging of leaders with a liberation background from the governing party Earlier this week, the commander of Zimbabwe's Defence Forces, General Constantino Chiwenga, warned the Zanu-PF governing party to stop the purge against independence war veterans. Following his dismissal and escape to South Africa, Mr Mnangagwa promised to return to regain control of the ruling party from the Mugabes. This suggested his confidence in the support he had from the military. Emmerson Mnangagwa is highly respected in army circles So the next step would be to negotiate his return ahead of the party congress in December, where he could be affirmed as the president's successor. At worst, the military will force Mr Mugabe to resign - but they will not want to humiliate him further because of the history they share. They will also extend the courtesy to Grace Mugabe, in spite of her recent actions. Prior suggestions that the armed forces were divided have not been revealed so far this week. The rise of an opposing faction would probably be bloody, and not something Zimbabweans would like to see, regardless of how tough life has been in recent years. The end of the Mugabe era would be a relief to many, but Mr Mnangagwa is not necessarily popular in all parts of the country. Under his tenure as security minister in the early 1980s, government forces crushed a rebellion in the Midlands and Matebeleland province, and allegedly killed thousands of civilians. There is still bitter resentment among people from the affected regions. Robert Mugabe 'under house arrest' Zimbabwe latest: Key players How can you tell a coup is happening?

"The army is upset about recent purges in the ruling party The military in Zimbabwe has taken control of the country, putting veteran President Robert Mugabe under house arrest and announcing it was targeting ""criminals"" around him. It has denied it is staging a coup, while Mr Mugabe, 93, has been pictured smiling beside army chiefs and left the house for a scheduled appearance on Friday. However on Sunday,Mr Mugabe was removed as the leader of Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF partyand ex-vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa, who had been fired by Mr Mugabe two weeks before, was appointed in his place. Military officials had feared Mr Mugabe was planning to install his wife, Grace, as his successor. So what does this mean for Mr Mugabe and the country he has led since independence in 1980? Here is what we know. Do you have a question about the situation in Zimbabwe?haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Military vehicles were spotted on roads leading to Harare on Tuesday, sparking rumours that something was afoot. Later, soldiers seized the headquarters of Zimbabwe's national broadcaster ZBC and explosions and gunfire were heard. Maj-Gen Sibusiso Moyo then read out a statement on national television, assuring the nation that President Mugabe and his family were safe. This video can not be played Maj Gen Sibusiso Moyo read out a statement on national TV early on Wednesday The military was only targeting what he called ""criminals"" around the president, he said, denying that there had been a coup. ""As soon as we have accomplished our mission we expect that the situation will return to normalcy,"" he added. President Mugabe was being held at his home and was ""fine"", according to a statement by South Africa's President Jacob Zuma, who spoke to him on Wednesday. On Thursday,he was pictured taking part in talks with Gen Constantino Chiwengaand South African government ministers at State House. The South African envoy has been trying to help the two sides reach a deal on Mr Mugabe's future, but sources suggest he may be resisting pressure to resign. On Friday, the president gave out degrees at a university of which he is chancellor, thereby meeting a prior commitment. The military said on Friday that they had detained some ""criminals"", but they did not give names. On Saturday, tens of thousands of Zimbabweans took to the streets of Harare to urge Mr Mugabe to go. It was led by veterans of the country's war of independence, who last year turned against him. ""There's no going back about Mugabe,"" said veterans leader Christopher Mutsvangwa. ""He must leave."" On Sunday, Zanu-PF sacked Mr Mugabe as its leader. Meanwhile main opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who has been receiving cancer treatment in South Africa, returned to Zimbabwe amid suggestions that his Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) could form part of a possible transitional government. There has not been any official government response to events. Nor have we heard directly from President Mugabe or his wife Grace which, according to analysts, suggests they have lost control. When Mr Mugabe spoke at the university on Friday, he did not make any political comment. And there are no reports of any members of the security forces who remain loyal to Mr Mugabe intervening to defend him. Zimbabwe takeover: Five things you should know SA delegation tries to find resolution This is all about the leadership succession, as Mr Mugabe's powers finally falter. The people who fought in the 1970s guerrilla war against white minority rule still dominate Zimbabwe's government, and especially its security forces, and they are worried about losing that power, and the wealth it generates. Last week, the army chief Gen Chiwenga warned the military could intervene to halt purges of the governing Zanu-PF that were ""clearly targeting members of the party with a liberation background"". This video can not be played Who is Grace Mugabe? This was obviously a reference to the sacking last week of Mr Mnangagwa, Mr Mugabe's once loyal deputy and a former defence minister, spy chief and veteran of the war of independence. Mrs Mugabe's supporters are known as ""Generation 40"" or ""G40"" - a name which signals a changing of the guard in Zimbabwe, at least partially, 37 years after independence. So this military action is the old guard reasserting its authority. Mr Mugabe was the political leader of the guerrilla war so the army has always professed loyalty to him, until he explicitly came out in favour of his wife taking over from him. The rise of Grace Mugabe Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Most observers think so. The army's denial it was carrying out a coup has been mocked on social media. The BBC's southern Africa correspondent Andrew Harding called the move an ""extraordinary gamble"". He sees it as an internal power struggle within Zanu-PF ""and whoever emerges victorious can expect a newly purged party to fall obediently into line"". He says it is important to remember that Mr Mugabe is not being challenged by Western governments, or by Zimbabwe's political opposition, or by a mass uprising against economic hardship. How can you tell a coup is happening? There appears to have been no dramatic effect on normal life. People say shops have opened as normal. The military thanked the public ""for remaining patient and peaceful as they carry out the operation"". Some Zimbabweans told the BBC that they welcomed the news, with one man expressing his thanks to the army for ""taking out the tyrant"". This video can not be played Zimbabweans react to the news that troops had taken control One resident of Harare though told the Press Association: ""I don't think I see how anything could possibly be different. If we wanted to see any change we would have to assassinate about 5,000 people all feeding from the same trough."" The head of the key regional bloc the African Union, Guinea's president Alpha Conde, said that the crisis ""seems like coup"". He said the AU demanded that ""constitutional order be restored immediately"". In his statement, South Africa's President Zuma said that he was sending a delegation to Zimbabwe to meet President Mugabe and the Zimbabwean Defence Force. Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari has urged ""respect for the constitution"", and said every attempt should be made to save the country from ""political instability"". The leaders of Botswana and the Ivory Coast called on Mr Mugabe to leave his post, both focusing on his age and the amount of time he had been president. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called for a ""quick return to civilian rule"" and the UK - Zimbabwe's former colonial ruler - said it hoped elections scheduled for 2018 would take place as planned.

"Wiggins has won five Olympic gold medals on the road and track There will be no charges over a 'mystery' medical package delivered for Sir Bradley Wiggins at the Criterium du Dauphine in 2011, says UK Anti-Doping. The ruling follows an investigation into allegations of wrongdoing at British Cycling and Team Sky. It was alleged the package contained a banned substance but the doctor involved, Dr Richard Freeman, said it was a legal decongestant - fluimucil. Ukad said it had been ""unable"" to prove the package contained Fluimucil. However, the organisation has shared information from its investigations with the General Medical Council (GMC). Five-time Olympic champion Wiggins won the Criterium du Dauphine stage race in France that year and went on to become the first Briton to win the Tour de France in 2012. The 14-month investigation has been closed and a Ukad statement said it would only ""revisit matters if new and material information were to come to light"". My life was a living hell - Wiggins Q&A: cycling inquiry & 'mystery' package Wiggins 'mystery package' doctor quits A statement on the organisation's website added: ""Put simply, due to the lack of contemporaneous evidence, Ukad has been unable to definitively confirm the contents of the package. ""The significant likelihood is that it is now impossible to do so."" Ukad chief executive Nicole Sapstead said the investigation was hindered by the ""lack of accurate medical records"" held by British Cycling. ""This is a serious concern,"" she said. ""As part of their conditions to receive public funding, all sports governing bodies must comply with the UK National Anti-Doping Policy. ""In this case the matter was further complicated by the cross over between personnel at British Cycling and Team Sky."" This video can not be played September 2016: Drugs were for medical condition' Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford was questioned by a Culture, Media and Sport Committee last December and said he had been told by then-team doctor Freeman that ""it was Fluimucil for a nebuliser"". Freeman, who was simultaneously employed by British Cycling and Team Sky between 2009 and 2015, missed the hearing through ill health but the DCMS committee was told that in 2014 he had a laptop containing medical records stolen. As part of the investigation, Ukad interviewed 37 individuals, including current and former British Cycling and Team Sky riders, medical professionals and other staff. From that, Ukad have established that: At some point during the race, a request was made by Dr Freeman for a package to be delivered to him. Coach Shane Sutton arranged for British Cycling employee Simon Cope to pick up that package and to bring it over to France. Cope said it was left for him on a desk at the British Cycling offices sealed in a Jiffy bag. There was a post-it note on the package that said ""To Simon, for Dr Richard Freeman"". Cope travelled to Manchester to pick up that package, took a flight to Geneva, hired a car and took it to the end stage of the race on 12 June and passed the sealed Jiffy bag over to Dr Freeman. When Ukad started its investigation into the 'mystery' package, Wiggins and Brailsford were already under scrutiny over the cyclist's use of a banned steroid before races was leaked by hackers Fancy Bears. Wiggins had sought therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) to use banned anti-inflammatory drug triamcinoclone for allergies and respiratory issues before the 2011 Tour de France, his 2012 Tour win and the 2013 Giro d'Italia. Wiggins, British Cycling and Team Sky have always denied any wrongdoing. The chairman of the DCMS committee - MP Damian Collins - said after December's hearing that the ""credibility of Team Sky and British Cycling is in tatters"". Brailsford has previously admitted he handled the situation ""badly"" but has consistently defended Team Sky's stance against performance-enhancing drugs, stating that the British-based team can be""trusted ""100%"". Freeman was off work from British Cycling with a stress-related illness beforeresigning earlier this year. BBC sports editor Dan Roan With no clarity over what was in the now-infamous jiffy bag delivered to Team Sky in 2011, this represents a wholly unsatisfactory end to a saga that has tainted some of the biggest reputations in British sport, and exposed Ukad's lack of power. But, while this case may not have resulted in any anti-doping charges, the lack of medical records, the inaccuracies in Team Sky's initial explanations for the mystery delivery, the unavailability of key witness Dr Richard Freeman to Ukad investigators, and the theft of his laptop, all means that suspicion will linger. And at best, the attention to detail that was once the mantra of Team Sky and British Cycling has been exposed as hollow. This video can not be played Watch: Brailsford's tense grilling on Team Sky Team Sky:""We have always maintained that there was no wrongdoing and we have co-operated fully with UK Anti-Doping over the last year. ""Since our inception as a new pro cycling team in 2010 we have continually strengthened our systems and processes so they best support our strong commitment to anti-doping."" British Cycling chief executive Julie Harrington:""Ukad's findings represent an organisation and culture that, despite delivering on the world stage, did not meet the high standards that British Cycling today holds itself to. ""We accept that the relationship between British Cycling and Team Sky developed rapidly and as a result, at times, resulted in the blurring of the boundaries between the two. This led to some failings in the way that processes and people were managed. ""Today, based on our learning together, there are clear boundaries and distinctions between our two organisations: no one is simultaneously employed by British Cycling and Team Sky; and we each have our own practices in place for managing athlete records. ""We are intent on ensuring that the integrity of our record keeping is never called into question again."" GMC spokesperson:""Ukad have made us aware of these concerns and we are looking into these. However, we are not able to comment further on this matter."" DCMS select committee chair Damian Collins MP:""The evidence that the committee has received during its inquiry points to serious and worrying structural problems within sport, both in terms of anti-doping and governance. ""The committee will be publishing its report on doping in sport shortly. This will be followed by a second report focusing on sports governance in the New Year.""

"This video can not be played Who is Grace Mugabe? Zimbabwe's former first lady Grace Mugabe, a polarising figure, had for years been positioning herself as a potential successor to her 93-year-old husband Robert as president. Once a quiet figure known for her shopping and her charity work, she became more high-profile in the ruling Zanu-PF party as the head of its women's league. She was instrumental in the ousting of several alternative potential successors to her husband's presidency. However, she did not get the better of her main rival, former Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa. The former president accused him of disloyalty and sacked in early November 2017, but the subsequent chain of events undermined both the former president and former first lady. Members of the military seized state TV and put Mr Mugabe under house arrest. Mr Mnangagwa was appointed leader of Zanu-PF on 19 November. At 52, Mrs Mugabe is four decades younger than her 93-year-old husband, once the world's oldest ruler, who governed Zimbabwe from the end of white-minority rule in 1980 till his resignation was announced in November 2017. Mrs Mugabe has always been a staunch supporter of her husband- earlier this year she memorably said that he could even win votes as a corpse. She has not denied wanting to take the helm of the country, and at a 2014 rally she said: ""They say I want to be president. Why not? Am I not a Zimbabwean?"" Began affair with Robert Mugabe, 41 years her senior, while working as a typist in state house Mr Mugabe was still married to his first wife, Sally, who was terminally ill at the time Married Mr Mugabe, her second husband, in 1996 in an extravagant ceremony They have three children - Bona, Robert and Chatunga Nicknamed ""Gucci Grace"" by her critics who accuse her of lavish spending Named head of Zanu-PF women's league in 2014, had been tipped to be named vice-president in December Accused of assaulting a model in South Africa in 2017 Robert Mugabe - hero, or villain? Political opponents had warned against a dynasty taking shape, andMrs Mugabe was criticised for seeking to use her diplomatic immunity when accused of assaulting a 20-year-old South African modelwith an electrical plug. This was not the first time she had been accused of physical assault. Along with her husband, Mrs Mugabe is subject to EU and US sanctions, including travel bans, imposed over the seizure of land and accusations of rigged elections and crackdowns on political opposition. Former President Mugabe began wooing Grace Marufu while she was working as a young typist in the country's state house. The two began an affair while he was married to his terminally ill first wife, Sally. ""He came to me and started asking about my family,"" she said in a rare interview about their first encounter in the late 1980s. ""I looked at him as a father figure. I did not think he would at all look at me and say: 'I like that girl.' I least expected that."" Mr Mugabe has said Sally did give her consent to the union before she died in 1992 - though he did not marry Grace until four years later. The couple have three children: Bona, Robert and Chatunga. Occasionally referred to as ""Gucci Grace"", Mrs Mugabe has been criticised by some for an alleged appetite for extravagant shopping. The former first family has vast properties, businesses and farms dotted around the country, mainly in the rich western and northern Mashonaland provinces. Over the years, Mrs Mugabe has attempted to grow herself into a powerful businesswoman and sees herself as a philanthropist, founding an orphanage on a farm just outside the capital, Harare, with the help of Chinese funding. She controversially earned a PhD in sociology from the University of Zimbabwe in just two months in 2014, although her thesis, unlike those of other students, was never filed and has never been made available. Nevertheless, her doctorate title was used on campaign material as she prepared to take over the leadership of the Zanu-PF women's wing. Since becoming more active in politics, she has become known for her sharp tongue and tough reputation. Pulling no punches while attacking political opponents, Mrs Mugabe often fiercely defends her husband. She has been accused of washing the ruling party's dirty linen in public by calling on people to resign or apologise. Mrs Mugabe spearheaded the ousting of a former ally, then-Vice-President Joice Mujuru, in 2014. She said the vice-president should be sacked from government because she was ""corrupt, an extortionist, incompetent, a gossiper, a liar and ungrateful"", and accused her of collaborating with opposition forces and white people to undermine the country's post-independence gains. Joice Mujuru was once a staunch ally of Mr Mugabe A few months later, Mrs Mujuru was expelled from Zanu-PF. She remains a leader of the opposition National People's Party (NPP) and is spearheading a People's Rainbow Coalition (PRC), where she urged people to register to vote to prevent the perpetual rule of Mr Mugabe and his wife. The new vice-president was Mr Mnangagwa, a former justice minister who Mrs Mugabe had called ""loyal and disciplined"". But by 2017, Mrs Mugabe was publicly calling on her husband to remove Mr Mnangagwa. She suggested that his supporters were planning a coup. When he fell ill at a rally and had to be airlifted out of the country for treatment, his supporters blamed poison administered through ice cream from Mrs Mugabe's dairy farm, a suggestion she denied. He later said he had been poisoned, but it was ""false and malicious"" to suggest it was at the hands of the former first lady.

"President Mugabe's ties to the military date from the liberation struggle Zimbabwe's military says its actions do not amount to a takeover. It still refers to Robert Mugabe as the commander-in-chief of the country's defence forces. But practically speaking, Mr Mugabe is not in charge if his forces can step in to usurp his authority. This is not a coup d'Ã©tat in name, but it appears to be in action. The military takeover of the national broadcaster, the presence of troops on the streets and major access points, and even forced entry into the presidential palace are traits of a military takeover - at least as we have seen them in Africa. One thing that is lacking is that the constitution has not been suspended. The cementing of democracy across Africa has led to a general regional and continent-wide aversion to violent takeovers of government. Even in the past, coup-stagers often promised a quick handover to civilian government through elections or a negotiated transition. The military says it has not taken control of the country So far in Zimbabwe, the military is not showing any intention of assuming a governing role. However, it has someone it would prefer to do that. Emmerson Mnangagwa, the recently sacked vice-president, is held in high regard in Zimbabwean military circles. The polarising Grace Mugabe Mnangagwa - the 'crocodile' who snapped back How can you tell a coup is happening? He was involved in the struggle for independence, and in 1980 created the Zimbabwe National Army by fusing the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (Zipra) and Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (Zanla) with the remnants of the former Rhodesian security forces. He was seen as the natural successor for the top office. President Mugabe sacked Mr Mnangagwa last week at the prompting of the First Lady Grace Mugabe, who has political aspirations and has publicly opposed the former vice president, but does not have support within a military where the liberation legacy is held in high esteem. Grace Mugabe is a divisive figure in Zimbabwe The top military officials were part of the liberation struggle, like their comrade and president Mr Mugabe, so they have supported his government over the years because he has served their interests. They did not act this way in 2014, when Mr Mugabe sacked his previous Vice President Joice Mujuru, a former independence fighter, in a similar power struggle. This time though, there is a sense the president might have gone too far. Gen Chiwenga said that the military would not allow the purging of leaders with a liberation background from the governing party Earlier this week, the commander of Zimbabwe's Defence Forces, General Constantino Chiwenga, warned the Zanu-PF governing party to stop the purge against independence war veterans. Following his dismissal and escape to South Africa, Mr Mnangagwa promised to return to regain control of the ruling party from the Mugabes. This suggested his confidence in the support he had from the military. Emmerson Mnangagwa is highly respected in army circles So the next step would be to negotiate his return ahead of the party congress in December, where he could be affirmed as the president's successor. At worst, the military will force Mr Mugabe to resign - but they will not want to humiliate him further because of the history they share. They will also extend the courtesy to Grace Mugabe, in spite of her recent actions. Prior suggestions that the armed forces were divided have not been revealed so far this week. The rise of an opposing faction would probably be bloody, and not something Zimbabweans would like to see, regardless of how tough life has been in recent years. The end of the Mugabe era would be a relief to many, but Mr Mnangagwa is not necessarily popular in all parts of the country. Under his tenure as security minister in the early 1980s, government forces crushed a rebellion in the Midlands and Matebeleland province, and allegedly killed thousands of civilians. There is still bitter resentment among people from the affected regions. Robert Mugabe 'under house arrest' Zimbabwe latest: Key players How can you tell a coup is happening?

"Zimbabwe's The Herald newspaper ran a special edition later on Wednesday Zimbabwean media have been slow to keep their audiences up to date on developments after the military took control earlier today. State TV and radios were re-broadcasting the statement by Major-General Sibusiso Moyo announcing that the military had taken over but offered little by way of updates to the situation. For most of the morning the TV played patriotic songs from the independence period of the 1980s before resuming normal programming. The lunchtime news featured the army takeover as the main story. What we know so far The rise of Grace Mugabe Zimbabwe country profile The print edition of the government-owned daily The Herald appeared on the streets on Wednesday morning with Tuesday's stories which downplayed the importance of the warning by the head of the armed forces Constantino Chiwenga that the military would take over if necessary. The paper's online edition took a few hours to update, and has been carrying coverage of the unfolding events, under the headlineLive and developing: No Military Takeover in Zim,external. Apart from carrying the military statement the paper said: ""The situation in Harare's central business district is calm with people going about their business."" Social media users have been trying to make up for the lack of news by posting their own observations and pictures of street scenes in the capital Harare, including some of troops and police being made to sit in a line outside parliament and people going about their daily lives. Many have dismissed suggestions by the military that their actions don't amount to a coup. Maj Gen Sibusiso Moyo read out a statement on national TV early on Wednesday Using the Twitter hashtag #ZimbabweCoup, many users welcomed the developments. The hashtag had been used more than 13,000 times in the 24 hours up until noon on Wednesday, many of the users appearing to be in the country. One widely shared and liked tweet with a sarcastic overtone read: ""The coup going on in Zimbabwe is the smoothest I've ever seen.. It started like we just wanna talk then went to it's cute you think you [sic] still president."" ""When you see the army commanders take over the state broadcaster airwaves then that's the confirmation it's a COUP. End of an era,"" another tweet read. (bit.ly/2hyoy64) Allow Twitter content?

The crisis came a week after Mr Mugabe sacked his deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, in favour of his wife, Grace. Army chief Gen Constantino Chiwenga warned on Monday that the military would step in and take action if such ""purges"" in the ruling Zanu-PF party did not stop. Who are the key players in this crisis? A revolutionary hero who spent years in jail for the ""liberation"" struggle, he came to power in elections after independence was declared in 1980. This is why, even today, many African leaders remain reluctant to criticise him - unlike a large number of his compatriots who experience his rule first-hand. Most of the world has moved on from the anti-colonial struggles but Mr Mugabe's outlook and tactics for retaining political control remain the same. He is best-known for his land reform programme in the 1990s that involved the seizure of white-owned farms for redistribution to black peasants. This video can not be played Mugabe: From war hero to resignation After decades of authoritarian rule, his country is in political and economic turmoil, and allegations of government corruption are rife. He is viewed globally with derision. The proud 93-year-old is reluctant to relinquish power but as his physical powers have visibly deteriorated, the battle over his succession has come to the fore. The independence-era old guard represented by sacked Vice-President Mnangagwa is rivalling the younger ""Generation-40"" faction fronted by Mrs Mugabe. Robert Mugabe - revolutionary hero, or the man who wrecked Zimbabwe? Robert Mugabe's second wife, who is more than 40 years his junior, has risen from presidential typist to the most powerful woman in Zimbabwe. They met and had their first two of three children while Mr Mugabe's first wife, Sally, was terminally ill with cancer, though they only married after her death. Her alleged appetite for extravagant shopping earned her the moniker Gucci Grace. While her supporters point to her charitable and philanthropic work and refer to her as ""Dr Amai"", meaning ""mother"", her critics accuse her of pursuing a ruthless campaign for wealth and power. This video can not be played Who is Grace Mugabe? As a notable political figure close to the president, Grace has been subject to the same targeted EU and US sanctions as her husband, which include a travel ban and asset freeze. She accompanies the president on trips abroad, often visiting the Far East where they own property. Her many domestic business interests also include a dairy farm estate outside Harare, which she claimed as part of the national land reforms implemented starting in 2001. Mrs Mugabe has a sharp tongue and last week she described her rival, Vice President Mnangagwa, as a ""snake"" which ""must be hit on the head"". The next day President Mugabe sacked him. Who is Zimbabwe's first lady? Until Mrs Mugabe's rise, he had been viewed for several years as President Mugabe's anointed successor. Following military training in Egypt and China, he helped direct the ""liberation"" struggles prior to independence in 1980, spending time in jail where he was allegedly tortured. He has been in government ever since. Thousands of civilians died in a brutal post-independence conflict in which he played a key role as National Security minister, though he denies having blood on his hands. He is known in Zimbabwe asngwena(English: crocodile) (and his supporters as ""Lacoste"") because of his political cunning, biding his time in the 1990s to reclaim a position of power after falling foul of Mr Mugabe and being cast into political oblivion. But his fearsome reputation means he is little loved in the rank-and-file of the Zanu-PF party. As a former defence and national security minister, he was a key link between the ruling party and Zimbabwe's military and intelligence agencies. He is also chair of the Joint Operations Command, in charge of state security. Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back At 61, he is a close ally of Mr Mnangagwa and has led the army since 1994. Gen Chiwenga was also a product of the country's independence struggles, training with the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army in Mozambique and later rising through its ranks. In 2002, he and 18 other close associates of President Mugabe were sanctioned by the European Union, United States and New Zealand, including a travel ban and freeze on his foreign assets, which has been repeatedly extended. In 2003, he was promoted to commander general of the Zimbabwe combined armed forces. He shocked Zimbabweans on Monday when he issued an open warning against those responsible for ""purging"" the ruling party of those who shared his roots in the country's struggles against colonialism, saying the military could step in. A former mine worker and union chief, the 65-year-old became the symbol of resistance to Mr Mugabe's government during the mid-2000s. The charismatic public speaker founded the Movement for Democratic Change in 2000 and stood for president in 2008, gaining the most votes but, according to official results, not enough to win outright. He withdrew from the second round after a campaign of violence by Mr Mugabe's security forces. He was later sworn in as prime minister and in 2013 challenged Mr Mugabe for the presidency again but lost heavily. Mr Tsvangirai has been brutally assaulted, charged with treason and labelled a traitor and has reportedly survived three assassination attempts, including one in 1997 in which he was nearly forced out of the window of his 10th-storey office. He has been receiving treatment for cancer in South Africa but returned to Zimbabwe after the army took control and has called for Mr Mugabe to resign.

"This video can not be played Who is Grace Mugabe? Zimbabwe's former first lady Grace Mugabe, a polarising figure, had for years been positioning herself as a potential successor to her 93-year-old husband Robert as president. Once a quiet figure known for her shopping and her charity work, she became more high-profile in the ruling Zanu-PF party as the head of its women's league. She was instrumental in the ousting of several alternative potential successors to her husband's presidency. However, she did not get the better of her main rival, former Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa. The former president accused him of disloyalty and sacked in early November 2017, but the subsequent chain of events undermined both the former president and former first lady. Members of the military seized state TV and put Mr Mugabe under house arrest. Mr Mnangagwa was appointed leader of Zanu-PF on 19 November. At 52, Mrs Mugabe is four decades younger than her 93-year-old husband, once the world's oldest ruler, who governed Zimbabwe from the end of white-minority rule in 1980 till his resignation was announced in November 2017. Mrs Mugabe has always been a staunch supporter of her husband- earlier this year she memorably said that he could even win votes as a corpse. She has not denied wanting to take the helm of the country, and at a 2014 rally she said: ""They say I want to be president. Why not? Am I not a Zimbabwean?"" Began affair with Robert Mugabe, 41 years her senior, while working as a typist in state house Mr Mugabe was still married to his first wife, Sally, who was terminally ill at the time Married Mr Mugabe, her second husband, in 1996 in an extravagant ceremony They have three children - Bona, Robert and Chatunga Nicknamed ""Gucci Grace"" by her critics who accuse her of lavish spending Named head of Zanu-PF women's league in 2014, had been tipped to be named vice-president in December Accused of assaulting a model in South Africa in 2017 Robert Mugabe - hero, or villain? Political opponents had warned against a dynasty taking shape, andMrs Mugabe was criticised for seeking to use her diplomatic immunity when accused of assaulting a 20-year-old South African modelwith an electrical plug. This was not the first time she had been accused of physical assault. Along with her husband, Mrs Mugabe is subject to EU and US sanctions, including travel bans, imposed over the seizure of land and accusations of rigged elections and crackdowns on political opposition. Former President Mugabe began wooing Grace Marufu while she was working as a young typist in the country's state house. The two began an affair while he was married to his terminally ill first wife, Sally. ""He came to me and started asking about my family,"" she said in a rare interview about their first encounter in the late 1980s. ""I looked at him as a father figure. I did not think he would at all look at me and say: 'I like that girl.' I least expected that."" Mr Mugabe has said Sally did give her consent to the union before she died in 1992 - though he did not marry Grace until four years later. The couple have three children: Bona, Robert and Chatunga. Occasionally referred to as ""Gucci Grace"", Mrs Mugabe has been criticised by some for an alleged appetite for extravagant shopping. The former first family has vast properties, businesses and farms dotted around the country, mainly in the rich western and northern Mashonaland provinces. Over the years, Mrs Mugabe has attempted to grow herself into a powerful businesswoman and sees herself as a philanthropist, founding an orphanage on a farm just outside the capital, Harare, with the help of Chinese funding. She controversially earned a PhD in sociology from the University of Zimbabwe in just two months in 2014, although her thesis, unlike those of other students, was never filed and has never been made available. Nevertheless, her doctorate title was used on campaign material as she prepared to take over the leadership of the Zanu-PF women's wing. Since becoming more active in politics, she has become known for her sharp tongue and tough reputation. Pulling no punches while attacking political opponents, Mrs Mugabe often fiercely defends her husband. She has been accused of washing the ruling party's dirty linen in public by calling on people to resign or apologise. Mrs Mugabe spearheaded the ousting of a former ally, then-Vice-President Joice Mujuru, in 2014. She said the vice-president should be sacked from government because she was ""corrupt, an extortionist, incompetent, a gossiper, a liar and ungrateful"", and accused her of collaborating with opposition forces and white people to undermine the country's post-independence gains. Joice Mujuru was once a staunch ally of Mr Mugabe A few months later, Mrs Mujuru was expelled from Zanu-PF. She remains a leader of the opposition National People's Party (NPP) and is spearheading a People's Rainbow Coalition (PRC), where she urged people to register to vote to prevent the perpetual rule of Mr Mugabe and his wife. The new vice-president was Mr Mnangagwa, a former justice minister who Mrs Mugabe had called ""loyal and disciplined"". But by 2017, Mrs Mugabe was publicly calling on her husband to remove Mr Mnangagwa. She suggested that his supporters were planning a coup. When he fell ill at a rally and had to be airlifted out of the country for treatment, his supporters blamed poison administered through ice cream from Mrs Mugabe's dairy farm, a suggestion she denied. He later said he had been poisoned, but it was ""false and malicious"" to suggest it was at the hands of the former first lady.

"This video can not be played Mugabe: From war hero to resignation Robert Mugabe, the man who became synonymous with Zimbabwe, has resigned as president after 37 years in power. For some, he will always remain a hero who brought independence and an end to white-minority rule. Even those who forced him out blamed his wife and ""criminals"" around him. But to his growing number of critics, this highly educated, wily politician became the caricature of an African dictator, who destroyed an entire country in order to keep his job. In the end, it was the security forces, who had been instrumental in intimidating the opposition and keeping him in power, who made him go. They were incensed when he sacked his long-time ally, Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, paving the way for his much younger wife Grace to succeed him, fearing it meant the end for them as the powers behind the throne. He had survived numerous previous crises and predictions of his demise but with his powers failing at the age of 93, his former comrades-in-arms turned on him, favouring Mr Mnangagwa. Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Before the 2008 elections, Mr Mugabe said: ""If you lose an election and are rejected by the people, it is time to leave politics."" But after coming second to Morgan Tsvangirai, Mr Mugabe displayed more characteristic defiance, swearing that ""only God"" could remove him from office. And just to be sure, violence was unleashed to preserve his grip on power. In order to save the lives of his supporters, Mr Tsvangirai pulled out of the second round and although Mr Mugabe was forced to share power with his long-time rival for four years, he remained president. He even won another election, in 2013, as Mr Tsvangirai had lost a lot of credibility during his years working with Mr Mugabe. The key to understanding Mr Mugabe is the 1970s guerrilla war where he made his name. President Mugabe (L) has given his support to his wife Grace (R) for the vice-presidency 1924:Born Later trained as a teacher 1964:Imprisoned by Rhodesian government 1980:Wins post-independence elections 1996:Marries Grace Marufu 2000:Loses referendum, pro-Mugabe militias invade white-owned farms and attack opposition supporters 2008:Comes second in first round of elections to Tsvangirai who pulls out of run-off amid nationwide attacks on his supporters 2009:Amid economic collapse, swears in Tsvangirai as prime minister, who served in uneasy government of national unity for four years 2017:Sacks long-time ally Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, paving the way for his wife Grace to succeed him. Army intervenes and forces him to step down Grace Mugabe profile: Who is Zimbabwe's first lady? Zimbabwe under Mugabe - in 10 numbers Even after 37 years in power, Mr  Mugabe still maintained the same worldview - the patriotic socialist forces of his Zanu-PF party were still fighting the twin evils of capitalism and colonialism. Any critics were dismissed as ""traitors and sell-outs"" - a throwback to the guerrilla war, when such labels could be a death sentence. Robert Mugabe (L), seen here in 1960, was greatly influenced by pan-Africanist ideals He always blamed Zimbabwe's economic problems on a plot by Western countries, led by the UK, to oust him because of his seizure of white-owned farms. His critics firmly blamed him, saying he had no understanding of how a modern economy worked. He always concentrated on the question of how to share out the national cake, rather than how to make it grow. Protesters in 2016 burn worthless currency in a show of defiance against the introduction of new bond notes Mr Mugabe once famously said that a country could never go bankrupt - with the world's fastest-shrinking economy and annual inflation of 231 million per cent in July 2008, it seemed as though he was determined to test his theory to the limit. Professor Tony Hawkins of the University of Zimbabwe once observed that with Zimbabwe's former leader: ""Whenever economics gets in the way of politics, politics wins every time."" In 2000, faced with a strong opposition for the first time, he wrecked what was one of Africa's most diversified economies in a bid to retain political control. He seized the white-owned farms which were the economy's backbone and scared off donors but in purely political terms, Mr Mugabe outsmarted his enemies - he remained in power for another 17 years. And the tactics he and his supporters used were straight from the guerrilla war. After he suffered the first electoral defeat of his career, in a 2000 referendum, Mr Mugabe unleashed his personal militia - the self-styled war veterans, backed by the security forces - who used violence and murder as an electoral strategy. Mr Mugabe says he is fighting for the rights of black Zimbabweans Eight years later, a similar pattern was followed after Mr Mugabe lost the first round of a presidential election to his long-time rival Morgan Tsvangirai. When needed, all the levers of state - the security forces, civil service, state-owned media - which are mostly controlled by Zanu-PF, were used in the service of the ruling party. The man who fought for one-man, one-vote introduced a requirement that potential voters prove their residence with utility bills, which the young, unemployed opposition core electorate were unlikely to have. In fact, the signs of his attitude to opposition were there from the early 1980s, when members of the North-Korea trained Fifth Brigade of the army were sent to Matabeleland, home to his then rival, Joshua Nkomo. Thousands of civilians were killed before Mr Nkomo agreed to share power with Mr Mugabe - a precursor of what happened with Mr Tsvangirai. One of the undoubted achievements of the former teacher's 33 years in power was the expansion of education. Zimbabwe still has one of the highest literacy rates in Africa, at 89% of the population. The now deceased political scientist Masipula Sithole once said that by expanding education, the president was ""digging his own grave"". Mr Mugabe has not been afraid to use violence to stay in power The young beneficiaries were able to analyse Zimbabwe's problems for themselves and most blamed government corruption and mismanagement for the lack of jobs and rising prices. He often claimed to be fighting on behalf of the rural poor but much of the land he confiscated ended up in the hands of his cronies. Archbishop Desmond Tutu once said that Zimbabwe's long-time president had become a cartoon figure of the archetypal African dictator. During the 2002 presidential campaign, he started wearing brightly coloured shirts emblazoned with his face - a style copied from many of Africa's authoritarian rulers. For the preceding 20 years, this conservative man was only seen in public with either a stiff suit and tie or safari suit. Robert Mugabe celebrated his 93rd birthday earlier this year He professes to be a staunch Catholic, and worshippers at Harare's Catholic Cathedral were occasionally swamped by security guards when he turned up for Sunday Mass. However, Mr Mugabe's beliefs did not prevent him from having two children by Grace, then his secretary, while his popular Ghanaian first wife, Sally, was dying from cancer. But it was his second wife Grace, 40 years his junior, who ultimately proved his downfall. Although Mr Mugabe outlived many predictions of his demise, the increasing strain of recent years took its toll and his once-impeccable presentation has begun to look rather worn at times. In 2011, a US diplomatic cable released byWikileaks suggested that he was suffering from prostate cancer,external. Wife Grace said Mr Mugabe woke at 05:00 for his exercise But he certainly led a healthy lifestyle. Grace once said that he woke up at 05:00 for his daily exercises, including yoga. He did not drink alcohol or coffee and was largely vegetarian. Mr Mugabe was 73 when she gave birth to their third child, Chatunga. If nothing else, Mr Mugabe has always been an extremely proud man. He often said he would only step down when his ""revolution"" was complete. He was referring to the redistribution of white-owned land but he also wanted to hand-pick his successor, who would of course have had to come from the ranks of Zanu-PF. Didymus Mutasa, once one of Mr Mugabe's closest associates but who has since fallen out with him, once told the BBC that in Zimbabwean culture, kings were only replaced when they die ""and Mugabe is our king"". But even his closest allies were not ready for Zimbabwe to be turned into a monarchy, with power retained by a single family.

"This video can not be played Maj Gen Sibusiso Moyo read out a statement on national TV early on Wednesday Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has been detained by the country's military, who have seized control of the national broadcaster, ZBC. Soldiers and army vehicles are on the streets of the capital, Harare, where gunfire and artillery were heard on Wednesday. Is it a coup? The military insists not - but it certainly has a lot of the hallmarks. The signs that a coup is under way have always been the same across the world and across the decades. Here are the key things to watch out for when a takeover is on the cards. Firstly, be aware that almost nobody mounting a coup ever says that's what they're doing. Zimbabwe's envoy to South Africa, Isaac Moyo, explicitly said there was no coupas the government was ""intact"" with no ""military takeover"". ""We are only targeting criminals around [President Mugabe] who are... causing social and economic suffering,"" Mr Moyo said on state TV. ""As soon as we have accomplished our mission, we expect that the situation will return to normalcy."" The ""situation"" probably looks more alarming to those on the wrong side of the military action, however. This kind of semantic wriggling is common in attempted coups. In restive Venezuela, which has seen violent anti-government protests since the spring, military officers launched an unsuccessful uprising against President Nicolas Maduro in August. This video can not be played Venezuela's rebel Army officers called their move ""a legitimate rebellion"" ""This is not a coup but a civil and military action to re-establish constitutional order,"" said the group's leader, Juan Caguaripano. Venezuela's ruling Socialist Party disagreed, and deputy leader Diosdado Cabello branded it a ""terrorist attack"" on Twitter. When checking for a likely coup, look at where the head of state is.President Mugabe is being held in Harare under house arrest, according to the office of South Africa's President Jacob Zuma,external. He reportedly said in a phone call that he was fine. There is no confirmation of the fate of his powerful wife,52-year-old Grace Mugabe, who has been vying to be her husband's successor. However, an MP from the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, Eddie Cross, told the BBC she had fled Zimbabwe for Namibia on Tuesday night. Detaining the target of the uprising is a vital stage in proceedings. As the BBC's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus observes, the failure of Turkey's attempted coup in July 2016 stemmed from the plotters' inability to immobilise President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The rise of Grace Mugabe A brief guide to Turkey's coup Foreign embassies can become a place of refuge for ousted or imperilled leaders. When President George Bush Senior invaded Panama in 1989, repressive strongman General Manuel Noriega holed himself up in the Vatican's embassy in Panama City. When US troops rolled into Panama, General Manuel Noriega made for the Vatican embassy And sometimes, the head of state will show up in an entirely different country.In Honduras in 2009, troops deposed President Manuel Zelaya and forced him onto a plane,external. When he arrived in Costa Rica, he said he had been kidnapped in his pyjamas. Almost three months later he made a surprise return - and installed himself in Honduras's Brazilian embassy. Waves of popular protest are a key coup signifier. Protesters will often call for a return to democracy and the fall of a repressive regime, only for the military to move in and take power. In Egypt, President Hosni Mubarak was forced out by mass protests during the Arab Spring of 2010-11, which also swept across Libya, Tunisia, Yemen and Syria. The turning point came when the Egyptian army announced that it would not use force against the demonstrating crowds. Mr Mubarak stood down, and a military administration stepped into the breach. Egyptian anti-government demonstrators shout slogans against President Hosni Mubarak at Cairo's Tahrir Square on February 10, 2011 As Turkey's failed coup unfolded in July 2016, civilians actually took to the streets in support of the threatened president. When bridges over the Bosphorus strait in Istanbul were blocked by renegade troops, the public joined pro-Erdogan soldiers to confront them. There has been a lack of public protest in Zimbabwe, where tensions were triggered by Mr Mugabe sacking his political deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, in favour of his wife, Grace. The streets are said to be calm, but armoured military vehicles are patrolling the capital. Even if not sheltering an endangered leader, embassies on the ground have a duty to keep their nationals safe, so they'll start offering guidance. In Zimbabwe, the UK Foreign Office has advised Britons ""currently in Harare to remain safely at home or in their accommodation until the situation becomes clearer"". The US embassy tweeted that it would be closed on Wednesday ""due to ongoing uncertainty"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Getting the message out is important, so rebels often try to seize state or private media to use as their mouthpiece. In Zimbabwe, the military has successfully overrun the headquarters of the state TV station, ZBC. Taking to the airwaves is no guarantee of success, however. In Turkey in 2016, the doomed army faction used a state broadcaster to claim it had seized power to protect democracy from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In fact, the revolt was suppressed. Taking over state media didn't guarantee success for the coup against Turkey's President Erdogan Zambia in 1997 saw an even less successful effort, with an attempted coup that lasted just three hours. At six o'clock one morning, a man calling himself Captain Solo announced on state radio that he had taken over the country, that the heads of the army and police were dismissed, and that President Frederick Chiluba had until nine to surrender or be killed. The president swiftly went on air to say six people had been arrested, and thanked his troops for ""a job well done"". To impose control over a country - or even just its capital city - it helps to close the borders, and seal bridges and other infrastructure that allow people in and out. In September 2015, presidential guards who led a coup in Burkina Faso ordered the sealing of land and air borders, as well as a night-time curfew. Perhaps the most striking lesson in airport control comes from Pakistan in 1999, when Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif tried to sack powerful army chief General Pervez Musharraf, and a battle for supremacy began. Gen Musharraf was in Sri Lanka when he got word that Mr Sharif planned to move against him, and made an airborne dash from Colombo airport to Karachi. Air traffic control refused permission for the plane and its 200 passengers to land, and the pilot was ordered to divert it, first to Oman, then to India. The general ordered the pilot to keep circling Karachi, even though fuel was running dangerously low. The plane was only brought down safely when pro-Musharraf soldiers surrounded the airport's control tower. The general was whisked to safety, and claimed control of Pakistan hours later.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I apologise to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe"" Boris Johnson has apologised for his remarks about a British-Iranian mother who is being held in prison in Iran. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe says she was on holiday when she was arrested in 2016 - a claim the foreign secretary appeared to contradict this month. Apologising in the Commons, Mr Johnson said he would meet her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, on Wednesday and will visit Iran ""before the end of the year"". He retracted ""any suggestion she was there in a professional capacity"". The row over the imprisonment of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe - who has been held in Iran for more than 18 months - has intensified since Mr Johnson gave evidence before a Commons committee on 1 November. During the hearing, the foreign secretary said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching journalism in Iran - something her family and employer say is incorrect.

Responding to an urgent question in Parliament, Mr Johnson was asked to apologise for the remarks. ""Of course I apologise for the distress, for the suffering that has been caused by the impression I gave that I believed she was there in a professional capacity. She was there on holiday,"" he said. This video can not be played Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband tells Today he doesn't think Boris Johnson should resign Mr Ratcliffe has called for his wife to be granted diplomatic protection, which under international law is a way for a state to take diplomatic action on behalf of a national. Earlier, Downing Street said it was ""one of the options"" it was considering in the case. Asked by Labour about the prospect, Mr Johnson told MPs that he would be answering the question ""in person"" and would meet Mr Ratcliffe this week. He said he was also planning to visit Iran before the end of the year and would discuss the possibility of Mr Ratcliffe accompanying him. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year sentence in Iran By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent When a British citizen is jailed overseas, they normally get basic consular help from the local embassy. This could include anything from contacting family to legal support to medical help. But if the UK were to assert its diplomatic protection over a British citizen, that would change things significantly. This would be a signal that the UK is no longer treating the case as a consular matter but a formal, legal dispute between Britain and that country. That's because diplomatic protection is a mechanism under international law that a state can use to help one of its nationals whose rights have been breached in another country. The broad legal principle is that British diplomats would no longer be representing the interests of a citizen but the interests of their state. Read more from James Last week, Mr Johnson said he was sorry if his remarks about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had caused anxiety to her family. However, Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry pushed him to ""apologise properly"" for his comments. ""If it is a matter of pride that the foreign secretary is refusing to admit that simply he has made a mistake, well then I feel bound to say to him that his pride matters not one ounce compared to Nazanin's freedom,"" she said in the Commons. ""After a week of obfuscation and bluster, will he finally take the opportunity today to state simply and unequivocally for the removal of any doubt - either here or in Tehran - that he simply got it wrong?"" Labour MP Yvette Cooper told Mr Johnson that ""words matter"", saying Mr Johnson cannot keep ""shrugging off"" comments that are ""inaccurate"" or ""damaging"". She called for him to resign. In reply, Mr Johnson said: ""It was my mistake. I should have been clearer."" He added: ""I apologise for the distress and anguish that has been caused to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family."" Medical concern for Briton held in Iran 'My wife's been punished without crime' Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme earlier, Mr Ratcliffe said he had written to the Foreign Office following remarks made by Mr Johnson's Cabinet counterpart Michael Gove. Mr Gove had told the BBC on Sunday he did not know what Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been doing in Iran. Mr Ratcliffe said Mr Johnson ""did promise to consider"" whether Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe would be eligible for diplomatic protection, which he said ""gives a different push"" to what the government can do. ""I'm reassured that it is the position of the government,"" Mr Ratcliffe adding. A Downing Street spokesman said diplomatic protection was one available option, adding: ""I think what we need to look at is what will work best and what can be most beneficial in this case."" The spokesman said Prime Minister Theresa May had been involved in Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case ""from the outset"" and was treating it as ""a priority"". She had raised it with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on at least two occasions, he added. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe - who has a three-year-old daughter, who is being cared for by family in Iran - was arrested and jailed in Iran in April 2016.

"This video can not be played Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband said ""she was just a mum on holiday"" Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman being held in Iran, has seen a specialist after finding lumps in her breasts, her husband has said. Richard Ratcliffe also expressed concern that his wife appeared to be ""on the verge of a nervous breakdown"". She was arrested during a visit to Iran in April 2016, accused of trying to overthrow the regime, which she denies. Cabinet ministers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have beenaccused of bungling the UK's handling of the case. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family have issued a statement about her condition, saying she had been ""complaining of sharp stabbing pains in her breasts"" for more than a year. They said she had been given a mammogram by the prison's gynaecologist, which gave an inconclusive result. After insisting on seeing an outside specialist, the family said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was then taken to hospital for an ultrasound on Saturday. They said although the doctor thought the lumps were likely to be benign, he did note her family having a history of breast cancer. She was given anti-inflammatory medication and vitamin pills and was to be seen by the specialist again next week to see whether there was any improvement or whether she might need surgery, the family said. Boris Johnson sorry if remarks 'caused anxiety' Mother caught in Iran power struggle 'My wife's been punished without crime' The full details of the allegations against Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe have never been made fully public. She maintains the purpose of her trip to Iran was to visit family and for her daughter to meet her grandparents but speaking in Westminster on 1 November, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson appeared to contradict her account when he wrongly said she had been training journalists there. Four days later, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was recalled to court in Iran and his remark cited as evidence against her, prompting fears her five-year sentence could be extended. However, her family say there have been no developments on new charges against her since her court appearance. Her lawyer also says he has not been contacted by the Iranian judiciary. In the statement her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, describes his earlier phone conversation with Mr Johnson and says the minister is trying to find time to meet him ""in the next few days"". This video can not be played Michael Gove says Richard Ratcliffe was the person who would know what his wife was doing in Iran It came after Environment Secretary Michael Gove told the BBC he did not know what Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been doing in Iran when she was arrested. He later said he would ""take her husband's assurance"" that she was on holiday. Amid calls for his resignation over the matter, the foreign secretary earlier this week clarified that the UK government had ""no doubt"" that a holiday was the sole purpose of her visit to Iran. Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had been angered by Mr Johnson's initial remarks and Iranian media coverage of her case. But he restated his belief that it was not in Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's interests for anyone to resign.

"Most of the dual nationals imprisoned by Iran have been held at Tehran's notorious Evin prison The plight of British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was arbitrarily detained for almost six years in Iran on spying charges that she strongly denied, focused attention on Iranians with dual nationality or foreign permanent residency being held in the Islamic Republic's prisons. Iran does not recognise dual nationality, and there are no exact figures on the number of such detainees given the sensitive nature of the information. Some of the most prominent are: Ahmadreza Djalali was sentenced to death in October 2017 The 51-year-old specialist in emergency medicine was arrested in April 2016 while on a business trip from Sweden. Amnesty International said Djalali washeld at Evin prison,externalby intelligence ministry officials for seven months, three of them in solitary confinement, before he was given access to a lawyer. He alleged that he was subjected to torture and other ill-treatment during that period, including threats to kill or otherwise harm his children, who live in Sweden, and his mother, who lives in Iran. In October 2017, a Revolutionary Court in Tehran convicted Djalali of ""spreading corruption on Earth"" and sentenced him to death. His lawyers said the court relied primarily on evidence obtained under duress and alleged that he was prosecuted solely because of his refusal to use his academic ties in European institutions to spy for Iran. 'My husband is facing execution in Iran' Two months later, Iranian state television also aired what it said was footage of Djalali confessing that he had spied on Iran's nuclear programme for Israel. It suggested he was responsible for identifying two Iranian nuclear scientists who were killed in bomb attacks in 2010. In February 2018, Sweden confirmed that it had given Djalali citizenship and demanded that his death sentence not be carried out. He had previously been a permanent resident. In November 2021, Djalali's wife, Vida Mehran-Nia, said he had been informed by prison authorities thathe faced imminent execution. He spent five months in solitary confinement, awaiting execution, until April 2021, when he reportedly was moved to a multi-occupancy cell. Just over a year later, an Iranian judiciary spokesman said Djalali's death sentence was ""final"" and was ""on the agenda"" of authorities. He also insisted that the case was not linked to the war crimes trial in Sweden of former Iranian judiciary official Hamid Nouri,who was sentenced to life in prisonover what prosecutors said was his leading role in the mass executions of Iranian opposition supporters in 1988. Djalali's wife and human rights groups have said Djalali is a ""hostage"" who Iran is threatening to execute in an attempt to negotiate a swap for Mr Nouri. Nahid Taghavi was an advocate for women's rights in Iran The 69-year-old retired architect, who is a German-Iranian dual national, was arrested at her apartment in Tehran in October 2020 and accused of ""endangering security"". She was placed in solitary confinement at Evin prison,externaland not given access to lawyers, German diplomats or members of her family, according to her daughter Mariam Claren. Taghavi was repeatedly subjected to coercive questioning without the presence of lawyers, according to Amnesty International. Interrogators reportedly asked her about meeting people to discuss women's and labour rights, and possessing literature about those issues. In August 2021, she was convicted by a Revolutionary Court in Tehran of ""forming a group composed of more than two people with the purpose of disrupting national security"" and ""spreading propaganda against the system"". She was sentenced to 10 years and eight months in prison. Taghavi had denied the charges, the first of which was apparently related to a social media account about women's rights, and Amnesty said the trial was ""grossly unfair"". Ms Claren wrote on Twitter,externalthat her mother ""did not commit any crime. Unless freedom of speech, freedom of thought are illegal"". She has said her mother has been denied adequate healthcare by prison and prosecution authorities, despite doctors saying in September 2021 that she needed surgery on her spinal column. In July 2022, Taghavi was granted urgent medical leave from prison for treatment for back and neck problems. She was sent back to Evin four months later. A fellow inmate in the prison warned in June 2023 that Taghavi's life was ""in danger"" following a further 220 days in solitary confinement. ""The pain is so severe that it can be clearly seen on her face. She can barely get out of her bed,""a message posted on human rights activist Narges Mohammadi's Instagram account said,external. Fariba Adelkhah's research focused on political and social anthropology The 64-year-old researcher at Sciences-Po university in Paris is a specialist in social anthropology and the political anthropology of post-revolutionary Iran, and has written a number of books. At the time of her arrest in Tehran in June 2019,external, she was examining the movement of Shia clerics between Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq, and had spent time in the holy city of Qom. Adelkhah was accused of espionage and other security-related offences. She protested her innocence and after going on hunger strike, she was admitted to hospital for treatment for severe kidney damage. Prosecutors dropped the espionage charge before her trial began at the Revolutionary Court in April 2020. The following month, the court sentenced Adelkhah to five years in prisonfor conspiring against national securityand an additional year for propaganda against the establishment. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian condemned the sentence and demanded her release. In October 2020, due to what Sciences-Po called her ""health circumstances"", Adelkhah was released on bail and allowed to return to her home in Tehran. However, Iran's judiciary announced in January 2022 that it hadreturned Adelkhah to prison,external, accusing her of ""knowingly violating the limits of house arrest dozens of times"". French President Emmanuel Macron called the decision ""entirely arbitrary"". In February 2023, AdelkhahAdelkhah was released from Evin prisonafter three and a half years in detention. However, Iranian authorities refused to return her identity papers, making it impossible for her to leave the country or resume her work as a researcher. Jamshid Sharmahd with his wife (L) and daughter, Gazelle Sharmahd, 68, a German citizen who lived in the US, arrived in the United Arab Emirates in July 2020 and was awaiting a connecting flight to India when he disappeared. It is believed that he was kidnapped by Iranian agents in Dubai and then forcibly taken to Iran via Oman. The following month, Iran's intelligence ministry announced that it had arrested Sharmahd following a ""complex operation"", without providing any details. It also published a video in which he appeared blindfolded and confessed to various crimes. In February 2023, Iran's judiciary said Sharmahd had beensentenced to deathby a Revolutionary Court in Tehran after being found guilty of ""spreading corruption on Earth through planning and leading terror operations"". It alleged that he was the leader of a terrorist group known as Tondar and that he had ""planned 23 terror attacks"", of which ""five were successful"", including the 2008 bombing of a mosque in Shiraz in that killed 14 people. Tondar - which means ""thunder"" in Persian - is another name of the Kingdom Assembly of Iran (KAI), a little-known US-based opposition group that seeks to restore the monarchy overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution. According to Amnesty International, Sharmahd created a website to publish statements from the KAI, including claims of explosions inside Iran. He also read out statements in radio and video broadcasts. However, he denied his involvement in the attacks, saying he was only a spokesman, and rejected all accusations during his trial. Amnesty said Sharmahd told his family that he had been tortured and subjected to other ill-treatment in detention, including by being held in prolonged solitary confinement. He also told them that he had been denied adequate healthcare, with access to medications required for his Parkinson's disease delayed routinely. In July, Sharmahd's daughter Gazelle told the BBC that he could beexecuted at any time. ""They're killing him softly in solitary confinement in this death cell. But even if he survives that, they're killing him by hanging him from a crane in public."" Shahab Dalili The 61-year-old retired Iranian merchant navy captain is a US permanent resident. He has been detained in Iran since April 2016, when he visited Tehran to attend his father's funeral. He was later convicted of ""collaborating with a hostile state"" and sentenced to 10 years in prison. His wife - who is a US citizen - broke her silence in March 2022,saying in a video statement that he had been imprisoned unjustly for six years,externaland appealing to President Joe Biden to ""bring Shahab home"". In August 2023, his son, Darian, complained that he was not part of a prisoner exchange deal between the US and Iran, which saw five US-Iranian dual nationals released the following month. ""He feels betrayed. He is demoralized. He believes that the US would bring back anyone that they want to bring back,"" Darian told Reuters news agency. A US state department spokesman declined to tell reporters why Dalili was not included, but did reveal he had not yet been declared ""wrongfully detained"" - a designation that would mean the department dedicated more resources to their case and assigned it to a presidential envoy.

"The UK Supreme Court has ruled that Scotland can set a minimum price for alcohol, rejecting a challenge by the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA). Legislation was approved by the Scottish Parliament five years ago but has been tied up in court challenges. In a unanimous judgment, seven Supreme Court judges said the legislation did not breach European Union law. The judges ruled the measure was a ""proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim"". Ministers said a 50p-per-unit minimum would help tackle Scotland's ""unhealthy relationship with drink"" by raising the price of cheap, high-strength alcohol. The whisky association had claimed the move was a ""restriction on trade"" and there were more effective ways of tackling alcohol misuse. After the Supreme Court verdict, ministers are expected to make Scotland the first country in the world to establish a minimum price per unit of alcohol, possibly early next year. A small number of countries, including Canada and Russia, have some form of minimum price structure, according to the Institute for Alcohol Studies. Many others have rules aimed at restricting cheap alcohol sales. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ""Absolutely delighted that minimum pricing has been upheld by the Supreme Court. ""This has been a long road - and no doubt the policy will continue to have its critics - but it is a bold and necessary move to improve public health."" The Scotch Whisky Association said it accepted the Supreme Court's ruling. The Scottish government believes cracking down on cheap alcohol will help tackle the country's binge-drinking culture The Scottish government's aim is to reduce the amount that problem drinkers consume simply by raising the price of the strongest, cheapest alcohol. The move is not a tax or duty increase. It is a price hike for the cheapest drink, with any extra cash going to the retailer. Last year, Alcohol Focus Scotland claimed the maximum recommended weekly intake of alcohol (14 units) could be bought for just Â£2.52. It said super-strength cider and own-brand vodka and whisky could be purchased for as little as 18p per unit of alcohol. The 50p-per-unit minimum outlined by the legislation would raise the price of the cheapest bottle of red wine (9.4 units of alcohol) to Â£4.69, a four-pack of 500ml cans of 4% lager (8 units) would cost at least Â£4 and a 70cl bottle of whisky (28 units of alcohol) could not be sold for less than Â£14. Normal strength cider (5% ABV) would cost at least Â£2.50 a litre but a super-strength version (7.5% ABV) would have to cost a minimum of Â£3.75 for a litre. Minimum pricing will not raise the prices of all alcoholic drinks because many are already above the threshold. Pubs and bars are unlikely to be affected as they usually charge much more than 50p per unit. The aim is to hit consumption of strong alcohol which is sold at low prices. The new laws would be ""experimental"" and expire after six years unless renewed. Supporters of minimum pricing,externalbelieve the move is necessary to tackle the country's binge drinking culture, withScots buying 20% more alcohol on averagethan people in England or Wales. The judges delivered their ruling at the Supreme Court in London The judges at the Supreme Court rejected the Scotch Whisky Association's claim that an excise duty or tax would be an equally effective way of achieving the government's objectives. Their judgment said minimum pricing targeted ""the health hazards of cheap alcohol and the groups most affected in a way that an increase in excise or VAT does not"". The judges said a tax would increase prices ""across the board"" and not just the cheap, strong alcohol which is the focus of the legislation. They also agreed that minimum pricing was ""easier to understand and simpler to enforce"". Minimum pricing would not allow retailers to ""absorb"" the cost in the way a duty rise would, they said. The Scottish government said it would move as quickly as possible to implement the legislation Scotland's health minister Shona Robison said: ""This is a historic and far-reaching judgment and a landmark moment in our ambition to turn around Scotland's troubled relationship with alcohol. ""In a ruling of global significance, the UK Supreme Court has unanimously backed our pioneering and life-saving alcohol pricing policy."" Scotch Whisky Association chief executive Karen Betts said: ""We will now look to the Scottish and UK governments to support the industry against the negative effects of trade barriers being raised in overseas markets that discriminate against Scotch Whisky as a consequence of minimum pricing, and to argue for fair competition on our behalf."" Scottish Conservative health spokesman Miles Briggs said the Scottish government would have his party's support on implementing the legislation. He said: ""We look forward to seeing whether or not minimum pricing can make any impact on Scotland's complex and damaging relationship with alcohol."" Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, said the decision was a ""massive victory for Scotland's health"". She said: ""Minimum unit pricing is effective because it targets the kind of drinking most likely to lead to the greatest harm. ""The price of a pint in the pub won't change but the price of strong white ciders and own brand spirits that are mainly bought by dependent drinkers will rise markedly."" Dr Peter Bennie, chairman of the British Medical Association Scotland, said: ""As doctors we see every day the severe harms caused by alcohol misuse and the damage it causes to individuals and their families. ""There are no easy solutions, but minimum unit pricing can make a significant contribution to reducing these harms and saving lives."" Cancer Research UK's cancer prevention expert Linda Bauld said: ""Alcohol is linked to seven types of cancer including breast and bowel cancer, and the more you drink the greater your risk of cancer. ""It's a shame expensive legal action has delayed this welcome measure."" Canada is one of the very few countries to have brought in a form of minimum pricing for alcohol, where it's known as a ""Social Reference Price"". Each of Canada's 10 provinces is able set the lowest price per litre that alcoholic drinks can be sold for in shops. Canadian academic studies suggest that the policy has successfully reduced alcohol consumption. According toresearch by Tim Stockwell at the University of Victoria's Centre for Addictions Research of British Columbia,,externala 10% increase in average minimum prices in one province led to an 8% decrease in alcohol consumption per person. The price rise was also associated with a 9% decrease in patients being hospitalised for alcohol related diseases. But other factors could also be contributing, such as the ageing population.Older Canadians tend to drink less,external, which might also explain the fall in consumption. It is also difficult to draw a direct comparison between Canada and Scotland. In Canada the extra revenue generated by the minimum pricing goes to the government rather than the retailers. This means retailers in Scotland may have an extra incentive to increase sales because they will profit directly. The Supreme Court ruling was the final stage of a five-year legal battle, with the cases already passing through courts in Edinburgh and Luxembourg. After an initial challenge at the Court of Session failed in 2013, the SWA appealed to the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The European court said the legislation might break EU law if other tax options would prove as effective, but said it was ""ultimately for the national court to determine"" whether they did. The Scottish court subsequently backed the measures for a second time, ruling that tax measures ""would be less effective than minimum pricing"". However, in December 2016 the Court of Session judges then allowed the SWA to go to the Supreme Court to challenge their ruling. May 2012:MSPs pass Scots booze price plan May 2013:Minimum drink price challenge fails December 2015:Minimum drink price 'may breach EU law' October 2016:Courts back minimum alcohol price December 2016:Whisky firms allowed minimum price appeal July 2017:Supreme Court judges retire to consider minimum pricing appeal The legislation to bring in a minimum price of 50p per unit was passed by the Scottish Parliament in May 2012 The UK government supported the devolved Scottish administration during the legal process, arguing that minimum pricing was compatible with EU law. In 2012, then Prime Minister David Cameronpledged to introduce minimum pricing- but the plan was shelved a year later in the face of fierce opposition from the drinks industry. The Home Office has said the policy remains under review and calls for its reintroduction in England are likely to be reignited when it is implemented in Scotland. Legislation to establish a minimum price is currently under active consideration by the National Assembly for Wales. In Northern Ireland, former Health Minister Jim Wells had been seeking to introduce minimum pricing before resigning in April 2015.

"Asking a question can be enough to interrupt suicidal thoughts, says a new campaign Commuters are being urged to step in if they see vulnerable people near railway tracks, as part of a campaign to prevent suicide. Network Rail, British Transport Police (BTP) and Samaritans hope the ""Small Talk Saves Lives,external"" campaign will give travellers the confidence to intervene. BTP Chief Constable Paul Crowther said engaging someone in conversation could ""make all the difference"". In 2016/17, 273 people died in suicide incidents on the UK's railways. Ian Stevens from Network Rail, who manages the industry's suicide prevention programme, said: ""Given that nearly five million journeys are made by train every day, we are asking for passengers to work alongside our staff as the eyes and ears of the railway, helping us to keep everybody safe."" Drop in rail suicides after new Samaritans course The railway workers trained to stop suicides A survey of 5,000 people carried out by the campaign group showed 83% of passengers would approach someone who may be suicidal if they knew the signs, what to say and if they knew they would not make the situation worse. The campaign highlights warning signs, including: A person standing alone and isolated A person looking distant or withdrawn Someone staying on the platform a long time without boarding a train Someone displaying something out of the ordinary in their behaviour or appearance. And when it comes to what to say, the Samaritans said something as simple as a question could break the pattern of suicidal thoughts. Examples which have saved lives include ""It's a warm evening, isn't it?"" and ""Do you need some help?"". Asking someone what their name is or introducing yourself can also get the conversation started. After asking the initial question, many people said they felt confident to offer reassurance and support those by listening, it added. The Samaritans operate a 24-hour service available every day of the year on116 123. If you prefer to write down how you're feeling, you can email atjo@samaritans.org. Childline runs a helpline for children and young people in the UK on0800 11 11. Calls are free and the number does not show up on your phone bill. PAPYRUS is a voluntary organisation supporting teenagers and young adults who are feeling suicidal. You can call them on0800 068 41 41. SOURCE:NHS -for more information click here,external. Sarah Wilson planned to take her life on the railway, but did not go through with it after someone spoke to her. ""Someone showing that they cared about me helped to interrupt my suicidal thoughts and that gave them time to subside,"" she said. ""The more that people understand that suicide is preventable, the better. You won't make things worse, and you could save a life."" While the group was keen to emphasise there was no single sign or combination of behaviours that meant a person was suicidal, it said: ""If something doesn't feel right, the message is to act."" If a person does not feel comfortable to talk to someone at risk, the group recommends alerting a member of staff or calling the police. The Samaritans have trained 16,000 rail staff and BTP officers in suicide prevention and, as a result, for each life lost on the railway, six are saved.

"Women who took the drug will be offered genetic testing The use of a controversial hormonal pregnancy test from the 1950s to the 1970s did not damage unborn children, a scientific review has found. The Commission on Human Medicines said the evidence did not support a ""causal link"". The inquiry was set up by the UK government amid concerns the drug may have caused defects and miscarriages. It was used in Britain between 1953 and 1975 - other countries stopped sooner. However, the commission said that women who used the test and subsequently had babies born with defects would be offered genetic testing to see if any cause could be identified. An electronic system for reporting side-effects during pregnancy will also be introduced to help identify problems with medicines that may occur in the future. It is estimated that over one million women used the drug to test for pregnancies. It worked by triggering a period if a woman was not pregnant. Before that pregnancy tests required complicated blood tests. Campaigners claim it caused birth defects in their children, such as blindness, deafness, spina bifida and heart and limb defects as well as cleft palates. A previous report by independent experts in 2014 also found inconclusive evidence of harm, but this new review was ordered by ministers after fresh concerns came to light. Legal action against Schering - the original manufacturer of Primodos - was halted in 1982 because of a lack of evidence. Schering was subsequently taken over by Bayer. Dr Alisa Gebbie, chair of the working group which oversaw the inquiry, said many thousands of pieces of evidence were examined during the review, and detailed testimonies had been gathered from families affected. But she said there was simply not the evidence to suggest the drug caused defects or miscarriages. She also said the findings should reassure women who still use the hormones - progestogen and oestrogen - that were used in the drug. ""Many women use these same hormones on a daily basis for contraception and heavy periods who may experience an unintended pregnancy. So our findings are also reassuring for them."" Marie Lyon, who is chair of the Association for Children Damaged by Hormone Pregnancy Tests, was prescribed Primodos and later gave birth to a daughter whose limbs were not fully formed. She said she was very angry with the findings. ""They have ignored some of the evidence. It's a cover-up. We had high hopes this inquiry would get to the truth but it hasn't."" She said she would like to see a judicial review of the whole issue.

"World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont announced the decision in London on Wednesday France will host the 2023 Rugby World Cup after beating rival bids from South Africa and Ireland. South Africa had been expected to win the vote after anindependent review recommendedthey stage the tournament. However, at a World Rugby Council meeting in London on Wednesday, France was chosen to hold the 10th event. France - the main host of the competition in 2007 - won in the second round of voting, with 24 votes compared to 15 for South Africa. Irish 'very disappointed' not to get Scotland & Wales RWC votes Ireland, which staged matches in 1991 and 1999, was eliminated after getting eight of the 39 votes in the first round - France picked up 18 and South Africa 13. South Africa hosted the World Cup in 1995, when the Springboks beat New Zealand 15-12 in the final. England backed the Irish bid but Wales supported South Africa and Scotland went with France. The head of the Irish Rugby Union Philip Browne said he was ""very disappointed"" with that. World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont described the selection process as the ""most transparent and comprehensive"" in the organisation's history. ""I am delighted for France. They have run a World Cup before and I think it will be an exciting World Cup,"" he said ""We feel for the first time that within World Rugby we have put the results of our evaluation out to the general public."" South Africa beat England in the 2007 final when France last hosted the tournament Last month, South Africa had ranked highest in the independent review after the three bids were judged on five categories... vision and hosting concept tournament organisation and schedule venues and host cities tournament infrastructure finance, commercial and commitments From the above criteria, South Africa scored 78.97%, France was second with 75.88% and Ireland was third with 72.25% - but members of the World Rugby Council voted to select France. Bernard Laporte, president of the French Rugby Federation (FFR), had criticised the original report, saying it contained a ""certain amount of incompetence"" and was ""laughable"". ""We are not rated as well over doping because they tell us we are too strict,"" Laporte told AFP in an interview last week. ""On security, we have the same number of points even though there are 52 murders a day in South Africa - it's crazy."" After the decision to award France the 2023 World Cup, Laporte said: ""This World Cup is for all of French rugby. The economic impact will be for them. With the reforms that we have committed, we needed this World Cup."" France President Emmanuel Macron tweeted:,external""We will again host the Rugby World Cup in 2023. Wonderful news for rugby, for sport and for France."" South Africa said they were ""bitterly disappointed"" at the decision, but would not appeal against the verdict. ""We would like to apologise to the people and government of South Africa for raising their hopes,"" added Mark Alexander, president of South Africa Rugby. ""We did everything in our power to bring the tournament to South Africa and we expected to have that right confirmed. ""We produced a compelling bid document that earned the unanimous recommendation of the Rugby World Cup Ltd board. That recommendation was questioned last week by rivals, but endorsed a second time by World Rugby last week. ""However, the view of the experts and World Rugby's leadership was overturned by World Rugby Council members, who may have had other factors to take into account. ""We cannot hide our desolation but, for the sake of rugby we wish the 2023 tournament hosts every success."" Jurie Roux, chief executive of South Africa Rugby, said: ""World Rugby ran an exhaustive, transparent process for 15 months to identify the best host nation, only for the process to go entirely opaque for the past two weeks. ""The view of the experts and World Rugby's leadership was overturned by World Rugby Council members."" Nelson Mandela, then president of South Africa, presented the World Cup trophy to Springboks captain Francois Pienaar in 1995 Chester Williams, who helped South Africa win the World Cup when they hosted the event in 1995, told BBC World Service the decision was ""disappointing and sad"". He added: ""It is a much needed event that we wanted here in South Africa and this could have been another opportunity for us as South Africa to reunite as a nation. ""It would have been an amazing opportunity to host the Rugby World Cup and the French have won it and we have to deal with it accordingly. ""We were about 90% certain that we would be hosting the World Cup. The whole of South Africa is going to be disappointed. ""We thought the biggest opposition would be the Irish."" Ireland's most capped player Brian O'Driscoll (right) was among the team hoping to get the event held in Ireland Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said Ireland could bid again to host the tournament in the future. ""I am of course deeply disappointed by this result but I wish France the very best in their preparations for Rugby World Cup 2023. World Rugby had a choice of three excellent contenders,"" he said. ""As someone who has been involved in the bid from the beginning, I had hoped Ireland would be selected. But we were beaten by another excellent candidate and I know that France will host a superb tournament in 2023. ""I have no regrets about bidding for the tournament and I want to thank everyone who was involved in it. ""We should never forget that the technical report found that Ireland would be excellent hosts for Rugby World Cup 2023, and there may be other occasions for Ireland to show the world what we are capable of.""

"Richard Ratcliffe told a press conference he raised the issue of diplomatic protection for his wife The Foreign Office is still considering whether it will give diplomatic protection to a British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held by Tehran since April 2016 after being accused of spying - charges she denies. Her husband raised the issue of her being given diplomatic protection in a meeting with the foreign secretary. The Foreign Office said lawyers would discuss the issue but said the question was whether it would help her case. Richard Ratcliffe met with Boris Johnson after the foreign secretary said during a Commons committee hearing that Mrs Zhagari-Ratcliffe was in Iran to ""train journalists"" - which could lead to her five-year jail term being doubled. He has since apologised for the remarks - made on 1 November - and retracted ""any suggestion she was there in a professional capacity"". Her family have always maintained she was on holiday with her daughter. Mr Ratcliffe told a press conference after the meeting that diplomatic protection - which allows a state to take diplomatic action on behalf of a national - would be ""important and helpful"". The protection would signal that the UK is treating the case as a formal, legal dispute between the UK and Iran. But he said the Foreign Office expressed reservations about whether the protection would help his wife's case. ""They have agreed to answer the questions and then for the lawyers to sit down and talk it through. Both legally and then also practically. ""But certainly, I think it is an important thing for us to be pushing for."" The Foreign Office said its lawyers would meet in the coming fortnight to discuss the issue further. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Caught in Iran power struggle Johnson 'sorry' over jailed mother remarks Medical concern for Briton held in Iran What is diplomatic protection? By James Landale, BBC News Diplomatic Correspondent When a British citizen is jailed overseas they normally get basic consular help from the local embassy, including contacting family, legal support and medical help. Conferring diplomatic protection on the citizen would ratchet up their status, so that diplomats working on the case would no longer treat it as a consular matter but a formal, legal dispute between Britain and that country, conducted under the rules of international law. The citizen's interests would be taken as those of the state. Diplomatic protection is very different from diplomatic immunity. The latter is something given to diplomats to ensure their safe passage and protection from prosecution. What is diplomatic protection? Richard Ratcliffe and Boris Johnson met at the Commonwealth office Mr Ratcliffe said he discussed with the foreign secretary the possibility of a joint trip to Iran before the end of the year. He said Mr Johnson had no fixed date for his planned visit to Iran, but the foreign secretary was ""keen"" for him to travel with him. He also spoke about the health of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who he said had found lumps in her breasts. ""She talks about being on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I absolutely believe that's true. ""I think it's important I don't exaggerate anything in the media and I'm not melodramatic, but she is in a difficult place."" Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been visiting Iran with her daughter Gabriella when she was arrested Mr Ratcliffe's MP, Tulip Siddiq, who joined him in the meeting, said he had failed to obtain a visa to visit Iran over the last 19 months and had not seen his daughter Gabriella, who is living in the country with her maternal grandparents, during that time. She said they had communicated over Skype but his daughter had lost the ability to speak English. ""So, if he gets to go with the foreign secretary, he gets to see his daughter for the first time in 19 months.

"Wages continue to lag behind the cost of living in the UK, while unemployment remains at a 42-year low. Workers' earnings, excluding bonuses, rose 2.2% in the three months to September compared with a year ago, theOffice for National Statistics said,external. But they fell 0.5% in real terms when accounting for inflation, marking seven months of negative pay growth. The number of jobless - people not in work but seeking a job - fell 59,000 to 1.42 million during the period. Withinflation at a five-and-a-half-year highof 3% in October, pay is failing to keep up with higher prices. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.3% - its lowest rate since 1975 - and down from 4.8% a year earlier. Minister for Employment Damian Hinds said the unemployment figures showed the ""strength of the economy"". ""A near-record number of people are now in work,"" he said. ""Everyone should be given the opportunity to find work and enjoy the stability of a regular pay packet."" At the same time, the number of people in work dropped to 32 million, down 14,000 from the last quarter, according to ONS data. Labour MP Debbie Abrahams, shadow work and pensions secretary, said the figures were further evidence of ""Tory economic failure"". She said: ""Both employment and real wages are falling while the price of household essentials balloons, leaving millions of people worse off than they were in 2010."" Matt Hughes, a senior ONS statistician, said employment had declined after two years of ""almost uninterrupted growth"", but was still higher than last year. The last time there was a bigger fall in employment was in April to June 2015, when the number of people in work dropped by 45,000, according to the ONS. The simultaneous drop in the number of workers and unemployed people is due to the rise in people who are classed as ""economically inactive"" - those not working and not seeking or available to work. This includes people studying, retirees, the long-term sick, or those looking after family, and rose by 117,000 to 8.8 million over the quarter. Mr Hughes said: ""There was a rise in the number of people who were neither working nor looking for a job - so-called economically inactive people."" SeparateONS data,externalshowed a bright spot for productivity, which increased by 0.9% in the latest three months - the strongest growth rate for six years. But this follows aprolonged period of weak productivitysince the financial crisis. By BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed: Any port in a storm, but it is sensible to put today's leap in productivity in context. After six months of negative figures (-0.5% January to March, -0.1% April to June), today's +0.9% jump in productivity is undoubtedly better news. But it would need at least two more quarters of similarly positive numbers to discern whether this is just normal quarter-by-quarter volatility or the first signs that the productivity slump might be starting to turn. The ONS measures productivity by dividing the number of hours worked by what is called Gross Value Added, the value of goods and services produced by the UK economy. It has leapt this quarter because working hours have fallen slightly and economic growth is higher. Whether we are actually producing more per hour worked - the key to wealth creation and better wages - will only become clear over the next six months. ONS head of productivity Philip Wales said: ""The medium-term picture continues to be one of productivity growing - but at a much slower rate than seen before the financial crisis."" The CBI's head of employment, Matthew Percival, thought the rise in productivity was ""encouraging"". He said: ""Businesses will be looking for the chancellor to cement progress in next week's Budget and maintain flexibility in the labour market, which remains a mainstay of the UK economy."" By BBC business correspondent Jonty Bloom: How can unemployment and the number of people in work drop at the same time? The unemployment rate is a measure of those people who want to work - and cannot - but the employment rate is a measure of everyone in work. So you could have a large number of people retiring and only some of them being replaced by unemployed people who are recruited to do their jobs. Employment will fall, and so will unemployment. In today's figures, the fall in employment seems to be concentrated amongst the 18-24 year olds, suggesting that part of the reason is that they are returning to education, although the figures are supposed to take such seasonal factors into account.

"This video can not be played Who is Grace Mugabe? Zimbabwe's former first lady Grace Mugabe, a polarising figure, had for years been positioning herself as a potential successor to her 93-year-old husband Robert as president. Once a quiet figure known for her shopping and her charity work, she became more high-profile in the ruling Zanu-PF party as the head of its women's league. She was instrumental in the ousting of several alternative potential successors to her husband's presidency. However, she did not get the better of her main rival, former Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa. The former president accused him of disloyalty and sacked in early November 2017, but the subsequent chain of events undermined both the former president and former first lady. Members of the military seized state TV and put Mr Mugabe under house arrest. Mr Mnangagwa was appointed leader of Zanu-PF on 19 November. At 52, Mrs Mugabe is four decades younger than her 93-year-old husband, once the world's oldest ruler, who governed Zimbabwe from the end of white-minority rule in 1980 till his resignation was announced in November 2017. Mrs Mugabe has always been a staunch supporter of her husband- earlier this year she memorably said that he could even win votes as a corpse. She has not denied wanting to take the helm of the country, and at a 2014 rally she said: ""They say I want to be president. Why not? Am I not a Zimbabwean?"" Began affair with Robert Mugabe, 41 years her senior, while working as a typist in state house Mr Mugabe was still married to his first wife, Sally, who was terminally ill at the time Married Mr Mugabe, her second husband, in 1996 in an extravagant ceremony They have three children - Bona, Robert and Chatunga Nicknamed ""Gucci Grace"" by her critics who accuse her of lavish spending Named head of Zanu-PF women's league in 2014, had been tipped to be named vice-president in December Accused of assaulting a model in South Africa in 2017 Robert Mugabe - hero, or villain? Political opponents had warned against a dynasty taking shape, andMrs Mugabe was criticised for seeking to use her diplomatic immunity when accused of assaulting a 20-year-old South African modelwith an electrical plug. This was not the first time she had been accused of physical assault. Along with her husband, Mrs Mugabe is subject to EU and US sanctions, including travel bans, imposed over the seizure of land and accusations of rigged elections and crackdowns on political opposition. Former President Mugabe began wooing Grace Marufu while she was working as a young typist in the country's state house. The two began an affair while he was married to his terminally ill first wife, Sally. ""He came to me and started asking about my family,"" she said in a rare interview about their first encounter in the late 1980s. ""I looked at him as a father figure. I did not think he would at all look at me and say: 'I like that girl.' I least expected that."" Mr Mugabe has said Sally did give her consent to the union before she died in 1992 - though he did not marry Grace until four years later. The couple have three children: Bona, Robert and Chatunga. Occasionally referred to as ""Gucci Grace"", Mrs Mugabe has been criticised by some for an alleged appetite for extravagant shopping. The former first family has vast properties, businesses and farms dotted around the country, mainly in the rich western and northern Mashonaland provinces. Over the years, Mrs Mugabe has attempted to grow herself into a powerful businesswoman and sees herself as a philanthropist, founding an orphanage on a farm just outside the capital, Harare, with the help of Chinese funding. She controversially earned a PhD in sociology from the University of Zimbabwe in just two months in 2014, although her thesis, unlike those of other students, was never filed and has never been made available. Nevertheless, her doctorate title was used on campaign material as she prepared to take over the leadership of the Zanu-PF women's wing. Since becoming more active in politics, she has become known for her sharp tongue and tough reputation. Pulling no punches while attacking political opponents, Mrs Mugabe often fiercely defends her husband. She has been accused of washing the ruling party's dirty linen in public by calling on people to resign or apologise. Mrs Mugabe spearheaded the ousting of a former ally, then-Vice-President Joice Mujuru, in 2014. She said the vice-president should be sacked from government because she was ""corrupt, an extortionist, incompetent, a gossiper, a liar and ungrateful"", and accused her of collaborating with opposition forces and white people to undermine the country's post-independence gains. Joice Mujuru was once a staunch ally of Mr Mugabe A few months later, Mrs Mujuru was expelled from Zanu-PF. She remains a leader of the opposition National People's Party (NPP) and is spearheading a People's Rainbow Coalition (PRC), where she urged people to register to vote to prevent the perpetual rule of Mr Mugabe and his wife. The new vice-president was Mr Mnangagwa, a former justice minister who Mrs Mugabe had called ""loyal and disciplined"". But by 2017, Mrs Mugabe was publicly calling on her husband to remove Mr Mnangagwa. She suggested that his supporters were planning a coup. When he fell ill at a rally and had to be airlifted out of the country for treatment, his supporters blamed poison administered through ice cream from Mrs Mugabe's dairy farm, a suggestion she denied. He later said he had been poisoned, but it was ""false and malicious"" to suggest it was at the hands of the former first lady.

"Universities have been told to be more careful about advertising claims The advertising watchdog has told six UK universities to take down marketing claims that could be misleading. Leicester, East Anglia, Strathclyde, Falmouth, Teesside and the University of West London have all had complaints upheld against them. The Advertising Standards Authority is warning against exaggerated claims made to attract students. Chief executive Guy Parker says students need ""good evidence"" when making such a big financial commitment. ""Misleading would-be students is not only unfair, it can also lead them to make choices that aren't right for them,"" said Mr Parker. Universities face false adverts warning Institutions challenged on top 1% advert For the first time universities are going to be issued with guidance on avoiding misleading information. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said that intensifying competition between universities now has a ""touch of the Wild West about it"". ""Universities should be careful about their claims, which need to be robust, truthful and useful. ""But it is a good thing that they are telling potential applicants more than they used to in the past."" There are dozens of different university rankings Hundreds of thousands of young people are currently deciding their options for applications for courses next autumn. The Advertising Standards Authority says universities trying to recruit students have to be able to objectively prove the claims they are making about their high status. The watchdog wants to stop unjustified claims and offer a clearer explanation of achievement in rankings and league tables. Complaints were upheld against six universities: Falmouth University has been told to stop describing itself as ""the UK's number one arts university"" or ""the UK's number one creative university"". Teesside University had a complaint upheld for saying it was the ""Top university in England for long-term graduate prospects"". University of East Anglia has been told not to use the claim ""Top 5 for student satisfaction"". University of Leicester must stop claiming to be ""a top 1% world university"". University of Strathclyde has been told to change the claim ""We're ranked No. 1 in the UK"" for physics. University of West London must stop claiming to be ""London's top modern university - and one of the top 10 in the UK"". Many of the challenges from the watchdog have been about how information from rankings or comparison tables have been presented. ""If you're making claims about your national or global ranking, student satisfaction or graduate prospects, make sure you practise what you teach... by backing up your claims with good evidence,"" said the head of the watchdog, Mr Parker. The universities involved have argued that they have put forward accurate information - but there could be greater clarification. ""We don't set out to mislead or confuse prospective students,"" said a statement from the University of Leicester. The university says its claim to be in the top 1% in the world is based on figures from several international rankings. Universities are having to compete to recruit students ""While we disagree with the Advertising Standards Authority on their assessment methodology, we will abide by their ruling,"" said the University of Leicester. Teesside also defended its claims over graduate prospects. ""We strongly believe that the marketing message was accurate, but we respect the decision of the Advertising Standards Authority ,"" said a spokesman for Teesside University. The University of West London says it has fully complied with the ruling: ""The advertising that was the subject of investigation has been removed and will not appear in our future marketing materials."" Charles Heymann, a higher education communications adviser, had been head of communications at the University of Reading when it was told to stop using the claim to be in the top 1% of world universities. ""It's a wake-up call to the whole sector. I suspect it pretty much kills off ""top 1%"" as a strapline and sends a clear message that universities need to be whiter than white in their advertising."" Mr Heymann said that rankings could ""exaggerate very marginal differences between individual universities. ""It's tempting for marketing teams to push the boundaries as far as they can go in emphasising them. At some point, most universities will be in the top 10 or 25 for something."" A spokesman for Universities UK said: ""With a proliferation of university rankings, data and awards now in existence, there is a need for clearer guidelines for universities in how they use this in a way which is clearly understood by students.""

"Indulgent grandparents may be having an adverse impact on their grandchildren's health, say researchers. The University of Glasgow study,published in PLOS One journal,external, suggests grandparents are often inclined to treat and overfeed children. The study also found some were smoking in front of their grandchildren and not giving them sufficient exercise. But Maureen Lipman, a grandmother of two, said: ""The grandparents' job is always definitely to indulge."" Children with obesity 'need NHS help' Parents 'may be overfeeding infants' The researchers looked at 56 studies with data from 18 countries, including the UK, US, China and Japan. The report focused on the potential influence of grandparents who were significant - but not primary - caregivers in a child's early years. The review considered three key areas of influence: diet and weight physical activity smoking In terms of both diet and weight, the report concluded that grandparents' behaviour had an adverse effect. Grandparents were characterised by parents as ""indulgent"" and ""misinformed"", and accused of using food as an emotional tool. Many studies found they were inclined to feed grandchildren high-sugar or high-fat foods - often in the guise of a treat. Parents felt unable to interfere because they were reliant on grandparents helping them out. The study also found that grandchildren were perceived to be getting too little exercise while under the care of their grandparents. Physical activity levels appeared to be related to whether grandparents were active themselves, or whether there was appropriate space where children could be active. Maureen Lipman likes giving her grandchildren ice cream and jelly But actress Maureen Lipman said there was a big difference between grandparents who looked after their grandchildren everyday compared to those who see them at the weekends. ""If you're seeing them once a week you're going to overindulge but if you work with them every day, you're going to treat them as your own children,"" she said. She keeps turkey dinosaurs in the freezer for her grandchildren Ava and Sacha and likes giving them ice cream with jelly. ""I try with the vegetables and fail,"" she said. ""You can't train other people's children."" ""The grandparents' job is kind of to be in cahoots with the grandchildren against the parents."" She said being a mother could be ""quite challenging"", but being a grandmother was ""just pure pleasure"". Ms Lipman said: ""It's a walking miracle that you've brought something into the world that's brought something into the world."" She's also conscious of an ""unspoken rivalry"". ""There are two sets of grandparents - and you don't want to be the one that isn't giving them the nice piece of cake."" In the study, smoking around the children, even when they had been asked not to, became an area of conflict between grandparents and parents. Conversely, in certain cases, the birth of a grandchild became a catalyst to a grandparent giving up smoking - or changing their habits. Lead researcher Dr Stephanie Chambers said: ""From the studies we looked at, it appears that parents often find it difficult to discuss the issues of passive smoking and over-treating grandchildren. ""While the results of this review are clear that behaviour such as exposure to smoking and regularly treating children increases cancer risks as children grow into adulthood, it is also clear from the evidence that these risks are unintentional. ""Given that many parents now rely on grandparents for care, the mixed messages about health that children might be getting is perhaps an important discussion that needs to be had."" According to Grandparents Plus, grandparents are ""the largest provider of informal childcare"" in the UK and they need to be ""better recognised and supported"". The charity's chief executive, Lucy Peake, said: ""Grandparents want the best for their grandchildren, and the more they're informed and enabled to play a positive role in their grandchildren's lives the better things will be. ""We know that children benefit enormously from having close relationships with their grandparents right through childhood into adolescence. ""What this study shows is that the role they're playing in children's lives needs to be better recognised and supported. ""We'd like to see more focus on ensuring that information available to parents about children's health reaches grandparents too."" Prof Linda Bauld, from Cancer Research UK, which part-funded the study, said: ""With both smoking and obesity being the two biggest preventable causes of cancer in the UK, it's important for the whole family to work together. ""If healthy habits begin early in life, it's much easier to continue them as an adult.""

"Since 2012, only Swift and Adele have sold a million copies of an album in a single week After just four days, Taylor Swift has sold more albums in the US than any other artist this year. The star's sixth album, Reputation, has sold 1.04 million copies in the US since Friday, says Billboard magazine. That puts her ahead of 2017's previous biggest-seller, Ed Sheeran's Ã·, which has shifted 919,000 copies to date. Reputation also becomes Swift's fourth album to sell a million copies in the space of a week, following 1989, Red and Speak Now. In fact, only she and Adele have sold a million copies of any album in a seven-day frame since 2012. Review: Taylor Swift's Reputation âââââ Why does Taylor Swift write so many one-note melodies? Notably, both artists withheld their records from streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music - a move which drives committed fans to buy or download the album. It has been rumoured that Reputation will be made available on those services later this week. This video can not be played First impressions of Taylor Swift's new album Reputation, which sees the star delve deeper than ever before into the realms of pop and hip-hop, has received largely positive reviews from critics. The Telegraph called it,external""a big, brash, all-guns-blazing blast of weaponised pop that grapples with the vulnerability of the human heart as it is pummelled by 21st-century fame. NPR's critic Ann Powers noted,externalthat Swift's lyrics had matured, describing the stand-out track Getaway Car as: ""A sure-footed step forward into the vagaries of grown up life."" BBC Music'sMark Savage said it was""her most sonically adventurous album yet"", while noting that moments where she lashes out at her detractors ""don't really lend themselves to big, singalong choruses"". However, the New York Times' writerJon Caramanica questioned whether Swift had diluted her appeal,externalby borrowing so heavily from other genres. ""In making her most modern album - one in which she steadily visits hostile territory and comes out largely unscathed - Ms Swift has actually delivered a brainteaser: If you're using other people's parts, can you ever really recreate your self?"" Ed Sheeran is on course to have the year's biggest-selling album in the UK Reputation is set to debut at number one in the UK, after selling 65,437 copies over the weekend. However, she is unlikely to beat Sheeran in his home territory. Divide sold 672,000 copies in its first week this March - making it the third-fastest seller in chart history, behind Adele's 25 (800,000 sales) and Oasis' Be Here Now (696,000). Sheeran's album, of course, was available on streaming services - which accounted for 12% of its sales. Earlier this week, Spotify's Troy Carter criticised Swift's decision to hold her album back, saying it would encourage piracy. ""It kind of sets the industry back a little bit,"" he said, while adding: ""Taylor is super smart. We are not mad at her for the decision she made.""

"This video can not be played Maj Gen Sibusiso Moyo read out a statement on national TV early on Wednesday The military has taken control in Zimbabwe but said President Robert Mugabe, in power since 1980, was safe. After seizing state TV, an army spokesman announced it was targeting people close to Mr Mugabe. South Africa's President JacobZuma later said he had spoken to Mr Mugabe,externalwho had indicated that he ""was confined to his home but said that he was fine"". The move may be a bid to replace Mr Mugabe with his sacked deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, BBC correspondents say. The dismissal of Mr Mnangagwa last week had left Mr Mugabe's wife Grace as the president's likely successor. Heavy gun and artillery fire could be heard in northern parts of the capital Harare early on Wednesday. A statement read out by a general on air denied it was a coup. There was no immediate word from the president himself. Latest reaction and updates The rise of Grace Mugabe Mr Mugabe, 93, has dominated the impoverished country's political scene since independence from the UK. Mr Zuma earlier said he hoped events in Zimbabwe would not lead to ""unconstitutional changes of government"". Messages appeared on a Twitter account purportedly run by the ruling Zanu-PF party saying Mr Mugabe had been detained. But there has been no confirmation by the army and it is not clear who runs the account. The UK Foreign Office advised Britons,external""currently in Harare to remain safely at home or in their accommodation until the situation becomes clearer"", while the US embassy in Harareadvised US citizens in Zimbabwe to ""shelter in place"",externaluntil further notice.

China, Zimbabwe's biggest trading partner, says it is closely watching the situation and hopes that the relevant parties can properly handle their internal affairs. Troops in armoured vehicles have been out in the streets of the capital Harare since Tuesday. After soldiers overran the headquarters of the ZBC broadcaster, Maj Gen Sibusiso Moyo went on air to say the military wished to ""assure the nation that his Excellency the president... and his family are safe and sound and their security is guaranteed"". Soldiers patrolled Harare on Wednesday ""We are only targeting criminals around him who are committing crimes... that are causing social and economic suffering in the country,"" he said. ""As soon as we have accomplished our mission, we expect that the situation will return to normalcy."" Other key points of the statement include: Citizens should remain calm and limit unnecessary movement The military assures the Zimbabwean judiciary that its independence is guaranteed Security services should ""co-operate for the good of our country"" and any provocation would ""be met with an appropriate response"" All leave for the defence forces is cancelled and personnel should return to barracks immediately It is not clear who is leading the military action. Army chief Gen Constantino Chiwenga, who visited China last week, said on Monday the army was prepared to act to end purges within Zanu-PF. By Joseph Winter, BBC News website Africa editor This is all about the leadership succession, as Mr Mugabe's powers finally falter. The people who fought in the 1970s guerrilla war against white minority rule still dominate Zimbabwe's government and especially its security forces, and they are worried about losing that power and the wealth it generates. In his statement on Monday, Gen Chiwenga warned against the ""purging, which is clearly targeting members of the party with a liberation background"". This was obviously a reference to the sacking last week of Mr Mugabe's once loyal deputy, Mr Mnangagwa, a former defence minister, spy chief and veteran of the war of independence. He and Grace Mugabe, who is four decades younger than her husband, had been seen as the main candidates to succeed Mr Mugabe. Mrs Mugabe's supporters are known as Generation 40 or G40 - a name which signals a changing of the guard in Zimbabwe, at least partially, 37 years after independence. So this military action is the old guard reasserting its authority. Mr Mugabe was the political leader of the guerrilla war so the army always professed loyalty to him until he explicitly came out in favour of his wife.

A witness told AFP news agency it could be heard near Mr Mugabe's residence in the suburb of Borrowdale early on Wednesday, Some staff at ZBC were manhandled when the soldiers moved in, sources told Reuters. A government source told Reuters news agency that Finance Minister Ignatius Chombo had been detained. He is a leading member of a faction of Zanu-PF led by Grace Mugabe. Alex Magaisa, former adviser to Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, told the BBC: ""They have decided not to call it a coup because they know that a coup does not sell, it will be condemned. General Chiwenga had warned of a military takeover ""But as far as authority is concerned it seems very clear that President Mugabe is now just a president in name and authority is now residing in the military."" Zanu-PF had accused Gen Chiwenga of ""treasonable conduct"" after he issued his warning that the army might intervene. Last month,Mrs Mugabe accused allies of Mr Mnangagwa of planning a coup. Grace Mugabe is seen as a potential successor to her elderly husband Emmerson Mnangagwa is seen here at a recent funeral The rivalry between Mrs Mugabe and Mr Mnangagwa split Zanu-PF. Gen Chiwenga is a close ally of Mr Mnangagwa and both are veterans of the 1970s war which ended white minority rule. The leader of the war veterans, Chris Mutsvangwa, welcomed the military move, telling Reuters: ""This is a correction of a state that was careening off the cliff.

"This video can not be played Maj Gen Sibusiso Moyo read out a statement on national TV early on Wednesday Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has been detained by the country's military, who have seized control of the national broadcaster, ZBC. Soldiers and army vehicles are on the streets of the capital, Harare, where gunfire and artillery were heard on Wednesday. Is it a coup? The military insists not - but it certainly has a lot of the hallmarks. The signs that a coup is under way have always been the same across the world and across the decades. Here are the key things to watch out for when a takeover is on the cards. Firstly, be aware that almost nobody mounting a coup ever says that's what they're doing. Zimbabwe's envoy to South Africa, Isaac Moyo, explicitly said there was no coupas the government was ""intact"" with no ""military takeover"". ""We are only targeting criminals around [President Mugabe] who are... causing social and economic suffering,"" Mr Moyo said on state TV. ""As soon as we have accomplished our mission, we expect that the situation will return to normalcy."" The ""situation"" probably looks more alarming to those on the wrong side of the military action, however. This kind of semantic wriggling is common in attempted coups. In restive Venezuela, which has seen violent anti-government protests since the spring, military officers launched an unsuccessful uprising against President Nicolas Maduro in August. This video can not be played Venezuela's rebel Army officers called their move ""a legitimate rebellion"" ""This is not a coup but a civil and military action to re-establish constitutional order,"" said the group's leader, Juan Caguaripano. Venezuela's ruling Socialist Party disagreed, and deputy leader Diosdado Cabello branded it a ""terrorist attack"" on Twitter. When checking for a likely coup, look at where the head of state is.President Mugabe is being held in Harare under house arrest, according to the office of South Africa's President Jacob Zuma,external. He reportedly said in a phone call that he was fine. There is no confirmation of the fate of his powerful wife,52-year-old Grace Mugabe, who has been vying to be her husband's successor. However, an MP from the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, Eddie Cross, told the BBC she had fled Zimbabwe for Namibia on Tuesday night. Detaining the target of the uprising is a vital stage in proceedings. As the BBC's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus observes, the failure of Turkey's attempted coup in July 2016 stemmed from the plotters' inability to immobilise President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The rise of Grace Mugabe A brief guide to Turkey's coup Foreign embassies can become a place of refuge for ousted or imperilled leaders. When President George Bush Senior invaded Panama in 1989, repressive strongman General Manuel Noriega holed himself up in the Vatican's embassy in Panama City. When US troops rolled into Panama, General Manuel Noriega made for the Vatican embassy And sometimes, the head of state will show up in an entirely different country.In Honduras in 2009, troops deposed President Manuel Zelaya and forced him onto a plane,external. When he arrived in Costa Rica, he said he had been kidnapped in his pyjamas. Almost three months later he made a surprise return - and installed himself in Honduras's Brazilian embassy. Waves of popular protest are a key coup signifier. Protesters will often call for a return to democracy and the fall of a repressive regime, only for the military to move in and take power. In Egypt, President Hosni Mubarak was forced out by mass protests during the Arab Spring of 2010-11, which also swept across Libya, Tunisia, Yemen and Syria. The turning point came when the Egyptian army announced that it would not use force against the demonstrating crowds. Mr Mubarak stood down, and a military administration stepped into the breach. Egyptian anti-government demonstrators shout slogans against President Hosni Mubarak at Cairo's Tahrir Square on February 10, 2011 As Turkey's failed coup unfolded in July 2016, civilians actually took to the streets in support of the threatened president. When bridges over the Bosphorus strait in Istanbul were blocked by renegade troops, the public joined pro-Erdogan soldiers to confront them. There has been a lack of public protest in Zimbabwe, where tensions were triggered by Mr Mugabe sacking his political deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, in favour of his wife, Grace. The streets are said to be calm, but armoured military vehicles are patrolling the capital. Even if not sheltering an endangered leader, embassies on the ground have a duty to keep their nationals safe, so they'll start offering guidance. In Zimbabwe, the UK Foreign Office has advised Britons ""currently in Harare to remain safely at home or in their accommodation until the situation becomes clearer"". The US embassy tweeted that it would be closed on Wednesday ""due to ongoing uncertainty"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Getting the message out is important, so rebels often try to seize state or private media to use as their mouthpiece. In Zimbabwe, the military has successfully overrun the headquarters of the state TV station, ZBC. Taking to the airwaves is no guarantee of success, however. In Turkey in 2016, the doomed army faction used a state broadcaster to claim it had seized power to protect democracy from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In fact, the revolt was suppressed. Taking over state media didn't guarantee success for the coup against Turkey's President Erdogan Zambia in 1997 saw an even less successful effort, with an attempted coup that lasted just three hours. At six o'clock one morning, a man calling himself Captain Solo announced on state radio that he had taken over the country, that the heads of the army and police were dismissed, and that President Frederick Chiluba had until nine to surrender or be killed. The president swiftly went on air to say six people had been arrested, and thanked his troops for ""a job well done"". To impose control over a country - or even just its capital city - it helps to close the borders, and seal bridges and other infrastructure that allow people in and out. In September 2015, presidential guards who led a coup in Burkina Faso ordered the sealing of land and air borders, as well as a night-time curfew. Perhaps the most striking lesson in airport control comes from Pakistan in 1999, when Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif tried to sack powerful army chief General Pervez Musharraf, and a battle for supremacy began. Gen Musharraf was in Sri Lanka when he got word that Mr Sharif planned to move against him, and made an airborne dash from Colombo airport to Karachi. Air traffic control refused permission for the plane and its 200 passengers to land, and the pilot was ordered to divert it, first to Oman, then to India. The general ordered the pilot to keep circling Karachi, even though fuel was running dangerously low. The plane was only brought down safely when pro-Musharraf soldiers surrounded the airport's control tower. The general was whisked to safety, and claimed control of Pakistan hours later.

"The struggle for independence, land and power runs throughout Zimbabwe's modern history. Veteran President Robert Mugabe dominated the country's political scene for almost four decades after independence from Britain in 1980. Once the bread basket of the region, since 2000 Zimbabwe has struggled to feed its own people due to severe droughts and the effects of a land reform programme that saw white-owned farms redistributed to landless Zimbabweans, with sharp falls in production. The fall of Robert Mugabe in 2017 freed up politics and the media, but the country remains cash-strapped and impoverished.

"Wages continue to lag behind the cost of living in the UK, while unemployment remains at a 42-year low. Workers' earnings, excluding bonuses, rose 2.2% in the three months to September compared with a year ago, theOffice for National Statistics said,external. But they fell 0.5% in real terms when accounting for inflation, marking seven months of negative pay growth. The number of jobless - people not in work but seeking a job - fell 59,000 to 1.42 million during the period. Withinflation at a five-and-a-half-year highof 3% in October, pay is failing to keep up with higher prices. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.3% - its lowest rate since 1975 - and down from 4.8% a year earlier. Minister for Employment Damian Hinds said the unemployment figures showed the ""strength of the economy"". ""A near-record number of people are now in work,"" he said. ""Everyone should be given the opportunity to find work and enjoy the stability of a regular pay packet."" At the same time, the number of people in work dropped to 32 million, down 14,000 from the last quarter, according to ONS data. Labour MP Debbie Abrahams, shadow work and pensions secretary, said the figures were further evidence of ""Tory economic failure"". She said: ""Both employment and real wages are falling while the price of household essentials balloons, leaving millions of people worse off than they were in 2010."" Matt Hughes, a senior ONS statistician, said employment had declined after two years of ""almost uninterrupted growth"", but was still higher than last year. The last time there was a bigger fall in employment was in April to June 2015, when the number of people in work dropped by 45,000, according to the ONS. The simultaneous drop in the number of workers and unemployed people is due to the rise in people who are classed as ""economically inactive"" - those not working and not seeking or available to work. This includes people studying, retirees, the long-term sick, or those looking after family, and rose by 117,000 to 8.8 million over the quarter. Mr Hughes said: ""There was a rise in the number of people who were neither working nor looking for a job - so-called economically inactive people."" SeparateONS data,externalshowed a bright spot for productivity, which increased by 0.9% in the latest three months - the strongest growth rate for six years. But this follows aprolonged period of weak productivitysince the financial crisis. By BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed: Any port in a storm, but it is sensible to put today's leap in productivity in context. After six months of negative figures (-0.5% January to March, -0.1% April to June), today's +0.9% jump in productivity is undoubtedly better news. But it would need at least two more quarters of similarly positive numbers to discern whether this is just normal quarter-by-quarter volatility or the first signs that the productivity slump might be starting to turn. The ONS measures productivity by dividing the number of hours worked by what is called Gross Value Added, the value of goods and services produced by the UK economy. It has leapt this quarter because working hours have fallen slightly and economic growth is higher. Whether we are actually producing more per hour worked - the key to wealth creation and better wages - will only become clear over the next six months. ONS head of productivity Philip Wales said: ""The medium-term picture continues to be one of productivity growing - but at a much slower rate than seen before the financial crisis."" The CBI's head of employment, Matthew Percival, thought the rise in productivity was ""encouraging"". He said: ""Businesses will be looking for the chancellor to cement progress in next week's Budget and maintain flexibility in the labour market, which remains a mainstay of the UK economy."" By BBC business correspondent Jonty Bloom: How can unemployment and the number of people in work drop at the same time? The unemployment rate is a measure of those people who want to work - and cannot - but the employment rate is a measure of everyone in work. So you could have a large number of people retiring and only some of them being replaced by unemployed people who are recruited to do their jobs. Employment will fall, and so will unemployment. In today's figures, the fall in employment seems to be concentrated amongst the 18-24 year olds, suggesting that part of the reason is that they are returning to education, although the figures are supposed to take such seasonal factors into account.

"Indulgent grandparents may be having an adverse impact on their grandchildren's health, say researchers. The University of Glasgow study,published in PLOS One journal,external, suggests grandparents are often inclined to treat and overfeed children. The study also found some were smoking in front of their grandchildren and not giving them sufficient exercise. But Maureen Lipman, a grandmother of two, said: ""The grandparents' job is always definitely to indulge."" Children with obesity 'need NHS help' Parents 'may be overfeeding infants' The researchers looked at 56 studies with data from 18 countries, including the UK, US, China and Japan. The report focused on the potential influence of grandparents who were significant - but not primary - caregivers in a child's early years. The review considered three key areas of influence: diet and weight physical activity smoking In terms of both diet and weight, the report concluded that grandparents' behaviour had an adverse effect. Grandparents were characterised by parents as ""indulgent"" and ""misinformed"", and accused of using food as an emotional tool. Many studies found they were inclined to feed grandchildren high-sugar or high-fat foods - often in the guise of a treat. Parents felt unable to interfere because they were reliant on grandparents helping them out. The study also found that grandchildren were perceived to be getting too little exercise while under the care of their grandparents. Physical activity levels appeared to be related to whether grandparents were active themselves, or whether there was appropriate space where children could be active. Maureen Lipman likes giving her grandchildren ice cream and jelly But actress Maureen Lipman said there was a big difference between grandparents who looked after their grandchildren everyday compared to those who see them at the weekends. ""If you're seeing them once a week you're going to overindulge but if you work with them every day, you're going to treat them as your own children,"" she said. She keeps turkey dinosaurs in the freezer for her grandchildren Ava and Sacha and likes giving them ice cream with jelly. ""I try with the vegetables and fail,"" she said. ""You can't train other people's children."" ""The grandparents' job is kind of to be in cahoots with the grandchildren against the parents."" She said being a mother could be ""quite challenging"", but being a grandmother was ""just pure pleasure"". Ms Lipman said: ""It's a walking miracle that you've brought something into the world that's brought something into the world."" She's also conscious of an ""unspoken rivalry"". ""There are two sets of grandparents - and you don't want to be the one that isn't giving them the nice piece of cake."" In the study, smoking around the children, even when they had been asked not to, became an area of conflict between grandparents and parents. Conversely, in certain cases, the birth of a grandchild became a catalyst to a grandparent giving up smoking - or changing their habits. Lead researcher Dr Stephanie Chambers said: ""From the studies we looked at, it appears that parents often find it difficult to discuss the issues of passive smoking and over-treating grandchildren. ""While the results of this review are clear that behaviour such as exposure to smoking and regularly treating children increases cancer risks as children grow into adulthood, it is also clear from the evidence that these risks are unintentional. ""Given that many parents now rely on grandparents for care, the mixed messages about health that children might be getting is perhaps an important discussion that needs to be had."" According to Grandparents Plus, grandparents are ""the largest provider of informal childcare"" in the UK and they need to be ""better recognised and supported"". The charity's chief executive, Lucy Peake, said: ""Grandparents want the best for their grandchildren, and the more they're informed and enabled to play a positive role in their grandchildren's lives the better things will be. ""We know that children benefit enormously from having close relationships with their grandparents right through childhood into adolescence. ""What this study shows is that the role they're playing in children's lives needs to be better recognised and supported. ""We'd like to see more focus on ensuring that information available to parents about children's health reaches grandparents too."" Prof Linda Bauld, from Cancer Research UK, which part-funded the study, said: ""With both smoking and obesity being the two biggest preventable causes of cancer in the UK, it's important for the whole family to work together. ""If healthy habits begin early in life, it's much easier to continue them as an adult.""

"Alex Rowley has been absent from Holyrood in recent weeks because of a chest infection Scottish Labour has suspended MSP Alex Rowley from the party at Holyrood amid claims about his conduct. The Fife MSP stepped aside from his roles as interim and deputy leader after allegations he had sent abusive text messages to a former partner. In a statement, Mr Rowley rejected the allegations and said he would work to clear his name. The party subsequently announced it would be removing the whip from him for the duration of the investigation. Mr Rowley referred himself to the party's investigation unit and announced he would step aside from the leadership after claims were published in The Scottish Sun. He had been absent from the Scottish Parliament for the past two weeks, with party bosses citing a chest infection. Fellow MSP Jackie Baillie, who had been filling in for him at first minister's questions, has now been appointed interim leader. After former leader Kezia Dugdale said she would have suspended Mr Rowley had she still been in charge, both leadership candidates - Anas Sarwar and Richard Leonard - said he should be suspended. Party business manager James Kelly subsequently announced that the MSP would have the whip withdrawn in the Scottish Parliament throughout the probe. In a statement Mr Rowley said: ""I totally refute these allegations and will take all steps necessary to clear my name. ""These allegations must be properly and thoroughly investigated in line with our party's procedures - and I will refer myself to the party so such an investigation can take place. ""While that investigation is carried out, I will step aside as deputy leader, as well as interim leader, of the Scottish Labour party."" Leadership candidates Richard Leonard and Anas Sarwar - in background - both called for Mr Rowley to be suspended Mr Rowley, who previously served as election agent for former prime minister Gordon Brown, has beenstanding in as the Scottish Labour leader since Ms Dugdale stood down in August. In a statement, Ms Dugdale said that had she remained in charge, she would have suspended Mr Rowley from the party while the ""serious and deeply concerning"" allegations were investigated. This was subsequently echoed by both candidates to replace her as leader. Mr Leonard said suspension would be ""appropriate"", while Mr Sarwar said there were ""clear procedures"" which meant he should be suspended ""while a robust, fair and thorough investigation is carried out"". The party then announced he would be suspended from the Labour whip in the Scottish Parliament. Mr Kelly said: ""It is important that the investigation into these allegations is fair and transparent, and the matter will be thoroughly investigated using the Labour Party's internal complaints procedure. ""However, in light of the serious nature of the allegations, Labour at Holyrood has taken the decision to remove the whip from Alex Rowley for the period of this investigation.""

"Wiggins has won five Olympic gold medals on the road and track There will be no charges over a 'mystery' medical package delivered for Sir Bradley Wiggins at the Criterium du Dauphine in 2011, says UK Anti-Doping. The ruling follows an investigation into allegations of wrongdoing at British Cycling and Team Sky. It was alleged the package contained a banned substance but the doctor involved, Dr Richard Freeman, said it was a legal decongestant - fluimucil. Ukad said it had been ""unable"" to prove the package contained Fluimucil. However, the organisation has shared information from its investigations with the General Medical Council (GMC). Five-time Olympic champion Wiggins won the Criterium du Dauphine stage race in France that year and went on to become the first Briton to win the Tour de France in 2012. The 14-month investigation has been closed and a Ukad statement said it would only ""revisit matters if new and material information were to come to light"". My life was a living hell - Wiggins Q&A: cycling inquiry & 'mystery' package Wiggins 'mystery package' doctor quits A statement on the organisation's website added: ""Put simply, due to the lack of contemporaneous evidence, Ukad has been unable to definitively confirm the contents of the package. ""The significant likelihood is that it is now impossible to do so."" Ukad chief executive Nicole Sapstead said the investigation was hindered by the ""lack of accurate medical records"" held by British Cycling. ""This is a serious concern,"" she said. ""As part of their conditions to receive public funding, all sports governing bodies must comply with the UK National Anti-Doping Policy. ""In this case the matter was further complicated by the cross over between personnel at British Cycling and Team Sky."" This video can not be played September 2016: Drugs were for medical condition' Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford was questioned by a Culture, Media and Sport Committee last December and said he had been told by then-team doctor Freeman that ""it was Fluimucil for a nebuliser"". Freeman, who was simultaneously employed by British Cycling and Team Sky between 2009 and 2015, missed the hearing through ill health but the DCMS committee was told that in 2014 he had a laptop containing medical records stolen. As part of the investigation, Ukad interviewed 37 individuals, including current and former British Cycling and Team Sky riders, medical professionals and other staff. From that, Ukad have established that: At some point during the race, a request was made by Dr Freeman for a package to be delivered to him. Coach Shane Sutton arranged for British Cycling employee Simon Cope to pick up that package and to bring it over to France. Cope said it was left for him on a desk at the British Cycling offices sealed in a Jiffy bag. There was a post-it note on the package that said ""To Simon, for Dr Richard Freeman"". Cope travelled to Manchester to pick up that package, took a flight to Geneva, hired a car and took it to the end stage of the race on 12 June and passed the sealed Jiffy bag over to Dr Freeman. When Ukad started its investigation into the 'mystery' package, Wiggins and Brailsford were already under scrutiny over the cyclist's use of a banned steroid before races was leaked by hackers Fancy Bears. Wiggins had sought therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) to use banned anti-inflammatory drug triamcinoclone for allergies and respiratory issues before the 2011 Tour de France, his 2012 Tour win and the 2013 Giro d'Italia. Wiggins, British Cycling and Team Sky have always denied any wrongdoing. The chairman of the DCMS committee - MP Damian Collins - said after December's hearing that the ""credibility of Team Sky and British Cycling is in tatters"". Brailsford has previously admitted he handled the situation ""badly"" but has consistently defended Team Sky's stance against performance-enhancing drugs, stating that the British-based team can be""trusted ""100%"". Freeman was off work from British Cycling with a stress-related illness beforeresigning earlier this year. BBC sports editor Dan Roan With no clarity over what was in the now-infamous jiffy bag delivered to Team Sky in 2011, this represents a wholly unsatisfactory end to a saga that has tainted some of the biggest reputations in British sport, and exposed Ukad's lack of power. But, while this case may not have resulted in any anti-doping charges, the lack of medical records, the inaccuracies in Team Sky's initial explanations for the mystery delivery, the unavailability of key witness Dr Richard Freeman to Ukad investigators, and the theft of his laptop, all means that suspicion will linger. And at best, the attention to detail that was once the mantra of Team Sky and British Cycling has been exposed as hollow. This video can not be played Watch: Brailsford's tense grilling on Team Sky Team Sky:""We have always maintained that there was no wrongdoing and we have co-operated fully with UK Anti-Doping over the last year. ""Since our inception as a new pro cycling team in 2010 we have continually strengthened our systems and processes so they best support our strong commitment to anti-doping."" British Cycling chief executive Julie Harrington:""Ukad's findings represent an organisation and culture that, despite delivering on the world stage, did not meet the high standards that British Cycling today holds itself to. ""We accept that the relationship between British Cycling and Team Sky developed rapidly and as a result, at times, resulted in the blurring of the boundaries between the two. This led to some failings in the way that processes and people were managed. ""Today, based on our learning together, there are clear boundaries and distinctions between our two organisations: no one is simultaneously employed by British Cycling and Team Sky; and we each have our own practices in place for managing athlete records. ""We are intent on ensuring that the integrity of our record keeping is never called into question again."" GMC spokesperson:""Ukad have made us aware of these concerns and we are looking into these. However, we are not able to comment further on this matter."" DCMS select committee chair Damian Collins MP:""The evidence that the committee has received during its inquiry points to serious and worrying structural problems within sport, both in terms of anti-doping and governance. ""The committee will be publishing its report on doping in sport shortly. This will be followed by a second report focusing on sports governance in the New Year.""

"Indulgent grandparents may be having an adverse impact on their grandchildren's health, say researchers. The University of Glasgow study,published in PLOS One journal,external, suggests grandparents are often inclined to treat and overfeed children. The study also found some were smoking in front of their grandchildren and not giving them sufficient exercise. But Maureen Lipman, a grandmother of two, said: ""The grandparents' job is always definitely to indulge."" Children with obesity 'need NHS help' Parents 'may be overfeeding infants' The researchers looked at 56 studies with data from 18 countries, including the UK, US, China and Japan. The report focused on the potential influence of grandparents who were significant - but not primary - caregivers in a child's early years. The review considered three key areas of influence: diet and weight physical activity smoking In terms of both diet and weight, the report concluded that grandparents' behaviour had an adverse effect. Grandparents were characterised by parents as ""indulgent"" and ""misinformed"", and accused of using food as an emotional tool. Many studies found they were inclined to feed grandchildren high-sugar or high-fat foods - often in the guise of a treat. Parents felt unable to interfere because they were reliant on grandparents helping them out. The study also found that grandchildren were perceived to be getting too little exercise while under the care of their grandparents. Physical activity levels appeared to be related to whether grandparents were active themselves, or whether there was appropriate space where children could be active. Maureen Lipman likes giving her grandchildren ice cream and jelly But actress Maureen Lipman said there was a big difference between grandparents who looked after their grandchildren everyday compared to those who see them at the weekends. ""If you're seeing them once a week you're going to overindulge but if you work with them every day, you're going to treat them as your own children,"" she said. She keeps turkey dinosaurs in the freezer for her grandchildren Ava and Sacha and likes giving them ice cream with jelly. ""I try with the vegetables and fail,"" she said. ""You can't train other people's children."" ""The grandparents' job is kind of to be in cahoots with the grandchildren against the parents."" She said being a mother could be ""quite challenging"", but being a grandmother was ""just pure pleasure"". Ms Lipman said: ""It's a walking miracle that you've brought something into the world that's brought something into the world."" She's also conscious of an ""unspoken rivalry"". ""There are two sets of grandparents - and you don't want to be the one that isn't giving them the nice piece of cake."" In the study, smoking around the children, even when they had been asked not to, became an area of conflict between grandparents and parents. Conversely, in certain cases, the birth of a grandchild became a catalyst to a grandparent giving up smoking - or changing their habits. Lead researcher Dr Stephanie Chambers said: ""From the studies we looked at, it appears that parents often find it difficult to discuss the issues of passive smoking and over-treating grandchildren. ""While the results of this review are clear that behaviour such as exposure to smoking and regularly treating children increases cancer risks as children grow into adulthood, it is also clear from the evidence that these risks are unintentional. ""Given that many parents now rely on grandparents for care, the mixed messages about health that children might be getting is perhaps an important discussion that needs to be had."" According to Grandparents Plus, grandparents are ""the largest provider of informal childcare"" in the UK and they need to be ""better recognised and supported"". The charity's chief executive, Lucy Peake, said: ""Grandparents want the best for their grandchildren, and the more they're informed and enabled to play a positive role in their grandchildren's lives the better things will be. ""We know that children benefit enormously from having close relationships with their grandparents right through childhood into adolescence. ""What this study shows is that the role they're playing in children's lives needs to be better recognised and supported. ""We'd like to see more focus on ensuring that information available to parents about children's health reaches grandparents too."" Prof Linda Bauld, from Cancer Research UK, which part-funded the study, said: ""With both smoking and obesity being the two biggest preventable causes of cancer in the UK, it's important for the whole family to work together. ""If healthy habits begin early in life, it's much easier to continue them as an adult.""

We are ending our live coverage of the army's seizure of power in Zimbabwe. We'll be back if there is any dramatic development. In the meantime, get the latest news from ourour website. We leave you with this photo, which captures the contradiction of the military takeover in Zimbabwe: Mr Mugabe is in office, but not in power: Shingai NyokaBBC Africa, Harare Following guns and explosions on Tuesday night, many thought it was the end for Zimbabwe's long-time leader, Robert Mugabe. But the violence has been replaced by an almost surreal normal. Mr Mugabe  has not yet reached a deal with the military about his future, and does not seem to be losing any sleep over it. For the first time since his arrest, he appeared in public today, conferring degrees on university students in the capital, Harare. Robert Mugabe conferred degrees on more than 3,000 students Sources suggest that he wants to continue as a figurehead until the ruling Zanu-PF party's national congress next month. The catalyst of this crisis, his wife, Grace Mugabe, has not been seen in public. Many suggest that she is confined to their private residence in the capital. It's her ambition to take over as vice-president that set off these events. Mr Mugabe sacked Vice-President Emmerson  Mnangagwa last week and Zanu-PF expelled him, in what was seen as a move to ease his wife's path to power. With Mr Mnangagwa being a former defence minister and a veteran of the war for independence, the military intervened, saying it was targeting ""criminals"" around the president. Read: How to spot a coup Robert Mugabe was widely respected in Africa Where do world leaders go when they're cast out of power and need to find a safe haven fast? President Robert Mugabe famously declared that he would cling to power in Zimbabwe ""until God says 'Come'"". And at the age of 93, he might have expected that hour to arrive before a human intervention. Nonetheless, following the military takeover, the leader of 37 years' standing must now barter himself a future. Even now, the military is still negotiating with Mr Mugabe about his possible resignation, but when - or if - he goes, can he expect a villa in the sun like fallen strongmen of the past? Read full story Stanley KwendaBBC Africa, Kutama To get to President Robert Mugabe's rural home, you drive
along the Robert Mugabe Highway. It is probably one of the most well-maintained roads in
Zimbabwe. It is like driving on a carpet. Along the way you are greeted by a
plaque erected in his honour. Kutama Village is home to the 93-year-old. It is a small and
tightly connected village where everyone knows each other. You cannot  really tell if they have been rattled by the
current political crisis. As we arrived, there was an air of uncertainty. Mr Mugabe
is respected here. To many, he is a father and a friend. Speaking to me at his compound, a 65-year-old neighbour
told me: He's kind, he's a good man and he understands people's plight.""  The man goes to St Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church with Mr Mugabe, a devout Christian, whenever he visits.   He never demands special treatment. He visits people to check on their welfare.""  Nevertheless, he supported the intervention by the army to remove Mr Mugabe from office, saying it is meant to correct a broken system:  If his term goes out then there's nothing wrong.""  When I approached other villagers, I attracted immediate suspicion. They were not keen to talk. But it seems to me that Mr Mugabe is seen as a hero in the village. It is easy to spot people wearing clothes emblazoned with his face. Police officers are patrolling the area around Mr Mugabe's home. You can't really peep inside the compound because of tight security. Students at the University of Zimbabwe in the capital Harare are hopeful that the country will emerge from its current political crisis stronger, and will be able to deal with its myriad economic and social problems, as BBC Focus on Africa radio heard from them: Kim ChakanetsaBBC World Service President Robert Mugabe, seen here with his wife Grace and daughter Bona, comes from the Shona ethnic group Great weight is placed on respecting your elders among the Shona, which are Zimbabwe's biggest ethnic group. It is one of the fundamental values. At a young age you are taught to greet, speak and interact with elders in a particular manner. For example, when arriving at someone's house, an exchange of greetings will be led by the younger party, who must enquire about the health of every adult present. For girls or women, this could involve kneeling and clapping, then asking each individual in turn about their health. Boys and men will do much the same, but crouching. Failing to do so is frowned upon, and taken as a sign of a poor upbringing or lack of respect. Within the household, grandparents wield considerable influence. This reverence for elders extends beyond your family. Any older woman or man is to be treated in the same way. All 10 provincial committees of Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF party have resolved to remove President Robert Mugabe from office, a UK-based representative of the party has said. The decision is expected to be endorsed by the party's top leadership body, the central committee, which will then elect the man Mr Mugabe sacked as vice-president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, as the acting leader, Nick Mangwana said. Mr Mnangagwa will then be endorsed as the next president at Zanu-PF's national congress, next month, he added in a tweet:  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Schoolchildren formed this mosaic of Robert Mugabe at Independence Day celebrations in April President Robert Mugabe's first public appearance after the military takeover in Zimbabwe will have puzzled some. Here he was at a university graduation ceremony given the authority to hand students their degrees, almost as if nothing had happened. It tells us two things. Firstly, this was political theatre. The suggestion being that behind-the-scenes negotiations over his exit deal are cordial. But it was also more than spectacle. It showed that President Mugabe's opponents want to treat the elder statesman with dignity. As in much of Africa, respecting your elders is ingrained in Zimbabwe's culture. And 93-year-old Robert Mugabe, a liberation fighter who became the country's leader at independence in 1980, is seen as the father of the nation.

First Lady Grace Mugabe wanted to be the next president A ""palace revolution"" has taken place in Zimbabwe, after a split in the ruling Zanu-PF party over who will succeed President Robert Mugabe, South African political analyst Anthoni van Nieuwkerk has said. Mr Mugabe sacked his deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, in what was seen as a move to anoint his wife, Grace, as his successor. Mr Mnangagwa, a former defence minister, vowed to fight back, leading to the current crisis. His allies were grouped in Zanu-PF faction known as Lacoste, while Mrs Mugabe's allies were G-40. Mr Van Nieuwkerk told AFP: It is a palace revolution where one section of the ruling Zanu-PF party is using elements of the military, but not all of the security services - the police for example - to bring change within the ruling party.  Grace Mugabe was trying to get rid of her opponents, who were using aspects of the military to get rid of her.  So it is a limited military intervention with political purposes. The coup is against G-40  The calculation that the military is making is 'let's treat him with dignity and respect as we search for the way forward'. That is why he made the appearance at the university.""  Stanley KwendaBBC Africa, Kutama Villager says that Robert Mugabe understands the plight of people  There is no military presence of in Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's home village of Kutama, some 90km (55 miles) from the capital, Harare. Many here are aware of the political crisis unfolding but
are reluctant to talk about it. A villager, who did not want to be named, said that people are fond of the nonagenarian president. Mr Mugabe is a good man ""who understands people's plight and likes to mingle with people in the area when he visits"", he said. However, he would not mind if the president, in power since 1980, was forced out of office, the villager added. The military has ended 36 years of loyalty to President Mugabe US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has called for a ""a quick return to civilian rule"" in Zimbabwe, following the army takeover on Wednesday, Reuters news agency reports. He described the situation as ""a concern"", adding: Zimbabwe has an opportunity to set itself on a new path, one that must include democratic elections and respect for human rights.""  Mr Tillerson made the comments to African foreign ministers in Washington, Reuters reports. The US is seeking ""a new era"" in Zimbabwe, the State Department's top official for Africa has said, Reuters news agency reports. Donald Yamamoto added: It's a transition to a new era for Zimbabwe, that's really what we're hoping for.""  Mr Mugabe was a fierce critic of Western powers Regional mediators have been mediating between Mr Mugabe and the army to end the crisis. The army says it has not staged a coup, despite the fact that Mr Mugabe is in its custody. He was allowed to attend a university graduation ceremony earlier today. The army is deployed on the streets of Zimbabwe's capital, Harare China has called for the political crisis in  Zimbabwe to be legally resolved, Reuters news agency reports. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters: China calls on all sides in Zimbabwe to keep their eyes on the country's long-term and fundamental interests, and uphold dialogue and consultations to bridge differences, to promote a peaceful and appropriate resolution to the issue under a legal framework.""  China was a key ally of Mr Mugabe, who increasingly pursued a ""Look East"" policy after Western powers condemned his controversial land seizure programme and treatment of the opposition. China gave Mr Mugabe strong backing during the 1970s war for independence, and has invested heavily in the southern African state. Last week, Zimbabwe's army chief Gen Constantino Chiwenga was on an official visit to China when Mr Mugabe fired his deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa. Gen Chiwenga is allied with Mr Mnangagwa, and put Mr Mugabe under house arrest on Wednesday.  The military detained President Robert Mugabe on Wednesday Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was not accompanied by the presidential guard when he attended a university graduation ceremony in the capital, Harare, opposition politician David Coltart has said. The MDC senator said he had been reliably informed that Mr Mugabe's convoy was made of only three a cars. By allowing him to attend the event, the army generals who put him under house arrest on Wednesday were signalling to the regional bloc, the Southern African Development Community (Sadc), that Mr Mugabe was fine - but at the same time they were ""keeping him in his place"", he said. Sadc is trying to mediate an end to the crisis. Ivory Coast's President Alassane Ouattara has added his voice to calls for President Robert Mugabe, 93, to resign, AFP news agency reports. He praised Mr Mugabe's role  in the fight against colonialism, saying he ""has been the object of respect and  even adulation from many Africans and young Africans"". However, the ""world has changed""  and  because of his age and the ""long  time he has spent in office, everyone is aware that it is time for him to hand  over his seat to a new generation"", Mr Ouattara added. President Robert Mugabe's wife, Grace, 52, harboured ambitions to succeed him Mr Khama has been a strong critic of Mr Mugabe Botswana's President Ian Khama has backed calls for Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe to step down, the Reuters news agency reports. He says that the military intervention was ""an opportunity to put Zimbabwe on a path to peace and prosperity"". He added: I don't think anyone should be president for that amount of time [37 years]. We are presidents, we are not monarchs. It's just common sense.""  Botswana is among regional countries working to find a solution to resolve the ongoing political crisis. Mr Khama is a long-standing critic of Mr Mugabe, and has previously called for him to step down. Read: Mugabe - hero or wrecker? Analysis Joseph WinterBBC News website Africa editor Zimbabwe's security chiefs have worked with Mr Mugabe since they fought together in the 1970s war of independence Although the army is obviously calling
the shots in Zimbabwe, in public they still refer to Robert Mugabe as ""his
excellency, the president"" and even ""commander-in-chief"". This is why he has been allowed to
attend the graduation ceremony. This is partly to keep up the pretence that
they have not staged a coup but they also have a genuine, deeply felt respect
for him going back more than 40 years. All of Zimbabwe's security chiefs have
worked with Mr Mugabe since they fought together in the 1970s war of
independence - and the bonds forged in that struggle are difficult to break. In many ways, Zimbabwe's military
remains the armed wing of Zanu-PF, as it was when they were all rebels fighting
white-minority rule in the then Rhodesia. Furthermore, in Zimbabwean culture, the
elderly are treated with respect and no-one wants to be seen to be treating a
93-year-old in an undignified manner, especially a man even opposition figures
refer to as the ""father of the nation"". Zimbabwe's only independent MP - Temba Mliswa - has shared a video message expressing his hope for change in the country. He calls on Zimbabweans who want ""change"" to attend a rally planned to take place tomorrow in the capital, Harare: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Australia gay vote: The moment the country said yes Australians have overwhelmingly voted in favour of legalising same-sex marriage in a historic poll. The non-binding postal vote showed 61.6% of people favour allowing same-sex couples to wed, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said. Jubilant supporters have been celebrating in public spaces, waving rainbow flags and singing and dancing. A bill to change the law was introduced into the Senate late on Wednesday. It will now be debated for amendments. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said his government would aim to pass legislation in parliament by Christmas. ""[Australians] have spoken in their millions and they have voted overwhelmingly yes for marriage equality,"" Mr Turnbull said after the result was announced. ""They voted yes for fairness, yes for commitment, yes for love."" The issue only went to a voluntary postal vote after a long and bitter debate about amending Australia's Marriage Act. Penny Wong: Tears of joy from gay Australian senator Celebs celebrate Australia gay marriage result The announcement prompted jubilant scenes across Australia The result on Wednesday brings an end to what was at times a heated campaign. The vote itself had been criticised by same-sex marriage supporters, many of whom said it was unnecessary when parliament could debate the issue directly. The survey was voluntary, unlike Australia's compulsory elections. More than 12.7 million people - about 79.5% of eligible voters - took part in the eight-week poll, which asked one question: ""Should the marriage law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?"" Was the vote worth the trouble? How the two-month debate became heated The Yes campaign argued that it was a debate about equality. The No campaign put the focus on the definition of family, raising concerns about how issues like gender will be taught in schools. This video can not be played 'Gay people are going to have the best weddings' Australia's chief statistician David Kalisch said about 7.8 million people voted in support of same-sex marriage, with approximately 4.9 million against it. He said participation was higher than 70% in 146 of Australia's 150 electorates. All but 17 electorates supported changing the law. Allow Twitter content?

Hywel Griffith, BBC News Sydney correspondent After months of divisive debate, Australia now has a result to confirm what most people here already knew - that a majority of Australians support same-sex marriage. The campaign turned ugly at times, with graffiti on walls and shouting matches at public meetings. But now both sides have to move on. For the Yes campaign that means pressing the government to stick to its pledge of passing the law. For the No campaign, it means lobbying over the wording of that legislation, and arguing for legal protection for those who continue to oppose gay marriage. While today will see parties in the streets and rainbow flags flying high, both sides know their battle is far from over. The electorates with the strongest Yes votes nationwide were the inner city areas of Melbourne and Sydney, with 84% voting in favour. Blaxland in New South Wales recorded the highest No vote at 74%.It was among several electorates in socially conservative western Sydney to return a majority No vote.,external Mr Turnbull, a strong same-sex marriage supporter, is facing debate within his government over what the parliamentary bill should include. Some conservative MPs want it to contain exemptions that would allow businesses opposed to same-sex marriage to refuse goods and services for weddings. This video can not be played 'Trapped between my culture and sexuality' Government Senator Dean Smith has introduced a private member's bill to the Senate that was co-signed by several members of other parties. It will be debated in the chamber from Thursday. Plans for a rival bill that pleased some conservatives have been scrapped, and those MPs say they will now focus on amending Mr Smith's bill. Despite divisions within his own party over the issue and that fact that hisembattled government has lost its parliamentary majority over a dual citizenship scandal, Mr Turnbull is expected to be able to get the legislation through. The Australian weddings in waiting How the killing of a gay academic changed Australia Laws target hate speech during debate ""This is an amazing outcome and we should all be very proud of this amazing country,"" Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce, a prominent same-sex marriage supporter, told a jubilant crowd in Sydney. Equality Campaign director Tiernan Brady told the BBC the result affirmed that Australia remained ""the land of the fair go"". Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, a high-profile same-sex marriage opponent, said parliament should respect the result. No campaigners have pledged to monitor the new parliamentary bill He wrote on Facebook that he would support a bill that provided ""freedom of conscience for all, not just the churches"". Another prominent No campaigner, Lyle Shelton, said: ""We will now do what we can to guard against restrictions on freedom of speech and freedom of religion, to defend parents' rights, and to protect Australian kids from being exposed to radical LGBTIQ sex and gender education in the classrooms."" The postal survey followed two failed attempts by the government to hold a compulsory national vote that was twice voted down by the Senate. Senators who opposed the compulsory vote did not necessarily oppose legalisation, but said the vote would be costly and fuel hate campaigns. They argued the matter should be put to a parliamentary vote. Many same-sex marriage advocates levelled the same criticism at the voluntary vote, which did not require legislative approval.

"Indulgent grandparents may be having an adverse impact on their grandchildren's health, say researchers. The University of Glasgow study,published in PLOS One journal,external, suggests grandparents are often inclined to treat and overfeed children. The study also found some were smoking in front of their grandchildren and not giving them sufficient exercise. But Maureen Lipman, a grandmother of two, said: ""The grandparents' job is always definitely to indulge."" Children with obesity 'need NHS help' Parents 'may be overfeeding infants' The researchers looked at 56 studies with data from 18 countries, including the UK, US, China and Japan. The report focused on the potential influence of grandparents who were significant - but not primary - caregivers in a child's early years. The review considered three key areas of influence: diet and weight physical activity smoking In terms of both diet and weight, the report concluded that grandparents' behaviour had an adverse effect. Grandparents were characterised by parents as ""indulgent"" and ""misinformed"", and accused of using food as an emotional tool. Many studies found they were inclined to feed grandchildren high-sugar or high-fat foods - often in the guise of a treat. Parents felt unable to interfere because they were reliant on grandparents helping them out. The study also found that grandchildren were perceived to be getting too little exercise while under the care of their grandparents. Physical activity levels appeared to be related to whether grandparents were active themselves, or whether there was appropriate space where children could be active. Maureen Lipman likes giving her grandchildren ice cream and jelly But actress Maureen Lipman said there was a big difference between grandparents who looked after their grandchildren everyday compared to those who see them at the weekends. ""If you're seeing them once a week you're going to overindulge but if you work with them every day, you're going to treat them as your own children,"" she said. She keeps turkey dinosaurs in the freezer for her grandchildren Ava and Sacha and likes giving them ice cream with jelly. ""I try with the vegetables and fail,"" she said. ""You can't train other people's children."" ""The grandparents' job is kind of to be in cahoots with the grandchildren against the parents."" She said being a mother could be ""quite challenging"", but being a grandmother was ""just pure pleasure"". Ms Lipman said: ""It's a walking miracle that you've brought something into the world that's brought something into the world."" She's also conscious of an ""unspoken rivalry"". ""There are two sets of grandparents - and you don't want to be the one that isn't giving them the nice piece of cake."" In the study, smoking around the children, even when they had been asked not to, became an area of conflict between grandparents and parents. Conversely, in certain cases, the birth of a grandchild became a catalyst to a grandparent giving up smoking - or changing their habits. Lead researcher Dr Stephanie Chambers said: ""From the studies we looked at, it appears that parents often find it difficult to discuss the issues of passive smoking and over-treating grandchildren. ""While the results of this review are clear that behaviour such as exposure to smoking and regularly treating children increases cancer risks as children grow into adulthood, it is also clear from the evidence that these risks are unintentional. ""Given that many parents now rely on grandparents for care, the mixed messages about health that children might be getting is perhaps an important discussion that needs to be had."" According to Grandparents Plus, grandparents are ""the largest provider of informal childcare"" in the UK and they need to be ""better recognised and supported"". The charity's chief executive, Lucy Peake, said: ""Grandparents want the best for their grandchildren, and the more they're informed and enabled to play a positive role in their grandchildren's lives the better things will be. ""We know that children benefit enormously from having close relationships with their grandparents right through childhood into adolescence. ""What this study shows is that the role they're playing in children's lives needs to be better recognised and supported. ""We'd like to see more focus on ensuring that information available to parents about children's health reaches grandparents too."" Prof Linda Bauld, from Cancer Research UK, which part-funded the study, said: ""With both smoking and obesity being the two biggest preventable causes of cancer in the UK, it's important for the whole family to work together. ""If healthy habits begin early in life, it's much easier to continue them as an adult.""

"This video can not be played In a recent documentary Benedict Allen described his experiences of living in Papua New Guinea A search has been mounted for British explorer Benedict Allen, whose family say has gone missing during an expedition to Papua New Guinea. The 57-year-old was travelling on his own to try to find the reclusive Yaifo tribe, whom he first met 30 years ago. His sister says she was expecting to hear from him by Monday - and he hasn't taken planned flights home. A helicopter pilot, who dropped Mr Allen off several weeks ago, is trying to find him, the BBC has learned. Our security correspondent Frank Gardner, who recently travelled through Papua New Guinea with Mr Allen for a BBC documentary, said he understood the pilot was tracking Benedict's route from his starting point in a remote place called Bisorio. They have spoken to local police chiefs, and were looking to locate him by helicopter and get him out, our correspondent said. He added that the former UK high commissioner to Papua New Guinea, David Gordon-Macleod, said ""huge areas of the country have no mobile coverage"", meaning that even if Mr Allen had reached a village, he is likely to still be out of contact with the outside world. Mr Allen's older sister, Katie Pestille, said it was ""out of character"" for him to miss his scheduled flight out of Papua New Guinea to Hong Kong. ""It's ghastly,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""For everybody else, it's very exciting - all the expeditions and all the things he does, but for his sister and his wife, it's more of a worry,"" she explained. First solo adventure:To the Amazon at 22, during which he was shot at by two hitmen Tough time:An initiation into manhood in Papua New Guinea. He was kept in a ""crocodile nest"" with 20 others, and repeatedly cut with bamboo blades to leave scars that looked like crocodile scales Low moment:Eating his own dog to survive Travel habit:Always keeps loo paper in a back pocket. ""You know how it is,""he tells the Lonely Planet.,external Philosophy:""For me personally, exploration isn't about conquering nature, planting flags or leaving your mark. It's about the opposite: opening yourself up and allowing the place to leave its mark on you."" Career:Six TV series for the BBC, author, motivational speaker Family:Lives with family in Czech Republic Mr Allen, from London, has previously crossed the Amazon Basin on foot and in a dug out canoe, and participated in a six-week male initiation ceremony in which crocodile marks were carved onto his body. He has filmed a number of his adventures for BBC documentaries and written books on exploration. The Foreign Office said its staff were assisting family members and were in contact with local authorities. By BBC Security Correspondent Frank Gardner Travelling in Papua New Guinea is hugely unpredictable and normal schedules don't apply, so there is a good chance that Benedict Allen has been detained by natural causes. Landslides, torrential downpours and sometimes an eruption of fighting between local tribes can all throw itineraries off-course. Foreign travellers though, are rarely targeted outside the main towns. Knowing Benedict, it is also quite possible that he has accepted an invitation to stay on longer for a tribal ceremony - it can also be considered an insult to refuse. The Yaifo tribe who Benedict visited in the 1980s initially greeted him with suspicion and hostility but then accepted him. He told me last month, just before he set off, that he had no idea how they would receive him, or even if he would be able to find them in such a remote part of the country. In a blog posted in September,external, Mr Allen described his plan to assemble a group at an abandoned mission station in Bisorio before heading into the remote jungle. His aim, he said, was to create a brief record of the lives of the Yaifo and track down some of those he met on his last visit. ""Last time, the Yaifo 'greeted' me with a terrifying show of strength, an energetic dance featuring their bows and arrows,"" he said. ""On this occasion who knows if the Yaifo will do the same, or run off, or be wearing jeans and T shirts traded eons ago from the old mission station. ""But of course I may not even make it there - even aged 26, it was a very hard hike up through rather treacherous terrain."" He said his journey out of the jungle was unplanned. ""Either I must paddle down river for a week or so - or enlist the help of the Yaifo, as I did last time,"" he said. He added that he would be travelling without a satellite phone, GPS or companion, ""because this is how I do my journeys of exploration"". In his last tweet from 11 October, Mr Allen wrote: ""Marching off to Heathrow. I may be some time."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Richard Ratcliffe told a press conference he raised the issue of diplomatic protection for his wife The Foreign Office is still considering whether it will give diplomatic protection to a British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held by Tehran since April 2016 after being accused of spying - charges she denies. Her husband raised the issue of her being given diplomatic protection in a meeting with the foreign secretary. The Foreign Office said lawyers would discuss the issue but said the question was whether it would help her case. Richard Ratcliffe met with Boris Johnson after the foreign secretary said during a Commons committee hearing that Mrs Zhagari-Ratcliffe was in Iran to ""train journalists"" - which could lead to her five-year jail term being doubled. He has since apologised for the remarks - made on 1 November - and retracted ""any suggestion she was there in a professional capacity"". Her family have always maintained she was on holiday with her daughter. Mr Ratcliffe told a press conference after the meeting that diplomatic protection - which allows a state to take diplomatic action on behalf of a national - would be ""important and helpful"". The protection would signal that the UK is treating the case as a formal, legal dispute between the UK and Iran. But he said the Foreign Office expressed reservations about whether the protection would help his wife's case. ""They have agreed to answer the questions and then for the lawyers to sit down and talk it through. Both legally and then also practically. ""But certainly, I think it is an important thing for us to be pushing for."" The Foreign Office said its lawyers would meet in the coming fortnight to discuss the issue further. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Caught in Iran power struggle Johnson 'sorry' over jailed mother remarks Medical concern for Briton held in Iran What is diplomatic protection? By James Landale, BBC News Diplomatic Correspondent When a British citizen is jailed overseas they normally get basic consular help from the local embassy, including contacting family, legal support and medical help. Conferring diplomatic protection on the citizen would ratchet up their status, so that diplomats working on the case would no longer treat it as a consular matter but a formal, legal dispute between Britain and that country, conducted under the rules of international law. The citizen's interests would be taken as those of the state. Diplomatic protection is very different from diplomatic immunity. The latter is something given to diplomats to ensure their safe passage and protection from prosecution. What is diplomatic protection? Richard Ratcliffe and Boris Johnson met at the Commonwealth office Mr Ratcliffe said he discussed with the foreign secretary the possibility of a joint trip to Iran before the end of the year. He said Mr Johnson had no fixed date for his planned visit to Iran, but the foreign secretary was ""keen"" for him to travel with him. He also spoke about the health of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who he said had found lumps in her breasts. ""She talks about being on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I absolutely believe that's true. ""I think it's important I don't exaggerate anything in the media and I'm not melodramatic, but she is in a difficult place."" Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been visiting Iran with her daughter Gabriella when she was arrested Mr Ratcliffe's MP, Tulip Siddiq, who joined him in the meeting, said he had failed to obtain a visa to visit Iran over the last 19 months and had not seen his daughter Gabriella, who is living in the country with her maternal grandparents, during that time. She said they had communicated over Skype but his daughter had lost the ability to speak English. ""So, if he gets to go with the foreign secretary, he gets to see his daughter for the first time in 19 months. And if he's there, he has the right to visit Nazanin in prison as her relative,"" she said. Ms Siddiq added that Mr Johnson had made clear he would ""certainly"" push to see Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe himself in prison if he goes to Iran. This video can not be played Mr Ratcliffe previously rejected suggestions that Boris Johnson should resign over his comments The Foreign Office said the meeting had been ""positive"". It said the British ambassador in Iran had raised the case with the country again, urging for consular access, appropriate medical treatment, a decision on Mr Ratcliffe's visa application and access for him to visit his wife if a trip takes place. ""The foreign secretary concluded the meeting by saying that no stone would be left unturned in the case of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, and that of our other dual nationals detained in Iran,"" the Foreign Office added.

"Asking a question can be enough to interrupt suicidal thoughts, says a new campaign Commuters are being urged to step in if they see vulnerable people near railway tracks, as part of a campaign to prevent suicide. Network Rail, British Transport Police (BTP) and Samaritans hope the ""Small Talk Saves Lives,external"" campaign will give travellers the confidence to intervene. BTP Chief Constable Paul Crowther said engaging someone in conversation could ""make all the difference"". In 2016/17, 273 people died in suicide incidents on the UK's railways. Ian Stevens from Network Rail, who manages the industry's suicide prevention programme, said: ""Given that nearly five million journeys are made by train every day, we are asking for passengers to work alongside our staff as the eyes and ears of the railway, helping us to keep everybody safe."" Drop in rail suicides after new Samaritans course The railway workers trained to stop suicides A survey of 5,000 people carried out by the campaign group showed 83% of passengers would approach someone who may be suicidal if they knew the signs, what to say and if they knew they would not make the situation worse. The campaign highlights warning signs, including: A person standing alone and isolated A person looking distant or withdrawn Someone staying on the platform a long time without boarding a train Someone displaying something out of the ordinary in their behaviour or appearance. And when it comes to what to say, the Samaritans said something as simple as a question could break the pattern of suicidal thoughts. Examples which have saved lives include ""It's a warm evening, isn't it?"" and ""Do you need some help?"". Asking someone what their name is or introducing yourself can also get the conversation started. After asking the initial question, many people said they felt confident to offer reassurance and support those by listening, it added. The Samaritans operate a 24-hour service available every day of the year on116 123. If you prefer to write down how you're feeling, you can email atjo@samaritans.org. Childline runs a helpline for children and young people in the UK on0800 11 11. Calls are free and the number does not show up on your phone bill.

Sarah Wilson planned to take her life on the railway, but did not go through with it after someone spoke to her. ""Someone showing that they cared about me helped to interrupt my suicidal thoughts and that gave them time to subside,"" she said. ""The more that people understand that suicide is preventable, the better. You won't make things worse, and you could save a life."" While the group was keen to emphasise there was no single sign or combination of behaviours that meant a person was suicidal, it said: ""If something doesn't feel right, the message is to act."" If a person does not feel comfortable to talk to someone at risk, the group recommends alerting a member of staff or calling the police. The Samaritans have trained 16,000 rail staff and BTP officers in suicide prevention and, as a result, for each life lost on the railway, six are saved. ""Suicide is everybody's business and any one of us could have an opportunity to save a life,"" said Ruth Sutherland, chief executive of the Samaritans.

"Stillbirth and newborn death risk could be reduced by offering more pregnant women the chance to give birth on their due date, experts believe. Currently, women who are overdue but well are often given a couple of extra weeks to see if labour will happen spontaneously before doctors intervene. New research suggests bringing forward induction to 40 weeks' gestation may be a safer option for mothers and babies. The study, inPLOS Medicine,external, included first-time mothers aged 35 and over. This is a group that generally has a higher risk of birth complications - although the absolute risk for an individual woman and her baby is still small, say experts. It is also a group that is growing in number, with 14% of first-time mothers in the UK now aged 35 and over. In 2015 in England and Wales, almost 40,000 women aged 35 or over gave birth to their first baby, according to the Office for National Statistics. Inductions are offered to avoid the risks of prolonged pregnancy, which can include stillbirth. In the UK, about one in three labours starts in this way. How accurate are 'due dates'? Baby loss: 'People sharing stories is the biggest comfort' Guidelines recommend inductions are offered to pregnant women between 41 and 42 weeks of gestation - one to two weeks after the due date. But according to the new research, one baby death might be avoided for every 526 inductions of labour if women over 35 were helped to give birth on their due date rather than a week or two after it. In the study of nearly 80,000 women in England, the rate of stillbirth or death of a baby within seven days of birth was eight per 10,000 pregnancies when induction was carried out earlier, compared with 26 per 10,000 when induction was postponed (known as ""expectant management"") to allow more time for labour to happen naturally. By their calculations, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine researchers say a change in policy to inductions at 40 weeks could potentially save about 50 babies' lives a year in the UK. if she's overdue if her waters have broken if she or her baby has a health problem It's a woman's choice whether to have her labour induced or not. Most women go into labour naturally by 42 weeks of pregnancy. But lead researcher Hannah Knight said it was too soon to recommend changing the current guidelines - more studies were needed first - although the findings could help pregnant women make informed choices about the timing of their labour. ""There appears to be evidence that bringing forward the offer of induction to 40 weeks would be beneficial. It should be something that women and doctors discuss together. ""This study represents the strongest evidence yet that moving the offer of induction forward to 40 weeks might reduce the risk of stillbirth in this specific age group, which we know face a greater risk of stillbirth and neonatal death."" Prof Lesley Regan, from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said the implications of a policy change would be enormous for both the health service and women themselves. ""Further research to determine the impact of such a change in practice is needed. ""While induction is safe and studies have shown no short-term adverse impact on mother or baby, induction of labour represents an intervention, is associated with costs to the service, and can be a more prolonged process than spontaneous labour."" A recent study in theNew England Journal of Medicine,externalfound earlier induction had no effect on the chance of needing a caesarean delivery.

"Mr Banks says there is a need to involve economic and energy advisers in talks President Trump's special adviser on climate says that the US is seeking ways of continuing to be part of international climate discussions. George David Banks said the US was considering reviving the Major Economies Meeting (MEM). The Bush-era forum allowed the US to remain in climate discussions even when outside the formal process. The leaders of France and Germany will address the talks today amid concern over slow progress in cutting carbon. The group first met in September 2007 and featured delegations from the US, China, the EU, the UK and other countries with high levels of carbon emissions. At the time the US was outside the formal UN climate negotiating process, having signed but not ratified the Kyoto Protocol, which limited the emissions of richer nations only. When President Obama came into office, the MEM became the Major Emitters Forum, which helped shape the approach of larger economies in the run up to the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009. The forum continued, in a much-reduced form until 2015. Now, President Trump's key climate change adviser thinks it might be a way forward for discussions. ""We are looking into the possibility of having a major economies meeting, it is being discussed,"" he told reporters on the sidelines of this meeting in the former German capital. ""The only way you are going to have a rational discussion about climate mitigation and policy in general is if you bring in the economic and energy advisers, you are not going to have kind of conversation as long as it dominated by environment ministries."" Warriors dressed in traditional costume at the talks Fiji, whose pavilion is shown here, is presiding over this year's climate talks Mr Banks described the annual UN led talks here as an ""echo chamber"". However, the idea of reviving the Bush-era approach to tackling climate change was given short shrift by some observers here. ""This notion of creating a new institution is just a dodge by the Trump clique because they are not on pace to reduce emissions,"" said Paul Bledsoe, from the American University in Washington and a former Clinton White House climate adviser. ""I think almost every country in the world has had enough of Donald Trump's obfuscations particularly on climate change, I don't think they are going to be fooled."" Senior ministers from dozens of countries are arriving in Bonn for the high level segment of this meeting. They will hear from UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres who will be attending his first Conference of the Parties. Mr Guterres will tell the meeting that a broader coalition is needed if the temperature targets agreed in Paris are to be met. His climate adviser told reporters that the UN was also looking to the future, and a new generation of political leaders, perhaps including a new occupant in the White House. ""By 2020 when those national decisions are being made, the group of leaders who will be making those decisions are almost entirely different to the leaders who agreed to the Paris agreement in 2015,"" Robert Orr said. ""The Secretary General is very conscious of that, we need to renew and rebuild the coalition of leaders day by day with all the new leaders."" Ministers from richer countries are likely get a cool reception at the high level segment of this meeting from developing countries. They are angry about the lack of carbon cutting action being taken by the developed world in the years before the Paris agreement comes into force in 2020. ""They are shirking their responsibilities,"" said Mohamed Adow from Christian Aid. ""They are postponing actions to post 2020 and that won't actually help deliver the kind of actions and ambitions that are needed.""

"Richard Ratcliffe told a press conference he raised the issue of diplomatic protection for his wife The Foreign Office is still considering whether it will give diplomatic protection to a British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held by Tehran since April 2016 after being accused of spying - charges she denies. Her husband raised the issue of her being given diplomatic protection in a meeting with the foreign secretary. The Foreign Office said lawyers would discuss the issue but said the question was whether it would help her case. Richard Ratcliffe met with Boris Johnson after the foreign secretary said during a Commons committee hearing that Mrs Zhagari-Ratcliffe was in Iran to ""train journalists"" - which could lead to her five-year jail term being doubled. He has since apologised for the remarks - made on 1 November - and retracted ""any suggestion she was there in a professional capacity"". Her family have always maintained she was on holiday with her daughter. Mr Ratcliffe told a press conference after the meeting that diplomatic protection - which allows a state to take diplomatic action on behalf of a national - would be ""important and helpful"". The protection would signal that the UK is treating the case as a formal, legal dispute between the UK and Iran. But he said the Foreign Office expressed reservations about whether the protection would help his wife's case. ""They have agreed to answer the questions and then for the lawyers to sit down and talk it through. Both legally and then also practically. ""But certainly, I think it is an important thing for us to be pushing for."" The Foreign Office said its lawyers would meet in the coming fortnight to discuss the issue further. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Caught in Iran power struggle Johnson 'sorry' over jailed mother remarks Medical concern for Briton held in Iran What is diplomatic protection? By James Landale, BBC News Diplomatic Correspondent When a British citizen is jailed overseas they normally get basic consular help from the local embassy, including contacting family, legal support and medical help. Conferring diplomatic protection on the citizen would ratchet up their status, so that diplomats working on the case would no longer treat it as a consular matter but a formal, legal dispute between Britain and that country, conducted under the rules of international law. The citizen's interests would be taken as those of the state. Diplomatic protection is very different from diplomatic immunity. The latter is something given to diplomats to ensure their safe passage and protection from prosecution. What is diplomatic protection? Richard Ratcliffe and Boris Johnson met at the Commonwealth office Mr Ratcliffe said he discussed with the foreign secretary the possibility of a joint trip to Iran before the end of the year. He said Mr Johnson had no fixed date for his planned visit to Iran, but the foreign secretary was ""keen"" for him to travel with him. He also spoke about the health of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who he said had found lumps in her breasts. ""She talks about being on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I absolutely believe that's true. ""I think it's important I don't exaggerate anything in the media and I'm not melodramatic, but she is in a difficult place."" Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been visiting Iran with her daughter Gabriella when she was arrested Mr Ratcliffe's MP, Tulip Siddiq, who joined him in the meeting, said he had failed to obtain a visa to visit Iran over the last 19 months and had not seen his daughter Gabriella, who is living in the country with her maternal grandparents, during that time. She said they had communicated over Skype but his daughter had lost the ability to speak English. ""So, if he gets to go with the foreign secretary, he gets to see his daughter for the first time in 19 months. And if he's there, he has the right to visit Nazanin in prison as her relative,"" she said. Ms Siddiq added that Mr Johnson had made clear he would ""certainly"" push to see Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe himself in prison if he goes to Iran. This video can not be played Mr Ratcliffe previously rejected suggestions that Boris Johnson should resign over his comments The Foreign Office said the meeting had been ""positive"". It said the British ambassador in Iran had raised the case with the country again, urging for consular access, appropriate medical treatment, a decision on Mr Ratcliffe's visa application and access for him to visit his wife if a trip takes place. ""The foreign secretary concluded the meeting by saying that no stone would be left unturned in the case of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, and that of our other dual nationals detained in Iran,"" the Foreign Office added.

"The UK Supreme Court has ruled that Scotland can set a minimum price for alcohol, rejecting a challenge by the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA). Legislation was approved by the Scottish Parliament five years ago but has been tied up in court challenges. In a unanimous judgment, seven Supreme Court judges said the legislation did not breach European Union law. The judges ruled the measure was a ""proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim"". Ministers said a 50p-per-unit minimum would help tackle Scotland's ""unhealthy relationship with drink"" by raising the price of cheap, high-strength alcohol. The whisky association had claimed the move was a ""restriction on trade"" and there were more effective ways of tackling alcohol misuse. After the Supreme Court verdict, ministers are expected to make Scotland the first country in the world to establish a minimum price per unit of alcohol, possibly early next year. A small number of countries, including Canada and Russia, have some form of minimum price structure, according to the Institute for Alcohol Studies. Many others have rules aimed at restricting cheap alcohol sales. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ""Absolutely delighted that minimum pricing has been upheld by the Supreme Court. ""This has been a long road - and no doubt the policy will continue to have its critics - but it is a bold and necessary move to improve public health."" The Scotch Whisky Association said it accepted the Supreme Court's ruling. The Scottish government believes cracking down on cheap alcohol will help tackle the country's binge-drinking culture The Scottish government's aim is to reduce the amount that problem drinkers consume simply by raising the price of the strongest, cheapest alcohol. The move is not a tax or duty increase. It is a price hike for the cheapest drink, with any extra cash going to the retailer. Last year, Alcohol Focus Scotland claimed the maximum recommended weekly intake of alcohol (14 units) could be bought for just Â£2.52. It said super-strength cider and own-brand vodka and whisky could be purchased for as little as 18p per unit of alcohol. The 50p-per-unit minimum outlined by the legislation would raise the price of the cheapest bottle of red wine (9.4 units of alcohol) to Â£4.69, a four-pack of 500ml cans of 4% lager (8 units) would cost at least Â£4 and a 70cl bottle of whisky (28 units of alcohol) could not be sold for less than Â£14. Normal strength cider (5% ABV) would cost at least Â£2.50 a litre but a super-strength version (7.5% ABV) would have to cost a minimum of Â£3.75 for a litre. Minimum pricing will not raise the prices of all alcoholic drinks because many are already above the threshold. Pubs and bars are unlikely to be affected as they usually charge much more than 50p per unit. The aim is to hit consumption of strong alcohol which is sold at low prices. The new laws would be ""experimental"" and expire after six years unless renewed. Supporters of minimum pricing,externalbelieve the move is necessary to tackle the country's binge drinking culture, withScots buying 20% more alcohol on averagethan people in England or Wales. The judges delivered their ruling at the Supreme Court in London The judges at the Supreme Court rejected the Scotch Whisky Association's claim that an excise duty or tax would be an equally effective way of achieving the government's objectives. Their judgment said minimum pricing targeted ""the health hazards of cheap alcohol and the groups most affected in a way that an increase in excise or VAT does not"". The judges said a tax would increase prices ""across the board"" and not just the cheap, strong alcohol which is the focus of the legislation. They also agreed that minimum pricing was ""easier to understand and simpler to enforce"". Minimum pricing would not allow retailers to ""absorb"" the cost in the way a duty rise would, they said. The Scottish government said it would move as quickly as possible to implement the legislation Scotland's health minister Shona Robison said: ""This is a historic and far-reaching judgment and a landmark moment in our ambition to turn around Scotland's troubled relationship with alcohol. ""In a ruling of global significance, the UK Supreme Court has unanimously backed our pioneering and life-saving alcohol pricing policy."" Scotch Whisky Association chief executive Karen Betts said: ""We will now look to the Scottish and UK governments to support the industry against the negative effects of trade barriers being raised in overseas markets that discriminate against Scotch Whisky as a consequence of minimum pricing, and to argue for fair competition on our behalf."" Scottish Conservative health spokesman Miles Briggs said the Scottish government would have his party's support on implementing the legislation. He said: ""We look forward to seeing whether or not minimum pricing can make any impact on Scotland's complex and damaging relationship with alcohol."" Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, said the decision was a ""massive victory for Scotland's health"". She said: ""Minimum unit pricing is effective because it targets the kind of drinking most likely to lead to the greatest harm. ""The price of a pint in the pub won't change but the price of strong white ciders and own brand spirits that are mainly bought by dependent drinkers will rise markedly."" Dr Peter Bennie, chairman of the British Medical Association Scotland, said: ""As doctors we see every day the severe harms caused by alcohol misuse and the damage it causes to individuals and their families. ""There are no easy solutions, but minimum unit pricing can make a significant contribution to reducing these harms and saving lives."" Cancer Research UK's cancer prevention expert Linda Bauld said: ""Alcohol is linked to seven types of cancer including breast and bowel cancer, and the more you drink the greater your risk of cancer. ""It's a shame expensive legal action has delayed this welcome measure."" Canada is one of the very few countries to have brought in a form of minimum pricing for alcohol, where it's known as a ""Social Reference Price"". Each of Canada's 10 provinces is able set the lowest price per litre that alcoholic drinks can be sold for in shops. Canadian academic studies suggest that the policy has successfully reduced alcohol consumption. According toresearch by Tim Stockwell at the University of Victoria's Centre for Addictions Research of British Columbia,,externala 10% increase in average minimum prices in one province led to an 8% decrease in alcohol consumption per person. The price rise was also associated with a 9% decrease in patients being hospitalised for alcohol related diseases. But other factors could also be contributing, such as the ageing population.Older Canadians tend to drink less,external, which might also explain the fall in consumption. It is also difficult to draw a direct comparison between Canada and Scotland. In Canada the extra revenue generated by the minimum pricing goes to the government rather than the retailers. This means retailers in Scotland may have an extra incentive to increase sales because they will profit directly. The Supreme Court ruling was the final stage of a five-year legal battle, with the cases already passing through courts in Edinburgh and Luxembourg. After an initial challenge at the Court of Session failed in 2013, the SWA appealed to the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The European court said the legislation might break EU law if other tax options would prove as effective, but said it was ""ultimately for the national court to determine"" whether they did. The Scottish court subsequently backed the measures for a second time, ruling that tax measures ""would be less effective than minimum pricing"". However, in December 2016 the Court of Session judges then allowed the SWA to go to the Supreme Court to challenge their ruling. May 2012:MSPs pass Scots booze price plan May 2013:Minimum drink price challenge fails December 2015:Minimum drink price 'may breach EU law' October 2016:Courts back minimum alcohol price December 2016:Whisky firms allowed minimum price appeal July 2017:Supreme Court judges retire to consider minimum pricing appeal The legislation to bring in a minimum price of 50p per unit was passed by the Scottish Parliament in May 2012 The UK government supported the devolved Scottish administration during the legal process, arguing that minimum pricing was compatible with EU law. In 2012, then Prime Minister David Cameronpledged to introduce minimum pricing- but the plan was shelved a year later in the face of fierce opposition from the drinks industry. The Home Office has said the policy remains under review and calls for its reintroduction in England are likely to be reignited when it is implemented in Scotland. Legislation to establish a minimum price is currently under active consideration by the National Assembly for Wales. In Northern Ireland, former Health Minister Jim Wells had been seeking to introduce minimum pricing before resigning in April 2015.

"Children's Centres are among the services to be cut Children facing abuse and neglect in England increasingly get help from local councils only when their problems reach a crisis, say leading charities. Services which intervene early to help families in difficulties are bearing the brunt of cuts, says their report. Relying on crisis intervention incurs a ""devastating cost"" both socially and financially, they add. The government says that providing help as early as possible is the best way to keep children safe. But the analysis by the Children's Society, Action for Children and the National Children's Bureau finds that councils are slashing preventative services ""under the pressure of Â£2.4bn of central government funding cuts"". Specifically, it says, central government funding for early intervention has fallen by Â£1.7bn since 2010. The report, Turning the Tide, finds: 40% cuts to services designed to spot early signs of neglect and abuse in the five years to 2016 cuts in the poorest areas are six times worse than in the richest Children's Centres, youth centres, teenage pregnancy advice and family support have all faced cuts Over the same period, the number of child protection investigations has more than doubled, with spending on crisis support up 7%, at Â£6.1bn, says the report. Matthew Reed, chief executive of the Children's Society, called the cuts ""nothing short of devastating"". ""Services that could intervene early to stop problems escalating have been the hardest hit. ""All too often central government shrugs off responsibility for council spending decisions but the figures are stark and undeniable. ""Councils are being denied the funding they need to provide safe, effective children's services and spending on vital support is collapsing as a result. ""We are at a tipping point with more cuts yet to come. The government must step up and give councils the funds they need to protect our children."" Sir Tony Hawkhead, chief executive of Action for Children, said council children's services were reduced to ""a crisis fire-fighting model"". While Anna Feuchtwang, chief executive of the National Children's Bureau, asked: ""Do we really want a system that can only help children and young people at immediate risk of harm, but can't step in to help families before problems deteriorate?"" The report urges central government to address the funding gap as a matter or urgency, working with local authorities to ensure additional funds go to early intervention services. The Local Government Association which represents councils in England warned of a further Â£2bn in central government funding cuts over the next three years. Richard Watts, chairman of the LGA's Children and Young People Board, said councils were ""working hard"" to minimise the impact of cuts, with savings including reductions to ""other valuable services such as parks, libraries and street lighting"". ""Last year saw the biggest annual increase in children in care since 2010 and councils simply cannot continue to provide the level of support that these children and young people need without urgent action to provide the funding necessary to do so,"" said Mr Watts. He urged the government to use the forthcoming budget ""to commit to fully funding children's services"". Anne Longfield, children's commissioner for England, said the government should earmark funding to enable councils ""to help children earlier when problems first start, rather than waiting until children are in crisis"". A government spokeswoman said more than Â£200bn had been made available to councils for local services, including children's services, up to 2019-20. ""Councils have a duty to provide appropriate care for the children in their area, including responding to referrals. We are supporting them to deliver efficient services by investing Â£200m in the Children's Social Care Innovation Programme - this includes projects providing targeted support for children in need.""

"The assessment was carried out by by HM Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) in June Two-thirds of women held at an immigration removal centre are later released into the community, a watchdog report has revealed. Inspectors said the finding raised concerns about whether the women should have been detained at Yarl's Wood, Bedfordshire, in the first place. The assessment was carried out by by HM Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) in June. The Home Office said: ""Detention and removal are essential parts of effective immigration controls."" A report on the inspection in June found during the previous six months, excluding men, 542 (21%) detainees had been removed from the centre, 295 (12%) had been transferred to other places of detention and 1,721 (67%) had been released. Inspectors said the high percentage of women released ""raised questions about the justification for detention in the first place"". The 2017 inspection found there had been ""significant improvements"" at the centre, which is operated by Serco Fewer detainees than at the previous inspection were being held for long periods, the watchdog noted. None had been held for over a year, although 14 had been held for between six and 12 months. The inspectorate also said the handling of cases by the Home Office was a ""principal area of concern"". It found that delays and uncertainty in the outcome of immigration casework were still a cause of frustration and anxiety for detainees. However, the report said there had been ""significant improvements"" at the centre, which is operated by Serco. A Home Office spokeswoman said it took ""the welfare of our detainees very seriously"" and action was being taken to address the report's recommendations. Serco, which is not responsible for determining policy on immigration detention or individual decisions regarding the length of detention, welcomed the recognition of progress made since the last inspection. The facility near Bedford houses adult women and family groups, as well as a small number of men who arrived in Britain as ""clandestine migrants"" on freight lorries.

"This video can not be played Maj Gen Sibusiso Moyo read out a statement on national TV early on Wednesday The military has taken control in Zimbabwe but said President Robert Mugabe, in power since 1980, was safe. After seizing state TV, an army spokesman announced it was targeting people close to Mr Mugabe. South Africa's President JacobZuma later said he had spoken to Mr Mugabe,externalwho had indicated that he ""was confined to his home but said that he was fine"". The move may be a bid to replace Mr Mugabe with his sacked deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, BBC correspondents say. The dismissal of Mr Mnangagwa last week had left Mr Mugabe's wife Grace as the president's likely successor. Heavy gun and artillery fire could be heard in northern parts of the capital Harare early on Wednesday. A statement read out by a general on air denied it was a coup. There was no immediate word from the president himself. Latest reaction and updates The rise of Grace Mugabe Mr Mugabe, 93, has dominated the impoverished country's political scene since independence from the UK. Mr Zuma earlier said he hoped events in Zimbabwe would not lead to ""unconstitutional changes of government"". Messages appeared on a Twitter account purportedly run by the ruling Zanu-PF party saying Mr Mugabe had been detained. But there has been no confirmation by the army and it is not clear who runs the account. The UK Foreign Office advised Britons,external""currently in Harare to remain safely at home or in their accommodation until the situation becomes clearer"", while the US embassy in Harareadvised US citizens in Zimbabwe to ""shelter in place"",externaluntil further notice.

China, Zimbabwe's biggest trading partner, says it is closely watching the situation and hopes that the relevant parties can properly handle their internal affairs. Troops in armoured vehicles have been out in the streets of the capital Harare since Tuesday. After soldiers overran the headquarters of the ZBC broadcaster, Maj Gen Sibusiso Moyo went on air to say the military wished to ""assure the nation that his Excellency the president... and his family are safe and sound and their security is guaranteed"". Soldiers patrolled Harare on Wednesday ""We are only targeting criminals around him who are committing crimes... that are causing social and economic suffering in the country,"" he said. ""As soon as we have accomplished our mission, we expect that the situation will return to normalcy."" Other key points of the statement include: Citizens should remain calm and limit unnecessary movement The military assures the Zimbabwean judiciary that its independence is guaranteed Security services should ""co-operate for the good of our country"" and any provocation would ""be met with an appropriate response"" All leave for the defence forces is cancelled and personnel should return to barracks immediately It is not clear who is leading the military action. Army chief Gen Constantino Chiwenga, who visited China last week, said on Monday the army was prepared to act to end purges within Zanu-PF. By Joseph Winter, BBC News website Africa editor This is all about the leadership succession, as Mr Mugabe's powers finally falter. The people who fought in the 1970s guerrilla war against white minority rule still dominate Zimbabwe's government and especially its security forces, and they are worried about losing that power and the wealth it generates. In his statement on Monday, Gen Chiwenga warned against the ""purging, which is clearly targeting members of the party with a liberation background"". This was obviously a reference to the sacking last week of Mr Mugabe's once loyal deputy, Mr Mnangagwa, a former defence minister, spy chief and veteran of the war of independence. He and Grace Mugabe, who is four decades younger than her husband, had been seen as the main candidates to succeed Mr Mugabe. Mrs Mugabe's supporters are known as Generation 40 or G40 - a name which signals a changing of the guard in Zimbabwe, at least partially, 37 years after independence. So this military action is the old guard reasserting its authority. Mr Mugabe was the political leader of the guerrilla war so the army always professed loyalty to him until he explicitly came out in favour of his wife.

A witness told AFP news agency it could be heard near Mr Mugabe's residence in the suburb of Borrowdale early on Wednesday, Some staff at ZBC were manhandled when the soldiers moved in, sources told Reuters. A government source told Reuters news agency that Finance Minister Ignatius Chombo had been detained. He is a leading member of a faction of Zanu-PF led by Grace Mugabe. Alex Magaisa, former adviser to Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, told the BBC: ""They have decided not to call it a coup because they know that a coup does not sell, it will be condemned. General Chiwenga had warned of a military takeover ""But as far as authority is concerned it seems very clear that President Mugabe is now just a president in name and authority is now residing in the military."" Zanu-PF had accused Gen Chiwenga of ""treasonable conduct"" after he issued his warning that the army might intervene. Last month,Mrs Mugabe accused allies of Mr Mnangagwa of planning a coup. Grace Mugabe is seen as a potential successor to her elderly husband Emmerson Mnangagwa is seen here at a recent funeral The rivalry between Mrs Mugabe and Mr Mnangagwa split Zanu-PF. Gen Chiwenga is a close ally of Mr Mnangagwa and both are veterans of the 1970s war which ended white minority rule. The leader of the war veterans, Chris Mutsvangwa, welcomed the military move, telling Reuters: ""This is a correction of a state that was careening off the cliff. ""It's the end of a very painful and sad chapter in the history of a young nation, in which a dictator, as he became old, surrendered his court to a gang of thieves around his wife.""

She says: ""It took a week to remember many years ago I was subject to a minor act of inappropriate behaviour in the House. ""I realised I hadn't put it out of my consciousness because it was trivial, but because I was so shocked I buried it. That's what our minds do. ""We need to recognise the way people act when they've been subject to something so shocking is not what we might expect."" House of CommonsParliament That's it from the Commons for this week.

Committee motions House of CommonsParliament The House is now considering a motion to appoint MPs to the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament (ISC). Labour MP Ben Bradshaw says he hopes the committee will investigate ""Russian interference in the UK"" and also ""dark money and the use of think tanks"" in political campaigns. His Labour colleague Liam Byrne says there is ""a rapidly emerging 21st Century propaganda operation"", which includes ""fabricating division and discord"" through social media. Deputy leader of the House Michael Ellis echoes the words of his colleague Andrea Leadsom earlier, saying the government has not seen evidence of successful interference in an election or referendum. Older people's human rights debate House of LordsParliament Health Minister Lord O'Shaughnessy winds up this debate for the government, describing meeting the needs of an ageing population as ""one of our most profound challenges"". He says it's a challenge the government recognises and is committed to tackling, before reminding peers of the Green Paper on social reform which the government has been announced will be published by summer next year. The paper will look at social care, wider networks of support and housing, he specifies, and an inter-ministerial working group has been set up to look at policy implications.

""I allowed my irritation to get the better of me and I approached the opposition front bench,"" he says. Defence aerospace industrial strategy debate House of CommonsParliament Defence Minister Harriett Baldwin says the speeches by MPs in this debate show there is ""not a corner of our great country that is untouched"" by the defence aerospace industry. She says the UK is exporting to Bahrain, Belgium and Qatar and is developing further export markets. Perhaps unable to resist a pun, Ms Baldwin says she hopes the industry will ""fly further, faster and higher in the future"" Ruth Smeeth, closing the debate, says she didn't hear a commitment to produce a defence aerospace industrial strategy and hopes that the minister will return to House in future to make such an announcement.

Defence aerospace industrial strategy debate House of CommonsParliament The Red Arrows are known worldwide for their displays of precision aerobatics Shadow defence minister Wayne David asks what the government is doing to promote the Hawk training aircraft abroad - ""the aircraft of the iconic Red Arrows"". He says the UK is buying too many products ""off the shelf"" from the US and accuses the government of ""short-termism"". Defence aerospace industrial strategy debate House of CommonsParliament SNP armed forces spokeswoman Carol Monaghan says a defence aerospace industrial strategy debate must not just be about procurement but also about ""a skilled workforce for the future"". She refers to warnings of ""an extraordinary increase"" in incursions by Russian submarines into Scottish waters - and says that, at present, the UK is not always able to track them. Defence aerospace industrial strategy debate House of CommonsParliament The call for a defence aerospace industrial strategy gains support on both sides of the House. Conservative Jack Lopresti says ""we must not be forced to rely entirely on expertise from abroad"". Labour's Vernon Coaker says the debate is taking place in a time of ""a great deal of uncertainty around the whole of equipment budget"" in UK defence spending. He thinks the aerospace industry ""is particularly vulnerable to this"". The signals are that the UK has to promise more cash for the EU to agree to begin trade talks.

Defence aerospace industrial strategy debate House of CommonsParliament An RAF Typhoon aircraft The next backbench debate concerns a defence aerospace industrial strategy. The government has not produced a standalone strategy but Labour MP Ruth Smeeth, opening the debate, says one is needed. The defence aerospace industry boosts the UK economy and has been key to ""maintaining our country's aerial supremacy for generations"", she argues. The UK has produced the Harrier, the Tornado and the Typhoon and is ""a global leader in the manufacture of combat aircraft"", Ms Smeeth adds. Older people's human rights debate House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Foulkes of Cumnock, who is chair of Age Scotland, opens his debate on older people's human rights. He says even though these rights have been recognised by international bodies including the UN, ""little or nothing is done about it"". He highlights the need for older people to have an adequate income, high-quality housing and domicilary care. He says most care is still carried out by family members, and there must be more care home provision with properly trained staff. He also calls for a charter of rights for older people. Universal credit debate House of CommonsParliament Frank Field, who opened the debate, closes it by saying that everyone in the House ""has called on the government to move"". After MPs agree the motion without a vote, Mr Field observes that this motion says the government should ""reduce the standard initial wait for a first Universal Credit payment to one month"". He urges ministers to respond. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9995043
