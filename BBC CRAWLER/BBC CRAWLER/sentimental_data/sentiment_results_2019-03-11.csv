"Passengers were waiting outside the door of the airport's departure terminal on Monday morning Belfast International Airport has been heavily criticised over long delays which saw passengers queuing outside the airport in freezing conditions. The Consumer Council said customers were ""frustrated"" by the length of time it was taking to get through security. Last month,the airport said it was expanding its security area from six to eight search lanes. But on Sunday the airport said it would have to reduce the number of lanes to carry out expansion work. This video can not be played Graham Keddie said things would improve after delays on Monday caused dozens of passengers to miss flights. Travellers have taken to social media to complain about security lines stretching outside the terminal. Graham Keddie, managing director of Belfast International Airport, asked customers for ""more forbearance"", adding that work on the lanes would be finished before Easter. Some 70 people missed their flights on Monday, Mr Keddie told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A spokesperson for the airport's security provider, Wilson James, said: ""We support Belfast International Airport in its aim of improving the passenger journey through the security screening area of the airport and we share the airport's feelings of this morning's queues which proved challenging whilst operating five out of six the lanes during ongoing building work. ""The sixth lane will be back in operation this week followed by the additional two lanes in time for Easter."" Wilson James reiterated the airport's statement that passengers should arrive at least two hours before their flight time. This video can not be played Long delays for Belfast International Airport passengers Bernie Brown from Ballymena, who is one of those affected by the situation at Belfast International, said she was still in a long queue to get through security more than an hour after arriving at the airport. ""People are frustrated,"" she told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme. Ms Brown, who was travelling from Belfast International Airport to Edinburgh, later said: ""I caught my flight, but 36 people did not according to the cabin crew."" Belfast International said the airport was expanding its security area from six to eight search lanes ""We're all concerned about missing our flights, but there are no airport staff around to assure people about what has been happening."" Low-cost airline easyJet said the airline is opening its bag drop earlier when necessary. In a statement to BBC News NI, a spokesperson said that the airline is aware that security queues are longer than usual in Belfast International. ""Security at Belfast is managed by the airport and although this is outside of our control, we would like to apologise to any affected passengers for any inconvenience. ""We would like to reassure passengers that we will continue to work with the airport to minimise any disruption."" With passengers being forced to queue outside Belfast International Airport, BBC News NI's weather presenter Angie Philips said that while the temperature would have been around 2C this morning, with the wind chill it would have felt more like -2C.

He added: ""Since May 2018, we have been in discussions with BIA and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) about these issues."" He said the council recognises that the airport has recruited a new security company and are working to install new security lanes. ""However, passengers still remain frustrated with the queues and the length of time it takes to get through security,"" Mr Williams added. The Consumer Council said it was keen in general to hear about passengers' experiences at the airport over the last six to 12 months.

"A DoH pay rise has resulted in 787 workers taking home less money Hundreds of nurses have had to pay money back to the NHS despite receiving a pay rise. The Department of Health (DoH) implemented a pay award for Health and Social Care (HSC) employees last month. But the pay rise has resulted in 787 workers - 1.1% of HSC staff - taking home less money as it put them in a higher pension bracket. The DoH said there had been ""significant communication"" with staff and trade unions on the issue. ""It's grossly unfair. We didn't fight this long for a pay rise to end up being out of pocket,"" a nurse told BBC News NI. ""It makes you feel so undervalued, like nobody really cares at all. ""The pressure on staff is in the health care system in Northern Ireland is ridiculous at the minute yet here we are with even less money at the end of the month."" One nurse told BBC News NI that their ""work-life balance has hit an all-time low"" The nurse faces a salary deduction of Â£240 this month. ""I worked all over Christmas, hardly saw my family or friends, and I work long hours, trying to do my job the best I can for the patients and now I'm hit with a bill for Â£240 to be taken from my salary this month. How is that fair?"" ""It's hard enough to attract people to nursing because of how much pressure staff are under and this could well push good nurses away completely."" Rita Devlin, acting deputy director of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in Northern Ireland, said the pay deal was not agreed by the trade union. She said the RCN's concerns had been raised with the Department of Health. ""We already have a high vacancy rate in Northern Ireland with nearly 2,000 posts in the HSC alone unfilled,"" Ms Devlin told BBC News NI. ""We can ill afford to lose any more of our highly trained nurses. We would urge the DoH to ensure that we are not in the same position this time next year."" A spokesperson for the DoH said: ""There was significant communication directly with staff and with trade unions on this issue. ""Mitigation arrangements have been made available for any staff member whose backdated pay increase does not cover backdated pension contribution arrears. Any such deficit can be paid through wage deductions over a period of up to 12 months."" The department states that there are seven different contribution rates, based on seven earnings brackets, meaning that ""the more a staff member earns, the higher their contribution rate may be"".

"Wonder Woman star Gal Gadot has become embroiled in a row with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the status of the country's Arab minority. ""Love your neighbour as yourself,"" the Israeli actress said, amid wrangling over the role of Israeli Arab parties in upcoming polls. Mr Netanyahu caused a stir when he said Israel ""was not a state of all its citizens"", referring to Arabs who make up 20% of its population. He cited a ""nation-state"" law. The legislation sparked controversy last year. Arab MPs reacted furiously in July when Israel's parliament approved the legislation, which says Jews have a unique right to national self-determination in the country and puts Hebrew above Arabic as the official language. The spat began on Saturday, when Israeli actress and TV presenter Rotem Sela challenged comments made by Culture Minister Miri Regev in a TV interview about the role of Arab parties in the 9 April general election. Ms Regev repeated a warning by her and Mr Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party that voters should not choose its main rivals because they might form a governing coalition that included Arab MPs. ""What is the problem with the Arabs?"" Sela questioned in an Instagram story. ""When the hell will someone in this government convey to the public that Israel is a state of all its citizens and that all people were created equal, and that even the Arabs and the Druze and the LGBTs and - shock - the leftists are human."" On Sunday, Mr Netanyahu responded with an Instagram post of his own that referred to the ""nation-state"" law. ""Dear Rotem,"" he wrote. ""Israel is not a state of all its citizens. According to the basic nationality law we passed, Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people - and only it."" ""As you wrote, there is no problem with the Arab citizens of Israel. They have equal rights like all of us and the Likud government has invested more in the Arab sector than any other government,"" he added. According to AFP news agency, Mr Netanyahu later brought up the issue at a cabinet meeting. He called Israel a ""Jewish, democratic state"" with equal rights, but the ""nation state not of all its citizens but only of the Jewish people"". The Wonder Woman star defended the comments posted by Sela, who is reported to be a close friend. ""This isn't a matter of right or left. Jew or Arab. Secular or religious,"" she told her 28.3m followers on Instagram. ""It's a matter of dialogue, of dialogue for peace and equality and of our tolerance of one towards the other."" President Reuven Rivlin also appeared to get involved in the debate on Monday. Without mentioning any names, Mr Rivlin condemned what he said were recent ""entirely unacceptable remarks about the Arab citizens of Israel"". Arab MPs also praised Sela's comments,external, the Times of Israel reports, including Ayman Odeh who said: ""Rotem Sela, we don't know each other but bravo."" Mr Netanyahu's critics say comments like those made by Ms Regev are part of a bid to court right-wing voters. Likud is facing a serious challenge to its re-election hopes with a rival centrist Blue and White alliance, led by ex-military chief Benny Gantz and ex-Finance Minister Yair Lapid, ahead in the polls. The prime minister has also come under increased pressure since the attorney general announced last month his intention to file corruption charges against him, pending a final hearing that will take place after the election. How much trouble is Netanyahu in? Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM At the last election four years ago,Mr Netanyahu apologised after warning that ""right-wing rule is in danger"" because ""the Arabs are voting in droves"". Israeli Arabs, descendants of the 160,000 Palestinians who remained after the State of Israel was created in 1948, have long complained of being treated as second-class citizens. They say they face discrimination and worse provision than Israeli Jews when it comes to services such as education, health and housing. Is Netanyahu in more trouble now than ever before?

"Sinclair was 69 when he was finally convicted 37 years after the World's End murders Angus Sinclair, one of Scotland's most notorious murderers, has died at the age of 73. He was convicted of four killings, including the 1977 World's End murders, but was suspected of killing four more women in Glasgow the same year. Sinclair had been in prison since 1982 after being convicted of a series of rapes and indecent attacks on children. Kevin Scott, the brother of one of the murder victims, described the serial killer as a ""monster"". Sinclair was jailed for a minimum of 37 years after being found guilty of murdering Helen Scott and her friend Christine Eadie. Christine Eadie and Helen Scott were killed in October 1977 Speaking to BBC Scotland, Mr Scott said: ""He was a monster.  To treat innocent people the way he did was just evil.  You would need to be a beast to commit those crimes. ""I would have wanted him to live longer to serve more of the 37 year sentence, as opposed to getting the easy way out. ""I do feel for the families of the other victims that he may have had. They'll never be afforded the kind of justice that we received."" The Scottish Prison Service confirmed on Monday that Sinclair died overnight at HMP Glenochil in Alloa, Clackmannanshire. It is understood that he had suffered from a series of strokes. A lifetime of abuse, rape and murder Was Angus Sinclair Scotland's worst serial killer? Double jeopardy law change led to guilty verdict How Angus Sinclair was caught by DNA Sinclair, who grew up in Glasgow, was 16 when he carried out his first killing in 1961. He raped and strangled seven-year old neighbour Catherine Reehill before disposing of her body. However, he was released in his early 20s after serving just six years. Angus Sinclair is thought to have killed six women within seven months in 1977. He went on to kill two more women In 1977, six women disappeared after nights out, and were found dumped on deserted farmland or waste ground. Four of the victims - Frances Barker, Hilda McAuley, Agnes Cooney and Anna Kenny - were killed in Glasgow. Teenagers Helen Scott and Christine Eadie went missing after last being seen at the World's End pub on Edinburgh's Royal Mile in October 1977. They were found dead six miles apart in the East Lothian countryside the next day. Despite the biggest manhunt in Scottish police history, the identity of their killer remained a mystery for decades. Catherine Reehill, seven Christine Eadie, 17 Helen Scott, 17 Mary Gallacher, 17 Frances Barker, 37 Hilda McAuley, 36 Agnes Cooney, 23 Anna Kenny, 20 In 1982, Sinclair was jailed for life after he admitted 11 charges of rape and indecent assault. Almost 20 years later, when he was being prepared for parole, a cold case review revealed that Sinclair's DNA had been found on Mary Gallacher - who was murdered in Glasgow in 1978. He was given another life sentence after being found guilty of her murder. Following that case, police began to examine the link between Sinclair and several other unsolved cases. Scientific advances put Sinclair in the frame for the World's End murders. Christine and Helen were last seen in the World's End pub on Edinburgh's Royal Mile He first stood trial in 2007, accused of killing Christine Eadie and Helen Scott. However, the case collapsed due to insufficient evidence. But following a change to Scotland's double jeopardy law, Sinclair was prosecuted a second time and found guilty of the murders in 2014. The sentencing judge described Sinclair as a dangerous predator capable of sinking to the depths of depravity, and said the words ""evil"" and ""monster"" were inadequate for him. He was sentenced toa minimum of 37 years in prisonfor the murders of the two teenagers - the longest handed out by a Scottish court.

"This video can not be played Sir Tim Berners-Lee spoke to the BBC's Rory Cellan-Jones Global action is required to tackle the web's ""downward plunge to a dysfunctional future"", its inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee has told the BBC. He made the comments in an exclusive interview to mark 30 years since he submittedhis proposal for the web.,external Sir Tim said people had realised how their data could be ""manipulated"" afterthe Cambridge Analytica scandal. However, he said he felt problems such as data breaches, hacking and misinformation could be tackled. In an open letter,externalalso published on Monday, the web's creator acknowledged that many people doubted the web could be a force for good. He had his own anxieties about the web's future, he told the BBC: ""I'm very concerned about nastiness and misinformation spreading."" But he said he felt that people were beginning to better understand the risks they faced as web users. ""When the Cambridge Analytica thing went down [people] realised that elections had been manipulated using data that they contributed."" What was the web like 30 years ago? He added that in recent years he has increasingly felt that the principles of an open web need to be safeguarded. In his letter, Sir Tim outlined three specific areas of ""dysfunction"" that he said were harming the web today: malicious activity such as hacking and harassment problematic system design such as business models that reward clickbait unintended consequences, such as aggressive or polarised discussions These things could be dealt with, in part, through new laws and systems that limit bad behaviour online, he said. He cited theContract for the Web project,,externalwhich he helped to launch late last year. But initiatives like this would require all of society to contribute - from members of the public to business and political leaders. ""We need open web champions within government - civil servants and elected officials who will take action when private sector interests threaten the public good and who will stand up to protect the open web,"" he wrote. Wandering round the data centre at Cern, Sir Tim Berners-Lee was in a playful mood, remembering how he'd plugged the very first web server into the centre's uninterruptible power supply over Christmas so that nobody would switch it off - only for the whole place to be powered down. But as we talked about what had happened since he submitted his proposal for the web 30 years ago - described by his boss as ""vague but exciting"" - Sir Tim's mood darkened. In the last few years, he told me, he'd realised it was not enough to just campaign for an open web and leave people to their own devices. Sir Tim has a plan - the Contract for the Web - to put things back on the right track but it depends on governments and corporations doing their part, and the citizens of the web pressing them to act. When, as my last question, I asked Sir Tim whether the overall impact of the web had been good, I expected an upbeat answer. Instead, gesturing to indicate an upward and then a downward curve, he said that after a good first 15 years, things had turned bad and a ""mid-course correction"" was needed. His brilliant creation has grown into a troubled adolescent - and Sir Tim sees it as his personal mission to put the web back on the right track. Sir Tim's vision was ""at once utopian and realistic"", said Jonathan Zittrain, author of The Future of the Internet and How to Stop It. It rested on the idea that a free and open web would empower its users, rather than reduce them to simply being consumers, he explained. ""I see Tim's letter not only as a call to build a better web, but to rededicate ourselves to the core principles it embodies,"" he told the BBC. Those principles, he said, included universality of access and transparency - the ability to see and understand how web applications work. What was the web like 30 years ago?

"This video can not be played The BBC's Emmanuel Igunza, at the scene, said there was a huge crater at the site of the crash The US Federal Aviation Administration has told airlines it believes Boeing's 737 Max 8 model to be airworthy, after two fatal crashes inside six months. An Ethiopian Airlines plane en route from Addis Ababa to Nairobi crashed six minutes after take-off on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board. The incident followed Lion Air 737 Max 8 crash in October that killed 189. Some in the aviation community have called for the aircraft to be grounded pending a full investigation. But late on Monday, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a ""continued airworthiness notification"" saying the plane was safe to fly. China, Indonesia, and Ethiopia on Monday ordered their airlines to ground the jet. Aerolineas of Argentina, Mexico's Aeromexico and Brazil's Gol have also suspended flights of the aircraft. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore on Tuesday said it was ""temporarily suspending operation of all variants of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft into and out of Singapore"". The suspension will take effect from 14:00 local time (06:00 GMT). Other airlines kept flying the 737 Max 8 after Boeing said it was safe. Shares in Boeing fell by 12.9% on Monday in the wake of the crash. US Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said the FAA would ""take immediate and appropriate action"" if a defect was found in the plane. FAA chief Dan Elwell said the notification ""informs the international community where we are and (gives) ... one answer to the whole community"". The delay that saved a man's life More about Boeing 737 Max 8 Ethiopian Airlines: Africa's largest airline Paul Hudson, the president of FlyersRights.org and a member of the FAA Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee, called for the plane to be grounded. ""The FAA's 'wait and see' attitude risks lives as well as the safety reputation of the US aviation industry,"" Mr Hudson said in a statement on Monday. The aircraft came down near the town of Bishoftu, 60km (37 miles) south-east of the capital. The cause of the disaster is not clear, but the pilot had reported difficulties and asked to return to Addis Ababa. Investigators have found the cockpit voice recorder and digital flight data recorder  but it will be a while before the findings are made public. Visibility was said to be good but air traffic monitorFlightradar24,externalreported that the plane's ""vertical speed was unstable after take-off"". The pilot was named as Senior Capt Yared Getachew,external, who Ethiopian Airlines said had a ""commendable performance"" over more than 8,000 hours in the air. Several witnesses who worked in the farmland below the plane's flight path told the Reuters news agency they heard loud rattling noises coming from the aircraft. ""When it was hovering, fire was following its tail, then it tried to lift its nose,"" said one witness, Gadisa Benti. ""When it passed over our house, the nose pointed down and the tail raised up. It went straight to the ground with its nose, it then exploded."" Rolled out in 2017, the Max 8 is the latest iteration of the 737 line. By the end of January, Boeing had delivered 350 of the model of 5,011 orders. The plane that crashed was among six of 30 that Ethiopian Airlines had ordered as part of its expansion.It underwent a ""rigorous first check maintenance"",externalon 4 February, the airline said. Airlines ground 737 Max 8 jets Who's still flying the Max 8 Boeing said it was ""deeply saddened"",externalby the crash and was sending a team to provide technical assistance. Following last October's Lion Air crash in Indonesia, investigators said the pilots had appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling, a new feature of the jet. The anti-stall system repeatedly forced the plane's nose down, despite efforts by pilots to correct this, preliminary findings suggested. The Lion Air plane was also new and the accident happened soon after take-off. What October's Max 8 crash told us How could a brand new plane crash? After that accident, Boeing sent an emergency notice to airlines warning them of a problem with the anti-stall system. Ethiopian Airlines shared this image of CEO Tewolde Gebremariam at the crash site Boeing is expected to release a software patch to the system to deal with the issue, Reuters reports. It is not yet clear whether the anti-stall system was the cause of Sunday's crash. Aviation experts say other technical issues or human error cannot be discounted. There were people of more than 30 nationalities on the flight, including 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians, nine Ethiopians and nine Britons (two of whom were dual nationals travelling on non-British passports). Among the Canadians was a family of six, originally from India. Kosha Vaidya, 37, and her husband Prerit Dixit, 45 were taking their 14-year-old daughter Ashka and 13-year-old daughter Anushka to Nairobi - where Kosha was born - along with her parents, Pannagesh Vaidya, 73, and Hansini Vaidya, 67. There were also eight Italians, eight Chinese, eight Americans, seven French citizens, six Egyptians, five Germans, four Indians and four people from Slovakia on board.

Pub worker Mitchell blew kisses while being led off the field Mitchell, of Cock Hill Lane, was also ordered to pay Â£350 in fines and costs and has been banned from attending any football matches in the UK for 10 years. The Â£350 includes Â£100 in compensation for Grealish's ""pain, discomfort and shock"". The Villa midfielder was able to continue with the game at St Andrew's andwent on to score the winning goal in the 67th minute. Mitchell, a pub worker, claimed he was not drunk when he invaded the pitch and punched Grealish in the jaw. Paul Mitchell's prison sentence ""should be a deterrent"", magistrates said ""I cannot help but feel how lucky I was in this incident,"" the player said. ""It could have been so much worse had the supporter had some sort of weapon."" Birmingham City apologised to both Grealish and Villa immediately after the game and said Mitchell had been banned from St Andrew's for life. He has also been banned from away games. The club said there were ""no excuses"" for his behaviour, which ""has no place in football"". Latest news from the West Midlands West Midlands Police said it was also investigating ""offensive social media posts"" that appeared after the goal referencing Grealish's younger brother, who died when the midfielder was four. Birmingham City said it had banned another supporter for life over the ""vile and malicious"" tweets. Grealish went on to score the winning goal for Aston Villa Mitchell, who has been a season ticket holder for 20 years, was said to be ""very remorseful"" after realising he had ""brought shame"" on his club. His defence asked for community service or a suspended prison sentence but magistrates ruled that a ""message had to be sent out to fans"". The father-of-one's prison sentence ""should be a deterrent"", magistrates added. During the court hearing, Mr Whistance said online threats had been made to Mitchell. Mr Whistance said his family had left the area ""through fear that they would suffer serious harm or even death"". An FA spokesperson said ""a line had been crossed"" and strongly condemned the attack, as well asanother pitch invasion during the Manchester United and Arsenal match. It has written to Birmingham City to examine the club's security measures. Grealish sat on the turf while Mitchell was apprehended The club said it had begun reviewing all of its stewarding, safety and security procedures ""as a matter of high importance"". ""We will be putting into place extra measures at our stadium designed to help ensure the safety of players, as well as supporters,"" a spokesman said. The club also confirmed it was investigating an incident involving a steward ""after Aston Villa players celebrated their goal on Sunday in front of their supporters in the Gil Merrick Stand"". Meanwhile, former England playerPhil Neville said drastic action was needed to ensure the safety of players. ""Either through points deductions or by emptying stadiums and making clubs play behind closed doors,"" he said. In 2002, a Birmingham City fan who ran on to the St Andrew's pitch and confronted Aston Villa goalkeeper Peter Enckelman was jailed for four months for encroaching the playing area and using threatening behaviour.

"This video can not be played Joanna Toole's father said it was ""tragic"" she would not be able to achieve more with the UN At least nine Britons were on board the Ethiopian Airlines plane that crashed on Sunday, the Foreign Office now says. The crash happened six minutes after the Boeing 737 Max 8 took off from Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, for Nairobi in Kenya, killing all 157 people on board. Tributes have been paid to the UK nationals who died, including UN worker Joanna Toole, and University of Plymouth graduate Sarah Auffret. Kenyan and British dual national Joseph Waithaka was also among the victims. UK aid worker Sam Pegram, of Lancashire, was also among the nine,the BBC has been told. Geneva-based Mr Pegram, 25 and from Penwortham, was an intern with the Norwegian Refugee Council. The Lancashire Evening Post quoted Mr Pegram's mother Deborah, who said: ""Sam was so looking forward to going to Nairobi. He loved the work he was doing. ""We can't believe this has happened. We're totally devastated."" It was initially reported that seven UK nationals were on the flight, but another two passengers were discovered to be dual nationals travelling on another passport, the Foreign Office said.

Adrian Tooletold Devon Live,externalhis daughter was a ""very soft and loving person"" and that they were ""still in a state of shock"" over her death. Ms Toole, who was from Exmouth but was living in Rome and worked for the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), was travelling to the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi. The director of the FAO, Manuel Barange,tweeted,external: ""So profoundly sad and lost for words at the loss of our wonderful @FAOfish officer @JoannaToole. ""A wonderful human being, who loved her work with a passion. Our love to her family and loved ones."" Sarah Auffret was also travelling to the UN Environment Assembly Ms Auffret, believed to have had dual British and French nationality, was a polar tourism expert and had been travelling to Nairobi to talk about how to tackle marine plastic pollution at the UN event. She grew up in Brittany in northern France before going on to live in the UK, Australia, Germany, Argentina, Japan, and the Antarctic Peninsula.Norwegian media,externalreported she was aged 30 and lived in Tromso, Norway.

At least 19 victims were affiliated with the United Nations, according to a UN official. The cause of the disaster is not yet known. However, the pilot had reported difficulties and had asked to return to Addis Ababa, the airline said. Investigators say they have found the ""black box"" flight data recorders. Another plane of the same model was involved in a crash less than five months ago, whena Lion Air flight crashed into the sea near Indonesiawith nearly 190 people on board. The 737 Max 8 aircraft has only been in commercial use since 2017. Several airlines have grounded the Boeing model following the disaster, but some airlines serving UK airports are continuing to fly the aircraft model involved in the deadly crash.

It said it was liaising ""very closely""  with the European Aviation Safety Agency as information about the crash emerged. Meanwhile, two airlines that fly in and out of the UK and have the Boeing 737 Max 8 among their fleet said their aircraft were operating as normal. Tui Airways, which became the first UK airline to receive a Max 8 last November, currently flies six of the type.

"Molly Russell died in 2017 after seeing content about suicide on social media The family of a teenager who took her own life after viewing material about suicide and self-harm on social media has been refused funding to pay for legal advice at her inquest. Molly Russell was 14 when she died in 2017 and her parents in part blame the content she viewed on Instagram. Her case ledministers to demand online firms do moreto remove harmful posts. The Legal Aid Agency says funding is not automatically granted at inquests except in ""exceptional circumstances"". Molly's father, Ian, said he was ""quite flabbergasted"" by its decision. Instagram to remove graphic self-harm images Regulate social media, MPs urge He added: ""It's quite shocking to think that our legal aid agency, our society, doesn't think it's important to support such cases."" Mr Russell faces either having to raise tens of thousands pounds to pay for a legal team out of his own pocket, or appearing in court to represent his daughter's interests by himself. It is thought the big tech companies are likely to send representatives to the inquest. The Legal Aid Agency, which operates under the Ministry of Justice, wrote to Molly's family - rejecting a request to pay part of the costs of their lawyers.

The coroner overseeing Molly's inquest has already written to Facebook, the owner of Instagram - as well as Pinterest, YouTube and Apple - requesting they hand over all relevant information. After the revelations about Molly's death,Facebook was forced to change its policiesand promised to remove all graphic content about suicide and self-harm. The Children's Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, said the decision on legal aid underlined an imbalance in power, adding: ""It just confirms to me how unreachable these big tech companies are."" In a statement, a Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""This was a tragic case and our thoughts are with the family of Molly Russell. ""While our recent review of inquests found that legal representation is not necessary for the vast majority of cases, we are making a number of changes to the system to make it more accessible and supportive. ""This includes reviewing means-test requirements and simplifying the application process."" The families of the 96 football fans who died in the Hillsborough stadium disaster are among those given legal aid for an inquest in recent years.

"Police say the woman and her relatives used a circular saw to cut off her hand (file pic) Police in Slovenia have accused a woman of cutting off her hand with a circular saw - with the help of her family - to make a fraudulent insurance claim. The 21-year-old and a relative have been detained and face up to eight years in prison if convicted. The suspects recently took out injury insurance, police say. The woman allegedly stood to gain about â¬400,000 (Â£340,000; $450,000) in compensation and monthly payments of about â¬3,000 from the policy. Four members of the family were initially detained earlier this year, but two were later released. Police say the group deliberately cut the woman's hand above the wrist at their home in the capital Ljubljana. Relatives took her to hospital, saying she had injured herself while sawing branches. Officials say the group left the severed hand behind rather than bring it to hospital, to ensure the disability was permanent. But the authorities recovered it in time to sew it back on.

"Wonder Woman star Gal Gadot has become embroiled in a row with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the status of the country's Arab minority. ""Love your neighbour as yourself,"" the Israeli actress said, amid wrangling over the role of Israeli Arab parties in upcoming polls. Mr Netanyahu caused a stir when he said Israel ""was not a state of all its citizens"", referring to Arabs who make up 20% of its population. He cited a ""nation-state"" law. The legislation sparked controversy last year. Arab MPs reacted furiously in July when Israel's parliament approved the legislation, which says Jews have a unique right to national self-determination in the country and puts Hebrew above Arabic as the official language. The spat began on Saturday, when Israeli actress and TV presenter Rotem Sela challenged comments made by Culture Minister Miri Regev in a TV interview about the role of Arab parties in the 9 April general election. Ms Regev repeated a warning by her and Mr Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party that voters should not choose its main rivals because they might form a governing coalition that included Arab MPs. ""What is the problem with the Arabs?"" Sela questioned in an Instagram story. ""When the hell will someone in this government convey to the public that Israel is a state of all its citizens and that all people were created equal, and that even the Arabs and the Druze and the LGBTs and - shock - the leftists are human."" On Sunday, Mr Netanyahu responded with an Instagram post of his own that referred to the ""nation-state"" law. ""Dear Rotem,"" he wrote. ""Israel is not a state of all its citizens. According to the basic nationality law we passed, Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people - and only it."" ""As you wrote, there is no problem with the Arab citizens of Israel. They have equal rights like all of us and the Likud government has invested more in the Arab sector than any other government,"" he added. According to AFP news agency, Mr Netanyahu later brought up the issue at a cabinet meeting. He called Israel a ""Jewish, democratic state"" with equal rights, but the ""nation state not of all its citizens but only of the Jewish people"". The Wonder Woman star defended the comments posted by Sela, who is reported to be a close friend. ""This isn't a matter of right or left. Jew or Arab. Secular or religious,"" she told her 28.3m followers on Instagram. ""It's a matter of dialogue, of dialogue for peace and equality and of our tolerance of one towards the other."" President Reuven Rivlin also appeared to get involved in the debate on Monday. Without mentioning any names, Mr Rivlin condemned what he said were recent ""entirely unacceptable remarks about the Arab citizens of Israel"". Arab MPs also praised Sela's comments,external, the Times of Israel reports, including Ayman Odeh who said: ""Rotem Sela, we don't know each other but bravo."" Mr Netanyahu's critics say comments like those made by Ms Regev are part of a bid to court right-wing voters. Likud is facing a serious challenge to its re-election hopes with a rival centrist Blue and White alliance, led by ex-military chief Benny Gantz and ex-Finance Minister Yair Lapid, ahead in the polls. The prime minister has also come under increased pressure since the attorney general announced last month his intention to file corruption charges against him, pending a final hearing that will take place after the election. How much trouble is Netanyahu in? Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM At the last election four years ago,Mr Netanyahu apologised after warning that ""right-wing rule is in danger"" because ""the Arabs are voting in droves"". Israeli Arabs, descendants of the 160,000 Palestinians who remained after the State of Israel was created in 1948, have long complained of being treated as second-class citizens. They say they face discrimination and worse provision than Israeli Jews when it comes to services such as education, health and housing. Is Netanyahu in more trouble now than ever before?

"Bosses at fashion chain Superdry have told co-founder Julian Dunkerton he is not wanted back at the firm. The company is holding a shareholder meeting at the start of next month to decide whether to grant Mr Dunkerton's request to return as a director. But Superdry said such a move would be ""extremely damaging,external"". Mr Dunkerton left the firm last year and has been critical of the firm's strategy since then. He wants the firm to focus on selling hoodies and coats. He also disputes the firm's claim that he oversaw the Autumn/Winter collection which did not sell well. Mr Dunkerton says he was cut out of the design process for many months before he left. Superdry founder seeks return to the fold Superdry hit by slow coat and hoodie sales Superdry became popular with teenagers by providing sweatshirts and other casual wear with a Japanese-style branding. Mr Dunkerton favours sticking with Superdry's trademark hoodies and jackets, but fashion watchers say this market is now saturated. Mr Dunkerton told the BBC late last year he was offering to return to Superdry ""in any capacity"" to correct what he described as a failing strategy. He argued that the policy of putting new products in its stores more frequently was not working. Julian Dunkerton co-founded Superdry in 2003 Mr Dunkerton co-founded the fashion chain in 2003 and is still Superdry's largest shareholder, with an 18.4% stake. He founded the firm with James Holder, who resigned from the business in 2016, and who has a 9.7% stake. The company's current management, which is being led by chief executive Euan Sutherland, have been in dispute with Mr Dunkerton for months over strategy. Superdry said in its statement: ""The board unanimously believes that Mr Dunkerton's return to the company, in any capacity, would be extremely damaging to the company and its prospects."" It said Mr Dunkerton's strategy would reintroduce a leadership style that does not fit within the ""open-minded collaborative culture, values and operation of the company"". In December it issued a profits warning, saying it would make between Â£55m and Â£70m this year, well down on the Â£84m the market was expecting.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Emmanuel Igunza, at the scene, said there was a huge crater at the site of the crash Investigators have found the flight data recorders from an Ethiopian Airlines plane that crashed on Sunday. The devices recovered at the crash site were the Boeing 737 Max 8's cockpit voice recorder and digital flight data recorder. The plane was en route from Addis Ababa to the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, when it crashed six minutes after take-off, killing all 157 people on board. Several airlines have grounded the Boeing model following the disaster. The months-old aircraft came down near the town of Bishoftu, 60km (37 miles) south-east of the capital at 08:44 local time (05:44 GMT). The delay that saved a man's life More about Boeing 737 Max 8 Ethiopian Airlines: Africa's largest airline There were people of more than 30 nationalities on the flight, including Kenyans, Ethiopians, Canadians, and Britons. The cause of the disaster is not yet clear. But the pilot had reported difficulties and asked to return to Addis Ababa, Ethiopian Airlines said. ""At this stage, we can't rule out anything,"" CEO Tewolde Gebremariam said. ""We can't also attribute the cause to anything because we'll have to comply with the international regulation to wait for the investigation."" Visibility was said to be good but air traffic monitorFlightradar24 reported that the plane's ""vertical speed was unstable after take-off"",external. The pilot was named as Senior Capt Yared Getachew,externalwho Ethiopian Airlines said had a ""commendable performance"" with more than 8,000 hours in the air. Several witnesses who worked in the farmland below the plane's flight path told the Reuters news agency they heard loud rattling noises coming from the aircraft and saw billows of smoke and debris in its wake as it made a low turn over the fields. ""When it was hovering, fire was following its tail, then it tried to lift its nose,"" said one witness, Gadisa Benti. ""When it passed over our house, the nose pointed down and the tail raised up. It went straight to the ground with its nose, it then exploded."" The 737 Max 8 aircraft has only been in commercial use since 2017. The plane that crashed was among six of 30 that Ethiopian Airlines had ordered as part of its expansion.It underwent a ""rigorous first check maintenance"",externalon 4 February, the airline said. Airlines ground 737 Max 8 jets Who's still flying the Max 8 Boeing said it was ""deeply saddened"",externalby the crash and was sending a team to provide technical assistance. It was the second crash in five months involving a 737 Max 8, and comparisons are being drawn witha Lion Air accident in Indonesia last Octoberthat killed 189 people. Following the Lion Air crash, investigators said the pilots had appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling, a new feature of the jet. The anti-stall system repeatedly forced the plane's nose down, despite efforts by pilots to correct this, preliminary findings suggested. The Lion Air plane was also new and the accident happened soon after take-off. What October's Max 8 crash told us How could a brand new plane crash? ""It's highly suspicious,"" Mary Schiavo, former Inspector General of the US Transportation Department, told CNN. ""Here we have a brand-new aircraft that's gone down twice in a year. That rings alarm bells in the aviation industry, because that just doesn't happen."" After last October's crash, Boeing sent an emergency notice to airlines warning them of a problem with the anti-stall system. Ethiopian Airlines shared this image of CEO Tewolde Gebremariam at the crash site Boeing is expected to release a software patch to the system to deal with the issue, Reuters reports. It is not yet clear whether the anti-stall system was the cause of Sunday's crash. Aviation experts say other technical issues or human error cannot be discounted. There were 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians, nine Ethiopians and nine Britons (two of whom were dual nationals travelling on non-British passports) on the flight. There were also eight Italians, eight Chinese, eight Americans, seven French citizens, six Egyptians, five Germans, four Indians and four people from Slovakia. This video can not be played Son of Ethiopian Airlines passenger: ""I'm still in shock"" At least 21 passengers were affiliated with the UN and were travelling to a session of its Environment Assembly in Nairobi. ""It is one of the biggest catastrophes we have had in years,"" Michael Moller, director-general of the UN Office in Geneva, told the session on Monday. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed his condolences for the dead. ""Our colleagues were women and men, junior professionals and seasoned officials, hailing from all corners of the globe and with a wide array of expertise,"" he said. ""They all had one thing in common: a spirit to serve the people of the world and to make it a better place for us all."" David Beasley, the executive director of the World Food Programme, said seven members of the agency's staff had died in the crash, including Irish and Italian nationals. Read more about the victims The investigation will be led by Ethiopian authorities in co-ordination with teams of experts from Boeing and the US National Transportation Safety Board. Ethiopian Airlines said it had grounded all of its 737 Max 8s,external""until further notice"" as ""an extra safety precaution"".

"The four-hour A&E target may be dropped under plans announced by NHS England. NHS bosses have unveiled plans for an overhaul of the A&E target alongside changes to waiting times for cancer, mental health and planned operations. It said the targets were becoming outdated. But it comes after many of them have been missed for years. Instead of aiming to see and treat virtually all A&E patients in four hours, the sickest patients will be prioritised for quick treatment. NHS England wants to see patients coming in with heart attacks, acute asthma, sepsis and stroke starting their care within an hour. The changes will be piloted this year and, if successful, could be introduced in 2020. The plans have been unveiled after NHS England was asked by the prime minister to look at the system of targets last year.  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. The four-hour target, which expects 95% of patients to be seen in time, was introduced in 2004 and has not been met since July 2015. Last month, only two hospital trusts hit it. NHS England said the current target seemed to be distorting priorities. It pointed out that large numbers of patients were admitted into hospital just before the four-hour mark, which has the effect of ""stopping the clock"". NHS England said hospitals appeared to be motivated by the target rather than doing what was best for the patient. But it said a final decision over whether or not to definitely scrap it would not be made until after piloting takes places over the rest of the year. Currently, the target treats everyone the same - whether a patient has a sore thumb or has had a heart attack. That, of course, does not mean staff do. All accident and emergency units have systems in place to prioritise the sickest patients. It is just that how long they wait is not recorded and published publicly. In doing this, the change will put pressure on those hospitals that are not seeing such patients quickly. That is obviously a benefit. But for people with less urgent needs, there is concern that dropping the four-hour target could mean they wait longer. NHS England plans to counter this by recording the average waits and introducing a new measure to record when all patients see a senior doctor or nurse. But nonetheless the changes still send a clear signal about the pecking order - and, in an under pressure system, that could lead to ""less important"" cases waiting longer. Not many people would argue with that if it is someone with a sore thumb. But if a patient has a broken bone or is bleeding and is in pain, that is likely to be viewed differently. The NHS will also move towards average waiting times for planned operations, such as knee and hip replacements. Currently 92% of patients should be seen in 18 weeks. But that has not been met since February 2016. Cancer targets - for which there are nine separate ones - will be simplified so that there are two key targets for treatment starting on top of the incoming 28-day goal for diagnosis - something that is not currently measured. Meanwhile, new targets will be introduced for mental health care with the goal of ensuring that everyone who needs urgent crisis care in the community receives it within 24 hours. Access to other community mental health services - for children and adults - will be expected in four weeks. This is the first time that these services will have had targets attached to them. NHS England medical director Stephen Powis said: ""Now is the right time to look again at the old targets, which have such a big influence on how care is delivered, to make sure they take account of the latest treatments and techniques and support, not hinder, staff to deliver the kind of responsive, high-quality services that people want to see."" Many groups, including medical royal colleges, regulators and patient groups have broadly welcomed the plans. Prof Ted Baker, the chief inspector of hospitals at the Care Quality Commission, said that while the four-hour target had been ""valuable"" in focusing efforts on improving emergency care, it was the right time to find a better way to measure performance. ""Emergency departments need a set of standards which give priority to patients with life-threatening conditions."" But the Royal College of Emergency Medicine said it was against the four-hour target being scrapped and instead said it should survive alongside the new measures. ""We are keen to ensure that any changes are not imposed due to political will, but are developed responsibly, collaboratively and are based upon clinical expert consensus in the best interests of patients,"" added college president Dr Taj Hassan. Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said there was a concern the changes could lead to ""the return to the bad old days of long waits"". Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have a similar four-hour target, but there are no plans to change it. The way the other targets work is quite different.

"EU sources are asking who Theresa May stands for when it comes to Brexit ""Is this a crunch week? Is this not a crunch week?

UK civil servants representing whom? Theresa May only?"" ""How can the EU conduct negotiations, when the other side (the UK) doesn't have one position but many? And they keep changing and contradicting."" The mood in the EU, I can assure you, is not one of a bloc that is poised to ""blink"" at the last moment.

Brexit: A really simple guide New ideas for the Brexit border backstop ""We hear many in the UK saying 'oh, the EU always backs down last minute, and if they don't do it now it's because they want to punish the UK',"" one well-placed EU source said to me recently.

After all, the argument could go, only the leaders of the 27 EU countries ultimately have the legal ability to decisively change or alter the Withdrawal Agreement and therefore the backstop. That power does not lie with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker or EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Of course anything is possible. If the UK parliament does not approve an extension of the negotiations and hard Brexit looms the other side of 29 March, then some EU diplomats think it possible that EU leaders could, reluctantly, agree to an expiry date (or appearance of an expiry date) to the backstop - as long as that date is far enough into the future that, it's presumed, a trade deal or some alternative could be in place by then. 10 ways you could be affected by no-deal Brexit Deal or no deal - how are EU countries preparing? But, before anyone gets too excited or outraged by that suggestion, the above scenario, while possible, does not seem likely.

And don't imagine that the EU is salivating at the thought of a second referendum. EU leaders' idea of hell would be to postpone Brexit long enough for the vote, allowing the issue to overshadow so much other EU business, including upcoming European parliamentary elections, only for the second referendum result to be inconclusive and even more divisive than the first, thus maintaining Brexit as an unresolved open wound in the EU's side for even longer.

And why do I say that? Well, either you are a member of the single market or you are not.

He had his own anxieties about the web's future, he told the BBC: ""I'm very concerned about nastiness and misinformation spreading."" But he said he felt that people were beginning to better understand the risks they faced as web users. ""When the Cambridge Analytica thing went down [people] realised that elections had been manipulated using data that they contributed."" What was the web like 30 years ago? He added that in recent years he has increasingly felt that the principles of an open web need to be safeguarded. In his letter, Sir Tim outlined three specific areas of ""dysfunction"" that he said were harming the web today: malicious activity such as hacking and harassment problematic system design such as business models that reward clickbait unintended consequences, such as aggressive or polarised discussions These things could be dealt with, in part, through new laws and systems that limit bad behaviour online, he said. He cited theContract for the Web project,,externalwhich he helped to launch late last year. But initiatives like this would require all of society to contribute - from members of the public to business and political leaders. ""We need open web champions within government - civil servants and elected officials who will take action when private sector interests threaten the public good and who will stand up to protect the open web,"" he wrote. Wandering round the data centre at Cern, Sir Tim Berners-Lee was in a playful mood, remembering how he'd plugged the very first web server into the centre's uninterruptible power supply over Christmas so that nobody would switch it off - only for the whole place to be powered down. But as we talked about what had happened since he submitted his proposal for the web 30 years ago - described by his boss as ""vague but exciting"" - Sir Tim's mood darkened. In the last few years, he told me, he'd realised it was not enough to just campaign for an open web and leave people to their own devices. Sir Tim has a plan - the Contract for the Web - to put things back on the right track but it depends on governments and corporations doing their part, and the citizens of the web pressing them to act. When, as my last question, I asked Sir Tim whether the overall impact of the web had been good, I expected an upbeat answer. Instead, gesturing to indicate an upward and then a downward curve, he said that after a good first 15 years, things had turned bad and a ""mid-course correction"" was needed. His brilliant creation has grown into a troubled adolescent - and Sir Tim sees it as his personal mission to put the web back on the right track. Sir Tim's vision was ""at once utopian and realistic"", said Jonathan Zittrain, author of The Future of the Internet and How to Stop It. It rested on the idea that a free and open web would empower its users, rather than reduce them to simply being consumers, he explained. ""I see Tim's letter not only as a call to build a better web, but to rededicate ourselves to the core principles it embodies,"" he told the BBC. Those principles, he said, included universality of access and transparency - the ability to see and understand how web applications work. What was the web like 30 years ago?

"This video can not be played Algerians celebrate after president drops fifth term bid Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has postponed the 18 April presidential elections and said he will not seek a fifth term in office. President Bouteflika's candidacy had provoked mass protests across Algeria over the past few weeks. He has led Algeria for 20 years but has been rarely seen in public since he suffered a stroke in 2013. No new date for the election was set. A cabinet reshuffle will happen soon, a statement in Mr Bouteflika's name said. There was no suggestion in the announcement that the president intends to step down before a rescheduled election. Meanwhile, Algeria's Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia announced his resignation and was replaced by Interior Minister Noureddine Bedoui, who has been tasked with forming a new government, the official APS news agency reported. ""There will be no fifth term,"" Mr Bouteflika was quoted as saying in a statement. ""There was never any question of it for me. Given my state of health and age, my last duty towards the Algerian people was always contributing to the foundation of a new Republic."" How does reclusive President Bouteflika run Algeria? Video: What's behind Algeria protests? Judges refuse to oversee Algeria poll He had pledged last week that he would step down early if re-elected - but the guarantee failed to placate the thousands of demonstrators. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, pictured here in 2017, has not spoken in public since 2014 Algeria had been hit by strikes by teachers and students, as well as shops closing and train services being suspended as thousands took to the streets. Pressure mounted on Mr Bouteflika to withdraw when more than 1,000 judges said on Monday they would refuse to oversee the planned general election were he a candidate. Then the military's chief of staff, Lt Gen Gaed Salah, said the military and the people had a united vision of the future - the strongest indication so far that the armed forces were sympathetic to the protests. Top clerics had already criticised pressure on them to issue pro-government sermons. ""Leave us to do our job, don't interfere,"" cleric Imam Djamel Ghoul, leader of an independent group of clerics, told journalists. Rana Jawad, BBC North Africa correspondent This will be seen as a partial victory for those who have been on the streets for weeks. While it is a guarantee from Mr Bouteflika that he will not seek a fifth term, the absence of a new election date potentially leaves the process frustratingly open-ended. The reaction on social media was swift, and questions are already being asked over the legality of prolonging Mr Bouteflika's term in office beyond the constitutional mandate. The delay could help to ensure a peaceful transition of power - allowing all candidates to campaign properly while addressing the public's core demand of removing Mr Bouteflika from office. But key to satisfying the protesters' demand will be a timetable for his departure. And the legitimacy of an election does not stop at the ballot box - the ruling elite, the country's judges, and its electoral bodies will need to demonstrate a genuine will to ensure a free and fair poll. Algerians have shown they are no longer willing to accept the status quo, and that will undoubtedly extend to close scrutiny of how the next election plays out. This video can not be played Algeria protests: What's behind them? The president's announcement came a day after he returned home after a two-week stay in a Swiss hospital, where he has been for treatment since suffering a stroke in 2013. He has over the years since his stroke become a virtual recluse. His last public address was in 2014, shortly after winning the previous general election. Many Algerians were concerned about his ailing health, and worried that his death in office during a fifth term might cause dangerous political instability. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian welcomed President Bouteflika's decision not to seek re-election. ""France expresses its hope that a new dynamic that can answer the deep aspirations of the Algerian people will rapidly take hold,"" he said in a statement. Meanwhile, people on the streets of the capital, Algiers, have been celebrating the news. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tributes have been paid to the UK nationals who died, including UN worker Joanna Toole, and University of Plymouth graduate Sarah Auffret. Kenyan and British dual national Joseph Waithaka was also among the victims. UK aid worker Sam Pegram, of Lancashire, was also among the nine,the BBC has been told. Geneva-based Mr Pegram, 25 and from Penwortham, was an intern with the Norwegian Refugee Council. The Lancashire Evening Post quoted Mr Pegram's mother Deborah, who said: ""Sam was so looking forward to going to Nairobi. He loved the work he was doing. ""We can't believe this has happened. We're totally devastated.""

Adrian Tooletold Devon Live,externalhis daughter was a ""very soft and loving person"" and that they were ""still in a state of shock"" over her death. Ms Toole, who was from Exmouth but was living in Rome and worked for the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), was travelling to the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi. The director of the FAO, Manuel Barange,tweeted,external: ""So profoundly sad and lost for words at the loss of our wonderful @FAOfish officer @JoannaToole. ""A wonderful human being, who loved her work with a passion. Our love to her family and loved ones."" Sarah Auffret was also travelling to the UN Environment Assembly Ms Auffret, believed to have had dual British and French nationality, was a polar tourism expert and had been travelling to Nairobi to talk about how to tackle marine plastic pollution at the UN event. She grew up in Brittany in northern France before going on to live in the UK, Australia, Germany, Argentina, Japan, and the Antarctic Peninsula.Norwegian media,externalreported she was aged 30 and lived in Tromso, Norway.

At least 19 victims were affiliated with the United Nations, according to a UN official. The cause of the disaster is not yet known. However, the pilot had reported difficulties and had asked to return to Addis Ababa, the airline said. Investigators say they have found the ""black box"" flight data recorders. Another plane of the same model was involved in a crash less than five months ago, whena Lion Air flight crashed into the sea near Indonesiawith nearly 190 people on board. The 737 Max 8 aircraft has only been in commercial use since 2017. Several airlines have grounded the Boeing model following the disaster, but some airlines serving UK airports are continuing to fly the aircraft model involved in the deadly crash. The UK Civil Aviation Authority said there were five Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft registered and operational in the UK, with a sixth due to enter operation this week. It said it was liaising ""very closely""  with the European Aviation Safety Agency as information about the crash emerged. Meanwhile, two airlines that fly in and out of the UK and have the Boeing 737 Max 8 among their fleet said their aircraft were operating as normal. Tui Airways, which became the first UK airline to receive a Max 8 last November, currently flies six of the type.

"The Amazon Echo is just one of various types of smart speaker Question: ""Alexa - what is now being used to help calculate the cost of living in the UK?"" Answer: ""I am."" Smart speakers, such as the Amazon Echo device (or Alexa), have been added to the basket of goods used to measure the movement of prices. These price movements of 700 goods and services are used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to calculate the rate of inflation. The latest annual review has also added bakeware but envelopes are out. Amazon Alexa heard and sent private chat UK inflation falls to two-year low in January The addition of baking items, such as trays and roasting tins, reflected the success of TV programmes such as the Great British Bake Off. The Great British Bake Off has inspired many people to bake There are some clear changes from lifestyles in previous decades as the move towards electronic communication, rather than letter-writing, has meant envelopes have been removed. The three-piece suite and crockery sets, once signs of an upwardly-mobile household, have also been taken out as people tend to buy individual items of furniture, rather than a set. The former has been replaced by single settees and the latter by just dinner plates. Washing powder was no longer needed as liquid was being used instead, the ONS said. Hi-fi systems have also gone, made redundant by streaming services as well as smart and portable speakers. However, there is now a place for electric toothbrushes in the basket. Flavoured tea has also been added owing to its rising popularity and increased shelf-space in supermarkets. In all, 16 items have been added this year, 10 have been removed and 16 modified, with 688 unchanged,the ONS said,external. Some 180,000 prices are measured in 20,000 UK outlets to calculate inflation, which itself is used as a benchmark for our finances. This basket of goods reflects contemporary habits and technology to work out the inflation rate, which charts the changing cost of living. The ONS also aims to ensure that each sector of goods and services, and where items are bought, are reflected adequately in the calculations. That is why peanut butter, and shop-bought popcorn have also been added this year. Children's fiction, suitable for six to 12-year-olds has also been added, to close a gap in the coverage of books between illustrated books for infants and teenage literature in the basket. ONS senior statistician Philip Gooding said: ""We want to reflect modern spending habits, and the alterations we have made highlight shifting consumer behaviour, whether that is in technology, the home, or the way we communicate with one another. ""It is important to remember that we change a small percentage of the overall basket."" Last year, women's leggings and mashed potato replaced pork pies and lager sold in nightclubs in the inflation basket. Leggings are in, pork pies out, says ONS The annoying things about being called Alexa.

"This video can not be played Joanna Toole's father said it was ""tragic"" she would not be able to achieve more with the UN The father of a British woman who was on the Ethiopian Airlines plane that crashed on Sunday has spoken of his pride in his daughter's achievements. Adrian Toole said it was ""tragic"" that 36-year-old Joanna would not be able to achieve more in her career with the UN. Tributes have also been paid to Kenyan and British dual national Joseph Waithaka and University of Plymouth graduate Sarah Auffret. The Foreign Office said at least seven Britons were among the dead. The crash happened at 08:44 local time (05:44 GMT), six minutes after the months-old Boeing 737 Max-8 took off. There were 149 passengers and eight crew members on board. Boeing faces questions after crash 'No survivors' in Ethiopia plane crash What is the Boeing 737 Max-8 aircraft? Air disasters timeline Mr Toole said he last spoke to his daughter, who was from Exmouth but was living in Rome, on Friday evening. Hetold Devon Live,externalshe was a ""very soft and loving person"" and that they were ""still in a state of shock"" over her death. ""Joanna was genuinely one of those people who you never heard a bad word about."" He said her job involved a lot of travel, but added: ""Personally, I never wanted her to be on a single one of those planes. ""I'm an environmental campaigner myself - so partly it was because of the damage to the environment but also because it's a dangerous occupation to be flying. Up until now she had been lucky."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Toole paid tribute to her 15 years working in international animal welfare organisations: ""I'm very proud of what she achieved. It's just tragic that she couldn't carry on to further her career and achieve more."" ""She was very well known in her own line of business and we've had many tributes already paid to her,"" he added. He said he remembered when she was a small child she had tried to save badgers from being run over on a new road near her home. Ms Toole, who worked for the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), was travelling to the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi. The director of the FAO, Manuel Barange,tweeted,external: ""So profoundly sad and lost for words at the loss of our wonderful @FAOfish officer @JoannaToole"". ""A wonderful human being, who loved her work with a passion. Our love to her family and loved ones."" Sarah Auffret was also travelling to the UN Environment Assembly Ms Auffret, believed to have had dual British and French nationality, was a polar tourism expert and had been travelling to Nairobi to talk about how to tackle marine plastic pollution at the UN event. She grew up in Brittany in northern France before going on to live in the UK, Australia, Germany, Argentina, Japan, and the Antarctic Peninsula.Norwegian media,externalreported she was aged 30 and lived in Tromso, Norway. Ms Auffret hadgraduated from the University of Plymouth in 2007,external, having taken a degree in European Studies and German. A spokesman for the university described her as ""an exemplary student who fully embraced university life and took every opportunity to develop herself while she was here"", adding: ""She is remembered as someone who had a passion for learning about Europe and a strong moral compass."" Her employers, the Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators, said they were ""shocked and heartbroken"" to learn of her death. In a statement,external, released with the agreement of Ms Auffret's family, they said: ""Words cannot describe the sorrow and despair we feel. We have lost a true friend and beloved colleague."" Ms Auffret joined AECO last May and was leading the company's Clean Seas project - this included efforts to cut back on single-use plastics on Arctic expedition cruise ships and to involve cruise passengers in beach clean-ups. Joseph Waithaka was a father of three Joseph Waithaka - a 55-year-old Kenyan and British dual national - was also killed in the crash. His son, Ben Kuria said he was still in shock after hearing that his father, who moved to the UK in 2004, was on board the flight. Mr Kuria described him as a ""generous"" man who ""loved justice"". Father-of-three Mr Waithaka lived in Hull and worked for the Humberside Probation Trust before returning to live in Kenya in 2015. This video can not be played Son of Ethiopian Airlines passenger: ""I'm still in shock"" Mr Kuria said he had seen his father in Croydon, south London on Saturday, when he had been in the UK visiting relatives. They had a meal together and said goodbye before his father caught a flight to Addis Ababa, he said. ""I gave him a hug and shook his hand, because in my culture it's more about the handshake than it is about the hug,"" he told BBC News. ""And I said we'll probably see you at some point soon. We usually spend a bit more time saying goodbye, but yesterday it kind of just felt routine."" Michael Ryan worked for the World Food Programme Michael Ryan, from Ireland, was one of seven people from the UN's World Food Programme who died in the crash. The aid worker and engineer, known as Mick, was formerly from Lahinch in County Clare and is believed to have been married with two children. Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar said,externalMr Ryan was ""doing life-changing work in Africa"". The Boeing 737 Max-8 aircraft that crashed on Sunday Ethiopian Airlines said it had contacted the families of all the victims, who came from 35 nations - including 18 Canadians, nine Ethiopians and eight Americans. At least 19 victims were affiliated with the United Nations, according to a UN official. The cause of the disaster is not yet known. However, the pilot had reported difficulties and had asked to return to Addis Ababa, the airline said. Another plane of the same model was involved in a crash less than five months ago, whena Lion Air flight crashed into the sea near Indonesiawith nearly 190 people on board. The UK Civil Aviation Authority said there were five Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft registered and operational in the UK, with a sixth due to enter operation this week. It said it was liaising with the European Aviation Safety Agency as information about the crash emerged. Meanwhile, two airlines that fly in and out of the UK and have the Boeing 737 Max 8 among their fleet said their aircraft were operating as normal. Tui Airways, which became the first UK airline to receive a Max 8 last November, currently flies six of the type.

"The 355,000 players caught cheating on Apex Legends were all using the PC version of the game, the studio behind the game has said. Respawn Entertainment said it intended to be ""secretive"" about its plans to combat cheating, so as not to forewarn players trying to break the rules. Apex Legends has attracted 50 million players since its release last month. It is often compared with Fortnite, which has 200 million players and was released in July 2017. Both shooter games are in the form of Battle Royale - where players fight against each other until only one survives. Apex Legends v Fortnite: The battle for Battle Royale In Apex Legends, gamers play in three-player squads rather than as individuals. They pick from one of eight possible pre-defined characters, each with different abilities and roles. Apex Legends also has more realistic graphics than the cartoon-style feel of Fortnite. Legends draws heavily on work that Respawn did on the Titanfall 2 video game. In an update on Reddit,,externalRespawn said it would be adding a report feature which would take players through to anti-cheat platform Easy Anti-Cheat. ""The service works but the fight against cheaters is an ongoing war that we'll need to continue to adapt to and be very vigilant about fighting,"" it said. ""We take cheating very seriously and care deeply about the health of Apex Legends for all players."" Games analyst Piers Harding-Rolls from IHS Markit told the BBC that cheating on the Windows PC version is more common because it is easier to download a cheat application. ""Reducing cheating is an ongoing process for games publishers and a significant operating cost,"" he said. ""The battle is never won, as new cheats and hacks are appearing all the time. ""Big publishers or developers like Respawn create teams of anti-cheating staff to target cheaters and also work with specialist companies to apply anti-cheating software which is integrated into their client software.""

"This video can not be played The fire is understood to have started in the roof of the building The president of Shetland's world-renowned bird observatory, which was destroyed by fire at the weekend, has vowed to rebuild it. Firefighters were called to the Fair Isle Bird Observatory at about 11:20 on Sunday. No-one was hurt in the blaze, including a family living in the adjoining flat. The observatory's records have also survived as they were digitised. Observatory president Roy Dennis said the fire was ""shocking"". The fire is understood to have started in the roof of the building Speaking on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, he added: ""Thank goodness no-one was injured or killed. ""Now we've got to get on and rebuild. We are so important to that island."" Fire destroys Shetland bird observatory He said the observatory's treasurer would ask the insurers to start the process of securing the funds to rebuild it, which he expects to take a year. One local told BBC Scotland a Fair Isle boat crew spotted smoke while out on the water just after leaving the harbour, and turned back to raise the alarm. Photographer Rob Fray could see a plume of smoke from the blaze from the Sumburgh Hotel in Shetland - approximately 30 miles across the water. Mr Dennis said the challenges posed by the island's location made it difficult to construct the observatory and to contain the fire, which is believed to have started in the roof. He said: ""It's the most remote island and that's why it was very difficult for the fire crews to get there quickly and why it is very difficult building a big building like that on such an isolated island. ""We know there is a big challenge ahead."" The smoke from the blaze could be seen for miles He added that all of the observatory's records, going back to 1948, were digitised and so were safe. The 70 years' worth of material can inform researchers about climate and environmental changes, he added. He said the fire was ""tragic"" for the ""excellent"" researchers who regularly visited the island. The new observatory was built in 2010 The observatory, which is located on the north east of the island, is a popular tourist spot for bird watching and for scientific research into seabirds and bird migration. It is also important to the economy of Fair Isle, which is famous for its knitting and has a population of about 60. It was established in 1948 with the current building constructed in 2010, offering three-star accommodation to visitors. The observatory is run by an independent charity but has close links to other organisations such as the National Trust for Scotland which owns the remainder of the island.

"On Tuesday, MPs will pass their verdict on Prime Minister Theresa May's plan to take Britain out of the European Union on 29 March. Here is what you need to know about the vote. At 7pm on Tuesday evening, after a full day of debate. They are passing judgement on the deal Theresa May spent two years negotiating with the European Union. Brexit: What could happen next? This is the big one. If MPs vote the deal down, one of two things is likely to happen. The UK will either leave the EU on 29 March without a withdrawal agreement - or that departure date will be delayed. If they back the deal, the UK will leave the EU on 29 March but things will stay broadly as they are until December 2020, while the two sides thrash out a permanent trade deal. Yes - andby a massive margin. Mrs May said she secured ""legally binding"" changes to her Brexit deal on Monday, a day ahead of MPs voting on it. She said the first change could be used to start a ""formal dispute"" against the EU if it tried to keep the UK tied into the backstop - the safety net designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland - indefinitely. The second is a ""joint statement"" from the EU and the UK. It adds to the political declaration on the UK and EU's future relationship and commits to replacing the backstop with alternative arrangements by December 2020. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, the government's chief law officer, haspublished updated legal advice,externalon the prime minister's deal, saying the new provisions secured by Mrs May ""reduce the risk"" of the UK being ""indefinitely and involuntarily"" held  in the backstop. But his advice adds that ""the legal risk remains unchanged"" that the UK would have no legal means of exiting without EU agreement. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. If MPs vote down Mrs May's withdrawal agreement on Tuesday, then MPs have been promised a vote on whether the UK should leave without a deal or not. This is likely to take place on Wednesday. If they back a no-deal Brexit in this vote, then the UK will leave without a deal on 29 March. If they reject a no-deal Brexit then they could get a vote on Thursday on whether to request a delay to Brexit from the EU. Not necessarily. If Mrs May loses the vote on Tuesday by a narrow margin, she could ask the EU for a short technical delay to allow everyone to regroup and make one last push to get it ""over the line"". Mrs May could make that final push at the next EU summit on 22 March, with another Commons vote to follow, assuming she can get a delay to Brexit. Brexit: If not 29 March, then when? Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button The first thing to stress is that it is not a trade deal. It is simply an agreement to allow the UK to leave the EU in an orderly fashion, minimising disruption to businesses and citizens of the UK and EU nations. Things would carry on pretty much as usual for at least 21 months after the official departure date of 29 March. During that time, the two sides would try to hammer out a permanent trading relationship - the overall aim of those talks is set out in the political declaration on the future relationship between the UK and EU, which MPs are also voting on. The withdrawal agreement also commits the UK to paying a Â£39bn ""divorce bill"". UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, would also retain their residency and social security rights. The withdrawal agreement - what it all means The decision MPs make on Tuesday will shape the UK's economy and society for decades to come, influencing incomes, job prospects and much else besides. There may also be some more immediate consequences. Many fear a no-deal Brexit will cause chaos at ports, disruption to food and medical supplies and long-term economic damage, with big multinational companies moving out of the UK. Others say these fears are exaggerated and the UK will thrive when it has made a clean break from the EU. The ""Irish backstop"" clause. This is a bit of legal jargon that is meant to prevent the return of cameras and border guards along the 310 mile border between Ireland and Northern Ireland - the only land border between the EU and the UK. It would keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, avoiding the need for physical checks on vehicles passing through the border, which many fear could reignite the Northern Irish Troubles. It is only meant to kick in if the two sides have not agreed a trade deal by December 2020 - and it is meant to be temporary. But because there is no end date written into the agreement, and no way of quitting it without the EU's say-so, many MPs fear it will become permanent, effectively making a mockery of Brexit. These MPs want a time-limit on the backstop - something the EU has ruled out. The EU says the deal it struck with Mrs May is the best and only one available and it can't be rewritten. Mrs May used to say that too, until MPs rejected it in January. MPs are studying the additional legal assurances on the temporary nature of the backstop, agreed by Mrs May in 11th hour talks with EU officials, before deciding whether to vote for her deal or not. After months of questions about his position, Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he could support a new referendum, while continuing to push for his preferred option of a general election or Labour's own version of Brexit. Many Labour MPs from areas that voted Leave in the 2016 referendum could vote against it, however, reducing its chances of success. The Labour leadership also appears to be warming to the idea of a Norway-style deal with the EU, which is backed by a group of Conservative and Labour MPs. This would see the UK remain in the EU single market, which its supporters say would protect jobs. If Mrs May's deal is defeated on Tuesday, there could be moves to get MPs to back ""Common Market 2.0"", as its supporters call this plan. Opponents say it would not end the free movement of people or allow the UK to strike its own trade deals around the world.

"Ms Begum left Bethnal Green, east London, in 2015 to join the Islamic State group in Syria The mother of Shamima Begum has urged the government to reconsider the decision to revoke her daughter's British citizenship.

When she was found in a Syrian refugee camp last month, she gave an interview in which she said did not regret joining IS. Shamima Begum's father apologises to the UK What is Shamima Begum's legal status?

He said the family had not yet been in direct contact with the 19-year-old. Asking for a reply within 24 hours, he continued: ""You will appreciate there are immediate fears for Shamima's health and safety, and the matter is urgent."" This video can not be played Diane Abbott questions Sajid Javid on Shamima Begum baby Shortly after the birth of her son, Jarrah, Ms Begum told the BBC she wished her child to be raised in the UK. But Jarrah died on Thursday, according to a medical certificate that gave pneumonia as the cause of death. He was less than three weeks old. Because the baby was born before Ms Begum was deprived of UK citizenship by the Home Office, he was considered British. The home secretary has been criticisedfor refusing to allow Ms Begum to return to the UK with her child. Ms Begum's sister, Renu,wrote to him two weeks ago on behalf of the familychallenging the decision to remove citizenship - which she described as Shamima's ""only hope at rehabilitation"".

In a BBC interview last month, Shamima Begum said although it was ""wrong"" that innocent people had died in the 2017 Manchester Arena attack, it was ""kind of retaliation"" for attacks on IS. Details have also emerged of two more women from the UK, who are in Syrian camps with their young children, who have been stripped of their citizenship. Sources told the BBC that the decision to remove their citizenship was taken by the former Home Secretary Amber Rudd.

"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have joined the Queen for a Westminster Abbey service to mark Commonwealth Day. The royals and senior figures from national life marked the 70th anniversary of the modern Commonwealth. The theme of this year's event was A Connected Commonwealth, with member countries being urged to protect natural resources and the environment. In her message, the Queen said the Commonwealth vision ""inspires us to find ways of protecting our planet"". Earlier Prince Harry and Meghan visited the Canadian embassy as part of Commonwealth Day celebrations. The multicultural, multi-faith event at Westminster Abbey saw performances and readings from representatives from throughout the Commonwealth. Grammy-winning group, Clean Bandit were the first to perform, followed by performances of North Indian dhol drumming, and a solo by an Australian aboriginal musician on a didgeridoo. The Queen says the impact of the goodwill generated by the Commonwealth is ""very real"" The Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke of York also attended the service. The Prime Minister Theresa May was in the 2,000-strong congregation, as well as Commonwealth Secretary-General Baroness Scotland, high commissioners, ambassadors, faith leaders, plus more than 800 schoolchildren and young people. Cold-water swimmer, Lewis Pugh spoke at the ceremony to appeal for greater efforts to restore the health of the oceans. Earlier, Prince Harry and Meghan kicked off the celebrations at an event at Canada House, to showcase Canadian talent in the UK. The couple were welcomed to the embassy by Canada's High Commissioner to the UK, Janice Charette. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrived for the Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey Prime Minister Theresa May made time on a busy day to attend the service Ms Charette said: ""We kind of claim them a little bit as Canadians... One of their first outings as a couple was actually at the Invictus Games in Toronto, so we like to think of them as having come home here to Canada House."" The royal couple visited Commonwealth countries for their first oversees tour last year. In pictures: Harry and Meghan's first tour Since 1977, Commonwealth day has been celebrated annually on the second Monday in March. The 53 Commonwealth countries in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Americas, the Pacific and Europe, marked the day with a range of activities, such as faith and civic gatherings, school assemblies, flag raising ceremonies, street parties and cultural events. Last year the Queen announced the Prince of Wales will become the next Head of the Commonwealth Prince Harry and Meghan celebrated Commonwealth day with young people at Canada House before the Westminster service. In her Commonwealth message, the Queen said the Commonwealth vision ""offers hope, and inspires us to find ways of protecting our planet, and our people. ""We are able to look to the future with greater confidence and optimism as a result of the links that we share, and thanks to the networks of co-operation and mutual support to which we contribute, and on which we draw. ""With enduring commitment through times of great change, successive generations have demonstrated that whilst the goodwill for which the Commonwealth is renowned may be intangible, its impact is very real."" The Queen famously dedicated herself to the empire, which later became the Commonwealth, on her 21st birthday in 1947. The then Princess Elizabeth said: ""I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family, to which we all belong.""

"This video can not be played Big Brexit moment: Will MPs back or bin the PM's deal? The EU has said it is now up to MPs to decide the next steps for Brexit and it remains ""committed"" to agreeing a deal in time for the UK to leave this month. Officials said they had offered fresh assurances on the issue of the Irish backstop ahead of Tuesday's second vote by MPs on Theresa May's deal. It was ""now for the Commons to take an important set of decisions"", they said. Labour and Tory MPs have told the PM she must honour her commitment to put her deal to the vote again on Tuesday. Amid speculation the vote could be postponed or downgraded, No 10 confirmed it remained the plan to go ahead with another ""meaningful vote"", with the motion to be debated to be published later on Monday. Live: Ministers answer Labour question Adler: The EU is not about to blink Big Brexit vote: What do I need to know? Reality Check: False claims over the euro Downing Street said the PM's focus was ""getting on with the work required to allow MPs to support the deal and to bring this stage of the process to an end"". The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the prime minister was ""likely"" to head to Strasbourg later - where the European Parliament is based. Allow Twitter content?

This was reiterated by Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney,who told a press conference he ""understands"" Mrs May is travelling to the city later,external. But neither No 10 or the European Commission have confirmed this, with a spokesperson for the latter saying: ""We keep talking and working."" The spokesperson did confirm, however, that the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Mrs May had spoken by phone on Monday. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March but MPs rejected the withdrawal deal on offer in January and demanded major changes. This video can not be played Is the UK in a crisis over leaving the EU? BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the mood was ""bleak"" in Brussels after the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, briefed EU ambassadors on the state of play earlier. Adam Fleming said the member states were told that the UK had rejected the EU's proposed solutions on the backstop because ""they wouldn't get the support of the Cabinet"". ""There is a widely held view that the UK has not been negotiating in good faith over the last few days,"" he said, adding that at least one diplomat had mentioned planning for a ""post-Theresa May government"". The government has been seeking changes to the Irish backstop, the safety net designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland, and only to be used as a last resort. But the details of it were a sticking point for many MPs when they voted her deal down in January. They worry that - in its current form - the backstop may leave the UK tied to the EU indefinitely. In a statement, the Commission said it had put forward proposals to try and reassure MPs the backstop ""if used will apply temporarily"". A spokesman said the EU was willing to meet UK negotiators at any time. Minister rejects 'May should quit' reports Reality Check: False claims over the euro 10 ways you could be affected by no-deal Brexit He added: ""We are committed to using our best endeavours to find a subsequent agreement that replaces the backstop... We are committed to ratifying this deal before 29 March."" Earlier, Mr Barnier said that talks about the UK's withdrawal from the bloc were now between the British government and MPs. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the chances of Parliament approving Mrs May's deal appeared ""very remote"" at this stage. She said it was still possible that the UK would come back with some new assurances from the EU over the backstop which could ""get the numbers down"" and limit the scale of any defeat. Theresa May has been attending the Commonwealth Day service in Westminster Abbey Mark Francois, a member of the European Research Group of Brexit-backing Tory MPs, said unless ""something amazing"" materialised, the outcome of Tuesday's vote would be similar to that in January - when the government lost by a record 230 votes. Former Labour cabinet minister Yvette Cooper said Mrs May ""had given...her word"" to MPs that this week's votes would happen. Ms Cooper, who has spearheaded parliamentary efforts to rule out a no-deal exit, called for talks on the withdrawal deal and the UK's exit to be put on hold while the PM tried to build a consensus in Parliament and the country. ""The stakes are far too high to assume she has this under control,"" she said. ""If she won't find a way forward, Parliament has a responsibility to do so instead."" There will be an urgent question from Labour in the Commons later, asking Mrs May for an update on the progress made in achieving legal changes to the withdrawal agreement and the timetable for its approval. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""imperative"" that Mrs May responded, rather than sending a junior minister. As things stand, the chances of Theresa May getting approval in the Commons tomorrow for her Brexit compromise, reversing a defeat of more than 200 votes, are very remote. That said, it is quite possible to get those numbers down. Despite the fact the talks are stuttering with Brussels, it is still likely there will be some kind of piece of paper that emerges from the Berlaymont building - those edifices in Brussels where negotiators have been locked for the past few days. There is likely to be some kind of reassurance on paper out of those talks, probably at some point later today. The political point though is this: It is very unlikely - very unlikely - that it's going to be enough to get the kind of revision to the deal that could comfortably reverse the defeat for the prime minister. That's why some MPs are starting to say, as they did last time, it is unwise for her to keep marching into gunfire to do again what no prime minister had done in recent memory - to go into a crucial vote all but knowing you are going to lose, and lose badly. And that's why things are so risky this week. Theresa May's deal is expected to face a ""meaningful vote"" in Parliament on Tuesday If it's rejected, a further vote has been promised for Wednesday on whether the UK should leave without a deal If that no-deal option is rejected, MPs could get a vote on Thursday on whether to request a delay to Brexit from the EU.

"Jack Grealish was attacked from behind by Paul Mitchell at St Andrew's A Birmingham City fan has been jailed for 14 weeks for attacking Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish during the second city derby. Paul Mitchell, of Rubery, Worcestershire, ran on to the pitch and hit Grealish from behind about 10 minutes into Sunday's game. Mitchell, 27, admitted assault and encroachment on to the pitch at Birmingham Magistrates' Court earlier. He ""cannot explain what came over him yesterday morning"", his solicitor said. ""His initial foolish intention was to just go on to the pitch and whip up the crowd,"" said Vaughn Whistance, defending. Pub worker Mitchell blew kisses while being led off the field Mitchell, of Cock Hill Lane, was also ordered to pay Â£350 in fines and costs and has been banned from attending any football matches in the UK for 10 years. The Â£350 includes Â£100 in compensation for Grealish's ""pain, discomfort and shock"". The Villa midfielder was able to continue with the game at St Andrew's andwent on to score the winning goal in the 67th minute. Mitchell, a pub worker, claimed he was not drunk when he invaded the pitch and punched Grealish in the jaw. Paul Mitchell's prison sentence ""should be a deterrent"", magistrates said ""I cannot help but feel how lucky I was in this incident,"" the player said. ""It could have been so much worse had the supporter had some sort of weapon."" Birmingham City apologised to both Grealish and Villa immediately after the game and said Mitchell had been banned from St Andrew's for life. He has also been banned from away games. The club said there were ""no excuses"" for his behaviour, which ""has no place in football"". Latest news from the West Midlands West Midlands Police said it was also investigating ""offensive social media posts"" that appeared after the goal referencing Grealish's younger brother, who died when the midfielder was four. Birmingham City said it had banned another supporter for life over the ""vile and malicious"" tweets. Grealish went on to score the winning goal for Aston Villa Mitchell, who has been a season ticket holder for 20 years, was said to be ""very remorseful"" after realising he had ""brought shame"" on his club. His defence asked for community service or a suspended prison sentence but magistrates ruled that a ""message had to be sent out to fans"". The father-of-one's prison sentence ""should be a deterrent"", magistrates added. During the court hearing, Mr Whistance said online threats had been made to Mitchell. Mr Whistance said his family had left the area ""through fear that they would suffer serious harm or even death"". An FA spokesperson said ""a line had been crossed"" and strongly condemned the attack, as well asanother pitch invasion during the Manchester United and Arsenal match. It has written to Birmingham City to examine the club's security measures. Grealish sat on the turf while Mitchell was apprehended The club said it had begun reviewing all of its stewarding, safety and security procedures ""as a matter of high importance"". ""We will be putting into place extra measures at our stadium designed to help ensure the safety of players, as well as supporters,"" a spokesman said. The club also confirmed it was investigating an incident involving a steward ""after Aston Villa players celebrated their goal on Sunday in front of their supporters in the Gil Merrick Stand"". Meanwhile, former England playerPhil Neville said drastic action was needed to ensure the safety of players. ""Either through points deductions or by emptying stadiums and making clubs play behind closed doors,"" he said. In 2002, a Birmingham City fan who ran on to the St Andrew's pitch and confronted Aston Villa goalkeeper Peter Enckelman was jailed for four months for encroaching the playing area and using threatening behaviour.

"EU sources are asking who Theresa May stands for when it comes to Brexit ""Is this a crunch week? Is this not a crunch week? What does this have to do with us any more?"" an EU diplomat from a country traditionally close to the UK asked me this weekend. ""Are you having meaningful votes? Are you not?"" says another. ""Does one cabinet minister agree with the other? Exactly what do you want changed to the backstop? Is the backstop really the only objection to the Withdrawal Agreement? It's up to you British. The EU has no magic wand to wave."" ""How can we move forward with the UK?"" another EU diplomat spluttered in frustration. ""We held talks this weekend, yes. But with whom? UK civil servants representing whom? Theresa May only?"" ""How can the EU conduct negotiations, when the other side (the UK) doesn't have one position but many? And they keep changing and contradicting."" The mood in the EU, I can assure you, is not one of a bloc that is poised to ""blink"" at the last moment. And there is huge irritation in EU circles that UK government fingers of blame are pointing at Brussels for what they see as EU intransigence. Brexit: A really simple guide New ideas for the Brexit border backstop ""We hear many in the UK saying 'oh, the EU always backs down last minute, and if they don't do it now it's because they want to punish the UK',"" one well-placed EU source said to me recently. ""These people citethe Greek debt crisis. But remember: at the time of the Greek debt crisis, our choice was clear. We moved to keep Greece in our club. We sent a message of unity to the world and we saved the euro (currency) from breaking apart. We protected the single market. We 'blinked' in our own interest. And (Greek Prime Minister Alexis) Tsipras made the decisions for the whole country. ""Who does Theresa May represent these days? And anyway the UK's goal is to leave us. We don't see dramatic changes in opinion polls."" ""Everyone seems to be fighting everyone,"" said one EU official The sense in the EU is that division and indecision will continue in parliament this week and into next. It's thought here that Theresa May (now known in Brussels for a habit of: ""when faced with a wall, delay, delay, delay if you can"") will soon begin to point ahead to the EU leaders' Brexit summit next week. The time for her next ""Battle for Britain"", as all backs are firmly lined up against the wall of the 29 March deadline. After all, the argument could go, only the leaders of the 27 EU countries ultimately have the legal ability to decisively change or alter the Withdrawal Agreement and therefore the backstop. That power does not lie with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker or EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Of course anything is possible. If the UK parliament does not approve an extension of the negotiations and hard Brexit looms the other side of 29 March, then some EU diplomats think it possible that EU leaders could, reluctantly, agree to an expiry date (or appearance of an expiry date) to the backstop - as long as that date is far enough into the future that, it's presumed, a trade deal or some alternative could be in place by then. 10 ways you could be affected by no-deal Brexit Deal or no deal - how are EU countries preparing? But, before anyone gets too excited or outraged by that suggestion, the above scenario, while possible, does not seem likely. As I've noted before in this blog,throughout the Brexit process those slamming the brakes on EU ""flexibility"" in negotiations have not been the often-demonised Brussels bureaucrats but EU national leaders, with France's President Emmanuel Macron in the front line. And don't imagine that the EU is salivating at the thought of a second referendum. EU leaders' idea of hell would be to postpone Brexit long enough for the vote, allowing the issue to overshadow so much other EU business, including upcoming European parliamentary elections, only for the second referendum result to be inconclusive and even more divisive than the first, thus maintaining Brexit as an unresolved open wound in the EU's side for even longer. ""We just want to get on with it"" is the EU's loud and clear message right now. Jeremy Corbyn (C) has announced Labour will back a second Brexit referendum And while the EU far prefers the type of Brexit advocated by Jeremy Corbyn - a softer Brexit, with the UK staying in the EU customs union and closely aligned with the European single market - his plan is clearly seen in Brussels as yet more ""magical thinking"" and ""cherry-picking"", though this time from the leader of the opposition. And why do I say that? Well, either you are a member of the single market or you are not. If you are, then free movement of people is part and parcel of the package, however much Mr Corbyn says it wouldn't be for him. That was the stumbling block for David Cameron - and he was the prime minister of a net-contributor EU member state at the time. Cameron: I don't regret calling referendum Something else for the Labour leader to take note of: you can't be a member of the EU customs union, yet have a free hand in making your own trade deals. Just after the Brexit vote in the UK, almost three years ago now, I remember a high-level EU official saying to me: ""Of course we (the EU) would prefer the UK to stay as close to us as possible after Brexit but, most importantly for successful negotiations with the UK, there needs to be a strong and stable (he did use those words) leader in 10 Downing Street, who knows what he or she wants, who can cut a deal in Brussels and sell it back home in Westminster."" Well, that hasn't really come to pass. EU officials reel off with an eye-roll the number of Brexit secretaries, intermediaries and, most recently, the UK Attorney General, Geoffey Cox, who have rolled into Brussels from London, with the perceived attitude of ""telling the Europeans what's what"" but without (I'm told at the highest levels here) a clear understanding of European law and of how the EU works. Mr Juncker and Mr Barnier: The EU wants to avoid Brexit clashing with the European elections The prediction now in Brussels is that Theresa May will end up asking the EU for an extension - a short one - to this negotiating period. Which she will get (under EU law, all 27 EU leaders need to agree on this). But you may be shocked to hear that the ""short"" three-month extension being debated in the UK is not the same ""short"" Brexit delay the EU has in mind right now. EU Parliament elections are held between 23 and 26 May. If the UK doesn't want to field its own candidates in the vote, then the current thinking in Brussels is that Brexit has to happen around 20 May. And if you are hoping for that infamous ""EU blink"" before then, I will leave you with the thoughts of a well-placed Brussels official: ""Things would be different, if Theresa May had one, clear objective in these last-minute negotiations. A clear concession - that we could grant at a push - that would turn things around definitively in Westminster."" ""But we look at the UK and everyone seems to be fighting everyone - about the backstop or whether Brexit should happen at all; over Norway or no deal and whether Theresa May should stay or go. There are splits in the prime minister's cabinet; we even see UK civil servants disagreeing amongst themselves now."" ""These are UK domestic problems, yet the prime minister looks to us (the EU) to sort it out. We can't. We simply can't.""

Adrian Toole said it was ""tragic"" that 36-year-old Joanna would not be able to achieve more in her career with the UN. Tributes have also been paid to Kenyan and British dual national Joseph Waithaka and University of Plymouth graduate Sarah Auffret. The Foreign Office said at least seven Britons were among the dead.

Hetold Devon Live,externalshe was a ""very soft and loving person"" and that they were ""still in a state of shock"" over her death. ""Joanna was genuinely one of those people who you never heard a bad word about."" He said her job involved a lot of travel, but added: ""Personally, I never wanted her to be on a single one of those planes. ""I'm an environmental campaigner myself - so partly it was because of the damage to the environment but also because it's a dangerous occupation to be flying. Up until now she had been lucky."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Toole paid tribute to her 15 years working in international animal welfare organisations: ""I'm very proud of what she achieved. It's just tragic that she couldn't carry on to further her career and achieve more."" ""She was very well known in her own line of business and we've had many tributes already paid to her,"" he added. He said he remembered when she was a small child she had tried to save badgers from being run over on a new road near her home. Ms Toole, who worked for the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), was travelling to the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi. The director of the FAO, Manuel Barange,tweeted,external: ""So profoundly sad and lost for words at the loss of our wonderful @FAOfish officer @JoannaToole"".

The Boeing 737 Max-8 aircraft that crashed on Sunday Ethiopian Airlines said it had contacted the families of all the victims, who came from 35 nations - including 18 Canadians, nine Ethiopians and eight Americans. At least 19 victims were affiliated with the United Nations, according to a UN official. The cause of the disaster is not yet known. However, the pilot had reported difficulties and had asked to return to Addis Ababa, the airline said. Another plane of the same model was involved in a crash less than five months ago, whena Lion Air flight crashed into the sea near Indonesiawith nearly 190 people on board.

"This video can not be played Kim Jong-nam: Indonesian woman freed in murder case The Indonesian woman accused of killing Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korea's leader, has been freed after charges against her were dropped. Siti Aisyah had been accused of smearing VX nerve agent on Mr Kim's face in Kuala Lumpur airport in 2017. She and her co-accused, Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong, deny murder and say they thought they were part of a TV prank. The brazen killing at an international airport left observers stunned and gripped international headlines. After several months of delay, the defence phase of the trial was set to begin Monday, with testimony from Ms Huong. However, the prosecutor in the case requested the murder charge for Siti Aisyah be dropped, without giving a reason. Who are the two women of the Kim Jong-nam murder? The world's most unusual assassinations In a letter to the Indonesian law minister though, Malaysia's attorney general explained the decision was taking into account considerations Jakarta raised about the case as well as the good relations between the two countries. The judge approved the request, saying ""Siti Aisyah is freed"", according to AFP news agency. However, this does not amount to an acquittal. Doan Thi Huong (left) and Siti Aisyah (right) say they were tricked by North Korean agents into carrying out the killing Ms Aisyah could have faced the death penalty if convicted. ""I feel happy. I did not know this will happen. I did not expect it,"" AFP cites Ms Aisyah saying as she left the court. BBC correspondent Jonathan Head, who is at the court in Kuala Lumpur, says there appears to have been less evidence against her than against her Vietnamese co-defendant. Ms Huong had initially been expected to read a statement in court, which would have been the first time either of the two gave testimony. However, her case has now been adjourned at the request of her lawyers. Kim Jong-nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, had been waiting to board a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Macau on 13 February 2017 when two women approached him in the departure area. CCTV footage showed one of them placing her hands over his face, then both women leaving the scene. Mr Kim died on the way to hospital from what was later found to be exposure to the nerve agent VX, one of the most toxic of all known chemical agents. North Korea has fiercely denied any involvement in the killing, but four men - believed to be North Koreans who fled Malaysia on the day of the murder - have also been charged in the case. They remain at large despite an Interpol ""red notice"", equivalent to an international arrest warrant. North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis Stop romanticising a dictator, say N Koreans The two women have said they were innocent victims of an elaborate North Korean plot. According to their lawyers, in the days before Mr Kim's death the women had been paid to take part in pranks where they wiped liquid on people at airports, hotels and shopping malls. Kim Jong-nam, pictured in 2001, the late half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un They thought they were taking part in another prank at the airport. Their lawyers had expressed confidence that the court would see they had no motive to kill Mr Kim. After the court's surprise decision on Monday, the Indonesian ambassador to Malaysia told reporters they would ""try to fly Siti back to Indonesia today or as soon as possible,"" according to AFP. Kim Jong-nam was the older half-brother of North Korea's authoritarian ruler, Kim Jong-un. He was once seen as a future leader of the isolated country, but when his father Kim Jong-il died, was bypassed in favour of the younger Kim. He was largely estranged from the family, and spent most of his time overseas in Macau, mainland China and Singapore. He had spoken out in the past against his family's dynastic control of North Korea, and in a 2012 book was quoted as saying he believed his half-brother lacked leadership qualities.

"The four-hour A&E target may be dropped under plans announced by NHS England. NHS bosses have unveiled plans for an overhaul of the A&E target alongside changes to waiting times for cancer, mental health and planned operations. It said the targets were becoming outdated. But it comes after many of them have been missed for years. Instead of aiming to see and treat virtually all A&E patients in four hours, the sickest patients will be prioritised for quick treatment. NHS England wants to see patients coming in with heart attacks, acute asthma, sepsis and stroke starting their care within an hour. The changes will be piloted this year and, if successful, could be introduced in 2020. The plans have been unveiled after NHS England was asked by the prime minister to look at the system of targets last year.  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. The four-hour target, which expects 95% of patients to be seen in time, was introduced in 2004 and has not been met since July 2015. Last month, only two hospital trusts hit it. NHS England said the current target seemed to be distorting priorities. It pointed out that large numbers of patients were admitted into hospital just before the four-hour mark, which has the effect of ""stopping the clock"". NHS England said hospitals appeared to be motivated by the target rather than doing what was best for the patient. But it said a final decision over whether or not to definitely scrap it would not be made until after piloting takes places over the rest of the year. Currently, the target treats everyone the same - whether a patient has a sore thumb or has had a heart attack. That, of course, does not mean staff do. All accident and emergency units have systems in place to prioritise the sickest patients. It is just that how long they wait is not recorded and published publicly. In doing this, the change will put pressure on those hospitals that are not seeing such patients quickly. That is obviously a benefit. But for people with less urgent needs, there is concern that dropping the four-hour target could mean they wait longer. NHS England plans to counter this by recording the average waits and introducing a new measure to record when all patients see a senior doctor or nurse. But nonetheless the changes still send a clear signal about the pecking order - and, in an under pressure system, that could lead to ""less important"" cases waiting longer. Not many people would argue with that if it is someone with a sore thumb. But if a patient has a broken bone or is bleeding and is in pain, that is likely to be viewed differently. The NHS will also move towards average waiting times for planned operations, such as knee and hip replacements. Currently 92% of patients should be seen in 18 weeks. But that has not been met since February 2016. Cancer targets - for which there are nine separate ones - will be simplified so that there are two key targets for treatment starting on top of the incoming 28-day goal for diagnosis - something that is not currently measured. Meanwhile, new targets will be introduced for mental health care with the goal of ensuring that everyone who needs urgent crisis care in the community receives it within 24 hours. Access to other community mental health services - for children and adults - will be expected in four weeks. This is the first time that these services will have had targets attached to them. NHS England medical director Stephen Powis said: ""Now is the right time to look again at the old targets, which have such a big influence on how care is delivered, to make sure they take account of the latest treatments and techniques and support, not hinder, staff to deliver the kind of responsive, high-quality services that people want to see."" Many groups, including medical royal colleges, regulators and patient groups have broadly welcomed the plans. Prof Ted Baker, the chief inspector of hospitals at the Care Quality Commission, said that while the four-hour target had been ""valuable"" in focusing efforts on improving emergency care, it was the right time to find a better way to measure performance. ""Emergency departments need a set of standards which give priority to patients with life-threatening conditions."" But the Royal College of Emergency Medicine said it was against the four-hour target being scrapped and instead said it should survive alongside the new measures. ""We are keen to ensure that any changes are not imposed due to political will, but are developed responsibly, collaboratively and are based upon clinical expert consensus in the best interests of patients,"" added college president Dr Taj Hassan. Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said there was a concern the changes could lead to ""the return to the bad old days of long waits"". Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have a similar four-hour target, but there are no plans to change it. The way the other targets work is quite different.

"Sinclair was 69 when he was finally convicted 37 years after the World's End murders Angus Sinclair, one of Scotland's most notorious murderers, has died at the age of 73. He was convicted of four killings, including the 1977 World's End murders, but was suspected of killing four more women in Glasgow the same year. Sinclair had been in prison since 1982 after being convicted of a series of rapes and indecent attacks on children. Kevin Scott, the brother of one of the murder victims, described the serial killer as a ""monster"". Sinclair was jailed for a minimum of 37 years after being found guilty of murdering Helen Scott and her friend Christine Eadie. Christine Eadie and Helen Scott were killed in October 1977 Speaking to BBC Scotland, Mr Scott said: ""He was a monster.  To treat innocent people the way he did was just evil.  You would need to be a beast to commit those crimes. ""I would have wanted him to live longer to serve more of the 37 year sentence, as opposed to getting the easy way out. ""I do feel for the families of the other victims that he may have had. They'll never be afforded the kind of justice that we received."" The Scottish Prison Service confirmed on Monday that Sinclair died overnight at HMP Glenochil in Alloa, Clackmannanshire. It is understood that he had suffered from a series of strokes. A lifetime of abuse, rape and murder Was Angus Sinclair Scotland's worst serial killer? Double jeopardy law change led to guilty verdict How Angus Sinclair was caught by DNA Sinclair, who grew up in Glasgow, was 16 when he carried out his first killing in 1961. He raped and strangled seven-year old neighbour Catherine Reehill before disposing of her body. However, he was released in his early 20s after serving just six years. Angus Sinclair is thought to have killed six women within seven months in 1977. He went on to kill two more women In 1977, six women disappeared after nights out, and were found dumped on deserted farmland or waste ground. Four of the victims - Frances Barker, Hilda McAuley, Agnes Cooney and Anna Kenny - were killed in Glasgow. Teenagers Helen Scott and Christine Eadie went missing after last being seen at the World's End pub on Edinburgh's Royal Mile in October 1977. They were found dead six miles apart in the East Lothian countryside the next day. Despite the biggest manhunt in Scottish police history, the identity of their killer remained a mystery for decades. Catherine Reehill, seven Christine Eadie, 17 Helen Scott, 17 Mary Gallacher, 17 Frances Barker, 37 Hilda McAuley, 36 Agnes Cooney, 23 Anna Kenny, 20 In 1982, Sinclair was jailed for life after he admitted 11 charges of rape and indecent assault. Almost 20 years later, when he was being prepared for parole, a cold case review revealed that Sinclair's DNA had been found on Mary Gallacher - who was murdered in Glasgow in 1978. He was given another life sentence after being found guilty of her murder. Following that case, police began to examine the link between Sinclair and several other unsolved cases. Scientific advances put Sinclair in the frame for the World's End murders. Christine and Helen were last seen in the World's End pub on Edinburgh's Royal Mile He first stood trial in 2007, accused of killing Christine Eadie and Helen Scott. However, the case collapsed due to insufficient evidence. But following a change to Scotland's double jeopardy law, Sinclair was prosecuted a second time and found guilty of the murders in 2014. The sentencing judge described Sinclair as a dangerous predator capable of sinking to the depths of depravity, and said the words ""evil"" and ""monster"" were inadequate for him. He was sentenced toa minimum of 37 years in prisonfor the murders of the two teenagers - the longest handed out by a Scottish court.

"The 355,000 players caught cheating on Apex Legends were all using the PC version of the game, the studio behind the game has said. Respawn Entertainment said it intended to be ""secretive"" about its plans to combat cheating, so as not to forewarn players trying to break the rules. Apex Legends has attracted 50 million players since its release last month. It is often compared with Fortnite, which has 200 million players and was released in July 2017. Both shooter games are in the form of Battle Royale - where players fight against each other until only one survives. Apex Legends v Fortnite: The battle for Battle Royale In Apex Legends, gamers play in three-player squads rather than as individuals. They pick from one of eight possible pre-defined characters, each with different abilities and roles. Apex Legends also has more realistic graphics than the cartoon-style feel of Fortnite. Legends draws heavily on work that Respawn did on the Titanfall 2 video game. In an update on Reddit,,externalRespawn said it would be adding a report feature which would take players through to anti-cheat platform Easy Anti-Cheat. ""The service works but the fight against cheaters is an ongoing war that we'll need to continue to adapt to and be very vigilant about fighting,"" it said. ""We take cheating very seriously and care deeply about the health of Apex Legends for all players."" Games analyst Piers Harding-Rolls from IHS Markit told the BBC that cheating on the Windows PC version is more common because it is easier to download a cheat application. ""Reducing cheating is an ongoing process for games publishers and a significant operating cost,"" he said. ""The battle is never won, as new cheats and hacks are appearing all the time. ""Big publishers or developers like Respawn create teams of anti-cheating staff to target cheaters and also work with specialist companies to apply anti-cheating software which is integrated into their client software.""

"Gas from Glengorm could be tied back to the Elgin-Franklin or Culzean platforms Forecasts of how much oil and gas could be produced by the UK offshore industry have been revised upwards. The industry regulator now believes 11.9 billion barrels will be extracted by 2050, up from an estimate of eight billion four years ago. So far, 43 billion barrels of oil or its gas equivalent have been extracted from UK waters. The new prediction is driven by lower production costs, technical advances and 30 new fields coming on stream. Gas find hailed as biggest in decade Call for deal to protect oil and gas sector UK reserves to last 'at least 20 years' Estimates of oil and gas potential have been part of the debate about the financial situation facing Scotland should it become independent. The Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) forecast in 2015 that a further eight billion barrels could be pumped by 2050, but that has now been raised by 3.9 billion barrels. Head of performance, planning and reporting at the OGA, Loraine Pace, said: ""The 3.9 billion barrels identified is great news with 2018 being a productive year. ""New discoveries such as Glendronach and Glengorm highlight the future potential of the basin which could be boosted further with new investment, exploration successes and resource progression."" The regulator, reporting to the Treasury ahead of the chancellor's spring statement, said oil output last year was up 8.9 % last year, the highest UK oil production rate since 2011. Gas production, however, fell by 3%. The total is expected to fall from this year onwards, but at a slower rate than previously forecast. Capital expenditure also fell for the fourth successive year, although this trend is expected to be reversed in 2019.

"The four-hour A&E target may be dropped under plans announced by NHS England. NHS bosses have unveiled plans for an overhaul of the A&E target alongside changes to waiting times for cancer, mental health and planned operations. It said the targets were becoming outdated. But it comes after many of them have been missed for years. Instead of aiming to see and treat virtually all A&E patients in four hours, the sickest patients will be prioritised for quick treatment. NHS England wants to see patients coming in with heart attacks, acute asthma, sepsis and stroke starting their care within an hour. The changes will be piloted this year and, if successful, could be introduced in 2020. The plans have been unveiled after NHS England was asked by the prime minister to look at the system of targets last year.  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. The four-hour target, which expects 95% of patients to be seen in time, was introduced in 2004 and has not been met since July 2015. Last month, only two hospital trusts hit it. NHS England said the current target seemed to be distorting priorities. It pointed out that large numbers of patients were admitted into hospital just before the four-hour mark, which has the effect of ""stopping the clock"". NHS England said hospitals appeared to be motivated by the target rather than doing what was best for the patient. But it said a final decision over whether or not to definitely scrap it would not be made until after piloting takes places over the rest of the year. Currently, the target treats everyone the same - whether a patient has a sore thumb or has had a heart attack. That, of course, does not mean staff do. All accident and emergency units have systems in place to prioritise the sickest patients. It is just that how long they wait is not recorded and published publicly. In doing this, the change will put pressure on those hospitals that are not seeing such patients quickly. That is obviously a benefit. But for people with less urgent needs, there is concern that dropping the four-hour target could mean they wait longer. NHS England plans to counter this by recording the average waits and introducing a new measure to record when all patients see a senior doctor or nurse. But nonetheless the changes still send a clear signal about the pecking order - and, in an under pressure system, that could lead to ""less important"" cases waiting longer. Not many people would argue with that if it is someone with a sore thumb. But if a patient has a broken bone or is bleeding and is in pain, that is likely to be viewed differently. The NHS will also move towards average waiting times for planned operations, such as knee and hip replacements. Currently 92% of patients should be seen in 18 weeks.

"The Amazon Echo is just one of various types of smart speaker Question: ""Alexa - what is now being used to help calculate the cost of living in the UK?"" Answer: ""I am."" Smart speakers, such as the Amazon Echo device (or Alexa), have been added to the basket of goods used to measure the movement of prices. These price movements of 700 goods and services are used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to calculate the rate of inflation. The latest annual review has also added bakeware but envelopes are out. Amazon Alexa heard and sent private chat UK inflation falls to two-year low in January The addition of baking items, such as trays and roasting tins, reflected the success of TV programmes such as the Great British Bake Off. The Great British Bake Off has inspired many people to bake There are some clear changes from lifestyles in previous decades as the move towards electronic communication, rather than letter-writing, has meant envelopes have been removed. The three-piece suite and crockery sets, once signs of an upwardly-mobile household, have also been taken out as people tend to buy individual items of furniture, rather than a set. The former has been replaced by single settees and the latter by just dinner plates. Washing powder was no longer needed as liquid was being used instead, the ONS said. Hi-fi systems have also gone, made redundant by streaming services as well as smart and portable speakers. However, there is now a place for electric toothbrushes in the basket. Flavoured tea has also been added owing to its rising popularity and increased shelf-space in supermarkets. In all, 16 items have been added this year, 10 have been removed and 16 modified, with 688 unchanged,the ONS said,external. Some 180,000 prices are measured in 20,000 UK outlets to calculate inflation, which itself is used as a benchmark for our finances. This basket of goods reflects contemporary habits and technology to work out the inflation rate, which charts the changing cost of living. The ONS also aims to ensure that each sector of goods and services, and where items are bought, are reflected adequately in the calculations. That is why peanut butter, and shop-bought popcorn have also been added this year. Children's fiction, suitable for six to 12-year-olds has also been added, to close a gap in the coverage of books between illustrated books for infants and teenage literature in the basket. ONS senior statistician Philip Gooding said: ""We want to reflect modern spending habits, and the alterations we have made highlight shifting consumer behaviour, whether that is in technology, the home, or the way we communicate with one another. ""It is important to remember that we change a small percentage of the overall basket.""

"Public health chiefs have proposed a ban on cars idling outside school gates in a bid to cut air pollution. The measure is among aseries of UK-wide recommendations,externalput forward by Public Health England. PHE medical director Paul Cosford told the BBC: ""We should stop idling outside schools and we should make sure that children can walk or cycle to school."" PHE said 28,000 to 36,000 deaths a year in the UK could be attributed to long-term exposure to air pollution. Wood burners under fire in clean air plan Watch: how pollution moves across Europe The report said local authorities could implement no-idling zones in areas with vulnerable hotspots such as schools, hospitals and care homes. It also recommends a wider uptake of low emission or clean air zones to discourage the most highly polluting vehicles from entering populated areas. It describes air pollution as the biggest environmental threat to health in the UK and says there is strong evidence that air pollution causes the development of coronary heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease and lung cancer, and exacerbates asthma. Although England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales lead on air quality policy in their own territories, PHE contributes to the implementation of the government's UK-wide strategy. Professor Cosford told BBC Radio 5 Live conversations needed to be had between local authorities, schools and parents about how to ""stop the emissions at source"". The PHE review also recommends: Redesigning cities so people aren't so close to highly polluting roads by, for example, designing wider streets or using hedges to screen against pollutants Investing more in clean public transport as well as foot and cycle paths Encouraging uptake of low emission vehicles by setting more ambitious targets for installing electric car charging points Discouraging highly polluting vehicles from entering populated areas with incentives such as low emission or clean air zones This video can not be played UK scientists estimate air pollution cuts British people's lives by an average of six months Prof Cosford said: ""Transport and urban planners will need to work together with others involved in air pollution to ensure that new initiatives have a positive impact. ""Decision makers should carefully design policies to make sure that the poorest in society are protected against the financial implications of new schemes."" PHE said that national government policy could support these local actions - for example, they could allow controls on industrial emissions in populated areas to take account of health impacts.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to leave the EU ""do or die"" by the 31 October - the date the UK must depart if no deal has been reached. But a government document outlining ""reasonable worst case assumptions"" in the event of such a no-deal Brexit has warned of rising food and fuel prices, disruption to medicine supplies and public disorder. An extra Â£2.1bn of funding has been announced to help deal with the consequences of no deal. How could you be affected if the UK does leave the EU without an agreement? What you find on the supermarket shelves could well be where you see the first effects. Almost 30% of our food currently comes from the EU, and it is likely that some foods, such as fresh vegetables and fruit, will become more scarce and more expensive in the event of no deal. Thefive-page document spelling out the government's worst-case assumptions under Operation Yellowhammer,external- the government's no-deal contingency plan - warns: Some fresh food supplies will decrease Key ingredients for food made in the UK may be in shorter supply There won't be a shortage of food overall, but there could be reduced availability and choice Prices may also increase ""which could impact vulnerable groups"" Supermarkets themselves have warned thatthere could be empty shelves and higher prices. In preparation, supermarkets say they have been stockpiling some foods - but they are unable to do that for some fresh fruit and veg. Stockpiling is more of a challenge at this time of year too, businesses say, aswarehouse capacity is already strained by the seasonal stock build-up ahead of Black Friday and Christmas,external. The government has said it will continue to recognise EU standards for imported food, to minimise disruption. It has alsopublished a ""tariff schedule"",,externalwhich has removed most tariffs on imports in the event of no deal. Shoppers planning to buy from companies based in the EU, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland after a no-deal Brexit have also been warnedcredit and debit card charges may be higher and payments may take longer,external. Government advice for the food and drink sector,external Government advice on buying things from Europe after Brexit,external What does Yellowhammer say about no-deal impact? Although there is not expected to be an immediate disruption to electricity or gas supplies, there arelikely to be significant price rises,externalfor businesses and households, the government's Yellowhammer report warns. The market price for electricity could climb because of a fall in the value of the pound against the euro, but also as a result of cutting ties with EU energy markets. Yellowhammer warned this could mean that some energy firms ""exit"" the energy market, ""exacerbating"" the economic and political impact of Brexit. The warnings echo the findings of a 2017 House of Lords report, which saidthe UK could be ""more vulnerable to supply shortages,externalin the event of extreme weather or unplanned generation outages"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  46%UK domestic production 45%Imported via European pipelines, inc from Russia and Norway 8%Liquefied natural gas imports The risk would arise as a result of the UK's exit from the EU's Internal Energy Market, it said. The bulk of the UK's natural gas imports come via Norway, which is part of the Internal Energy Market, although it is not an EU member. But the government says trade in gas between the UK and Norway will continue in its current form regardless. Brexit 'could leave UK short of energy' Millions of people from the UK travel abroad each year - the vast majority of journeys made to Europe. If you are planning to make a journey to an EU member state after Brexit, the government is advising you to check you have the right paperwork. Travel to Ireland will not change, even if there's no deal. You'll continue to be able to travel and work there in the same way as before. Passports The government isadvising you to make sure your passport is valid for at least six months,externalif you are travelling to most countries in Europe - thefull list is here,external. Until recently, UK citizens who renewed their passport before it expired could have up to nine months of the remaining validity added to their new travel document. But the government has now warned that this time carried over may not count towards the six-month requirement after a no-deal Brexit. You can check if your passport has enough time leftwith this government tool.,external You'll need torenew your passport before travelling,externalif you do not have enough validity left. It usually takes three weeks. Visas You won't need a visa for stays of up to 90 days out of any 180-day period in the EU or Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland (the European Economic Area). However, you may need a visa or permit to stay for longer, or to work or study. When new rules are confirmed, information about visa requirements will be oneach country's travel advice page.,external Border control The government has also advised that at EU borders you may need to: show a return or onward ticket show you have enough money for your stay use separate queueing lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens The government's Yellowhammer report also warns there may also be increased immigration checks at EU borders causing delays at airports and ports. European health cover In addition, if there is no deal, thenin theory the cover provided by your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) would cease to exist. The government is advising travellers ""whether there's a deal or not"" to ""get appropriate travel insurance with healthcare cover"". Ministers say it is ""particularly important"" to get travel insurance with the right cover if you have a pre-existing medical condition.,externalThis is because the EHIC scheme covers pre-existing conditions, while many travel insurance policies do not. Travel However you intend to travel, in the event of no-deal Brexit, the government says, you should check before you leave for any delays or disruption. If you intend to drive in the EU, you'll need some extra documents: a ""green card"", which proves your insurance provides the minimum required cover (obtained from your vehicle insurance company) a GB sticker an International Driving Permit for some countries (you cancheck if you need one,externalon the Post Office website) The government says flights, ferries and cruises, the Eurostar and Eurotunnel and bus and coach services between the UK and the EU will continue to run as normal. An earlier government assessment hadwarned of long queues at London's St Pancras International, the main Eurostar terminal in the UK,external, but Eurostar bosses have said they are working to ensuretheir services run as smoothly as possible. However, the government does warn some bus and coach services to non-EU countries, such as Switzerland or Andorra, may not be able to run. Pets After Brexit you will not be able to use the existing pet passport scheme and will instead need to follow adifferent process, involving a number of vet's tests,external. The process could take up to four months. Bank cards If you have a UK bank account and intend to use your bank card to pay for goods and services while you are in the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway,the government has warned that it may become more expensive.,external Full government travel advice,external How will it affect my holidays to Europe? While there are regular fluctuations in medicine supplies, there areconcerns a no-deal Brexit could make shortages worse. The government's Yellowhammer document warns supplies of medicines and medical products are ""particularly vulnerable"" to disruption at Channel ports. While some products can be stockpiled, others can't because of their short shelf life, it says. More than 12,000 medicines are used by the NHS, andabout 7,000 come from or via the EU. Ministers and NHS leaders say every effort is being made to ensure there will be enough medicines and clinical equipment available in the event of delays to imports from the EU. The government has announced a further Â£434m of funding and other measures, including: extra warehouse space for medicines securing additional roll-on, roll-off freight capacity in ports away from Dover and Folkestone building buffer stocks booking plane space for products requiring immediate shipment making changes to regulatory requirements strengthening processes to deal with shortages However, the National Audit Office has said there are still""significant"" gapsin the government's preparation regarding the NHS and care homes. Government advice on medicine supply,external Should NHS patients be worried? About 1.3 million UK-born people live in the other 27 EU countries. The UK government has requested that EU countries reciprocate its promise to uphold the rights of EU citizens in the UK, meaning UK citizens living in the EU would be able to continue their lives broadly as now. In event of no deal, this would ensure they would have continued access to employment, healthcare, education, benefits and other services. However, the government's Yellowhammer document warns that as UK nationals will lose their EU citizenship, they can ""expect to lose associated rights and access to services over time"". The government has announced a public information campaign and an increase in consular support for Britons living abroad, costing Â£138m. It advises UK citizens living in the EU to subscribe to updates from the relevantcountry advice pages.,external Health UK nationals living in, working in, or visiting the EU may find their access to healthcare in EU member states will change after the UK leaves the EU with no deal. This will depend on decisions made by each country. However, the UK government says it is seeking bilateral agreements to maintain healthcare rights, as a top priority. Its Yellowhammer report warns that whileEU countries should treat people with urgent needs, they may be required to pay. This could mean some people facing ""substantial costs"".,external Information on how to access healthcare abroad,externalcan be found on the NHS website. Pensions The UK government will continue to pay state pension, child benefits, and disability benefits to eligible UK nationals in the EU. Tax The UK's exit from the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements, which apply to EU countries. These ensure everyone - not just British citizens - living in a country that has a treaty with the UK will not pay tax in two countries on the same income or gain - and determine which country has primary taxing rights. Full government advice for UK nationals living in the EU,external How would no deal affect UK citizens in the EU? Drivers UK nationals who live in the EU, European Economic Area or Switzerland should swap their UK driving licences for a local licence before 31 October 2019. If there is no deal, licence exchange arrangements may stop and UK licence holders may have to retake their driving test in the country where they live. The UK government has reached an agreement with the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland, that will protect the rights of EU citizens and their family members living in the UK. There are currently 2.37 million EU nationals working in Britain, according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS). The ONS has revised its estimates for overall arrivals to the UK - both from the EU and the rest of the world. Those new figures show the number of people arriving from the EU had been rising before the referendum. Statisticians have not yet adjusted the figures for EU immigration after 2016, but unrevised figures showed a steep decline. If you are an EU citizen and living in the UK, the government has atool to find out what you need to do and when.,external Government advice on applying for settled and pre-settled status,external Home Office minister Brandon Lewis has warned thatthe UK will deport EU citizensafter Brexit if they do not apply for the right to remain in time. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Importing goods from the EU is likely to get more expensive when free movement of goods ends with the UK's departure. As a member of the EU, UK firms don't have to pay extra duties, taxes or have customs checks on goods travelling to or from the EU. But after a no-deal Brexit, new rules will apply. UK businesses will need to apply the same processes to EU trade that apply when trading with the rest of the world. Individuals may also have to pay VAT, duty and fees if they receive parcels worth more than Â£135. In March,the government published a 1,477-page documentoutlining its plans for tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In October it published anupdate,externalto the plans which trade minister Conor Burns said are designed to support the UK economy. A tariff is a tax applied to goods that are traded on international markets. Mostly, they are applied to imported goods by the country importing them. But there can also be tariffs on exported goods. Under the temporary scheme, 88% of imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access. At the moment, 80% of imports are tariff free. Tariffs would be maintained to protect some industries, including agriculture. Beef, lamb, poultry and some dairy products would receive protection. How will the new tariff system work? Government guide to no-deal tariffs,external Most commentators and industry experts agree uncertainty created by the Brexit process is causing buyers and sellers to sit tight, causing a slowdown in the housing market. UK house pricesrose at a slower rate in the year to July than at any time since September 2012,according to the Office of National Statistics. Brexit uncertainty meant key aspects of the housing market were""pretty much flatlining"", the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has said. The Bank of England says theimpact of the UK leaving the EU on the housing market could be significant. It has said house prices could fall by up to 30% from pre-Brexit levels if there was no deal, or a ""disorderly Brexit"". In July, the Office for Budget responsibility estimated a possible 10%fall in house prices,externalby 2021 in the event of no-deal. But bad news for homeowners might be better news for first time buyers trying to get a foot on the property ladder. Will the value of your home change in 2019? Up to85% of lorries using the main channel crossings ""may not be ready"" for French customs and could face queues of two-and-a-half days,,externalthe government's Yellowhammer report warns. These queues at Channel ports could reduce the flow of trucks to 40-60% of current levels within a day, it says, with the worst disruption lasting up to three months. Even after that time, traffic flows may only reach 50-70% of current levels and delays could lead to queues in Kent and other routes to France for significantly longer, the report said. A simple guide to the UK leaving the EU A jargon-busting guide to the key terms In the event of bottlenecks, a traffic management system known as Operation Brock would come into force on a section of the M20. Traffic would be allowed to flow in both directions on the same carriageway, while lorries would be left queuing on the other side. If that proved to be insufficient, a disused airfield near Ramsgate would be used as a lorry park, and if further capacity was still required, the M26 could also be used. Kent County Council says it hasemployed extra staff and stockpiled supplies in preparation for six months of disruption in the event of no deal. To ensure more lorries are ready for customs, the government announced last month that88,000 companies would be automatically enrolled in a new customs system. The government has also announced Â£344m more funding to be spent on new border and customs operations. Could leaving with no deal cause traffic jams? Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? What would no deal mean for lorry drivers? More than 16,000 British students studied on placements organised by the Erasmus study abroad scheme - in place since the 1980s - in 2016-17. UK universities say they would expecta similar number to be planning to do the same this coming academic year.,external The government and the EU have agreed thatpeople who have already started Erasmus trips will be able to continue them,external. This is true for both UK students planning to go to EU countries, and EU nationals hoping to come to the UK. The government has also issued a ""guarantee"" that funding will be available to UK organisations who have had Erasmus applications approved by the European Commission at the time the UK departs, but which have not yet begun. Institutions are beingadvised to apply for this ""HMG guarantee"",externalto ensure they get the funding.

"On Tuesday, MPs will pass their verdict on Prime Minister Theresa May's plan to take Britain out of the European Union on 29 March. Here is what you need to know about the vote. At 7pm on Tuesday evening, after a full day of debate. They are passing judgement on the deal Theresa May spent two years negotiating with the European Union. Brexit: What could happen next? This is the big one. If MPs vote the deal down, one of two things is likely to happen. The UK will either leave the EU on 29 March without a withdrawal agreement - or that departure date will be delayed. If they back the deal, the UK will leave the EU on 29 March but things will stay broadly as they are until December 2020, while the two sides thrash out a permanent trade deal. Yes - andby a massive margin. Mrs May said she secured ""legally binding"" changes to her Brexit deal on Monday, a day ahead of MPs voting on it. She said the first change could be used to start a ""formal dispute"" against the EU if it tried to keep the UK tied into the backstop - the safety net designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland - indefinitely. The second is a ""joint statement"" from the EU and the UK. It adds to the political declaration on the UK and EU's future relationship and commits to replacing the backstop with alternative arrangements by December 2020. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, the government's chief law officer, haspublished updated legal advice,externalon the prime minister's deal, saying the new provisions secured by Mrs May ""reduce the risk"" of the UK being ""indefinitely and involuntarily"" held  in the backstop. But his advice adds that ""the legal risk remains unchanged"" that the UK would have no legal means of exiting without EU agreement. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. If MPs vote down Mrs May's withdrawal agreement on Tuesday, then MPs have been promised a vote on whether the UK should leave without a deal or not. This is likely to take place on Wednesday. If they back a no-deal Brexit in this vote, then the UK will leave without a deal on 29 March. If they reject a no-deal Brexit then they could get a vote on Thursday on whether to request a delay to Brexit from the EU. Not necessarily. If Mrs May loses the vote on Tuesday by a narrow margin, she could ask the EU for a short technical delay to allow everyone to regroup and make one last push to get it ""over the line"". Mrs May could make that final push at the next EU summit on 22 March, with another Commons vote to follow, assuming she can get a delay to Brexit. Brexit: If not 29 March, then when? Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button The first thing to stress is that it is not a trade deal. It is simply an agreement to allow the UK to leave the EU in an orderly fashion, minimising disruption to businesses and citizens of the UK and EU nations. Things would carry on pretty much as usual for at least 21 months after the official departure date of 29 March. During that time, the two sides would try to hammer out a permanent trading relationship - the overall aim of those talks is set out in the political declaration on the future relationship between the UK and EU, which MPs are also voting on. The withdrawal agreement also commits the UK to paying a Â£39bn ""divorce bill"". UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, would also retain their residency and social security rights. The withdrawal agreement - what it all means The decision MPs make on Tuesday will shape the UK's economy and society for decades to come, influencing incomes, job prospects and much else besides. There may also be some more immediate consequences. Many fear a no-deal Brexit will cause chaos at ports, disruption to food and medical supplies and long-term economic damage, with big multinational companies moving out of the UK. Others say these fears are exaggerated and the UK will thrive when it has made a clean break from the EU. The ""Irish backstop"" clause. This is a bit of legal jargon that is meant to prevent the return of cameras and border guards along the 310 mile border between Ireland and Northern Ireland - the only land border between the EU and the UK. It would keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, avoiding the need for physical checks on vehicles passing through the border, which many fear could reignite the Northern Irish Troubles. It is only meant to kick in if the two sides have not agreed a trade deal by December 2020 - and it is meant to be temporary. But because there is no end date written into the agreement, and no way of quitting it without the EU's say-so, many MPs fear it will become permanent, effectively making a mockery of Brexit. These MPs want a time-limit on the backstop - something the EU has ruled out. The EU says the deal it struck with Mrs May is the best and only one available and it can't be rewritten. Mrs May used to say that too, until MPs rejected it in January. MPs are studying the additional legal assurances on the temporary nature of the backstop, agreed by Mrs May in 11th hour talks with EU officials, before deciding whether to vote for her deal or not. After months of questions about his position, Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he could support a new referendum, while continuing to push for his preferred option of a general election or Labour's own version of Brexit. Many Labour MPs from areas that voted Leave in the 2016 referendum could vote against it, however, reducing its chances of success. The Labour leadership also appears to be warming to the idea of a Norway-style deal with the EU, which is backed by a group of Conservative and Labour MPs. This would see the UK remain in the EU single market, which its supporters say would protect jobs. If Mrs May's deal is defeated on Tuesday, there could be moves to get MPs to back ""Common Market 2.0"", as its supporters call this plan. Opponents say it would not end the free movement of people or allow the UK to strike its own trade deals around the world.

"The Amazon Echo is just one of various types of smart speaker Question: ""Alexa - what is now being used to help calculate the cost of living in the UK?"" Answer: ""I am."" Smart speakers, such as the Amazon Echo device (or Alexa), have been added to the basket of goods used to measure the movement of prices. These price movements of 700 goods and services are used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to calculate the rate of inflation. The latest annual review has also added bakeware but envelopes are out. Amazon Alexa heard and sent private chat UK inflation falls to two-year low in January The addition of baking items, such as trays and roasting tins, reflected the success of TV programmes such as the Great British Bake Off. The Great British Bake Off has inspired many people to bake There are some clear changes from lifestyles in previous decades as the move towards electronic communication, rather than letter-writing, has meant envelopes have been removed. The three-piece suite and crockery sets, once signs of an upwardly-mobile household, have also been taken out as people tend to buy individual items of furniture, rather than a set. The former has been replaced by single settees and the latter by just dinner plates. Washing powder was no longer needed as liquid was being used instead, the ONS said. Hi-fi systems have also gone, made redundant by streaming services as well as smart and portable speakers. However, there is now a place for electric toothbrushes in the basket. Flavoured tea has also been added owing to its rising popularity and increased shelf-space in supermarkets. In all, 16 items have been added this year, 10 have been removed and 16 modified, with 688 unchanged,the ONS said,external. Some 180,000 prices are measured in 20,000 UK outlets to calculate inflation, which itself is used as a benchmark for our finances. This basket of goods reflects contemporary habits and technology to work out the inflation rate, which charts the changing cost of living. The ONS also aims to ensure that each sector of goods and services, and where items are bought, are reflected adequately in the calculations. That is why peanut butter, and shop-bought popcorn have also been added this year. Children's fiction, suitable for six to 12-year-olds has also been added, to close a gap in the coverage of books between illustrated books for infants and teenage literature in the basket. ONS senior statistician Philip Gooding said: ""We want to reflect modern spending habits, and the alterations we have made highlight shifting consumer behaviour, whether that is in technology, the home, or the way we communicate with one another. ""It is important to remember that we change a small percentage of the overall basket."" Last year, women's leggings and mashed potato replaced pork pies and lager sold in nightclubs in the inflation basket.

"Nursing home worker Gary Dennis said he had a ""moral duty"" to hand over the tape A US man has claimed to have found a video tape allegedly showing R. Kelly ""sexually abusing underage African-American girls."" Gary Dennis told reporters that he handed the tape to authorities after discovering it at his house. R. Kelly was charged last month with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving four alleged victims, three of whom were minors. The R&B artist has denied appearing in the video, and all other charges. If convicted, he faces three to seven years in prison on each count. Mr Dennis, a nursing home worker, said he came across the footage whilst sorting through a box of old video tapes. The history of allegations against R. Kelly R. Kelly free on bail on sex abuse charges Watch: R. Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes He played one tape with a recording of a football match after finding it had been labelled ""R. Kelly"". He expected it to have been recorded over with an old concert. Instead it contained sexual abuse, he alleges. The singer became famous with hits like Vibe, I Believe I Can Fly and Ignition (Remix) Whilst not going into detail, Mr Dennis said he saw ""[R. Kelly] telling them what to do and what to say, and it appeared that he was in control of the camera."" After the discovery he said he had a ""moral duty"" to notify law enforcement and contacted Gloria Allred, a lawyer representing women who claim to have been sexually abused by R. Kelly. The tape was then turned over to the US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. Ms Allred said Mr Dennis had no personal connection to the R&B singer and had ""no idea"" how or when he came to possess the videotape, adding that friends had given him tapes of sporting events in the past. She said the tape appears to show a separate incident from those previously attributed to R. Kelly, but conceded that she could not be ""100% certain"" the man on the tape was him. ""The doubt here is self-evident,"" said Steve Greenberg, R. Kelly's lawyer. ""It is not him. The larger question is what the authorities are doing about the Dennis' possession of what they believe is child pornography in their tape collection."" This video can not be played R. Kelly in tearful sex abuse charges interview ""It is obviously now just open season on R. Kelly,"" Mr Greenberg continued. ""It is irresponsible to continue to take the speculation of every Tom, Dick and Harry, and report it as if it is fact."" R. Kelly was taken into custody on Wednesday after failing to pay $161,000 (Â£122,000) in child support to his former wife, Andrea Kelly, and their three children. He was released on Friday after paying the debt. Earlier this month he gavean explosive interview with CBS This Morningwhere he tearfully and angrily denied the allegations against him. ""I didn't do this stuff. This is not me,"" he said, adding that he is ""fighting for my life"".

"This video can not be played Big Brexit moment: Will MPs back or bin the PM's deal? The EU has said it is now up to MPs to decide the next steps for Brexit and it remains ""committed"" to agreeing a deal in time for the UK to leave this month. Officials said they had offered fresh assurances on the issue of the Irish backstop ahead of Tuesday's second vote by MPs on Theresa May's deal. It was ""now for the Commons to take an important set of decisions"", they said. Labour and Tory MPs have told the PM she must honour her commitment to put her deal to the vote again on Tuesday. Amid speculation the vote could be postponed or downgraded, No 10 confirmed it remained the plan to go ahead with another ""meaningful vote"", with the motion to be debated to be published later on Monday. Live: Ministers answer Labour question Adler: The EU is not about to blink Big Brexit vote: What do I need to know? Reality Check: False claims over the euro Downing Street said the PM's focus was ""getting on with the work required to allow MPs to support the deal and to bring this stage of the process to an end"". The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the prime minister was ""likely"" to head to Strasbourg later - where the European Parliament is based. Allow Twitter content?

This was reiterated by Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney,who told a press conference he ""understands"" Mrs May is travelling to the city later,external. But neither No 10 or the European Commission have confirmed this, with a spokesperson for the latter saying: ""We keep talking and working."" The spokesperson did confirm, however, that the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Mrs May had spoken by phone on Monday. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March but MPs rejected the withdrawal deal on offer in January and demanded major changes. This video can not be played Is the UK in a crisis over leaving the EU? BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the mood was ""bleak"" in Brussels after the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, briefed EU ambassadors on the state of play earlier. Adam Fleming said the member states were told that the UK had rejected the EU's proposed solutions on the backstop because ""they wouldn't get the support of the Cabinet"". ""There is a widely held view that the UK has not been negotiating in good faith over the last few days,"" he said, adding that at least one diplomat had mentioned planning for a ""post-Theresa May government"". The government has been seeking changes to the Irish backstop, the safety net designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland, and only to be used as a last resort. But the details of it were a sticking point for many MPs when they voted her deal down in January. They worry that - in its current form - the backstop may leave the UK tied to the EU indefinitely. In a statement, the Commission said it had put forward proposals to try and reassure MPs the backstop ""if used will apply temporarily"". A spokesman said the EU was willing to meet UK negotiators at any time. Minister rejects 'May should quit' reports Reality Check: False claims over the euro 10 ways you could be affected by no-deal Brexit He added: ""We are committed to using our best endeavours to find a subsequent agreement that replaces the backstop... We are committed to ratifying this deal before 29 March."" Earlier, Mr Barnier said that talks about the UK's withdrawal from the bloc were now between the British government and MPs. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the chances of Parliament approving Mrs May's deal appeared ""very remote"" at this stage. She said it was still possible that the UK would come back with some new assurances from the EU over the backstop which could ""get the numbers down"" and limit the scale of any defeat. Theresa May has been attending the Commonwealth Day service in Westminster Abbey Mark Francois, a member of the European Research Group of Brexit-backing Tory MPs, said unless ""something amazing"" materialised, the outcome of Tuesday's vote would be similar to that in January - when the government lost by a record 230 votes. Former Labour cabinet minister Yvette Cooper said Mrs May ""had given...her word"" to MPs that this week's votes would happen. Ms Cooper, who has spearheaded parliamentary efforts to rule out a no-deal exit, called for talks on the withdrawal deal and the UK's exit to be put on hold while the PM tried to build a consensus in Parliament and the country. ""The stakes are far too high to assume she has this under control,"" she said. ""If she won't find a way forward, Parliament has a responsibility to do so instead."" There will be an urgent question from Labour in the Commons later, asking Mrs May for an update on the progress made in achieving legal changes to the withdrawal agreement and the timetable for its approval. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""imperative"" that Mrs May responded, rather than sending a junior minister. As things stand, the chances of Theresa May getting approval in the Commons tomorrow for her Brexit compromise, reversing a defeat of more than 200 votes, are very remote. That said, it is quite possible to get those numbers down. Despite the fact the talks are stuttering with Brussels, it is still likely there will be some kind of piece of paper that emerges from the Berlaymont building - those edifices in Brussels where negotiators have been locked for the past few days. There is likely to be some kind of reassurance on paper out of those talks, probably at some point later today. The political point though is this: It is very unlikely - very unlikely - that it's going to be enough to get the kind of revision to the deal that could comfortably reverse the defeat for the prime minister. That's why some MPs are starting to say, as they did last time, it is unwise for her to keep marching into gunfire to do again what no prime minister had done in recent memory - to go into a crucial vote all but knowing you are going to lose, and lose badly. And that's why things are so risky this week. Theresa May's deal is expected to face a ""meaningful vote"" in Parliament on Tuesday If it's rejected, a further vote has been promised for Wednesday on whether the UK should leave without a deal If that no-deal option is rejected, MPs could get a vote on Thursday on whether to request a delay to Brexit from the EU.

"Jodie Chesney was stabbed to death in a park in Harold Hill, east London Two people including a 16-year-old boy, who are accused of murdering teenager Jodie Chesney in an east London park, have appeared in court. Manuel Petrovic, 20, of Romford, was remanded in custody after appearing at the Old Bailey via videolink. The teenage boy, who cannot be named, then appeared later at Barkingside Magistrates' Court. Jodie, 17, was knifed in the back near a playground in Harold Hill, Romford, on 1 March. Manuel Petrovic, 20, appeared at the Old Bailey on Monday via videolink A further four arrests have been made in connection with the investigation, the Metropolitan Police said.

"This video can not be played Kim Jong-nam: Indonesian woman freed in murder case The Indonesian woman accused of killing Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korea's leader, has been freed after charges against her were dropped. Siti Aisyah had been accused of smearing VX nerve agent on Mr Kim's face in Kuala Lumpur airport in 2017. She and her co-accused, Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong, deny murder and say they thought they were part of a TV prank. The brazen killing at an international airport left observers stunned and gripped international headlines. After several months of delay, the defence phase of the trial was set to begin Monday, with testimony from Ms Huong. However, the prosecutor in the case requested the murder charge for Siti Aisyah be dropped, without giving a reason. Who are the two women of the Kim Jong-nam murder? The world's most unusual assassinations In a letter to the Indonesian law minister though, Malaysia's attorney general explained the decision was taking into account considerations Jakarta raised about the case as well as the good relations between the two countries. The judge approved the request, saying ""Siti Aisyah is freed"", according to AFP news agency. However, this does not amount to an acquittal. Doan Thi Huong (left) and Siti Aisyah (right) say they were tricked by North Korean agents into carrying out the killing Ms Aisyah could have faced the death penalty if convicted. ""I feel happy. I did not know this will happen. I did not expect it,"" AFP cites Ms Aisyah saying as she left the court. BBC correspondent Jonathan Head, who is at the court in Kuala Lumpur, says there appears to have been less evidence against her than against her Vietnamese co-defendant. Ms Huong had initially been expected to read a statement in court, which would have been the first time either of the two gave testimony. However, her case has now been adjourned at the request of her lawyers. Kim Jong-nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, had been waiting to board a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Macau on 13 February 2017 when two women approached him in the departure area. CCTV footage showed one of them placing her hands over his face, then both women leaving the scene. Mr Kim died on the way to hospital from what was later found to be exposure to the nerve agent VX, one of the most toxic of all known chemical agents. North Korea has fiercely denied any involvement in the killing, but four men - believed to be North Koreans who fled Malaysia on the day of the murder - have also been charged in the case. They remain at large despite an Interpol ""red notice"", equivalent to an international arrest warrant. North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis Stop romanticising a dictator, say N Koreans The two women have said they were innocent victims of an elaborate North Korean plot. According to their lawyers, in the days before Mr Kim's death the women had been paid to take part in pranks where they wiped liquid on people at airports, hotels and shopping malls. Kim Jong-nam, pictured in 2001, the late half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un They thought they were taking part in another prank at the airport. Their lawyers had expressed confidence that the court would see they had no motive to kill Mr Kim. After the court's surprise decision on Monday, the Indonesian ambassador to Malaysia told reporters they would ""try to fly Siti back to Indonesia today or as soon as possible,"" according to AFP. Kim Jong-nam was the older half-brother of North Korea's authoritarian ruler, Kim Jong-un. He was once seen as a future leader of the isolated country, but when his father Kim Jong-il died, was bypassed in favour of the younger Kim.

"The Amazon Echo is just one of various types of smart speaker Question: ""Alexa - what is now being used to help calculate the cost of living in the UK?"" Answer: ""I am."" Smart speakers, such as the Amazon Echo device (or Alexa), have been added to the basket of goods used to measure the movement of prices. These price movements of 700 goods and services are used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to calculate the rate of inflation. The latest annual review has also added bakeware but envelopes are out. Amazon Alexa heard and sent private chat UK inflation falls to two-year low in January The addition of baking items, such as trays and roasting tins, reflected the success of TV programmes such as the Great British Bake Off. The Great British Bake Off has inspired many people to bake There are some clear changes from lifestyles in previous decades as the move towards electronic communication, rather than letter-writing, has meant envelopes have been removed. The three-piece suite and crockery sets, once signs of an upwardly-mobile household, have also been taken out as people tend to buy individual items of furniture, rather than a set. The former has been replaced by single settees and the latter by just dinner plates. Washing powder was no longer needed as liquid was being used instead, the ONS said. Hi-fi systems have also gone, made redundant by streaming services as well as smart and portable speakers. However, there is now a place for electric toothbrushes in the basket. Flavoured tea has also been added owing to its rising popularity and increased shelf-space in supermarkets. In all, 16 items have been added this year, 10 have been removed and 16 modified, with 688 unchanged,the ONS said,external. Some 180,000 prices are measured in 20,000 UK outlets to calculate inflation, which itself is used as a benchmark for our finances. This basket of goods reflects contemporary habits and technology to work out the inflation rate, which charts the changing cost of living. The ONS also aims to ensure that each sector of goods and services, and where items are bought, are reflected adequately in the calculations. That is why peanut butter, and shop-bought popcorn have also been added this year. Children's fiction, suitable for six to 12-year-olds has also been added, to close a gap in the coverage of books between illustrated books for infants and teenage literature in the basket. ONS senior statistician Philip Gooding said: ""We want to reflect modern spending habits, and the alterations we have made highlight shifting consumer behaviour, whether that is in technology, the home, or the way we communicate with one another. ""It is important to remember that we change a small percentage of the overall basket."" Last year, women's leggings and mashed potato replaced pork pies and lager sold in nightclubs in the inflation basket.

"Tesla said the price of its mid-market Model 3 car would not rise Tesla is increasing prices of its electric cars after scaling back a store closure programme. The carmaker said the 3% price rise would not apply to the new mid-market Model 3. Earlier this month Tesla said it would close an unspecified number of stores to fund a cut in the price of the Model 3 in the US to $35,000 (Â£26,400). It will now close ""about half as many"" stores - making half the cost savings. The carmaker, founded by Elon Musk, said that keeping more stores open would require a rise in vehicle prices by about 3% on average worldwide. It has 378 stores and service locations but had not been specific about which ones would close. Elon Musk's Tesla to cut about 3,000 jobs as cars 'too expensive' The weird and wonderful life of Elon Musk ""Over the past two weeks we have been closely evaluating every single Tesla retail location, and we have decided to keep significantly more stores open than previously announced as we continue to evaluate them over the course of several months,"" the company said. While it is pressing ahead with the price cut to the mid-market Model 3, prices will go up for more expensive variants of Model 3, as well as Model S and X cars, which can already cost up to Â£87,000. Customers can order at existing prices until 18 March. It is still planning to conduct its sales online and said that buyers in stores will be shown how to order a Tesla on their phone, a process which Tesla says will take just a few minutes. It had previously said that shifting sales online would allow it to cut prices by 6% on average - and cut the price of the Model 3. The company says it has a ""generous return policy"" to avoid the need for test drives, as would-be buyers can return a car after 1,000 miles or seven days. Tesla said that some stores in ""high visibility locations"" which have been closed will be reopened - albeit with smaller numbers of staff. Stores will hold fewer cars for those customers who want to drive away with new vehicle immediately. Tesla had not said how many stores will be closed The company has been making  efforts to cut costs after the ""most challenging"" year in its history.  In January it announced 7% of its 45,000-strong workforce would be cut, indicating around 3,000 job cuts. At the time Mr Musk had said the firm's cars were still ""too expensive for most people"". He has faced controversy over his tweets and last month the US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, askedthe courts to hold him in contempt for violatinga settlement month aimed at limiting his social media comments. He has until today to formally respond but had already tweeted the the regulator's oversight system is ""broken"". The matter stems back to his tweets about the company's financial performance and tweets in August when he claimed he had secured funding to take the firm private.

"Public health chiefs have proposed a ban on cars idling outside school gates in a bid to cut air pollution. The measure is among aseries of UK-wide recommendations,externalput forward by Public Health England. PHE medical director Paul Cosford told the BBC: ""We should stop idling outside schools and we should make sure that children can walk or cycle to school."" PHE said 28,000 to 36,000 deaths a year in the UK could be attributed to long-term exposure to air pollution. Wood burners under fire in clean air plan Watch: how pollution moves across Europe The report said local authorities could implement no-idling zones in areas with vulnerable hotspots such as schools, hospitals and care homes. It also recommends a wider uptake of low emission or clean air zones to discourage the most highly polluting vehicles from entering populated areas. It describes air pollution as the biggest environmental threat to health in the UK and says there is strong evidence that air pollution causes the development of coronary heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease and lung cancer, and exacerbates asthma. Although England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales lead on air quality policy in their own territories, PHE contributes to the implementation of the government's UK-wide strategy. Professor Cosford told BBC Radio 5 Live conversations needed to be had between local authorities, schools and parents about how to ""stop the emissions at source"". The PHE review also recommends: Redesigning cities so people aren't so close to highly polluting roads by, for example, designing wider streets or using hedges to screen against pollutants Investing more in clean public transport as well as foot and cycle paths Encouraging uptake of low emission vehicles by setting more ambitious targets for installing electric car charging points Discouraging highly polluting vehicles from entering populated areas with incentives such as low emission or clean air zones This video can not be played UK scientists estimate air pollution cuts British people's lives by an average of six months Prof Cosford said: ""Transport and urban planners will need to work together with others involved in air pollution to ensure that new initiatives have a positive impact. ""Decision makers should carefully design policies to make sure that the poorest in society are protected against the financial implications of new schemes."" PHE said that national government policy could support these local actions - for example, they could allow controls on industrial emissions in populated areas to take account of health impacts.

"Nursing home worker Gary Dennis said he had a ""moral duty"" to hand over the tape A US man has claimed to have found a video tape allegedly showing R. Kelly ""sexually abusing underage African-American girls."" Gary Dennis told reporters that he handed the tape to authorities after discovering it at his house. R. Kelly was charged last month with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving four alleged victims, three of whom were minors. The R&B artist has denied appearing in the video, and all other charges. If convicted, he faces three to seven years in prison on each count. Mr Dennis, a nursing home worker, said he came across the footage whilst sorting through a box of old video tapes. The history of allegations against R. Kelly R. Kelly free on bail on sex abuse charges Watch: R. Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes He played one tape with a recording of a football match after finding it had been labelled ""R. Kelly"". He expected it to have been recorded over with an old concert. Instead it contained sexual abuse, he alleges. The singer became famous with hits like Vibe, I Believe I Can Fly and Ignition (Remix) Whilst not going into detail, Mr Dennis said he saw ""[R. Kelly] telling them what to do and what to say, and it appeared that he was in control of the camera."" After the discovery he said he had a ""moral duty"" to notify law enforcement and contacted Gloria Allred, a lawyer representing women who claim to have been sexually abused by R. Kelly. The tape was then turned over to the US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. Ms Allred said Mr Dennis had no personal connection to the R&B singer and had ""no idea"" how or when he came to possess the videotape, adding that friends had given him tapes of sporting events in the past. She said the tape appears to show a separate incident from those previously attributed to R. Kelly, but conceded that she could not be ""100% certain"" the man on the tape was him. ""The doubt here is self-evident,"" said Steve Greenberg, R. Kelly's lawyer. ""It is not him. The larger question is what the authorities are doing about the Dennis' possession of what they believe is child pornography in their tape collection."" This video can not be played R. Kelly in tearful sex abuse charges interview ""It is obviously now just open season on R. Kelly,"" Mr Greenberg continued. ""It is irresponsible to continue to take the speculation of every Tom, Dick and Harry, and report it as if it is fact."" R. Kelly was taken into custody on Wednesday after failing to pay $161,000 (Â£122,000) in child support to his former wife, Andrea Kelly, and their three children. He was released on Friday after paying the debt. Earlier this month he gavean explosive interview with CBS This Morningwhere he tearfully and angrily denied the allegations against him. ""I didn't do this stuff. This is not me,"" he said, adding that he is ""fighting for my life"".

"Several airlines have grounded Boeing 737 Max 8 jets following a deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash. The flight crashed minutes after takeoff on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board. It was the second disaster in five months involving a Boeing 737 Max 8. Aviation regulators in China and Indonesia have suspended flights using that model. Ethiopian Airlines, Cayman Airways and Comair, have also grounded their 737 Max 8 aircraft. Boeing shares fell 13% in early trading on Wall Street, but then recovered some of those losses. While experts warn it is too early to say what caused the Ethiopian Airlines disaster, it comes after the same model crashed in aflight operated by Lion Air in October. The plane lost altitude soon after takeoff, killing 189 people on board. ""Given that two accidents both involved newly delivered Boeing 737 Max 8 planes and happened during take-off phase, they have some degree of similarity,"" the Civil Aviation Administration of China said in a statement. Which airlines have grounded their 737 Max 8 planes? Ethiopian Airlines 'black box found' Boeing faces questions after crash What is the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft? How could a brand new plane crash? The Chinese regulator ordered local carriers to ground all 737 Max 8 flights by 18:00 local time (10:00 GMT). Air China, China Eastern Airlines, Kunming Airlines, and China Southern Airlines are among the carriers affected. More than 90 Boeing 737 Max 8 models are in use in mainland China. The Indonesian Transport Ministry said inspections would begin on 12 March of one Garuda Indonesia plane and 10 operated by Lion Air.  Planes would be grounded until cleared by safety regulator. Shares in French aerospace group Safran, which makes the engines for the 737, fell on Monday. The aircraft is relatively new to the skies, having only been in commercial use since 2017. Boeing said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the crash and is sending a team to provide technical assistance to the investigation. The investigation will be led by Ethiopian authorities co-ordinating with teams of experts from Boeing and the US National Transportation Safety Board. The Indian government said it was discussing the situation with local regulators. Jet Airways and SpiceJet - neither of which made any comment - both use the aircraft. Comair, which has the franchise for British Airways in South Africa, said it was removing its 737 Max from its schedule while it ""consults with other operators, Boeing and technical experts"". According to Boeing's website, 16 airlines have taken delivery of the 737 Max 8.Â TUI Group has 15 in its fleet and said it is in close contact with the manufacturer, but has no plans to take them out of service.  It is the only airline to have any such planes registered with the UK's Civil Aviation Authority. A spokesperson for Flydubai told Reuters the carrier is ""monitoring the situation"". Norwegian Airlines, which has 18 in its fleet largely flying between Ireland the US, is continuing to use the planes. Its director of flight operations said the airline will follow any recommendations from Boeing and aviation authorities. It has three - including one from London Gatwick to Helsinki - in use today. Singapore's SilkAir said it was in contact with Boeing and all its flights using 737 Max 8 aircraft - of which it has six - are operating as normal, while Air Italy is also operating its planes as normal. Several North American airlines also operate the aircraft and have said they are monitoring the investigation. Southwest Airlines flies 34 of the aircraft and  said it had been in contact with Boeing and was operating as normal. American Airlines and Air Canada each have 24 in their fleet.

"A power surge in a washing machine was said to have caused damage to Elwyn Roberts' mother's house in Rhyl Nearly 150 fires in Welsh homes started last year because of faulty electrical appliances, a charity has said. It comes after Elwyn Roberts from Rhyl, Denbighshire, said his mother's home was destroyed by a fire caused by a power surge in a washing machine. Nobody was hurt in the fire, which happened in February, but Mr Roberts said some of the items lost were ""virtually irreplaceable"". Electrical Safety First urged people to register their electrical products. Fire services warn of tumble dryer danger Fresh fears over danger tumble dryers Safety flaws 'exposed by danger dryers' Mr Roberts said his 71-year-old mother was ""practically homeless"" while repairs to the house are made, with her mostly staying with neighbours or at his flat. He said: ""The fire left very little behind and with it destroyed items that hold very precious memories to my mother and our family. They are irreplaceable. ""I can't bear to see the devastation caused by this fire continue to hurt my mum. ""The blaze spread into the middle room and decimated it, destroying her new computer, burning away a hole in the ceiling and melted the double glazed window."" Tumble dryers and washing machines cause are the number one and two causes of electrical fires in Wales He added: ""The heart-breaking ashen devastation left in the wake of this tragedy has hurt my mum the most because so many treasured family possessions, including the beautiful silver line pram myself and my little sister had used when we children, were completely destroyed. ""My mum managed to get out of the house with the two cats, thankfully nobody was physically hurt but the memories destroyed by this fire are irreplaceable."" Electrical Safety First encouraged people to register their products with manufacturers to avoid such fires. It said 36% of the 250 people surveyed in Wales did not register their products, meaning they would not be notified if there was a fault with their item. In Wales, 143 fires were caused by faulty electrical appliances last year - the equivalent of nearly three a week. In England, there were 2,330 fires. The figures for Scotland and Northern Ireland were not given to Electrical Safety First. Tumble dryers caused the most fires out of all appliances, followed by washing machines and electric cookers.

"A fire has destroyed an internationally-renowned bird observatory on Fair Isle in Shetland. Firefighters were called to the Fair Isle Bird Observatory, which is located on the north east of the island, at about 11:20 on Sunday. Extra fire crews were flown in from Sumburgh by helicopter with others arriving on the island by boat. Observatory president Roy Dennis said the building had been ""lost to fire"", adding it was ""absolutely tragic news"". A family including two children who live in the flat adjoining the lodge were unhurt. There are no guests staying at the lodge for the winter season. Mr Dennis said: ""Thank goodness no loss of life but heartfelt sympathy to David, Susannah and family and the islanders. We will rebuild. We have lost much and will lose a year. Close to my heart - very very sad."" And Shetland MSP Tavish Scott described it as a ""colossal blow to the isle"". The smoke from the blaze could be seen for miles Fair Isle Bird Observatory (pictured in the background) recorded migration patterns One local told BBC Scotland a Fair Isle boat crew spotted smoke while out on the water just after leaving the harbour, and turned back to raise the alarm. The fire is understood to have started in the roof. Photographer Rob Fray could see a plume of smoke from the blaze from the Sumburgh Hotel in Shetland - approximately 30 miles across the water. A statement on the Fair Isle Observatory & Guesthouse website said: ""A major fire has tragically destroyed the Obs."" A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: ""Operations Control mobilised crews from Fair Isle and Shetland, with the crew from Lerwick transported via the Maritime Coastguard Agency's Search and Rescue helicopter. ""Further resources were later mobilised to help tackle the fire, with two crews transported from Shetland to Fair Isle with the assistance of the RNLI."" The observatory is a popular tourist spot for bird watching and for scientific research into seabirds and bird migration. It is also important to the economy of Fair Isle, which is famous for its knitting and has a population of about 60. It was established in 1948 with the current building constructed in 2010, offering three-star accommodation to visitors. The observatory is run by an independent charity but has close links to other organisations such as the National Trust for Scotland which owns the remainder of the island.

"Public health chiefs have proposed a ban on cars idling outside school gates in a bid to cut air pollution. The measure is among aseries of UK-wide recommendations,externalput forward by Public Health England. PHE medical director Paul Cosford told the BBC: ""We should stop idling outside schools and we should make sure that children can walk or cycle to school."" PHE said 28,000 to 36,000 deaths a year in the UK could be attributed to long-term exposure to air pollution. Wood burners under fire in clean air plan Watch: how pollution moves across Europe The report said local authorities could implement no-idling zones in areas with vulnerable hotspots such as schools, hospitals and care homes. It also recommends a wider uptake of low emission or clean air zones to discourage the most highly polluting vehicles from entering populated areas. It describes air pollution as the biggest environmental threat to health in the UK and says there is strong evidence that air pollution causes the development of coronary heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease and lung cancer, and exacerbates asthma. Although England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales lead on air quality policy in their own territories, PHE contributes to the implementation of the government's UK-wide strategy. Professor Cosford told BBC Radio 5 Live conversations needed to be had between local authorities, schools and parents about how to ""stop the emissions at source"". The PHE review also recommends: Redesigning cities so people aren't so close to highly polluting roads by, for example, designing wider streets or using hedges to screen against pollutants Investing more in clean public transport as well as foot and cycle paths Encouraging uptake of low emission vehicles by setting more ambitious targets for installing electric car charging points Discouraging highly polluting vehicles from entering populated areas with incentives such as low emission or clean air zones This video can not be played UK scientists estimate air pollution cuts British people's lives by an average of six months Prof Cosford said: ""Transport and urban planners will need to work together with others involved in air pollution to ensure that new initiatives have a positive impact. ""Decision makers should carefully design policies to make sure that the poorest in society are protected against the financial implications of new schemes.""

"Passengers were waiting outside the door of the airport's departure terminal on Monday morning Belfast International Airport has been heavily criticised over long delays which saw passengers queuing outside the airport in freezing conditions. The Consumer Council said customers were ""frustrated"" by the length of time it was taking to get through security. Last month,the airport said it was expanding its security area from six to eight search lanes. But on Sunday the airport said it would have to reduce the number of lanes to carry out expansion work. This video can not be played Graham Keddie said things would improve after delays on Monday caused dozens of passengers to miss flights. Travellers have taken to social media to complain about security lines stretching outside the terminal. Graham Keddie, managing director of Belfast International Airport, asked customers for ""more forbearance"", adding that work on the lanes would be finished before Easter. Some 70 people missed their flights on Monday, Mr Keddie told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A spokesperson for the airport's security provider, Wilson James, said: ""We support Belfast International Airport in its aim of improving the passenger journey through the security screening area of the airport and we share the airport's feelings of this morning's queues which proved challenging whilst operating five out of six the lanes during ongoing building work. ""The sixth lane will be back in operation this week followed by the additional two lanes in time for Easter."" Wilson James reiterated the airport's statement that passengers should arrive at least two hours before their flight time. This video can not be played Long delays for Belfast International Airport passengers Bernie Brown from Ballymena, who is one of those affected by the situation at Belfast International, said she was still in a long queue to get through security more than an hour after arriving at the airport. ""People are frustrated,"" she told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme. Ms Brown, who was travelling from Belfast International Airport to Edinburgh, later said: ""I caught my flight, but 36 people did not according to the cabin crew."" Belfast International said the airport was expanding its security area from six to eight search lanes ""We're all concerned about missing our flights, but there are no airport staff around to assure people about what has been happening."" Low-cost airline easyJet said the airline is opening its bag drop earlier when necessary. In a statement to BBC News NI, a spokesperson said that the airline is aware that security queues are longer than usual in Belfast International. ""Security at Belfast is managed by the airport and although this is outside of our control, we would like to apologise to any affected passengers for any inconvenience. ""We would like to reassure passengers that we will continue to work with the airport to minimise any disruption."" With passengers being forced to queue outside Belfast International Airport, BBC News NI's weather presenter Angie Philips said that while the temperature would have been around 2C this morning, with the wind chill it would have felt more like -2C.

He added: ""Since May 2018, we have been in discussions with BIA and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) about these issues."" He said the council recognises that the airport has recruited a new security company and are working to install new security lanes. ""However, passengers still remain frustrated with the queues and the length of time it takes to get through security,"" Mr Williams added.

"A DoH pay rise has resulted in 787 workers taking home less money Hundreds of nurses have had to pay money back to the NHS despite receiving a pay rise. The Department of Health (DoH) implemented a pay award for Health and Social Care (HSC) employees last month. But the pay rise has resulted in 787 workers - 1.1% of HSC staff - taking home less money as it put them in a higher pension bracket. The DoH said there had been ""significant communication"" with staff and trade unions on the issue. ""It's grossly unfair. We didn't fight this long for a pay rise to end up being out of pocket,"" a nurse told BBC News NI. ""It makes you feel so undervalued, like nobody really cares at all. ""The pressure on staff is in the health care system in Northern Ireland is ridiculous at the minute yet here we are with even less money at the end of the month."" One nurse told BBC News NI that their ""work-life balance has hit an all-time low"" The nurse faces a salary deduction of Â£240 this month. ""I worked all over Christmas, hardly saw my family or friends, and I work long hours, trying to do my job the best I can for the patients and now I'm hit with a bill for Â£240 to be taken from my salary this month. How is that fair?"" ""It's hard enough to attract people to nursing because of how much pressure staff are under and this could well push good nurses away completely."" Rita Devlin, acting deputy director of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in Northern Ireland, said the pay deal was not agreed by the trade union. She said the RCN's concerns had been raised with the Department of Health. ""We already have a high vacancy rate in Northern Ireland with nearly 2,000 posts in the HSC alone unfilled,"" Ms Devlin told BBC News NI. ""We can ill afford to lose any more of our highly trained nurses. We would urge the DoH to ensure that we are not in the same position this time next year."" A spokesperson for the DoH said: ""There was significant communication directly with staff and with trade unions on this issue. ""Mitigation arrangements have been made available for any staff member whose backdated pay increase does not cover backdated pension contribution arrears. Any such deficit can be paid through wage deductions over a period of up to 12 months."" The department states that there are seven different contribution rates, based on seven earnings brackets, meaning that ""the more a staff member earns, the higher their contribution rate may be"".

"This video can not be played A demo of David Bowie's hit song Starman - and a snippet of Hang Onto Yourself A demo believed to be the first recording of David Bowie's hit song Starman is being put up for auction. The 1971 tape had been packed away in a box and ""totally forgotten about"" for almost 50 years. Bowie can be heard on the demo telling guitarist Mick Ronson he had not finished the song when he tried to end the recording. Ronson gave the demo to his friend Kevin Hutchinson, an aspiring musician, to help him learn the song in 1971. But Mr Hutchinson listened to the song, labelled it ""David Bowie rehearsal tape"" and packed it away in his loft. David Bowie: The artistic chameleon who changed music The demo also contains recordings of Bowie songs Moonage Daydream and Hang Onto Yourself. David Bowie performs on stage on his Ziggy Stardust/Aladdin Sane tour in London, 1973 Mr Hutchinson, who is now selling the tape, said: ""I remember listening to it and thinking, 'This is OK.' I didn't think, 'This is fantastic.' ""At 16, you're not totally impressed. Nothing impresses you."" He kept the tape despite moving house several times and now Mr Hutchinson thinks it's ""phenomenal... obviously"". The song featured in the 1972 Ziggy Stardust concept album, which propelled Bowie to fame. Bowie died on 10 January 2016 The demo will be auctioned on Tuesday at Omega Auctions in Newton-le-Willows, between Liverpool and Manchester, where it is expected to sell for Â£10,000. Mr Hutchinson retrieved the tape from his loft after watching a documentary about Bowie, who died aged 69 in 2016. He toldBBC Radio Humberside in 2017that he had forgotten about the tape and was ""staggered"" when he heard the quality of it. This video can not be played The many faces of David Bowie Mr Hutchinson said his wife Claire had prompted his memory after remembering his story about Ronson. He said: ""I think she thought I didn't have the tape because when you say to someone, 'I once did some stuff with Mick Ronson and with David Bowie, people think, 'Yeah tell me another one.'"" He said he ""couldn't believe it"" when he found and played it, describing the recording as ""superb"". David Bowie's son criticises new biopic First Bowie recording found in bread basket ""You can tell that Mick has never heard the song before because at the end he is just about to turn the tape recorder off and Bowie says, 'Hang on. There's a little bit more,"" Mr Hutchinson said. Dan Hampson, assistant auction manager at Omega Auctions, said the tape was ""possibly the first ever demo version of Starman"". ""There's a lot of Bowie mythology around the writing of this timeless classic, and the raw and truly beautiful version heard here helps to provide a fascinating insight into the creative process of a bona fide genius,"" he added.

"Tesla said the price of its mid-market Model 3 car would not rise Tesla is increasing prices of its electric cars after scaling back a store closure programme. The carmaker said the 3% price rise would not apply to the new mid-market Model 3. Earlier this month Tesla said it would close an unspecified number of stores to fund a cut in the price of the Model 3 in the US to $35,000 (Â£26,400). It will now close ""about half as many"" stores - making half the cost savings. The carmaker, founded by Elon Musk, said that keeping more stores open would require a rise in vehicle prices by about 3% on average worldwide. It has 378 stores and service locations but had not been specific about which ones would close. Elon Musk's Tesla to cut about 3,000 jobs as cars 'too expensive' The weird and wonderful life of Elon Musk ""Over the past two weeks we have been closely evaluating every single Tesla retail location, and we have decided to keep significantly more stores open than previously announced as we continue to evaluate them over the course of several months,"" the company said. While it is pressing ahead with the price cut to the mid-market Model 3, prices will go up for more expensive variants of Model 3, as well as Model S and X cars, which can already cost up to Â£87,000. Customers can order at existing prices until 18 March. It is still planning to conduct its sales online and said that buyers in stores will be shown how to order a Tesla on their phone, a process which Tesla says will take just a few minutes. It had previously said that shifting sales online would allow it to cut prices by 6% on average - and cut the price of the Model 3. The company says it has a ""generous return policy"" to avoid the need for test drives, as would-be buyers can return a car after 1,000 miles or seven days. Tesla said that some stores in ""high visibility locations"" which have been closed will be reopened - albeit with smaller numbers of staff. Stores will hold fewer cars for those customers who want to drive away with new vehicle immediately. Tesla had not said how many stores will be closed The company has been making  efforts to cut costs after the ""most challenging"" year in its history.  In January it announced 7% of its 45,000-strong workforce would be cut, indicating around 3,000 job cuts. At the time Mr Musk had said the firm's cars were still ""too expensive for most people"". He has faced controversy over his tweets and last month the US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, askedthe courts to hold him in contempt for violatinga settlement month aimed at limiting his social media comments. He has until today to formally respond but had already tweeted the the regulator's oversight system is ""broken"". The matter stems back to his tweets about the company's financial performance and tweets in August when he claimed he had secured funding to take the firm private.

"This video can not be played A demo of David Bowie's hit song Starman - and a snippet of Hang Onto Yourself A demo believed to be the first recording of David Bowie's hit song Starman is being put up for auction. The 1971 tape had been packed away in a box and ""totally forgotten about"" for almost 50 years. Bowie can be heard on the demo telling guitarist Mick Ronson he had not finished the song when he tried to end the recording. Ronson gave the demo to his friend Kevin Hutchinson, an aspiring musician, to help him learn the song in 1971. But Mr Hutchinson listened to the song, labelled it ""David Bowie rehearsal tape"" and packed it away in his loft. David Bowie: The artistic chameleon who changed music The demo also contains recordings of Bowie songs Moonage Daydream and Hang Onto Yourself. David Bowie performs on stage on his Ziggy Stardust/Aladdin Sane tour in London, 1973 Mr Hutchinson, who is now selling the tape, said: ""I remember listening to it and thinking, 'This is OK.' I didn't think, 'This is fantastic.' ""At 16, you're not totally impressed. Nothing impresses you."" He kept the tape despite moving house several times and now Mr Hutchinson thinks it's ""phenomenal... obviously"". The song featured in the 1972 Ziggy Stardust concept album, which propelled Bowie to fame. Bowie died on 10 January 2016 The demo will be auctioned on Tuesday at Omega Auctions in Newton-le-Willows, between Liverpool and Manchester, where it is expected to sell for Â£10,000. Mr Hutchinson retrieved the tape from his loft after watching a documentary about Bowie, who died aged 69 in 2016. He toldBBC Radio Humberside in 2017that he had forgotten about the tape and was ""staggered"" when he heard the quality of it. This video can not be played The many faces of David Bowie Mr Hutchinson said his wife Claire had prompted his memory after remembering his story about Ronson. He said: ""I think she thought I didn't have the tape because when you say to someone, 'I once did some stuff with Mick Ronson and with David Bowie, people think, 'Yeah tell me another one.'"" He said he ""couldn't believe it"" when he found and played it, describing the recording as ""superb"". David Bowie's son criticises new biopic First Bowie recording found in bread basket ""You can tell that Mick has never heard the song before because at the end he is just about to turn the tape recorder off and Bowie says, 'Hang on. There's a little bit more,"" Mr Hutchinson said. Dan Hampson, assistant auction manager at Omega Auctions, said the tape was ""possibly the first ever demo version of Starman"". ""There's a lot of Bowie mythology around the writing of this timeless classic, and the raw and truly beautiful version heard here helps to provide a fascinating insight into the creative process of a bona fide genius,"" he added.

"Public health chiefs have proposed a ban on cars idling outside school gates in a bid to cut air pollution. The measure is among aseries of UK-wide recommendations,externalput forward by Public Health England. PHE medical director Paul Cosford told the BBC: ""We should stop idling outside schools and we should make sure that children can walk or cycle to school."" PHE said 28,000 to 36,000 deaths a year in the UK could be attributed to long-term exposure to air pollution. Wood burners under fire in clean air plan Watch: how pollution moves across Europe The report said local authorities could implement no-idling zones in areas with vulnerable hotspots such as schools, hospitals and care homes. It also recommends a wider uptake of low emission or clean air zones to discourage the most highly polluting vehicles from entering populated areas. It describes air pollution as the biggest environmental threat to health in the UK and says there is strong evidence that air pollution causes the development of coronary heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease and lung cancer, and exacerbates asthma. Although England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales lead on air quality policy in their own territories, PHE contributes to the implementation of the government's UK-wide strategy. Professor Cosford told BBC Radio 5 Live conversations needed to be had between local authorities, schools and parents about how to ""stop the emissions at source"". The PHE review also recommends: Redesigning cities so people aren't so close to highly polluting roads by, for example, designing wider streets or using hedges to screen against pollutants Investing more in clean public transport as well as foot and cycle paths Encouraging uptake of low emission vehicles by setting more ambitious targets for installing electric car charging points Discouraging highly polluting vehicles from entering populated areas with incentives such as low emission or clean air zones This video can not be played UK scientists estimate air pollution cuts British people's lives by an average of six months Prof Cosford said: ""Transport and urban planners will need to work together with others involved in air pollution to ensure that new initiatives have a positive impact. ""Decision makers should carefully design policies to make sure that the poorest in society are protected against the financial implications of new schemes.""

"O'Sullivan turned professional in 1992, the same year as John Higgins and Mark Williams Ronnie O'Sullivan became the first man to reach 1,000 career centuries as he sealed a 10-4 win over Neil Robertson in the Players Championship final. The five-time world champion went into the match needing three more centuries to reach four figures. He made two in taking a 7-2 lead at the end of the first session in Preston and achieved the landmark with a 134 to retain his title. Stephen Hendry (775) and John Higgins (745) are the only others to pass 700. In trademark O'Sullivan style, he paused and calmly switched his cue to his left hand before rolling in the milestone-clinching red. His achievement was raucously celebrated by the Preston Guild Hall crowd, which provided sustained applause as he cleared the table to make history. O'Sullivan's clearance of 141 would have earned him an additional Â£5,000 for the tournament's highest break - denying Robertson that accolade - but the cue ball trickled into the middle pocket. It was O'Sullivan's 35th title - his first came at the same venue in 1993 - and he said: ""It's a special moment with the crowd. You never know what to expect and I've never had that before, everyone cheering every ball as it was going in towards the end."" Finishing in the Australian accent he has frequently adopted this week, which he revealed was due to watching a large amount of that country's TV recently, he said: ""That was fantastic, mate, and something I'll remember for the rest of my life."" Most career centuries 1,000Ronnie O'Sullivan (Eng) 775Stephen Hendry (Sco) 745John Higgins (Sco) 621Neil Robertson (Aus) The 43-year-old was in masterful control from the moment Robertson went in off after potting the blue in the early stages of the opening frame. He was not even disrupted by twice having to tell referee Terry Camilleri that the black had been placed back on its spot incorrectly in frame two. Robertson scored only 35 points in the four frames before the mid-session interval, with a highest break of 25. In his 50th career final, O'Sullivan looked set to make it 5-0 when on a 50 break, only to miss a red into the centre, banging the table in frustration. A 65 helped Robertson to chalk up his first frame. But O'Sullivan swiftly took the next with a magnificent 116, his 50th century of the season, while in frame seven a three-ball plant led to a 56 and a 6-1 advantage. Robertson made a 78 to win frame eight, the only one of the session in which O'Sullivan did not make a 50 or more, but the Rocket moved to within one of the landmark with a superb 105. When the match resumed in the evening session, Robertson made a 120 total clearance with his 63rd century of the season in the opening frame. Having made a 90, which ended with a difficult missed red along the cushion with the rest, O'Sullivan fittingly coincided the landmark with the end of the match.

"Gas from Glengorm could be tied back to the Elgin-Franklin or Culzean platforms Forecasts of how much oil and gas could be produced by the UK offshore industry have been revised upwards. The industry regulator now believes 11.9 billion barrels will be extracted by 2050, up from an estimate of eight billion four years ago. So far, 43 billion barrels of oil or its gas equivalent have been extracted from UK waters. The new prediction is driven by lower production costs, technical advances and 30 new fields coming on stream. Gas find hailed as biggest in decade Call for deal to protect oil and gas sector UK reserves to last 'at least 20 years' Estimates of oil and gas potential have been part of the debate about the financial situation facing Scotland should it become independent. The Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) forecast in 2015 that a further eight billion barrels could be pumped by 2050, but that has now been raised by 3.9 billion barrels. Head of performance, planning and reporting at the OGA, Loraine Pace, said: ""The 3.9 billion barrels identified is great news with 2018 being a productive year. ""New discoveries such as Glendronach and Glengorm highlight the future potential of the basin which could be boosted further with new investment, exploration successes and resource progression."" The regulator, reporting to the Treasury ahead of the chancellor's spring statement, said oil output last year was up 8.9 % last year, the highest UK oil production rate since 2011. Gas production, however, fell by 3%. The total is expected to fall from this year onwards, but at a slower rate than previously forecast. Capital expenditure also fell for the fourth successive year, although this trend is expected to be reversed in 2019.

"Several airlines have grounded Boeing 737 Max 8 jets following a deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash. The flight crashed minutes after takeoff on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board. It was the second disaster in five months involving a Boeing 737 Max 8. Aviation regulators in China and Indonesia have suspended flights using that model. Ethiopian Airlines, Cayman Airways and Comair, have also grounded their 737 Max 8 aircraft. Boeing shares fell 13% in early trading on Wall Street, but then recovered some of those losses. While experts warn it is too early to say what caused the Ethiopian Airlines disaster, it comes after the same model crashed in aflight operated by Lion Air in October. The plane lost altitude soon after takeoff, killing 189 people on board. ""Given that two accidents both involved newly delivered Boeing 737 Max 8 planes and happened during take-off phase, they have some degree of similarity,"" the Civil Aviation Administration of China said in a statement. Which airlines have grounded their 737 Max 8 planes? Ethiopian Airlines 'black box found' Boeing faces questions after crash What is the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft? How could a brand new plane crash? The Chinese regulator ordered local carriers to ground all 737 Max 8 flights by 18:00 local time (10:00 GMT). Air China, China Eastern Airlines, Kunming Airlines, and China Southern Airlines are among the carriers affected. More than 90 Boeing 737 Max 8 models are in use in mainland China. The Indonesian Transport Ministry said inspections would begin on 12 March of one Garuda Indonesia plane and 10 operated by Lion Air.  Planes would be grounded until cleared by safety regulator. Shares in French aerospace group Safran, which makes the engines for the 737, fell on Monday. The aircraft is relatively new to the skies, having only been in commercial use since 2017. Boeing said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the crash and is sending a team to provide technical assistance to the investigation. The investigation will be led by Ethiopian authorities co-ordinating with teams of experts from Boeing and the US National Transportation Safety Board. The Indian government said it was discussing the situation with local regulators. Jet Airways and SpiceJet - neither of which made any comment - both use the aircraft. Comair, which has the franchise for British Airways in South Africa, said it was removing its 737 Max from its schedule while it ""consults with other operators, Boeing and technical experts"". According to Boeing's website, 16 airlines have taken delivery of the 737 Max 8.Â TUI Group has 15 in its fleet and said it is in close contact with the manufacturer, but has no plans to take them out of service.  It is the only airline to have any such planes registered with the UK's Civil Aviation Authority. A spokesperson for Flydubai told Reuters the carrier is ""monitoring the situation"". Norwegian Airlines, which has 18 in its fleet largely flying between Ireland the US, is continuing to use the planes. Its director of flight operations said the airline will follow any recommendations from Boeing and aviation authorities. It has three - including one from London Gatwick to Helsinki - in use today. Singapore's SilkAir said it was in contact with Boeing and all its flights using 737 Max 8 aircraft - of which it has six - are operating as normal, while Air Italy is also operating its planes as normal. Several North American airlines also operate the aircraft and have said they are monitoring the investigation. Southwest Airlines flies 34 of the aircraft and  said it had been in contact with Boeing and was operating as normal. American Airlines and Air Canada each have 24 in their fleet.

"Businesses looking to secure public sector contracts will need to do more to help improve society, the UK government is set to announce. Ministers want firms to tackle issues like modern slavery and climate change. The UK, which spends Â£49bn with outside organisations every year, will also try to award more contracts to small firms. It is ""morally right"" for the UK to make certain demands of companies taking taxpayers' money, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington will say. When drawing up public contracts, the government will now be looking at: Firms that employ people from diverse backgrounds, including those with disabilities and from ethnic minorities How companies reduce modern slavery and cyber-security risks in their supply chains Businesses that are focused on environmental sustainability Companies that boost employees' employability potential through staff training However, the government stressed that the changes to public procurement would not add complexity or increased costs to the process. ""By making sure that these social values are reflected not just across the government, but through all the companies we work with, we will take a major step towards our goal of creating an economy that works for everyone,"" Mr Lidington will say. Charity Anti-Slavery International has welcomed the UK's efforts to stamp out modern slavery, but it wants to see the government do even more. Modern slavery is occurring across the UK, with a higher percentage of incidents in industries such as domestic work, construction, agriculture, catering andhand car washes. Construction is an industry where modern slavery occurs in the UK ""At the moment big businesses are made to report slavery in the supply chain, but there are no penalties for either failing to submit the statement, or whether you report that it exists,"" Jakub Sobik, a spokesman for Anti-Slavery International told the BBC. Modern slavery is merely at one end of a spectrum of exploitative practices, and steps need to be taken to combat the practice of forcing employees to work overtime due to unrealistic targets, he added. The government also needs to stop companies from driving the price down during the bidding process. ""We would like the government to make sure that the price they pay is right for the services,"" said Mr Sobik. ""If the price they're being paid for the services is not high enough to make sure they pay the staff fairly - this is one of the reasons that companies might use exploitative practices.""

"This video can not be played A demo of David Bowie's hit song Starman - and a snippet of Hang Onto Yourself A demo believed to be the first recording of David Bowie's hit song Starman is being put up for auction. The 1971 tape had been packed away in a box and ""totally forgotten about"" for almost 50 years. Bowie can be heard on the demo telling guitarist Mick Ronson he had not finished the song when he tried to end the recording. Ronson gave the demo to his friend Kevin Hutchinson, an aspiring musician, to help him learn the song in 1971. But Mr Hutchinson listened to the song, labelled it ""David Bowie rehearsal tape"" and packed it away in his loft. David Bowie: The artistic chameleon who changed music The demo also contains recordings of Bowie songs Moonage Daydream and Hang Onto Yourself. David Bowie performs on stage on his Ziggy Stardust/Aladdin Sane tour in London, 1973 Mr Hutchinson, who is now selling the tape, said: ""I remember listening to it and thinking, 'This is OK.' I didn't think, 'This is fantastic.' ""At 16, you're not totally impressed. Nothing impresses you."" He kept the tape despite moving house several times and now Mr Hutchinson thinks it's ""phenomenal... obviously"". The song featured in the 1972 Ziggy Stardust concept album, which propelled Bowie to fame. Bowie died on 10 January 2016 The demo will be auctioned on Tuesday at Omega Auctions in Newton-le-Willows, between Liverpool and Manchester, where it is expected to sell for Â£10,000. Mr Hutchinson retrieved the tape from his loft after watching a documentary about Bowie, who died aged 69 in 2016. He toldBBC Radio Humberside in 2017that he had forgotten about the tape and was ""staggered"" when he heard the quality of it. This video can not be played The many faces of David Bowie Mr Hutchinson said his wife Claire had prompted his memory after remembering his story about Ronson. He said: ""I think she thought I didn't have the tape because when you say to someone, 'I once did some stuff with Mick Ronson and with David Bowie, people think, 'Yeah tell me another one.'"" He said he ""couldn't believe it"" when he found and played it, describing the recording as ""superb"". David Bowie's son criticises new biopic First Bowie recording found in bread basket ""You can tell that Mick has never heard the song before because at the end he is just about to turn the tape recorder off and Bowie says, 'Hang on. There's a little bit more,"" Mr Hutchinson said. Dan Hampson, assistant auction manager at Omega Auctions, said the tape was ""possibly the first ever demo version of Starman"". ""There's a lot of Bowie mythology around the writing of this timeless classic, and the raw and truly beautiful version heard here helps to provide a fascinating insight into the creative process of a bona fide genius,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Kim Jong-nam: Indonesian woman freed in murder case The Indonesian woman accused of killing Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korea's leader, has been freed after charges against her were dropped. Siti Aisyah had been accused of smearing VX nerve agent on Mr Kim's face in Kuala Lumpur airport in 2017. She and her co-accused, Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong, deny murder and say they thought they were part of a TV prank. The brazen killing at an international airport left observers stunned and gripped international headlines. After several months of delay, the defence phase of the trial was set to begin Monday, with testimony from Ms Huong. However, the prosecutor in the case requested the murder charge for Siti Aisyah be dropped, without giving a reason. Who are the two women of the Kim Jong-nam murder? The world's most unusual assassinations In a letter to the Indonesian law minister though, Malaysia's attorney general explained the decision was taking into account considerations Jakarta raised about the case as well as the good relations between the two countries. The judge approved the request, saying ""Siti Aisyah is freed"", according to AFP news agency. However, this does not amount to an acquittal. Doan Thi Huong (left) and Siti Aisyah (right) say they were tricked by North Korean agents into carrying out the killing Ms Aisyah could have faced the death penalty if convicted. ""I feel happy. I did not know this will happen. I did not expect it,"" AFP cites Ms Aisyah saying as she left the court. BBC correspondent Jonathan Head, who is at the court in Kuala Lumpur, says there appears to have been less evidence against her than against her Vietnamese co-defendant. Ms Huong had initially been expected to read a statement in court, which would have been the first time either of the two gave testimony. However, her case has now been adjourned at the request of her lawyers. Kim Jong-nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, had been waiting to board a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Macau on 13 February 2017 when two women approached him in the departure area. CCTV footage showed one of them placing her hands over his face, then both women leaving the scene. Mr Kim died on the way to hospital from what was later found to be exposure to the nerve agent VX, one of the most toxic of all known chemical agents. North Korea has fiercely denied any involvement in the killing, but four men - believed to be North Koreans who fled Malaysia on the day of the murder - have also been charged in the case. They remain at large despite an Interpol ""red notice"", equivalent to an international arrest warrant. North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis Stop romanticising a dictator, say N Koreans The two women have said they were innocent victims of an elaborate North Korean plot. According to their lawyers, in the days before Mr Kim's death the women had been paid to take part in pranks where they wiped liquid on people at airports, hotels and shopping malls. Kim Jong-nam, pictured in 2001, the late half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un They thought they were taking part in another prank at the airport. Their lawyers had expressed confidence that the court would see they had no motive to kill Mr Kim. After the court's surprise decision on Monday, the Indonesian ambassador to Malaysia told reporters they would ""try to fly Siti back to Indonesia today or as soon as possible,"" according to AFP. Kim Jong-nam was the older half-brother of North Korea's authoritarian ruler, Kim Jong-un. He was once seen as a future leader of the isolated country, but when his father Kim Jong-il died, was bypassed in favour of the younger Kim. He was largely estranged from the family, and spent most of his time overseas in Macau, mainland China and Singapore. He had spoken out in the past against his family's dynastic control of North Korea, and in a 2012 book was quoted as saying he believed his half-brother lacked leadership qualities.

It was the second crash in five months involving a 737 Max 8, and comparisons are being drawn witha Lion Air accident in Indonesia last October. In response, a number of airlines have now grounded all planes of the same model. However, experts warn it is too early to say what caused the latest disaster.

The Lion Air plane was also new and the accident happened soon after take-off. ""It's highly suspicious,"" Mary Schiavo, former Inspector General of the US Transportation Department, told CNN. ""Here we have a brand-new aircraft that's gone down twice in a year. That rings alarm bells in the aviation industry, because that just doesn't happen."" After last October's crash, Boeing sent an emergency notice to airlines warning them of a problem with the anti-stall system.
