"A trial in August ended in a jury being discharged after failing to reach a verdict and the media was barred from reporting the retrial until its conclusion A barrister has been jailed for four years for raping a woman. Robin Jacobs, 39, unexpectedly initiated anal sex during a consensual encounter, the court heard. The woman, who met Jacobs through the Tinder dating app, said she twice told him to stop and screamed at him before he moved away after 20 to 30 seconds. Jacobs, from South Woodford, east London, said he believed the woman had consented. He shouted from the dock ""I didn't do it"" after he was convicted. Jurors found him guilty after deliberating for four hours and 47 minutes to find him guilty of rape, by a majority verdict of 10 to two, following a retrial. Jacobs appeared anxious and agitated in the dock before shouting: ""I didn't do it, I didn't do it. I was telling you the truth. I could have lied but I told you the truth. Oh my God."" Before briefly adjourning the court, Judge John Hillen KC told the defendant to ""calm down"". Jailing Jacobs, Judge Hillen said the evidence showed the defendant had taken ""absolutely no steps"" to check if the woman consented to anal sex and the jury would have decided it was not reasonable for him to think she had. Stephen Rose, defending, said the court was dealing with a ""mistake by the defendant of a few seconds"". Previously, the court had heard how the couple met through Tinder in the summer of 2017. It was on their third date that the rape took place. In a videoed interview played in court, the woman told police what happened. She said Jacobs told her to ""wait a minute"" before forcing himself on to her. ""I told him to stop twice and he did not. I screamed 'get off', then he stopped and he did move away,"" she said. ""At that point I was just face down. I did not know what to do with myself, in quite a lot of pain."" She said: ""He asked me if I was going to report it to the police. He asked me if he would see me again, and then he also offered me paracetamol. ""There was no discussion, absolutely no warning, there was no touching, foreplay, warning. There was nothing."" The woman was examined at a specialist sexual assault clinic and found to have a fresh laceration measuring 2.5cm by 2mm, jurors were told. Experts agreed such an injury was likely to have been inflicted with ""at least moderate force"", the court heard. Jacobs denied he had used the woman's body to ""pleasure himself"", saying: ""That's not what I am about."" Follow BBC London onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Heathrow Airport has said about 15% of its schedule will be altered on Monday during Queen Elizabeth's state funeral. This is to ensure the skies over London fall quiet during the events, it said. There will be flight cancellations as a result, including 100 British Airways flights and four Virgin Atlantic flights. Separately tens of thousands of passengers are set to be affected by a French air traffic control strike on Friday. Among the cancelled flights will be many that fly over France, not just to and from the country. Heathrow said that all takeoffs and landings on Monday will be delayed for 15 minutes before and after the two-minute silence at the end of the funeral. Following that, there will be no arrivals between 13:45 BST and 14:20 BST during the procession of the hearse, and no departures between 15:03 BST and 16:45 for the ceremonial procession via the Long Walk to Windsor Castle. Between 16:45 BST and 21:00 BST, departures will be reduced to support the committal service at St George's Chapel. Flights will also be diverted around Windsor Castle ""to minimise noise during the private family service and interment"", it said. Bus strikes called off after Queen's death Strike action cancelled after the Queen's death In a statement, Heathrow apologised for the inconvenience but said that ""as a mark of respect, operations to and from the airport will be subject to appropriate changes in order to avoid noise disruption at certain locations at specific times on Monday"". The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has issued guidance which means that air passengers whose flights are cancelled or badly delayed on Monday because of Heathrow's changes will not legally be entitled to financial compensation. That is because these are likely to be deemed extraordinary circumstances. However, airlines are offering customers refunds or re-bookings. British Airways said its cancellations were on short-haul European flights where multiple services run on the same route, and that it was adding larger aircraft where possible to help customers re-book on operating flights. Alternatively they can choose to have a refund. No long-haul BA flights will be affected but some will be re-timed. What next? A day-by-day guide from now to the funeral Queen's funeral plans: What we know so far The dazzling crown resting on top of the Queenâs coffin Virgin Atlantic also apologised for the inconvenience. A spokesperson said passengers on the affected flights, between Los Angeles, San Francisco and Heathrow, would be rebooked on alternative same-day services wherever possible, or could rebook for later dates, take a voucher or request a refund. It said the airport and airlines were working closely with the air navigation service provider NATS to minimise the impact of these restrictions on passengers. A Heathrow spokesperson added that extra staff would be on hand in terminals to support passengers, and that people were encouraged to travel on public transport instead of by car, because roads around the airport would be extremely busy. Other changes at Heathrow during the period of national mourning include observing the National Moment of Reflection with a one-minute silence at 20:00 on Sunday, showing the Queen's funeral on screens at the airport on Monday, and closing non-essential shops. Shops deemed ""essential"", such as WH Smith, Boots and Travelex, will remain open along with restaurants, cafes and pubs. Separately, tens of thousands of passengers are set be affected by a French air traffic control strike on Friday. Ryanair has cancelled 420 flights, most of which were scheduled to fly over France, affecting 80,000 passengers. EasyJet is cancelling 76 flights, British Airways will cancel 22, while Air France said it would only run 45% of its short-haul flights. The SNCTA air traffic control union said the walkout was over wages, as inflation soars, and recruitment. Ryanair said all passengers affected had been notified this morning. The low-cost carrier normally operates more than 3,000 flights per day. Neal McMahon, Ryanair operations director, said it was ""inexplicable"" that thousands of European citizens and visitors ""will have their travel plans unfairly disrupted"". ""It is inexcusable that passengers who are not even flying to or from France are disrupted,"" he said. He said French laws protect French domestic flights, but not ones flying over the country. ""It is time that the European Union step in and protect overflights so that European passengers are not repeatedly held to ransom by a tiny French air traffic control union,"" he said. Ryanair called for other European air traffic controllers to be allowed to manage flights over France to ease the impact. Budget rival EasyJet said it had cancelled flights at the request of French authorities. EasyJet said: ""While this is outside of our control, we would like to apologise to our customers for any inconvenience they may experience."" British Airways will cancel 22 flights - or 11 return - to and from Heathrow, including some which fly over France. It also said there could be some extra delays on the day. Air France KLM said the French civil aviation authority - DGAC - had asked airlines to cut their Friday schedules from all French airports by 50%. Air France said it would only run 45% of its short and medium-haul flights, and 90% of long-haul. It also warned delays and last minute cancellations could not be ruled out. The flight cuts affect the whole of France, the DGAC said, adding that it was currently working with the European air travel regulator Eurocontrol to help airlines avoid the country's air space. Strikes across the aviation industry caused severe disruption to Europe's summer traffic, including ground and cabin personnel, who sought pay rises to cope with increased living costs amid high inflation. In July, several strikes by firefighters and staff at Paris' Charles De Gaulle airport led to cancellations and delays.

"The BBC's Kristian Johnson joined people who camped out to ensure they made the front of the queue Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to pay their respects to the Queen, as she lies in state over the next four days. BBC journalist Kristian Johnson joined those who camped overnight to ensure they were among the first in - he was 17th in the queue - and made new friends on a drenched night in London. At 10pm on Tuesday the heavens opened. People who had only met hours before huddled up together. Their umbrellas offered little respite from the rain. I was one of the lucky ones. My tent, pitched on the cold pavement of London's South Bank, gave me some shelter from the downpour. But even so, after just a few minutes outside, my jeans were soaked through. I wasn't the only one. ""We've got wet bottoms, but dry feet,"" said Sheila Morton, who was tucked up under a foil sheet with her friend, Lesley O'Hara. Journalists had significantly outnumbered people queuing on Monday, when Vanessa Nathakumaran proudly took her spot at the head of the queue. She only carried a bag with her - and she had more than 48 hours left to wait before she could get inside Westminster Hall. When I joined her on Tuesday lunchtime, I had secured position number 17 in the queue. Michael Darvill, 85, and his daughter Mandy Desmond, 55, were my new neighbours. They had already settled down in camping chairs. There were no books, no card games and no tablets to keep them occupied, just conversation. It was a theme everyone else seemed to unconsciously follow. No-one was staring at their phone screen and not a single person had plugged their headphones in. There was too much to talk about. How long is the queue to see the Queen's coffin? Sombre procession begins lying-in-state ceremony A day-by-day guide: From now until the Queen's funeral By the time the rain - which had fallen as drizzle on Tuesday afternoon - grew stronger and became a deluge, there were about 50 of us in the queue. A man called Gary Keen walked along the line offering slices of pizza. Jacqueline Nemorin, from Mauritius, shared her punnet of strawberries with the women sat next to her. At the front of the queue, a local charity arrived to hand out cups of tea and coffee. Yaqub Yousuf, who lives close to nearby Lambeth Bridge, brought endless supplies from his home to make life more comfortable for those in the queue. ""I saw these ladies completely unprepared so I decided to bring five chairs from my flat so they could sit down,"" he said. ""Then I realised they would be soaked all night, so I brought bags and blankets."" A little further along the line, impromptu singalongs of God Save the King broke out and candles were lit to remember the Queen. Others ordered food on Deliveroo. Truus Nayman first arrived in England in 1954 - a year after the Queen's coronation Even in the midst of the torrential rain, Andrew Israels-Swenson continued to swap stories with 85-year-old Truus Nayman. The pair hadn't moved from a wooden bench they had shared since meeting for the first time earlier that day. Andrew, who flew in from Minnesota on Saturday night, said he felt he had won a ""golden ticket"" by securing an overnight spot on a bench. Truus, originally from the Netherlands, told me she first arrived in England in 1954 - one year after the Queen's coronation. ""I'm a little bit of an oldie in this game now,"" she said, ""because my husband and I queued up when [Winston] Churchill died [in 1965]. We did a whole night standing here. ""When Princess Diana died [in 1997], my son and I queued up at Kensington Palace to sign the book of condolences. Then when the Queen Mother died [in 2002], I lined up on my own. I'm a royalist at heart."" I crawled into my tent at 2am, soaked to the skin. When I woke up two hours later, Michael and his daughter Mandy were still smiling, despite not getting any sleep. ""We got wet before 2am and we haven't got dry since,"" Michael said. ""The water went down the back of the chair, so we've been sitting in water."" Monica Farag was the sixth person in the queue Mercifully, the rain had stopped by the time the sun started to rise. The shift in weather not only seemed to warm bodies, but also spirits. People sipped coffees and rubbed their bleary eyes as it dawned on them that they were only a few hours away from a historic moment. Monica Farag, originally from the Philippines, was the sixth person in the queue. She didn't have a chair to sit on, but the 61-year-old was still beaming from ear to ear at 7am. ""I'm so excited, even though I'm lacking sleep,"" she said. ""It's a beautiful experience. This is the highlight of my 36 years in England."" Shortly before lunchtime, I was told to pack away my tent. The crowds behind us had swelled. The night before, the queue had been a neat line of people sat next to one another. Now it was five people wide, as newcomers began jostling for position. Tempers flared momentarily when someone tried to push into the queue. But finally, at 3pm, we were ushered forward in batches of 20. I joined Truus, Andrew, Michael, Mandy and Paul - my neighbours during the night - in a slow procession over Lambeth Bridge as we edged towards Westminster. Although the rain had long since passed, and the sun was now shining, a sombre atmosphere quickly set in as we snaked past Victoria Tower. Gone were the jokes and the camaraderie of our night under umbrellas. At 5pm, the doors to Parliament slowly opened and everyone fell completely and utterly silent. For the first time since I joined the queue, there wasn't a single sound. At the centre of Westminster Hall was the Queen's coffin. A woman behind me choked back tears. Ahead of me, Andrew and Truus walked together, arm-in-arm. I glanced up at the ceiling, approached the coffin and gave a nod. And in the blink of an eye, it was over. After 30 hours of waiting, the moment in Westminster Hall lasted no longer than 90 seconds. As I emerged again into the evening sunshine, one of my neighbours from the queue was waiting. ""I was there for her final journey,"" said Paul. ""That moment when I bowed my head to that great womanâ¦ I would go through it all again for that.""

"Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng is to unveil his first financial statement A mini Budget to deliver tax cuts promised by Liz Truss during her Tory leadership campaign will take place on Friday next week, it is understood. Plans to hold the ""fiscal event"" this month were thrown into doubt by the death of Queen Elizabeth II. The new PM has vowed to cut taxes to boost the economy and help people with rising living costs. Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng could also set out the estimated cost of plans to cap energy prices. He will deliver his statement on Friday 23 September, four days after the Queen's funeral and the end of the official national mourning period. Truss criticised over Treasury boss sacking Kwarteng considers scrapping bankersâ bonus cap Cost-of-living calendar â dates for your diary Parliament is suspended during the mourning period, with normal business due to resume on Thursday next week. MPs were due to begin a three-week break for party conferences the next day, although it is understood talks are underway about changing this. The governmenthas also proposed,externalshortening this conference recess by one week, so that MPs return on 11 instead of 17 October. Ms Truss has promised to use the fiscal event to undo the rise in National Insurance brought in by her predecessor Boris Johnson. She has also said she would temporarily scrap green levies on energy bills, in a bid to bring down prices for consumers. The government is yet to give an estimated cost for its plan, unveiled hours before the Queen's death was announced, tolimit energy price rises. The scheme, which would mean a typical household energy bill would cost around Â£2,500 annually until 2024, could cost up to Â£150bn. The government is also yet to give details of a separate scheme to limit energy price rises for businesses. Meanwhile, it has emerged the Treasury isconsidering removing a capon bankers' bonuses as part of a post-Brexit shake-up of City rules. Sources say Mr Kwarteng considers it a way of making London a more attractive place for global banks to do business. But critics have argued that uncapped bonuses lead to the kind of excessive risk taking that spawned the financial crisis of 2008.

"Mr Putin (far left) and Mr Xi (far right) met at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Samarkand Vladimir Putin has acknowledged China's ""concern"" over Ukraine, in his first face-to-face talks with President Xi Jinping since the Russian invasion. But speaking in Uzbekistan, Mr Putin also thanked China for its ""balanced position"" - and said US ""attempts to create a unipolar world"" would fail. Mr Xi said China was willing to work with Russia as ""major countries"". China hasn't endorsed Russia's invasion but has grown trade and other ties with Moscow since it was launched. The two leaders' meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Samarkand comes at a crucial point in the Ukraine war, as Russian troops lose ground in parts of the country. ""We highly value the balanced position of our Chinese friends when it comes to the Ukraine crisis,"" Mr Putin told Mr Xi, on only hissecond foray abroad since February's invasion. Revealing that China had ""questions and concern"" about the situation in Ukraine, he said he understood. ""During today's meeting, we will of course explain our position,"" Mr Putin said. In contrast to Mr Putin's statement,the Chinese government readout,externalafter the meeting notably did not mention the Ukraine war. But it said Russia and China would extend ""strong mutual support"" on core interests. Together, the two would play ""a leading role in injecting stability into a world of change and disorder"", and Beijing called their partnership ""as stable as mountains"". The invasion has plunged Moscow into its worst crisis with the West since the Cold War and has sent global food and energy prices soaring. It also poses a huge challenge for China - whose relations with the West have nosedived in recent years over issues including human rights and the future of Taiwan. Mr Putin and Mr Xi have met dozens of times over the years but their latest talks received particular scrutiny. Their growing relationship - which they characterise as a bulwark to Western dominance - signifies a major shift in the world order following the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991. The roles are reversed now, with China the dominant partner, having risen to become an economic superpower. ""Putin is getting more out of it than Xi - Russia is quite isolated internationally,"" Professor Emeritus Rosemary Foot, a senior research fellow in international relations at Oxford University, told the BBC. ""So it's important to show that China is a supportive partner, not an ally but certainly a supportive actor. There is a close relationship."" What does China want from the Ukraine crisis? The Ukraine crisis is a major challenge for China For Mr Xi, who described Mr Putin as ""an old friend"", the optics of the meeting were also significant. He is seeking a historic third term at a Communist Party congress next month, and his visit to Central Asia is the first time he has left China since the start of the Covid pandemic. His trip comes amidfresh lockdownsin China, where his ""zero Covid"" policy is still in place. While the rest of the world has opened up, Beijing continues to shut down entire cities and provinces every time cases flare up. China and Russia have long sought to position the SCO, founded in 2001 with four ex-Soviet Central Asian nations, as an alternative to Western multilateral groups. India, Pakistan and Iran are also members. During their last meeting in February - when Mr Putin travelled to Beijing for the Winter Olympics at Mr Xi's invitation - the two sought to demonstrate their close ties, famously declaring they shared a friendship with ""no limits"". Days later Russia invaded Ukraine, prompting international condemnation and sanctions, while putting the China-Russia relationship under an intense spotlight. Beijing has urged an end to hostilities and stressed the importance of national sovereignty. But it has also refused to call the war an invasion, as Russia refers to it as a ""special military operation"". In recent weeks China has sent troops to take part in joint military exercises with Russia, and sent senior officials to meet Russian counterparts. It has also come to Russia's economic aid as Western sanctions were imposed. This relationship has been a win-win for both countries. With Europe reducing its dependency on Russian oil and gas, China has increased its purchases, which it is reportedly getting at discounted rates. Last month Beijing also agreed to pay for gas in Russian roubles and Chinese yuan, giving Moscow a much-needed alternative to dollars as a foreign reserve, while furthering China's interests in boosting the yuan as an international currency. The two leaders met in Beijing during the Winter Olympics But China appears to have drawn a line. US intelligence says Moscow is so desperate for weapons, it has turned to Iran and even North Korea for supplies. It has also apparently approached China - but there has been no indication so far that Beijing has agreed. Some experts believe that despite the rosy picture of comradeship, Mr Xi will want to maintain some distance between him and Mr Putin for several reasons. ""It would be spectacularly inept to choose the moment of maximum Russian tactical retreat in Ukraine to lean into Moscow even harder than Beijing already has,"" said Evan Feigenbaum, vice-president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, ina recent commentary.,external Another concern for Mr Xi is that former Soviet Central Asian countries, four of which are members of the SCO, do not support Russia's invasion of Ukraine - which also used to be part of the USSR. ""[Mr Xi] must be very aware that Central Asia is unhappy and nervous about what's going on,"" Prof Foot told the BBC.

"Europol released Guardia Civil photos of the arrest An Irishman accused of being ""one of Europe's biggest money launderers"" and a member of the Kinahan crime cartel has been remanded in custody in Spain. The suspect is understood to be Johnny Morrissey, a 62-year-old Irish passport holder, who was arrested in Malaga on Monday. He was in court in Spain on Wednesday in relation to money laundering. But the hearing was held in private as is usual for Spanish pre-trial cases,according to Irish broadcaster RTÃ,external. It reported that six international law enforcement agencies were involved in the investigation that led to Mr Morrissey's arrest this week. Those included Spain's Guardia Civil, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (US DEA) and An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na (the Irish police force). The Kinahan crime cartel was originally based in the Republic of Ireland, where some members were involved ina high-profile feud with a rival crime gangwhich has claimed several lives since 2015. Kinahan cartel suspects operate in several countries and some alleged members haverecently been hit with international financial sanctionsfrom law enforcement agencies in the US, the UK and Ireland. Europol - the European Union's police agency -released a statement after the arrest operation,externalon Monday. It did not name any suspect but it hailed the arrest of a man it described as ""one of Europe's biggest money launderers"". ""Linked to the Kinahan clan, the suspect is believed to have laundered â¬200m (Â£173m) in just over one year,"" said Europol. Europol claimed that an 18-month international investigation had led to the discovery that â¬200m had been laundered through the Hawala underground banking system, which it described as ""an informal method of transferring money without any physical money actually moving"". It revealed that some suspects had laundered money by creating a brand of vodka that was being sold in nightclubs and restaurants in Spain's Costa del Sol ""to disguise the source of their earnings"". Europol also said that companies had been founded in the UK and Gibraltar to help launder illegal profits. Two other suspects - a man and a woman - were also in court in Spain on Wednesday. The man was also remanded in custody while the woman was released on bail. The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) said it had searched addresses in Greater Manchester and Glasgow as part of the investigation.

"The UK has told the EU it will continue delaying customs checks on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, despite legal action from Brussels over the Northern Ireland Protocol. The EU is considering its next steps. The protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, avoiding the need for a hard border with the Irish Republic after Brexit. The prime minister is expected to meet European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen for talks next week. It is thought they will speak when they both attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Despite normal politics being paused after the Queen's death last week, the UK responded to the Commission's legal action ahead of the EU's deadline of the end of Thursday. The EU has launched a series of lawsuits over what it sees as the UK's failure to comply with checks on the movement of farm produce from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. It has also started legal action over legislation that would allow the UK to alter the protocol, introduced by Liz Truss when she was foreign secretary. Why could parts of the Brexit deal be ditched? UK given more time to respond to EU on protocol US repeats warning over unilateral protocol action However, the UK government argues ""grace periods"" delaying full customs checks should remain in place. European Commission spokesman Daniel Ferrie said: ""I can confirm we have received a reply from the UK. We will now analyse the reply before deciding on the next steps."" The Commission could refer the case to the European Court of Justice, but its initial reaction is expected to be muted following the death of Queen Elizabeth II. Brussels has been making plenty of overtures about restarting negotiations, previously stalled, on how to reform the post-Brexit treaty. The new government's desires are less obvious, although Prime Minister Liz Truss is very familiar with the row. As foreign secretary she set in train a bill that could see Britain override parts of the protocol; something the EU sees as a clear and blatant breach of a mutually agreed treaty. EU diplomats believe Ms Truss's approach to the protocol was, at least in part, designed to woo the right wing of her party when a leadership contest loomed. Now that she's prime minister, what will she decide to do? With talk of a phone call or meeting between EU chief, Ursula von der Leyen and Ms Truss, maybe that question will be answered before long. Both will attend Queen Elizabeth II's funeral, but a more likely opportunity for a political discussion could be next week's UN General Assembly in New York. The protocol was part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, agreed between the UK and the EU in December 2019. Special trading arrangements were required for Northern Ireland because it has a land border with the Republic of Ireland, which is in the EU. The EU has strict food regulations and demands border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries. The UK and the EU also agreed that protecting the Northern Ireland peace deal, the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, was essential. From 2021, the protocol has meant some new checks on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Unionist politicians have condemned what they regard as the imposition of a trade border in the Irish Sea. Northern Ireland's devolved executive has been suspended since February, and the largest unionist party, the DUP, has refused to resume sharing power with nationalists until the protocol is significantly reformed. Polls have suggested overall opinion in Northern Ireland on the protocol is fairly evenly split. The Northern Ireland Protocol Bill would allow the UK government to override the arrangements for Northern Ireland it signed up to. Itcleared the House of Commonsin July, but is expected to face stern opposition when it begins its passage through the House of Lords next month.

"Mel C said the incident took place in a hotel room in Turkey Melanie C has revealed she was sexually assaulted the night before the Spice Girls' first ever concert in 1997. Speaking on novelist Elizabeth Day's podcast, the star said the assault took place during a hotel massage in Turkey. ""I felt violated. I felt very vulnerable. I felt embarrassed,"" she said. ""And then I felt unsure - have I got this right? I was in an environment where you take your clothes off with this professional person."" The singer, whose full name is Melanie Chisholm, said she ""buried"" the incident ""immediately"" because she had to focus on the Spice Girls' concert debut. ""I didn't want to make a fuss but also I didn't have time to deal with it."" Mel C: 'People think I'm mouthy, but I'm really gentle' She added that failing to process the assault at the time had allowed it to become ""buried for years and years and years"". It was only when she started writing her memoir, Who I Am, that the memories started to resurface. ""It came to me in a dream, or I kind of woke up and it was in my mind. And I was like, 'Oh, my gosh, I haven't even thought about having that in the book.' ""Then, of course, I had to think, 'Well, do I want to reveal this?' And I just thought, actually, I think it's really important for me to say it, and to finally deal with it and process it."" Mel C (far left) performing with the Spice Girls at the 1997 Brit Awards The star described the incident as a ""mild version"" of sexual assault, and said she wanted to share the details because of the impact it had on her. ""It has affected me. But I'd buried it, and I'm sureâ¦ lots of people do."" In the interview on the How To Fail podcast, the singer also talked about the impact of her parents' divorce, and the eating disorder she developed during her time in the Spice Girls. ""I had this idea of what I had to be, to be in this band, to be a pop star,"" she said. ""I started eliminating food groups [and] being very restrictive with my eating alongside doing more and more exercise - to the point of it becoming extremely obsessive. ""That went on for years. I lost so much weight that I did become anorexic and my periods stopped. I always wanted to be a mum, and here I was unable to control this thing that jeopardised my fertility. ""It was such a compulsion that I couldn't stop it."" However, she said she felt ""very proud"" that she had overcome the eating disorder, and gave birth to her daughter Scarlett in 2009.

"Heathrow Airport has said about 15% of its schedule will be altered on Monday during Queen Elizabeth's state funeral. This is to ensure the skies over London fall quiet during the events, it said. There will be flight cancellations as a result, including 100 British Airways flights and four Virgin Atlantic flights. Separately tens of thousands of passengers are set to be affected by a French air traffic control strike on Friday. Among the cancelled flights will be many that fly over France, not just to and from the country. Heathrow said that all takeoffs and landings on Monday will be delayed for 15 minutes before and after the two-minute silence at the end of the funeral. Following that, there will be no arrivals between 13:45 BST and 14:20 BST during the procession of the hearse, and no departures between 15:03 BST and 16:45 for the ceremonial procession via the Long Walk to Windsor Castle. Between 16:45 BST and 21:00 BST, departures will be reduced to support the committal service at St George's Chapel. Flights will also be diverted around Windsor Castle ""to minimise noise during the private family service and interment"", it said. Bus strikes called off after Queen's death Strike action cancelled after the Queen's death In a statement, Heathrow apologised for the inconvenience but said that ""as a mark of respect, operations to and from the airport will be subject to appropriate changes in order to avoid noise disruption at certain locations at specific times on Monday"". The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has issued guidance which means that air passengers whose flights are cancelled or badly delayed on Monday because of Heathrow's changes will not legally be entitled to financial compensation. That is because these are likely to be deemed extraordinary circumstances. However, airlines are offering customers refunds or re-bookings. British Airways said its cancellations were on short-haul European flights where multiple services run on the same route, and that it was adding larger aircraft where possible to help customers re-book on operating flights. Alternatively they can choose to have a refund. No long-haul BA flights will be affected but some will be re-timed. What next? A day-by-day guide from now to the funeral Queen's funeral plans: What we know so far The dazzling crown resting on top of the Queenâs coffin Virgin Atlantic also apologised for the inconvenience. A spokesperson said passengers on the affected flights, between Los Angeles, San Francisco and Heathrow, would be rebooked on alternative same-day services wherever possible, or could rebook for later dates, take a voucher or request a refund. It said the airport and airlines were working closely with the air navigation service provider NATS to minimise the impact of these restrictions on passengers. A Heathrow spokesperson added that extra staff would be on hand in terminals to support passengers, and that people were encouraged to travel on public transport instead of by car, because roads around the airport would be extremely busy. Other changes at Heathrow during the period of national mourning include observing the National Moment of Reflection with a one-minute silence at 20:00 on Sunday, showing the Queen's funeral on screens at the airport on Monday, and closing non-essential shops. Shops deemed ""essential"", such as WH Smith, Boots and Travelex, will remain open along with restaurants, cafes and pubs. Separately, tens of thousands of passengers are set be affected by a French air traffic control strike on Friday. Ryanair has cancelled 420 flights, most of which were scheduled to fly over France, affecting 80,000 passengers. EasyJet is cancelling 76 flights, British Airways will cancel 22, while Air France said it would only run 45% of its short-haul flights. The SNCTA air traffic control union said the walkout was over wages, as inflation soars, and recruitment. Ryanair said all passengers affected had been notified this morning. The low-cost carrier normally operates more than 3,000 flights per day. Neal McMahon, Ryanair operations director, said it was ""inexplicable"" that thousands of European citizens and visitors ""will have their travel plans unfairly disrupted"". ""It is inexcusable that passengers who are not even flying to or from France are disrupted,"" he said. He said French laws protect French domestic flights, but not ones flying over the country. ""It is time that the European Union step in and protect overflights so that European passengers are not repeatedly held to ransom by a tiny French air traffic control union,"" he said. Ryanair called for other European air traffic controllers to be allowed to manage flights over France to ease the impact. Budget rival EasyJet said it had cancelled flights at the request of French authorities. EasyJet said: ""While this is outside of our control, we would like to apologise to our customers for any inconvenience they may experience."" British Airways will cancel 22 flights - or 11 return - to and from Heathrow, including some which fly over France. It also said there could be some extra delays on the day. Air France KLM said the French civil aviation authority - DGAC - had asked airlines to cut their Friday schedules from all French airports by 50%. Air France said it would only run 45% of its short and medium-haul flights, and 90% of long-haul. It also warned delays and last minute cancellations could not be ruled out. The flight cuts affect the whole of France, the DGAC said, adding that it was currently working with the European air travel regulator Eurocontrol to help airlines avoid the country's air space. Strikes across the aviation industry caused severe disruption to Europe's summer traffic, including ground and cabin personnel, who sought pay rises to cope with increased living costs amid high inflation. In July, several strikes by firefighters and staff at Paris' Charles De Gaulle airport led to cancellations and delays.

"Many veterans have been paying their respects to Queen Elizabeth II at her lying in state. As sovereign she was head of the armed forces, but her association with the military began much earlier, in wartime. Princess Elizabeth was 13 when World War Two broke out. Those six years of conflict would see her begin in earnest her public role as the heir to the throne. It would be a defining period in the life of the future Queen, and at her death she was the last surviving head of state to have served in the war. At the outbreak of war against Germany in 1939, the Royal Family - parents King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, and sister Princess Margaret - was seen as a potent symbol of the values for which Britain and its allies were fighting. In October 1940, as Britain was suffering the worst of the Blitz, Elizabeth made her first broadcast. It was billed as a message to children who had been sent to North America to escape the bombing of British cities. The future Queen's first public address was a wartime broadcast made on BBC Children's Hour ""We children at home are full of cheerfulness and courage,"" she said. ""We are trying to do all we can to help our gallant sailors, soldiers and airmen. And we are trying too, to bear our own share of the danger and sadness of war."" The princess and her sister were some of the strongest propaganda weapons the government of the day had, says Prof Kate Williams, author of the biography Young Elizabeth. ""It really was the Queen's first bombshell broadcast,"" she says. The very fact that Elizabeth and Margaret, who died in 2002, remained in the country was a significant morale-booster. There were suggestions the Royal Family itself should seek safety abroad, specifically in Canada, but the King and Queen would have none of it. ""The children will not leave unless I do,"" declared Queen Elizabeth, later the Queen Mother. ""I shall not leave unless their father does, and the King will not leave the country in any circumstances whatever."" The furthest the children were ever moved was to Windsor Castle, about 30 miles from London. ""We went for a weekend and stayed five years,"" they said. Princess Elizabeth, second from right, with her family in 1942. They remained in Britain during the war They were near enough, though, to see the fire-lit skies over London during the heavy bombing. On one occasion, a bomb landed close to the castle as they sat in the air-raid shelter. ""We all went pink when we heard it,"" Princess Margaret later recalled. The sisters were joined on most evenings and at weekends by their parents, and lessons continued with their private tutors. At Christmas, in order to cheer up their father - who became depressed at the losses being inflicted on his countrymen and women - the girls performed pantomimes. It was Cinderella one year, Aladdin the next, with the princesses always in the starring roles. In 1944, with the King particularly upset at the setback of the Battle of Arnhem, the 18-year-old Elizabeth and 14-year-old Margaret wrote their own pantomime - Little Red Riding Boots - with the help of their mother. Three Guardsmen on duty at the castle were drafted in as extras. One of them, Bill Davies, later remembered being measured up and kitted out with scarlet tunics and bearskins. ""The performance went off splendidly and the family were in stitches,"" he recalled. ""It was a fairy tale moment. We forgot the war for an hour or two."" The overriding sense of duty that marked her reign was forged in the drama of these years. In 1942, Princess Elizabeth carried out her first public engagement, inspecting a parade of the Grenadier Guards, to whom she had become honorary colonel. In the final year of the war, she donned a uniform herself, joining the Auxiliary Territorial Service - the ATS. She was registered as number 230873, Second Subaltern Elizabeth Windsor, and she spent three weeks with a carefully chosen group of other recruits, learning about basic motor mechanics and how to drive a lorry. It was said to have been the first time a female member of the Royal Family had ever attended a course with ""other people"". Elizabeth served for a short period in uniform Now in her late 90s, Gwen Evans trained alongside the future Queen in the ATS, and remembers Princess Elizabeth receiving much the same treatment as everyone else. ""The only difference was when we finished work at five o'clock we went back to our barracks, whereas Elizabeth was picked up and taken to Windsor Castle,"" she says. In May 1945, tens of thousands gathered outside Buckingham Palace to celebrate Victory in Europe Day. Winston Churchill joined the Royal Family on the balcony, and later, the two princesses slipped out to join the crowds. ""I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall. All of us just swept along in a tide of happiness and relief,"" the Queen recalled 40 years later. ""After crossing Green Park, we stood outside and shouted, 'We want the King.' I think it was one of the most memorable nights of my life."" Â©All photographs are copyright What next?

"Sainsbury's said its filling stations will open from 17:00 to 22:00 on Monday Petrol stations at the UK's major supermarkets will be closed for most of the day of the Queen's funeral, before some reopen in the evening. Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons will close forecourts on Monday before some reopen at 17:00 BST. It is understood only a small number of Tesco self service fuel stations will reopen in the evening and customers have been advised to check local pumps. Supermarkets operate about one-in-five of forecourts, but dominate fuel sales. Independent traders operate about two-in-three of the country's filling stations, but only sell just over a third of all fuel, and the remainder is accounted for by sites owned by oil companies, according to the RAC motoring group. ""With many supermarket forecourts closed until the evening on Monday, our advice to drivers needing to refuel is to seek out a good value independent filling station that's choosing to stay open, or top up over the weekend instead,"" RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said. The Petrol Retailers Association, which represents independent fuel retailers, has been contacted for comment. What will be open on the day of the Queen's funeral? Morrisons said that while all of its supermarkets will be closed on Monday as a ""mark of respect and so colleagues can pay tribute to Her Majesty"", its petrol stations would reopen at 17:00. However, the majority of its fuel stations have different opening times so drivers have been urged to check if local ones are open on the company's website. Sainsbury's said its filling stations will be open from 17:00 to 22:00 on Monday to allow customers to ""pick up essential items"". ""We thank our customers for their understanding,"" the supermarket said in a statement. Major shops and businesses across the UK have announced they will shut their doors as a mark of respect for Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral. King Charles III approved a bank holiday on Monday for the state funeral at Westminster Abbey, but it is up to employers to decide whether to give staff the day off to observe the national day of mourning. Shell said it would close its company-owned petrol stations between 10:30 and 13:00. The oil giant has a total of 1,123 sites in the UK and owns and operates 526 of them. The remaining 597 are owned by independent dealers, which trade under the brand. The company said its intention was the shut during the funeral service to ""allow staff and customers to pay their respects"". It said the opening hours of its independent stations were at the ""discretion of individual business"", but added that the company had ""invited them to also consider closing to enable their staff and customers to pay their respects"".

"A trial in August ended in a jury being discharged after failing to reach a verdict and the media was barred from reporting the retrial until its conclusion A barrister has been jailed for four years for raping a woman. Robin Jacobs, 39, unexpectedly initiated anal sex during a consensual encounter, the court heard. The woman, who met Jacobs through the Tinder dating app, said she twice told him to stop and screamed at him before he moved away after 20 to 30 seconds. Jacobs, from South Woodford, east London, said he believed the woman had consented. He shouted from the dock ""I didn't do it"" after he was convicted. Jurors found him guilty after deliberating for four hours and 47 minutes to find him guilty of rape, by a majority verdict of 10 to two, following a retrial. Jacobs appeared anxious and agitated in the dock before shouting: ""I didn't do it, I didn't do it. I was telling you the truth. I could have lied but I told you the truth. Oh my God."" Before briefly adjourning the court, Judge John Hillen KC told the defendant to ""calm down"". Jailing Jacobs, Judge Hillen said the evidence showed the defendant had taken ""absolutely no steps"" to check if the woman consented to anal sex and the jury would have decided it was not reasonable for him to think she had. Stephen Rose, defending, said the court was dealing with a ""mistake by the defendant of a few seconds"". Previously, the court had heard how the couple met through Tinder in the summer of 2017. It was on their third date that the rape took place. In a videoed interview played in court, the woman told police what happened. She said Jacobs told her to ""wait a minute"" before forcing himself on to her. ""I told him to stop twice and he did not. I screamed 'get off', then he stopped and he did move away,"" she said. ""At that point I was just face down. I did not know what to do with myself, in quite a lot of pain."" She said: ""He asked me if I was going to report it to the police. He asked me if he would see me again, and then he also offered me paracetamol. ""There was no discussion, absolutely no warning, there was no touching, foreplay, warning. There was nothing."" The woman was examined at a specialist sexual assault clinic and found to have a fresh laceration measuring 2.5cm by 2mm, jurors were told. Experts agreed such an injury was likely to have been inflicted with ""at least moderate force"", the court heard. Jacobs denied he had used the woman's body to ""pleasure himself"", saying: ""That's not what I am about."" Follow BBC London onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Retailers John Lewis and DFS have said customers are cutting back on the amount they spend due to the rising cost of living. John Lewis said while shopper numbers were higher than last year, customers were spending less and avoiding buying as many ""big ticket"" items. ""No one could have predicted the scale of the cost of living crisis,"" said John Lewis boss Dame Sharon White. The company reported a loss of Â£99m,externalfor the first half of its trading year. Sofa retailerDFS Furniture reported slumping annual profits,externaldue to a dip in consumer spending, saying order numbers had ""softened markedly"" as shoppers tightened their belts. Also on Thursday, fashion chainH&M filed lower-than-expected quarterly sales.,external, but said it had seen a ""better start for the autumn collections than last year"". Dame Sharon said customers were less likely to splash out on ""big ticket"" household items and were moving their spending to dining out at restaurants and to holidays. ""No one could have predicted the scale of the cost of living crisis that has materialised, with energy prices and inflation rising ahead of anyone's expectations,"" she said. ""As a business, we have faced unprecedented cost inflation across grocery and general merchandise."" Over-50s quitting fuels inflation, warns John Lewis Milk and cheese push food inflation to 14-year high However, she said it was ""not unusual"" for the John Lewis Partnership to report a loss in the first half of the year as its trading is ""heavily skewed"" to Christmas, with most of its profits made in the final months of the year. In the first half of last year, the partnership reported a loss of Â£29m. Dame Sharon White said the outlook was ""highly uncertain"" The company said its losses this year were due to a combination of rising wholesale prices for goods not being passed on to customers, households cutting back on spending, and the ""unwinding"" of Covid shopping habits. It said it chose to ""forgo"" profit to help staff and customers through the cost-of-living crisis. The employee-owned group announced a Â£500 one-off payment to full-time workers, with a pro-rata amount for those working part-time, to support staff. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the ""fight is on for consumers' remaining disposable cash"". She said DFS was the ""latest"" company to warn of the the ""painful effects"" of inflation. ""DFS is not only having to cope with a slowdown due to purchases which were brought forward during the pandemic, but now as household bills mount for essentials like food and heating, a plush new sofa is a luxury many consumers are happy to do without,"" she said. Overall UK inflation, which measures the rate at which prices rise, is running near a 40-year high, but the rate eased for the first time in almost a year in August,slipping to 9.9% from July's 10.1%. Food prices have been increasing around the world following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has been one of the factors pushing up prices at supermarket tills, and Waitrose said its sales were down 5% on last year, with basket sizes ""smaller by nearly a fifth"". The Bank of England has warned inflation could top 13% this year, and is expected to keep increasing interest rates in an attempt to control it. John Lewis said its fashion sales increased as people shopped for travel and summer breaks. However, revenue from its home and technology ranges, which performed well during the height of the pandemic, declined. The company said the impact of the rise in the cost of living, specifically around energy costs, was ""evident in patterns of spending"", with sales of its own-brand items rising 28% and energy saving goods, such as air fryers and smart thermostats, increasing. Dame Sharon said the outlook for the rest of the year was ""highly uncertain owing to the cost of living crisis and its impact on discretionary spending as well as criticality of our Christmas trading period"". She said a successful Christmas was ""key for the business"", adding a bumper festive period beyond previous years was needed to ""generate sufficient profit"" for the company to be able to pay staff their usual bonus. Last month,Dame Sharon told the BBCthat an exodus of over-50s who left the workforce during the Covid pandemic had fuelled wage inflation. The UK has seen one million people, mostly in their 50s, leave work since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak, with job vacancies at a record high. It has meant employers who want to attract and retain staff are under pressure to lift wages, which in turn fuels inflation.

"Yvon Chouinard founded Patagonia in 1973 The billionaire founder of the outdoor fashion brand Patagonia has given away his company to a charitable trust. Yvon Chouinard said any profit not reinvested in running the business would go to fighting climate change. The label has amassed a cult following due to sustainability moves like guaranteeing its clothes for life and offering reasonably priced repairs. It is famous for an advert titled""Don't buy this jacket""asking shoppers to consider costs to the environment. The brand's website now states: ""Earth is now our only shareholder."" Mr Chouinard has always said he ""never wanted to be a businessman"". A rock climbing fanatic, he started out as making metal climbing spikes for himself and his friends to wedge into rocks, before moving into clothing and eventually creating a hugely successful sportswear brand with a cult following. Founded in 1973, Patagonia's sales were worth around $1.5bn this year, while Mr Chouinard's net worth is thought to be $1.2bn. But he has always shied away from his wealthy status, telling the New York Times he was ""horrified to be seen as a billionaire"". He claimed that profits to be donated to climate causes will amount to around $100m (Â£87m) a year, depending on the health of the company. ""Despite its immensity, the Earth's resources are not infinite, and it's clear we've exceeded its limits,"" the entrepreneur said of his decision to give up ownership. The firm's marketing campaigns - focused around asking people to buy only what they need - have not dampened sales and critics have argued by raising its prominence it has encouraged more spending rather than less. Prices are relatively high with jumpers, for example, costing around Â£200 and T-shirts around Â£40, but the company argues that the cost reflects the fact its clothes are meant to last a lifetime. Patagonia's chairman, Charles Conn, acknowledged the higher prices but said cheap fast fashion was ""anathema"" to the brand. ""We invest in making sure we use the least water, the least dangerous chemistries and dyes, and use the least carbon in the production of our products, which often means they cost a little bit more,"" he told the BBC. Sandra Halliday, UK editor for FashionNetwork.com, a global fashion news website, told the BBC Mr Chouinard's move could ironically end up boosting its sales further. However, she said the ""maverick"" founder had always been more committed to the environment than ""simply making money"". ""If this was simply a marketing ploy it would be an inspired one, but it's not, it's actually a genuine move to try to do something better for the planet."" Microsoft founderBill Gates this year vowed to ""drop off""the world's rich list as he made a $20bn donation to his philanthropic fund. The tech boss, who is thought to be worth $118bn, had pledged to give his wealth away to charity in 2010 but his net worth has more than doubled since then. Last year the boss of the Hut Group, which owns a range of online beauty and nutrition brands, donated Â£100m to a charitable foundation after becoming a billionaire when his firm was listed. Matthew Moulding said of his newfound wealth that he ""couldn't even comprehend the numbers"" and was trying to make a difference.

Mr Chouinard said he had initially considered selling Patagonia and donating the money to charity, or taking the company public. But he said both options would have meant giving up control of the business and putting its values at risk. Instead, the Chouinard family has transferred all ownership to two new entities. The Patagonia Purpose Trust, led by the family, remains the company's controlling shareholder but will only own 2% of its total stock, Mr Chouinard said. It will guide the philanthropy of the Holdfast Collective, a US charity ""dedicated to fighting the environmental crisis"" which now owns all of the non-voting stock - some 98% of the company. ""Each year the money we make after reinvesting in the business will be distributed as a dividend to help fight the crisis,"" Mr Chouinard said. Yvon Chouinard started out making metal spikes for rock climbing Patagonia combines high-end outdoor fashion with its own brand of environmental and social activism. It's a heady combination that certainly appeals to a loyal, if predominantly well-heeled following. Part of the attraction comes from the fact that its environmentally conscious stance isn't new. It was preaching eco-awareness years before sustainable fashion became fashionable. But it's still pretty hard to save the planet, if your business depends on selling stuff, however many recycled or renewable products you use. By ringfencing future profits for environmental causes, Patagonia's founder Yvon Chouinard has done his best to square that circle. But he is also clearly trying to ensure that Patagonia brand is future-proofed and can never fall into the hands of the kind of companies he has accused of greenwashing in the past.

By ringfencing future profits for environmental causes, Patagonia's founder Yvon Chouinard has done his best to square that circle. But he is also clearly trying to ensure that Patagonia brand is future-proofed and can never fall into the hands of the kind of companies he has accused of greenwashing in the past.

"Sainsbury's said its filling stations will open from 17:00 to 22:00 on Monday Petrol stations at the UK's major supermarkets will be closed for most of the day of the Queen's funeral, before some reopen in the evening. Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons will close forecourts on Monday before some reopen at 17:00 BST. It is understood only a small number of Tesco self service fuel stations will reopen in the evening and customers have been advised to check local pumps. Supermarkets operate about one-in-five of forecourts, but dominate fuel sales. Independent traders operate about two-in-three of the country's filling stations, but only sell just over a third of all fuel, and the remainder is accounted for by sites owned by oil companies, according to the RAC motoring group. ""With many supermarket forecourts closed until the evening on Monday, our advice to drivers needing to refuel is to seek out a good value independent filling station that's choosing to stay open, or top up over the weekend instead,"" RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said. The Petrol Retailers Association, which represents independent fuel retailers, has been contacted for comment. What will be open on the day of the Queen's funeral? Morrisons said that while all of its supermarkets will be closed on Monday as a ""mark of respect and so colleagues can pay tribute to Her Majesty"", its petrol stations would reopen at 17:00. However, the majority of its fuel stations have different opening times so drivers have been urged to check if local ones are open on the company's website. Sainsbury's said its filling stations will be open from 17:00 to 22:00 on Monday to allow customers to ""pick up essential items"". ""We thank our customers for their understanding,"" the supermarket said in a statement. Major shops and businesses across the UK have announced they will shut their doors as a mark of respect for Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral. King Charles III approved a bank holiday on Monday for the state funeral at Westminster Abbey, but it is up to employers to decide whether to give staff the day off to observe the national day of mourning. Shell said it would close its company-owned petrol stations between 10:30 and 13:00. The oil giant has a total of 1,123 sites in the UK and owns and operates 526 of them. The remaining 597 are owned by independent dealers, which trade under the brand. The company said its intention was the shut during the funeral service to ""allow staff and customers to pay their respects"". It said the opening hours of its independent stations were at the ""discretion of individual business"", but added that the company had ""invited them to also consider closing to enable their staff and customers to pay their respects"".

"New Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng The Treasury is considering removing a cap on bankers' bonuses as part of a post-Brexit shake-up of City rules. Sources said no final decisions had been made, but confirmed chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng considered it a way of making London a more attractive place for global banks to do business. City bosses have long complained about the EU-wide bonus rules which cap bonuses at twice an employee's salary. They say they lead to higher base pay that pushes up banks' fixed costs. Those costs cannot be adjusted in line with the firm's financial performance, they add, making the UK less attractive than the US or Asia. People close to Mr Kwarteng confirmedreports in the Financial Times,externalthat the new chancellor is considering the move. Kwasi Kwarteng: Chancellor who likes a challenge Review of workers' employment rights scrapped Critics have argued that uncapped bonuses lead to the kind of excessive risk taking that spawned the financial crisis of 2008. But others argue that other new rules that can hold senior managers personally and potentially criminally responsible for misconduct, plus the ability to claw back bonuses years after they are granted, achieve a sufficient disincentive. Taking the lid off bankers' pay at a time when many households are facing hardship from the rising cost of living will undoubtedly provoke outrage in many quarters. The proposal ""sends a rather confused signal when people are being squeezed in terms of the cost of living, and the government is trying to encourage pay restraint in the public sector"", Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, told the BBC. ""To appear to allow bankers to have bigger bonuses at the same time, doesn't look very well timed. There may be some longer term arguments for pursing this policy but I think the timing would be very bad if they did it now."" Rachel Winter, from Killick & Co, told the BBC: ""It's an absolutely terrible time for this headline when you've got inflation [at] a 40-year high, you've got so many people struggling with the cost of living, do we really want to be reading headlines about banker bonuses? ""Arguably the banks do pay a lot of tax, so I think the chancellor is looking at ways to boost the UK economy to get more banks to come to London, to stay in London and pay more tax."" Removing the cap is just one of a number of deregulation initiatives being considered. The government is also keen to relax rules limiting the amount insurance and pension funds can invest in assets that are harder to sell at short notice - such as long-term infrastructure projects. These rules are part of pan-European regulations collectively known as Solvency II. But the Bank of England is concerned that relaxing the rules could expose pensioners' savings to greater long-term risk and that lowering the amount of ready cash firms are required to hold could see them pay out any money freed up to their shareholders rather than invest in projects favoured by the government. Pitting the Treasury and the financial services industry against the Bank of England is seen as a key test of the Bank's independence and senior officials at the Bank have privately conceded the fight over Solvency II is a political one they could well lose. Kwasi Kwarteng laid out his ""unashamedly pro-growth plan"" for the economy at a gathering of senior bankers two weeks ago. He would argue that the instincts that persuade him to cut banking regulations are the same instincts that persuaded him to throw a Â£100bn-plus shield over businesses and households to prevent high energy prices causing a job-and-growth-killing recession.

"We've been sharing your tributes to Queen Elizabeth II following her death aged 96 You've told us what she meant to you, moments you remember from her life and your stories of meeting the UK's longest-reigning monarch On Monday, the nation paid a final farewell to the Queen, with a state funeral and military procession Our tributes page has been a reminder that hundreds of thousands of us felt a personal connection with the Queen, says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito ""She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life,"" says Simone Kennett, who was head teacher of a school when it was visited by the Queen We'll be preserving this page so people in the UK and around the world can continue to read the tributes so many of you have left for the Queen Deborah TurnessCEO, BBC News and Current Affairs As the Chief Executive of BBC News I
have the honour to write the closing message on this page of thousands of
tributes to Queen Elizabeth II. And itâs a message of thanks to every single
person who has taken the time to share their story. When the death of Queen Elizabeth was
announced, we at the BBC wanted to create a place where people could come
together to share their tributes, their photos and recollections. The
response has been incredible. We have received thousands of touching stories of
meeting the Queen, special moments, memories and messages of condolence. Thank you to everyone - from all
over the world - for coming together here in this virtual space for very real
acts a of remembrance. Looking at the contributions, the
common theme that emerges is that the Queen had a way of making each person she
met feel like the most important person in that moment. Thank you again for helping us remember
a woman whose promise to serve her people was fulfilled through a life of duty,
which touched so many people. Over the past 10 days, we've been asking you to share your memories of seeing and meeting Queen Elizabeth II or to send in your personal tributes. Thousands of people have sent their own messages of condolence. ""The stories speak to how many people felt a personal connection to Her Majesty,"" says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito. ""It reminds us that, while the official record of the life of the Queen will be a series of great moments of national pageantry, those were rare special occasions. ""Her life was much more about handshakes, birthday cards and meeting ordinary, but often remarkable, people. ""No-one forgets a conversation with the Queen. And our tributes page has been a little reminder that for hundreds of thousands of us, the Queen was more than a distant figure in a palace. She was someone with whom they felt a personal connection."" You can read more from David on the tributes here. Sibella Laing went to Cambridge University with King Charles III, has known the Royal Family since she was a child and has met the Queen. She was, is, and always has been, incredibly kind to everybody, always anxious to put people at their ease, always anxious to make you feel you are the only person in the room.  Iâm sure this huge support across the country that Charles must have been seeing will have been really inspirational and uplifting for him. He has had the Queen as a wonderful role model all his life and I think in a sense his whole life has been preparation for this, so I think he is ready for it."" Sibella Laing Dinkie Flowers in the queue to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Hall Dinkie Flowers (nee Stapleton), aged 101, queued for several hours on Saturday to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II. Dinkie, who lives in Shoreham-by-Sea is holding a letter she received from Buckingham Palace 70 years ago thanking her for her performance in the Celebrity Ice Show at Queens Ice Dance Club on 30 April 1952. Dinkie entertained other members of the public in the queue with some of her memorabilia including the card from Her Majesty for her 100th birthday in 2021. Lesley Tomlinson, Dinkie's hairdresser In Ghana students at Legon Hills International School paid tribute to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral. The school held a special assembly reflecting her long reign. Pupils also wrote heartfelt condolence messages, while the little ones watched the Paddington film. Akua Agyemang, Founder of Legon Hills Internatonal School, Ghana The children wrote messages of farewell to the Queen Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral with her friend Lee Stabler Marie Wood, 56, lived in Windsor for eight years when she was training to be a nurse and saw the Queen one day while out for a walk. Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral on Monday, watching the procession from the Long Walk. I was walking in Great Park and she drove her Land Rover further up. I was just gobsmacked.  We always felt that she belonged here. This was her home. I am glad that she is in Windsor now, this was her favourite place. She will be missed."" Marie Wood Frances came from Italy to leave a portrait of the Queen drawn by her son Alex I have been living in Italy for the last 22 years. My son, Alex (13) drew this portrait of the Queen and I asked him if he wanted me to take it to London so I could leave it as a tribute for the Queen. He said yes.  On Saturday I got on a plane from Verona to come especially to leave the portrait before the funeral. Yesterday I took the 5.20am train from Havant to London and I left his portrait in Green Park. The policemen were very kind to take it for me as the park had already closed for laying flowers."" Frances King Simone Kennett was head teacher of Jersey College for Girls when the Queen visited to open a new building in 2001. The Queen said we had a beautiful school and that she had really enjoyed this visit. She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life. The students did the college proud and it was a successful visit.  We also had a light-hearted moment during the her visit. The Queen stamped her foot on the school's front terrace and said: 'This is hollow.' I said, 'Yes, Your Majesty, and if Your Majesty continues to bounce up and down she will find herself sitting in Home Economics,' and she absolutely roared with laughter!"" Simone Kennett, Former head of Jersey College for Girls Glyn Sherman, from Coventry, was serving in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1984 when as a guard of honour he met the Queen at a birthday parade. When she came along I said 'all right, Liz'? The top brass went to come down and she put her hand up to stop them, so I was lucky. I felt bad about it but had to explain to her that I've got a daughter called Elizabeth and it just came out like that.  She turned around and said 'I like to be unofficial sometimes'. It was brilliant. The memory will never go out of me.  Her death has left me heartbroken. I don't look at her as being Her Majesty. We call her our boss. Glyn Sherman I was born in 1926, a Londoner, and saw the Queen on the balcony with her parents on the day her father was crowned George VI. That memory is still very vivid in my mind. Beryl Smith Alicia Finn-OâShea, who is 10, met the Queen as a four-month-old baby. The family were so impressed by that encounter they named Alicia's little sister Elizabeth. She's now aged seven and prefers to be called Eliza, but they came to the Mall on Monday to watch the funeral procession with their mum Claire. It was really magical and amazing but also upsetting. The nice thought is the Queen is having marmalade sandwiches and tea with her family in heaven."" Alicia Finn-OâShea We arrived early from Birmingham to secure our place opposite Buckingham Palace gates to bid farewell to Her Majesty. We are really tired today but so happy we made it. It was an absolutely amazing day."" Claire Finn-O'Shea I used to make cakes and pastries for Her Majesty when I worked at Buckingham Palace from 2001 to 2002 and Sandringham from 2005 to 2006. I got really lucky. I did a modern apprenticeship under the patronage of the now King Charles III... On my days off I went and worked at Buckingham Palace two days a week. Over time I ended up working in the pastry kitchen and had the privilege of making some of the cakes and pastries that used to go out to the Queen during her teatime.  When I heard the news of the Queen's death I stepped outside for a good 10 minutes and really cried, I needed to get away from everyone. There are no Brits near me [in America] and so it's more of a challenge for people to understand what's going on.  It feels like more of a part of you has gone rather than a parent or relative. It feels a little bit of your identity has been lost. Kieron Hales Peter John Wailes, who served in the RAF for 25 years, met the Queen many times and headed to Windsor on the day of her funeral to pay his respects. The 63-year-old recalls how once at Buckingham Palace during a VJ Day parade the Queen noticed a veteran was struggling in the heat and ordered an officer to get them some water. âShe was fantastic and in charge of everything,â he says. Iâm here to pay respects to my ex-boss, I feel great respect for her and want to say thanks for everything - I enjoyed working for her and meeting her.â Peter John Wailes Paul Hayden and his sister handing flowers to the Queen during her visit to Essex My memory is a rather distant one: I think I was about five, and the Queen visited the Essex county show. I was photographed handing a bouquet of flowers to the Queen with my younger sister. Prince Phillip stood alongside the Queen. The photo ended up on the front page of the local newspaper and a framed photo was proudly displayed by my parents in their hallway for at least 20 years.  You can imagine the enjoyment all my friends (and my sister) have had over the years making fun of their once angelic mate and his little sister giving flowers to the Queen but I must admit to being rather proud of the occasion, particularly now.  Rest in Peace HRH Queen Elizabeth II."" Paul Hayden The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell shared a jigsaw puzzle and watched TV with the Queen at Sandringham. It was a great privilege to be alongside her. We sat down after dinner and did a jigsaw and the television was on.  It's a bereavement, and with every bereavement there is shock, there is loss but there is also thankfulness for a life lived well. A life of astonishing service. She was a person of simple but profound faith, and it was that faith that shaped her."" Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell Raven Harlow Aspenwood is severely visually impaired and has channeled her grief into her portrait of the young Queen Elizabeth II I am registered severely visually impaired, but I felt compelled to do something to channel my overwhelming and surprising level of grief following the sad passing of HRH, Queen Elizabeth II. I think my strongest memory of the queen is how comforting her presence has been during every stage of my 28 years of life, when something difficult has happened she has comforted us with her words, when something wonderful has happened she has filled our hearts with joy, with her wonderful smile and calming presence. She has been the grandmother of our nation, the matriarch we all need in times of hardship and times of joy. Her dignity, strength and consistency has been a great comfort and I thank her for her seventy years of steadfast service. Raven Harlow Aspenwood from East Yorkshire What a smile. She could lift a room with that wonderful smile and that genuine interest that she has in the people of this country."" Warwickshire County Council Leader, Izzi Seccombe I do remember her smile, I experienced that myself. It not only lit up a room, it lit up a nation - and she had the capacity to make us smile too."" Bishop of Coventry, Reverend Christopher Cocksworth Zara Umar gave flowers to the Queen in 2002 My daughter Zara and I went down to the City Square in Dundee to see the Queen in 2002. We waited for a long time. Soon the time came and the Queen was walking towards us. She was about five or six steps away from us when one of her security personnel guided the Queen away to the car to leave. Zara was so disappointed and my heart sank. Just then a plain clothes man came and asked me if he could lift Zara over the barrier. Much to my delight, Zara presented the flowers to the Queen and said 'here you are then, take your flowers.' I couldnt believe it! The Queen must have found it funny though and watched Zara return to me with a big smile on her face. I will treasure this memory forever."" Ishrat Umar, Dundee Three army veterans from Worcestershire pay tribute to the Queen... She was our head, she was our leader, she was the person we were serving and she's the one that we would follow. It hits you, it hits your heart."" Eric Braithwaite, who served for 23 years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Everyone called her the boss in one way or another. I've actually guarded the Queen and Prince Philip on other duties. A big lump in the throat, lost the boss, getting a new one."" Dave Sandy, who served in the territorial army from the late 1970s until the 1990s I've done a lot of parades for the Queen, she was a lovely lady and worked so hard for the country. I was in tears, I will be honest. It was an honour to be with her and be a soldier for her."" Anthony Goodway, who spent two years in national service from 1958 until 1960 I met the Queen when she visited the Isle of Skye as part of her Golden Jubilee tour. As a nurse then at the local care home, myself and other staff members were invited to bring some of our residents to meet Her Majesty. The great day came, our ladies looking beautiful, wheelchairs polished. One of our residents had worked at the palace as a younger woman and had photos of the Queen all around her room in the care home, so, if any one was to be there that day, it was her.  As the Queen approached our little group that day she asked me: âAre these the ladies from the care home?' I replied in the positive and then said this resident had worked in the palace. The Queen looked down a little and asked her: âWhen did you work at the palace?â To which, the lady looked up and and replied, in a rather gruff voice: âAnd who are you?â What a moment. I apologised. The Queen just smiled and moved on.  I was quite overwhelmed, I donât have photos of the Queen all over the house, but Iâve always respected her, especially as a Christian woman. She had a real true faith, so meeting her was very special. I didnât expect to be so overcome by the moment. Her demeanour was that of interest and she handled the situation really well. She left us all feeling very special and honoured. Barbara Matheson from Glasgow Barbara Matheson has recalled the moment she met the Queen during Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee tour Â© 2025 BBC.

"Magdalena Andersson was Sweden's first female prime minister Sweden's prime minister has resigned after her government was defeated in Sunday's election. Magdalena Andersson's centre-left bloc lost narrowly to a bloc of right-wing parties, 176 seats to 173, with 99% of the votes counted. Moderate Party leader Ulf Kristersson is now expected to form a government. His right-wing grouping includes the Sweden Democrats, a far-right party that has campaigned againstrising gang shootings. It is a huge blow to Andersson's Social Democrats, which gained votes compared to the last election, and remain Sweden's largest party. But in Sweden, it is bloc politics that usually decides who gets into power and the right bloc has scored a razor-thin majority. The final result is still to be confirmed after a recount, which is standard practice in Sweden. Ms Andersson accepted defeat at a news conference on Wednesday. She formally offered her resignation on Thursday. ""In parliament, they have a one or two seat advantage,"" she said. ""It's a thin majority, but it is a majority."" The close-fought election campaign was dominated by gangs, immigration and integration issues, as well as soaring electricity prices. Ms Andersson was the Nordic nation's first female PM when she took office last year - she quit on the first day, before returning soon after. How a neo-Nazi movement became Sweden's kingmakers The woman who became Sweden's first female PM - twice She has been edged out by a four-party right-wing block made up of the Sweden Democrats, Moderate Party, Christian Democrats and Liberals. It is a momentous turning point for Swedish politics - the Sweden Democrats was once treated as a pariah by political parties, but has now won around 20% of the vote. It vowed to ""make Sweden safe again"" by bringing in longer prison sentences and restricting immigration. However the party's leader Jimmie Akesson will not become prime minister, because he does not have the support of the other right-wing parties to take on the job. Instead, Ulf Kristersson, leader of the Moderates has said he will start work to form a government. ""I am ready to do all I can to form a new, stable and vigorous government for the whole of Sweden and all its citizens,"" he said on Wednesday. It remains unclear whether Mr Kristersson's government will involve a coalition or formal cooperation with the Sweden Democrats. He has already held talks this week with the leaders of the Christian Democrats and Liberal parties as well as the nationalists. The Sweden Democrats is a party born out of a neo-Nazi movement at the end of the 1980s, which has slowly grown stronger while attempting to polish its image. Although many of its policies are right-wing, it sits to the left of some other parties in the bloc on some economic issues, such as protecting the current level of unemployment insurance. It started off growing its support base among rural working class voters, but this has now broadened. This year it has almost doubled its support amongst first-time voters, with some 22% of 18-21-year-olds voting for the party according to Swedish Public Service broadcaster SVT's exit poll survey. In 2019 Mr Kristersson started talks with the Sweden Democrats after years of declining to cooperate with them - a move which has now changed Sweden's political landscape. Ms Andersson told reporters on Wednesday that she understood those concerned at the party's growing popularity. ""I see your concern and I share it,"" she said. Magdalena Andersson's Social Democrats had governed Sweden since 2014 and dominated the country's political landscape since the 1930s. Sunday's vote was one of the closest elections ever in Sweden, with thousands of overseas and postal votes needed to be counted to get a clearer picture of who the winner was.

"Retailers John Lewis and DFS have said customers are cutting back on the amount they spend due to the rising cost of living. John Lewis said while shopper numbers were higher than last year, customers were spending less and avoiding buying as many ""big ticket"" items. ""No one could have predicted the scale of the cost of living crisis,"" said John Lewis boss Dame Sharon White. The company reported a loss of Â£99m,externalfor the first half of its trading year. Sofa retailerDFS Furniture reported slumping annual profits,externaldue to a dip in consumer spending, saying order numbers had ""softened markedly"" as shoppers tightened their belts. Also on Thursday, fashion chainH&M filed lower-than-expected quarterly sales.,external, but said it had seen a ""better start for the autumn collections than last year"". Dame Sharon said customers were less likely to splash out on ""big ticket"" household items and were moving their spending to dining out at restaurants and to holidays. ""No one could have predicted the scale of the cost of living crisis that has materialised, with energy prices and inflation rising ahead of anyone's expectations,"" she said. ""As a business, we have faced unprecedented cost inflation across grocery and general merchandise."" Over-50s quitting fuels inflation, warns John Lewis Milk and cheese push food inflation to 14-year high However, she said it was ""not unusual"" for the John Lewis Partnership to report a loss in the first half of the year as its trading is ""heavily skewed"" to Christmas, with most of its profits made in the final months of the year. In the first half of last year, the partnership reported a loss of Â£29m. Dame Sharon White said the outlook was ""highly uncertain"" The company said its losses this year were due to a combination of rising wholesale prices for goods not being passed on to customers, households cutting back on spending, and the ""unwinding"" of Covid shopping habits. It said it chose to ""forgo"" profit to help staff and customers through the cost-of-living crisis. The employee-owned group announced a Â£500 one-off payment to full-time workers, with a pro-rata amount for those working part-time, to support staff. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the ""fight is on for consumers' remaining disposable cash"". She said DFS was the ""latest"" company to warn of the the ""painful effects"" of inflation. ""DFS is not only having to cope with a slowdown due to purchases which were brought forward during the pandemic, but now as household bills mount for essentials like food and heating, a plush new sofa is a luxury many consumers are happy to do without,"" she said. Overall UK inflation, which measures the rate at which prices rise, is running near a 40-year high, but the rate eased for the first time in almost a year in August,slipping to 9.9% from July's 10.1%. Food prices have been increasing around the world following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has been one of the factors pushing up prices at supermarket tills, and Waitrose said its sales were down 5% on last year, with basket sizes ""smaller by nearly a fifth"". The Bank of England has warned inflation could top 13% this year, and is expected to keep increasing interest rates in an attempt to control it. John Lewis said its fashion sales increased as people shopped for travel and summer breaks. However, revenue from its home and technology ranges, which performed well during the height of the pandemic, declined. The company said the impact of the rise in the cost of living, specifically around energy costs, was ""evident in patterns of spending"", with sales of its own-brand items rising 28% and energy saving goods, such as air fryers and smart thermostats, increasing. Dame Sharon said the outlook for the rest of the year was ""highly uncertain owing to the cost of living crisis and its impact on discretionary spending as well as criticality of our Christmas trading period"". She said a successful Christmas was ""key for the business"", adding a bumper festive period beyond previous years was needed to ""generate sufficient profit"" for the company to be able to pay staff their usual bonus. Last month,Dame Sharon told the BBCthat an exodus of over-50s who left the workforce during the Covid pandemic had fuelled wage inflation. The UK has seen one million people, mostly in their 50s, leave work since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak, with job vacancies at a record high. It has meant employers who want to attract and retain staff are under pressure to lift wages, which in turn fuels inflation.

"The Ukrainian military has released these pictures of seemingly-abandoned Russian vehicles in a river Ukraine says it has made significant gains in pushing back Russian troops, retaking more than 3,000 sq km (1,158 sq miles) of territory in recent days. Jonathan Beale, the BBC's defence correspondent, takes a closer look at why they have been so successful - and what hurdles Ukraine's forces may still face in winning the war. ""Don't underestimate the Ukrainian's ability to surprise,"" a senior US military officer told me early this summer, just as Russia was continuing to make  advances in the Donbas. Ukraine's ability to surprise has become a hallmark of this war: from the Russian retreat from Kyiv, to recent attacks in Crimea. Now there's another surprise happening in the east of the country. Until now, it was Russia making most of the advances here - albeit a slow and grinding affair that was proving costly to its army. Now it's Ukraine making the gains,taking back thousands of square miles of territory in just a matter of days. The biggest gains for Ukraine have been in the east around the city of Kharkiv. The UK's latest defence intelligence report says that Ukraine has now liberated an area twice the size of Greater London - though it's difficult to establish the level of advances and continuing fighting with journalists kept well away from the frontline. Ukraine says it has captured the strategically important cities of Izyum and Kupiansk - military hubs used by Russia to resupply its forces in the Donbas. Those losses alone would be a major blow to the Russian army. Surprise has been the key to Ukraine's advances. That and the intelligent use of western weapons - including US and UK long-range multiple rocket launchers, used to destroy Russian supply lines, ammunition dumps and command posts. Last week, the US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin said long range artillery had hit more than 400 key targets over the summer period. Before the arrival of these weapons, Russia had always had a numeric advantage in terms of artillery. But now, the tables appear to have turned: US intelligence officials claim Russia is having to seek the help of North Korea to resupply them with millions of artillery shells, suggesting their stocks have been seriously depleted in the six months of fighting. That impact of those western weapons - combined with Ukraine's determination to take back territory - has forced Russian forces and their proxies into what looks like a chaotic retreat. Images on social media show tanks, armoured vehicles, weapons and ammunition left behind in a rush and abandoned. Shock and joy in Ukraine's liberated villages Why Russia wants to seize Ukraine's eastern Donbas Interestingly, the advance in the east has been much faster than the Ukrainians' well-publicised offensive in the south towards the city of Kherson. Ukraine had telegraphed that offensive long before it got under way, while keeping quiet about its plans for the east. It all now appears to have been part of its plan: if not a diversion, then a screen to hide what it was preparing in the east. It's clear it successfully wrong-footed Russia. Over the past few months, Russia's been redeploying forces from the east to bolster its defences in the south. Both fronts are now vulnerable. But Ukraine is finding it harder to make gains in the south where they're more exposed, having to fight in mostly open countryside. An advancing army needs more troops and firepower to overcome a defending army. Russian troops have left behind equipment in their rush to pull back from the frontlines The danger for Ukraine may now be similar to the one Russia faced in the early stages of the war. Trying to advance on multiple fronts can prove costly - in terms of ammunition, equipment, and troops.  The bigger the gains the longer the supply lines - which can then be targeted by a defender. There's also the risk that those forces that have advanced furthest - creating a bulge in the defensive line - could become surrounded. Despite the optimism, Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov has warned that Ukraine's forces in the east could now be more vulnerable to a Russian counter-attack. Seizing territory is not enough. An army has to hold the ground too. That might prove easier if the local population are behind you. Ukraine's double-pronged offensive is still risky. It could easily suffer setbacks. But this is much more than simply seizing back land - even if that is the ultimate goal. Ukraine is sending a signal to the world that it really believes it can win this war. It's already using these gains to appeal for more western weapons. And the offensive comes at a critical time - just before winter when it'll be harder to fight and the will of the west will be tested. The war is far from over. But Ukraine is once again showing the world its ability to surprise and overcome the odds.

"We've been sharing your tributes to Queen Elizabeth II following her death aged 96 You've told us what she meant to you, moments you remember from her life and your stories of meeting the UK's longest-reigning monarch On Monday, the nation paid a final farewell to the Queen, with a state funeral and military procession Our tributes page has been a reminder that hundreds of thousands of us felt a personal connection with the Queen, says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito ""She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life,"" says Simone Kennett, who was head teacher of a school when it was visited by the Queen We'll be preserving this page so people in the UK and around the world can continue to read the tributes so many of you have left for the Queen Deborah TurnessCEO, BBC News and Current Affairs As the Chief Executive of BBC News I
have the honour to write the closing message on this page of thousands of
tributes to Queen Elizabeth II. And itâs a message of thanks to every single
person who has taken the time to share their story. When the death of Queen Elizabeth was
announced, we at the BBC wanted to create a place where people could come
together to share their tributes, their photos and recollections. The
response has been incredible. We have received thousands of touching stories of
meeting the Queen, special moments, memories and messages of condolence. Thank you to everyone - from all
over the world - for coming together here in this virtual space for very real
acts a of remembrance. Looking at the contributions, the
common theme that emerges is that the Queen had a way of making each person she
met feel like the most important person in that moment. Thank you again for helping us remember
a woman whose promise to serve her people was fulfilled through a life of duty,
which touched so many people. Over the past 10 days, we've been asking you to share your memories of seeing and meeting Queen Elizabeth II or to send in your personal tributes. Thousands of people have sent their own messages of condolence. ""The stories speak to how many people felt a personal connection to Her Majesty,"" says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito. ""It reminds us that, while the official record of the life of the Queen will be a series of great moments of national pageantry, those were rare special occasions. ""Her life was much more about handshakes, birthday cards and meeting ordinary, but often remarkable, people. ""No-one forgets a conversation with the Queen. And our tributes page has been a little reminder that for hundreds of thousands of us, the Queen was more than a distant figure in a palace. She was someone with whom they felt a personal connection."" You can read more from David on the tributes here. Sibella Laing went to Cambridge University with King Charles III, has known the Royal Family since she was a child and has met the Queen. She was, is, and always has been, incredibly kind to everybody, always anxious to put people at their ease, always anxious to make you feel you are the only person in the room.  Iâm sure this huge support across the country that Charles must have been seeing will have been really inspirational and uplifting for him. He has had the Queen as a wonderful role model all his life and I think in a sense his whole life has been preparation for this, so I think he is ready for it."" Sibella Laing Dinkie Flowers in the queue to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Hall Dinkie Flowers (nee Stapleton), aged 101, queued for several hours on Saturday to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II. Dinkie, who lives in Shoreham-by-Sea is holding a letter she received from Buckingham Palace 70 years ago thanking her for her performance in the Celebrity Ice Show at Queens Ice Dance Club on 30 April 1952. Dinkie entertained other members of the public in the queue with some of her memorabilia including the card from Her Majesty for her 100th birthday in 2021. Lesley Tomlinson, Dinkie's hairdresser In Ghana students at Legon Hills International School paid tribute to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral. The school held a special assembly reflecting her long reign. Pupils also wrote heartfelt condolence messages, while the little ones watched the Paddington film. Akua Agyemang, Founder of Legon Hills Internatonal School, Ghana The children wrote messages of farewell to the Queen Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral with her friend Lee Stabler Marie Wood, 56, lived in Windsor for eight years when she was training to be a nurse and saw the Queen one day while out for a walk. Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral on Monday, watching the procession from the Long Walk. I was walking in Great Park and she drove her Land Rover further up. I was just gobsmacked.  We always felt that she belonged here. This was her home. I am glad that she is in Windsor now, this was her favourite place. She will be missed."" Marie Wood Frances came from Italy to leave a portrait of the Queen drawn by her son Alex I have been living in Italy for the last 22 years. My son, Alex (13) drew this portrait of the Queen and I asked him if he wanted me to take it to London so I could leave it as a tribute for the Queen. He said yes.  On Saturday I got on a plane from Verona to come especially to leave the portrait before the funeral. Yesterday I took the 5.20am train from Havant to London and I left his portrait in Green Park. The policemen were very kind to take it for me as the park had already closed for laying flowers."" Frances King Simone Kennett was head teacher of Jersey College for Girls when the Queen visited to open a new building in 2001. The Queen said we had a beautiful school and that she had really enjoyed this visit. She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life. The students did the college proud and it was a successful visit.  We also had a light-hearted moment during the her visit. The Queen stamped her foot on the school's front terrace and said: 'This is hollow.' I said, 'Yes, Your Majesty, and if Your Majesty continues to bounce up and down she will find herself sitting in Home Economics,' and she absolutely roared with laughter!"" Simone Kennett, Former head of Jersey College for Girls Glyn Sherman, from Coventry, was serving in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1984 when as a guard of honour he met the Queen at a birthday parade. When she came along I said 'all right, Liz'? The top brass went to come down and she put her hand up to stop them, so I was lucky. I felt bad about it but had to explain to her that I've got a daughter called Elizabeth and it just came out like that.  She turned around and said 'I like to be unofficial sometimes'. It was brilliant. The memory will never go out of me.  Her death has left me heartbroken. I don't look at her as being Her Majesty. We call her our boss. Glyn Sherman I was born in 1926, a Londoner, and saw the Queen on the balcony with her parents on the day her father was crowned George VI. That memory is still very vivid in my mind. Beryl Smith Alicia Finn-OâShea, who is 10, met the Queen as a four-month-old baby. The family were so impressed by that encounter they named Alicia's little sister Elizabeth. She's now aged seven and prefers to be called Eliza, but they came to the Mall on Monday to watch the funeral procession with their mum Claire. It was really magical and amazing but also upsetting. The nice thought is the Queen is having marmalade sandwiches and tea with her family in heaven."" Alicia Finn-OâShea We arrived early from Birmingham to secure our place opposite Buckingham Palace gates to bid farewell to Her Majesty. We are really tired today but so happy we made it. It was an absolutely amazing day."" Claire Finn-O'Shea I used to make cakes and pastries for Her Majesty when I worked at Buckingham Palace from 2001 to 2002 and Sandringham from 2005 to 2006. I got really lucky. I did a modern apprenticeship under the patronage of the now King Charles III... On my days off I went and worked at Buckingham Palace two days a week. Over time I ended up working in the pastry kitchen and had the privilege of making some of the cakes and pastries that used to go out to the Queen during her teatime.  When I heard the news of the Queen's death I stepped outside for a good 10 minutes and really cried, I needed to get away from everyone. There are no Brits near me [in America] and so it's more of a challenge for people to understand what's going on.  It feels like more of a part of you has gone rather than a parent or relative. It feels a little bit of your identity has been lost. Kieron Hales Peter John Wailes, who served in the RAF for 25 years, met the Queen many times and headed to Windsor on the day of her funeral to pay his respects. The 63-year-old recalls how once at Buckingham Palace during a VJ Day parade the Queen noticed a veteran was struggling in the heat and ordered an officer to get them some water. âShe was fantastic and in charge of everything,â he says. Iâm here to pay respects to my ex-boss, I feel great respect for her and want to say thanks for everything - I enjoyed working for her and meeting her.â Peter John Wailes Paul Hayden and his sister handing flowers to the Queen during her visit to Essex My memory is a rather distant one: I think I was about five, and the Queen visited the Essex county show. I was photographed handing a bouquet of flowers to the Queen with my younger sister. Prince Phillip stood alongside the Queen. The photo ended up on the front page of the local newspaper and a framed photo was proudly displayed by my parents in their hallway for at least 20 years.  You can imagine the enjoyment all my friends (and my sister) have had over the years making fun of their once angelic mate and his little sister giving flowers to the Queen but I must admit to being rather proud of the occasion, particularly now.  Rest in Peace HRH Queen Elizabeth II."" Paul Hayden The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell shared a jigsaw puzzle and watched TV with the Queen at Sandringham. It was a great privilege to be alongside her. We sat down after dinner and did a jigsaw and the television was on.  It's a bereavement, and with every bereavement there is shock, there is loss but there is also thankfulness for a life lived well. A life of astonishing service. She was a person of simple but profound faith, and it was that faith that shaped her."" Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell Raven Harlow Aspenwood is severely visually impaired and has channeled her grief into her portrait of the young Queen Elizabeth II I am registered severely visually impaired, but I felt compelled to do something to channel my overwhelming and surprising level of grief following the sad passing of HRH, Queen Elizabeth II. I think my strongest memory of the queen is how comforting her presence has been during every stage of my 28 years of life, when something difficult has happened she has comforted us with her words, when something wonderful has happened she has filled our hearts with joy, with her wonderful smile and calming presence. She has been the grandmother of our nation, the matriarch we all need in times of hardship and times of joy. Her dignity, strength and consistency has been a great comfort and I thank her for her seventy years of steadfast service. Raven Harlow Aspenwood from East Yorkshire What a smile. She could lift a room with that wonderful smile and that genuine interest that she has in the people of this country."" Warwickshire County Council Leader, Izzi Seccombe I do remember her smile, I experienced that myself. It not only lit up a room, it lit up a nation - and she had the capacity to make us smile too."" Bishop of Coventry, Reverend Christopher Cocksworth Zara Umar gave flowers to the Queen in 2002 My daughter Zara and I went down to the City Square in Dundee to see the Queen in 2002. We waited for a long time. Soon the time came and the Queen was walking towards us. She was about five or six steps away from us when one of her security personnel guided the Queen away to the car to leave. Zara was so disappointed and my heart sank. Just then a plain clothes man came and asked me if he could lift Zara over the barrier. Much to my delight, Zara presented the flowers to the Queen and said 'here you are then, take your flowers.' I couldnt believe it! The Queen must have found it funny though and watched Zara return to me with a big smile on her face. I will treasure this memory forever."" Ishrat Umar, Dundee Three army veterans from Worcestershire pay tribute to the Queen... She was our head, she was our leader, she was the person we were serving and she's the one that we would follow. It hits you, it hits your heart."" Eric Braithwaite, who served for 23 years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Everyone called her the boss in one way or another. I've actually guarded the Queen and Prince Philip on other duties. A big lump in the throat, lost the boss, getting a new one."" Dave Sandy, who served in the territorial army from the late 1970s until the 1990s I've done a lot of parades for the Queen, she was a lovely lady and worked so hard for the country. I was in tears, I will be honest. It was an honour to be with her and be a soldier for her."" Anthony Goodway, who spent two years in national service from 1958 until 1960 I met the Queen when she visited the Isle of Skye as part of her Golden Jubilee tour. As a nurse then at the local care home, myself and other staff members were invited to bring some of our residents to meet Her Majesty. The great day came, our ladies looking beautiful, wheelchairs polished. One of our residents had worked at the palace as a younger woman and had photos of the Queen all around her room in the care home, so, if any one was to be there that day, it was her.  As the Queen approached our little group that day she asked me: âAre these the ladies from the care home?' I replied in the positive and then said this resident had worked in the palace. The Queen looked down a little and asked her: âWhen did you work at the palace?â To which, the lady looked up and and replied, in a rather gruff voice: âAnd who are you?â What a moment. I apologised. The Queen just smiled and moved on.  I was quite overwhelmed, I donât have photos of the Queen all over the house, but Iâve always respected her, especially as a Christian woman. She had a real true faith, so meeting her was very special. I didnât expect to be so overcome by the moment. Her demeanour was that of interest and she handled the situation really well. She left us all feeling very special and honoured. Barbara Matheson from Glasgow Barbara Matheson has recalled the moment she met the Queen during Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee tour Â© 2025 BBC.

"Nadia had no idea her corgi Wilbur had such a famous relative Nadia wanted to get a corgi because it was the Queen's favourite dog. When she finally adopted one, he came with more of a royal connection than she realised. The 28-year-old welcomed Wilbur - ""the cutest puppy ever"" - last year. She was browsing social media one day when she stumbled across an article about the Queen's newest corgi, Muick. As she scrolled down, it dawned on her that Wilbur had come from the same breeder. ""I looked at the photo and thought 'Oh my God - the Queen has adopted his only brother',"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""There were only two in the litter."" After the Queen's death last week, people began to ask what would happen to her beloved corgis. It has since been announced that Muick, and the Queen's other corgi Sandy, will be going to live with her son Prince Andrew and his ex-wife. The Queen with one of her other dogs as she looks at memorabilia in January this year After Nadia found out about Wilbur's famous brother she felt she ""had to tell the Queen"" and decided to write to Buckingham Palace. She sent photos and copies his adoption documents to prove the canine siblings' connection, and to tell the Her Majesty she had been ""inspired by her and her love of the breed"". About 10 days later, Nadia says: ""We got a letter in the post with a royal stamp on it. ""The fact that we got a letter back as well - it's so cool. ""It said the Queen was delighted that we took the time to write to her, and she said it looks like Wilbur has an amazing home with us. ""So Wilbur lives in a small house and his brother's in a palace."" Nadia says she'll be making the trip to London with Wilbur to pay their respects to the Queen this week. But she is just one of many young people who have decided to adopt a corgi in recent years. Amy Powell thinks the image of corgis as an ""older person's dog"" is slowly fading Amy Powell - a 21-year-old student studying to be a paramedic - decided to get a corgi with her boyfriend, Sam, last year. She also says the Queen was the main motivator behind her choice of breed. ""When I was a bit younger, I always saw the Queen on TV with lots of corgis,"" she says. ""So I think a lot of it was growing up and seeing her with the dogs. After adopting her corgi - called Baxter - Amy says she was surprised to discover lots of people her age with corgis. ""I think they're still thought of as an older person's dog,"" she says. Queen and her corgis - how the dogs first stole her heart Crying corgi illustration goes viral Prince Andrew to care for Queen's beloved corgis In a Facebook post shared widely on a corgi-lovers' group last week, lots of owners around the UK said they believed their dogs had acted differently since news of the Queen's death broke. But, according to groups such as the RSPCA, it's probably more likely that thedogs are recognising and reacting to their owner's emotions,external. Amy and Nadia both agree they've noticed a change in their own pets' behaviour. ""Wilbur has been acting a little bit differently and has definitely needed a little bit more love over the last few days,"" Nadia says. Amy says Baxter has ""never really been much of a lap dog"" but, after the announcement, ""he jumped up on our laps and wouldn't leave my side for the rest of the evening"". What next?

"Retailers John Lewis and DFS have said customers are cutting back on the amount they spend due to the rising cost of living. John Lewis said while shopper numbers were higher than last year, customers were spending less and avoiding buying as many ""big ticket"" items. ""No one could have predicted the scale of the cost of living crisis,"" said John Lewis boss Dame Sharon White. The company reported a loss of Â£99m,externalfor the first half of its trading year. Sofa retailerDFS Furniture reported slumping annual profits,externaldue to a dip in consumer spending, saying order numbers had ""softened markedly"" as shoppers tightened their belts. Also on Thursday, fashion chainH&M filed lower-than-expected quarterly sales.,external, but said it had seen a ""better start for the autumn collections than last year"". Dame Sharon said customers were less likely to splash out on ""big ticket"" household items and were moving their spending to dining out at restaurants and to holidays. ""No one could have predicted the scale of the cost of living crisis that has materialised, with energy prices and inflation rising ahead of anyone's expectations,"" she said. ""As a business, we have faced unprecedented cost inflation across grocery and general merchandise."" Over-50s quitting fuels inflation, warns John Lewis Milk and cheese push food inflation to 14-year high However, she said it was ""not unusual"" for the John Lewis Partnership to report a loss in the first half of the year as its trading is ""heavily skewed"" to Christmas, with most of its profits made in the final months of the year. In the first half of last year, the partnership reported a loss of Â£29m. Dame Sharon White said the outlook was ""highly uncertain"" The company said its losses this year were due to a combination of rising wholesale prices for goods not being passed on to customers, households cutting back on spending, and the ""unwinding"" of Covid shopping habits. It said it chose to ""forgo"" profit to help staff and customers through the cost-of-living crisis. The employee-owned group announced a Â£500 one-off payment to full-time workers, with a pro-rata amount for those working part-time, to support staff. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the ""fight is on for consumers' remaining disposable cash"". She said DFS was the ""latest"" company to warn of the the ""painful effects"" of inflation. ""DFS is not only having to cope with a slowdown due to purchases which were brought forward during the pandemic, but now as household bills mount for essentials like food and heating, a plush new sofa is a luxury many consumers are happy to do without,"" she said. Overall UK inflation, which measures the rate at which prices rise, is running near a 40-year high, but the rate eased for the first time in almost a year in August,slipping to 9.9% from July's 10.1%. Food prices have been increasing around the world following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has been one of the factors pushing up prices at supermarket tills, and Waitrose said its sales were down 5% on last year, with basket sizes ""smaller by nearly a fifth"". The Bank of England has warned inflation could top 13% this year, and is expected to keep increasing interest rates in an attempt to control it. John Lewis said its fashion sales increased as people shopped for travel and summer breaks. However, revenue from its home and technology ranges, which performed well during the height of the pandemic, declined. The company said the impact of the rise in the cost of living, specifically around energy costs, was ""evident in patterns of spending"", with sales of its own-brand items rising 28% and energy saving goods, such as air fryers and smart thermostats, increasing. Dame Sharon said the outlook for the rest of the year was ""highly uncertain owing to the cost of living crisis and its impact on discretionary spending as well as criticality of our Christmas trading period"". She said a successful Christmas was ""key for the business"", adding a bumper festive period beyond previous years was needed to ""generate sufficient profit"" for the company to be able to pay staff their usual bonus. Last month,Dame Sharon told the BBCthat an exodus of over-50s who left the workforce during the Covid pandemic had fuelled wage inflation. The UK has seen one million people, mostly in their 50s, leave work since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak, with job vacancies at a record high. It has meant employers who want to attract and retain staff are under pressure to lift wages, which in turn fuels inflation.

"Historical ceremony and modern firearms mix at a march past the Bank of England The most complex security operation London has ever seen is under way. The Queen is lying in state, and thousands of people are on the streets of the capital queuing to pay their respects, with many more to come. In the hours and days ahead of the funeral on Monday, the Japanese emperor, kings and queens, the US president, and heads of state from across the globe will assemble in London. They will then all go to Westminster Abbey, which does not have any permanent security perimeter, for a very public funeral. All of this will be played out in front of hundreds of millions of television viewers around the world, providing a tempting target for international terrorists. It has required a security response unprecedented in scale. MI5 and GCHQ are working behind the scenes with counter-terrorism police, the Metropolitan Police has reinforcements from forces across the country, and military personnel and civilian stewards are all playing a role. For now, the queue of people waiting to pay their last respects, snaking its way from Lambeth Bridge along the South Bank, is the most vulnerable point. The queue will be there night and day until the early hours of Monday morning. As a first line of defence against the terrorist threat, the police are asking the public to be their own eyes and ears, to look out for each other, stay vigilant, trust their instincts and report anything that does not feel right. The government has hired hundreds of stewards from private security firms to help with queue management. Some 1,500 military personnel have also been deployed since Tuesday night, among them Gurkhas and Paratroopers, Royal Navy Police and Royal Military Police, and RAF personnel in their blue-grey uniforms. A military Wildcat helicopter has made several flights over Westminster. Behind the scenes, the security service MI5 is watching for any changes of behaviour by ""subjects of interest"", people suspected of involvement in violent extremism and terrorism. GCHQ will continue to monitor all forms of telecommunication. Armed police officers with binoculars have already been visible on rooftops in Westminster. Armed police can be seen on rooftops Watching the queue are police specialists trained to identify people preparing a terrorist act. At the main police control room just south of Lambeth Bridge officers are watching footage from hundreds of fixed CCTV cameras. Extra, mobile CCTV cameras have been put in at vulnerable sites or where there are holes in the coverage. Dogs specially trained to sniff out explosives and firearms are passing periodically through the crowds. Thousands of police officers are being deployed in central London each day, but the Met were keen to emphasise the number of reinforcements being provided by other forces. They do not want the people who live in London to think that normal day-to-day policing has been abandoned. Under what is known as ""mutual aid"", the Met are borrowing hundreds of officers from forces outside London - from as far away as Scotland and Northern Ireland. These are being provided under longstanding plans for a national mobilisation for the monarch's funeral, which include a wide range of specialist officers. For example explosives sniffer dog teams from West Yorkshire and Lancashire have been patrolling the Mall this week. The Met want to stress that while the event is unprecedented, much of the policing will be familiar to its officers. ""At every event that we police in London, we are considering the threat from terrorism, the threat from crime, looking after people at the same time,"" said Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Cundy. ""So whilst it is a unique event we are well-versed, officers are well trained and also experienced at policing such large events."" The scale of this week's security operation has been compared to the London Olympics. But in 2012 the public spent much of their time in venues where they had to pass through security checkpoint. At the lying-in-state, the checkpoint is only at the entrance to Westminster Hall, with people queuing for many hours before they reach that point. It can also be compared to the funerals of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother and Diana, Princess of Wales, but the extraordinary number of heads of state visiting the capital for this event makes it much more complicated. The threat has also changed. What are known as ""lone actor"" attacks using vehicles as weapons, or knives that can be bought from supermarkets, have become commonplace in the last decade The heads of state will start arriving as early as Friday. They will include Emperor Naruhito of Japan, kings and queens from Europe, Tonga and Bhutan, the Emir of Qatar, and presidents and prime ministers from dozens of countries. Those with particularly high-risk profiles include US President Joe Biden, and Isaac Herzog, the president of Israel. The security service from each of their countries will have their own concerns. But Mr Cundy says his force ""is very used to working with those who are involved in protection of dignitaries from across the world"". Police tracked the route of the cortege to Westminster Hall on Wednesday Heads of state will attend a reception with the King at Buckingham Palace on Sunday night. And then on Monday morning they will gather at Westminster Abbey for the funeral itself. Initially police wanted all of dignitaries to use all transport provided by the UK government to travel there, but the plans have now been revised. President Biden will be allowed to use his personal armoured car, ""the Beast"", and some other heads of state will also use their own vehicles. Before then a huge area around the abbey will have to be checked. Every manhole cover will be lifted, checked and sealed. Each lamp post will be opened and examined. Anywhere where an improvised explosive device could be hidden needs to be peered into. Dogs sniffing for explosives will pass through the abbey and surrounding areas time and again. On the morning of the funeral itself even more police spotters will be out on rooftops. Firearms officers will be discretely positioned across the secure area. The SAS will be on standby. Usually heads of state only gather together in extremely tightly-controlled security environments such as the UN General Assembly, but the Queen's funeral will be a public event. It is designed to be seen, and the Royal Family will want to be seen. But that brings with it a plethora of security difficulties. ""Ceremony and security are not happy bedfellows,"" says former Commander Bob Broadhurst, who was in charge of security for the Olympics. ""I don't know if there is another large country in the world that would allow this to happen."" In the meantime an unanticipated problem for the police has arisen since the Queen's death - that of anti-monarchy protesters shouting slogans like ""Not my King"" at ceremonial events. Some have been arrested, and in Scotland two have been charged. The National Police Chiefs Council has since issued guidance to officers on how to balance the right to protest with the right to grieve and reflect, though this guidance has not been made public. On Monday, Paul Powlesland, a barrister who specialises among other things in protest rights stood outside Parliament with a blank sheet of paper, and was approached by a police officer asking for his details. After the new guidance was issued, he went back to Parliament on Tuesday with 30 other people to see what police officers would do. He had a placard reading ""Not my King"" and he said that this time he was very differently treated. He was left alone. ""It seems that the media furore and also the public backlash to this heavy-handed policing has had its effect"", Mr Powlesland said. It was a reminder that even while involved in a huge and complex security operation, police officers will also need to be sensitive. What next?

"The BBC's Kristian Johnson joined people who camped out to ensure they made the front of the queue Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to pay their respects to the Queen, as she lies in state over the next four days. BBC journalist Kristian Johnson joined those who camped overnight to ensure they were among the first in - he was 17th in the queue - and made new friends on a drenched night in London. At 10pm on Tuesday the heavens opened. People who had only met hours before huddled up together. Their umbrellas offered little respite from the rain. I was one of the lucky ones. My tent, pitched on the cold pavement of London's South Bank, gave me some shelter from the downpour. But even so, after just a few minutes outside, my jeans were soaked through. I wasn't the only one. ""We've got wet bottoms, but dry feet,"" said Sheila Morton, who was tucked up under a foil sheet with her friend, Lesley O'Hara. Journalists had significantly outnumbered people queuing on Monday, when Vanessa Nathakumaran proudly took her spot at the head of the queue. She only carried a bag with her - and she had more than 48 hours left to wait before she could get inside Westminster Hall. When I joined her on Tuesday lunchtime, I had secured position number 17 in the queue. Michael Darvill, 85, and his daughter Mandy Desmond, 55, were my new neighbours. They had already settled down in camping chairs. There were no books, no card games and no tablets to keep them occupied, just conversation. It was a theme everyone else seemed to unconsciously follow. No-one was staring at their phone screen and not a single person had plugged their headphones in. There was too much to talk about. How long is the queue to see the Queen's coffin? Sombre procession begins lying-in-state ceremony A day-by-day guide: From now until the Queen's funeral By the time the rain - which had fallen as drizzle on Tuesday afternoon - grew stronger and became a deluge, there were about 50 of us in the queue. A man called Gary Keen walked along the line offering slices of pizza. Jacqueline Nemorin, from Mauritius, shared her punnet of strawberries with the women sat next to her. At the front of the queue, a local charity arrived to hand out cups of tea and coffee. Yaqub Yousuf, who lives close to nearby Lambeth Bridge, brought endless supplies from his home to make life more comfortable for those in the queue. ""I saw these ladies completely unprepared so I decided to bring five chairs from my flat so they could sit down,"" he said. ""Then I realised they would be soaked all night, so I brought bags and blankets."" A little further along the line, impromptu singalongs of God Save the King broke out and candles were lit to remember the Queen. Others ordered food on Deliveroo. Truus Nayman first arrived in England in 1954 - a year after the Queen's coronation Even in the midst of the torrential rain, Andrew Israels-Swenson continued to swap stories with 85-year-old Truus Nayman. The pair hadn't moved from a wooden bench they had shared since meeting for the first time earlier that day. Andrew, who flew in from Minnesota on Saturday night, said he felt he had won a ""golden ticket"" by securing an overnight spot on a bench. Truus, originally from the Netherlands, told me she first arrived in England in 1954 - one year after the Queen's coronation. ""I'm a little bit of an oldie in this game now,"" she said, ""because my husband and I queued up when [Winston] Churchill died [in 1965]. We did a whole night standing here. ""When Princess Diana died [in 1997], my son and I queued up at Kensington Palace to sign the book of condolences. Then when the Queen Mother died [in 2002], I lined up on my own. I'm a royalist at heart."" I crawled into my tent at 2am, soaked to the skin. When I woke up two hours later, Michael and his daughter Mandy were still smiling, despite not getting any sleep. ""We got wet before 2am and we haven't got dry since,"" Michael said. ""The water went down the back of the chair, so we've been sitting in water."" Monica Farag was the sixth person in the queue Mercifully, the rain had stopped by the time the sun started to rise. The shift in weather not only seemed to warm bodies, but also spirits. People sipped coffees and rubbed their bleary eyes as it dawned on them that they were only a few hours away from a historic moment. Monica Farag, originally from the Philippines, was the sixth person in the queue. She didn't have a chair to sit on, but the 61-year-old was still beaming from ear to ear at 7am. ""I'm so excited, even though I'm lacking sleep,"" she said. ""It's a beautiful experience. This is the highlight of my 36 years in England."" Shortly before lunchtime, I was told to pack away my tent. The crowds behind us had swelled. The night before, the queue had been a neat line of people sat next to one another. Now it was five people wide, as newcomers began jostling for position. Tempers flared momentarily when someone tried to push into the queue. But finally, at 3pm, we were ushered forward in batches of 20. I joined Truus, Andrew, Michael, Mandy and Paul - my neighbours during the night - in a slow procession over Lambeth Bridge as we edged towards Westminster. Although the rain had long since passed, and the sun was now shining, a sombre atmosphere quickly set in as we snaked past Victoria Tower. Gone were the jokes and the camaraderie of our night under umbrellas. At 5pm, the doors to Parliament slowly opened and everyone fell completely and utterly silent. For the first time since I joined the queue, there wasn't a single sound. At the centre of Westminster Hall was the Queen's coffin. A woman behind me choked back tears. Ahead of me, Andrew and Truus walked together, arm-in-arm. I glanced up at the ceiling, approached the coffin and gave a nod. And in the blink of an eye, it was over. After 30 hours of waiting, the moment in Westminster Hall lasted no longer than 90 seconds. As I emerged again into the evening sunshine, one of my neighbours from the queue was waiting. ""I was there for her final journey,"" said Paul. ""That moment when I bowed my head to that great womanâ¦ I would go through it all again for that.""

"Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill met King Charles at Hillsborough on Tuesday Despite the success of King Charles III's historic visit to Northern Ireland, has the rewind button been pressed on reconciliation? The question was posed at an event on Tuesday just after the King left. Crowds gathered at Hillsborough and in Belfastto welcome the King and Camilla, the Queen Consort. During the visit, assembly Speaker, Sinn FÃ©in'sAlex Maskey, delivered a message of condolenceto the royal couple on behalf of the assembly. He said everyone was ""thankful for Queen Elizabeth's commitment and encouragement to building peace and reconciliation across these islands and indeed for all of those who seek to keep us moving towards that goal"". On Tuesday night, the King's visit, the work of the Queen to promote reconciliation and Mr Maskey's speech were all discussed at an event to launch a new book - Living with Ghosts - by the journalist and author Brian Rowan. Author Brian Rowan said he had been most hopeful of progress more than a decade ago in 2007 It was attended by many who have had a close-up view of the peace process, including senior loyalists and republicans. For some, like the former head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, David Sterling, the King's visit offered a chance to change the political stalemate at Stormont. ""There's perhaps just an opportunity,"" he told BBC News NI. ""There's maybe a moment that if somebody could just capture, perhaps could bring the parties back together and maybe build from that and get the executive restored, because people here, because public services here, need it really badly."" For Mr Rowan, though, there was concern about what the current political division means for the peace process as a whole. ""We have pressed the rewind button and so I think that's the problem, that on occasions when we've got momentum we slow it down,"" he said. He said he had been most hopeful of progress more than a decade ago in 2007. David Sterling said the King's visit offered a chance to change the political dynamic at Stormont That year in the newly-restored Northern Ireland Assembly, the first minister, Democratic Unionist Party leader Ian Paisley, and the deputy first minister, Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness, surprised many by establishing a rapport and good working relationship. They were labelled the Chuckle Brothers as a result of being frequently photographed laughing and smiling together. Earlier in January of that year, Mr Maskey and Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams attended the late loyalist leaderDavid Ervine's funeral on east Belfast's Newtownards Road,external. ""That was the moment when I thought we had a chance,"" Mr Rowan said. ""The best chance of this process so far. ""But if you ask me, could Gerry Adams step on to the Newtownards Road in 2022? No he couldn't, and that's what I mean about [how] we've pressed the rewind button."" His concerns were shared by Jeanette Ervine, David Ervine's widow. ""I try to be hopeful because I feel our young people, they don't want to know, the majority of them don't want to know,"" she told BBC News NI. ""They want normality and I think they deserve that, but I think there are too many just living for yesteryear and they don't want to change it. ""We all need to reach out to the other community. ""There isn't enough leadership, definitely - I think that is a huge problem, it really is."" The book launch was attended by many who have had a close-up view of the peace process She said the Queen's actions and words on her state visit to Ireland in 2011 and herhandshake with Mr McGuinness in 2012were still examples of reconciliation to follow. ""I think David would have been very, very pleased, as I was,"" Ms Ervine said. ""I thought it was great that she reached out and I think we need more of the same. ""We need people reaching out to each other."" Senior loyalist Jackie McDonald was also at Tuesday's event, and agreed with those opinions. Queen Elizabeth II shook hands with Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness in 2012 ""The fact that she shook Martin McGuinness's hand, it meant so much to everybody,"" he said. ""We need to take a leaf out of the Queen's book, see the efforts she made on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland for peace to try to encourage people to go on the right road and we should all learn from that."" Another who referenced the Queen's importance to peace in Northern Ireland was the Reverend Harold Good. Along with the Catholic priest Fr Alex Reid,the Methodist minister was an independent witness to IRA decommissioningin 2005. Speaking at the book launch, Dr Good recalled how the Queen had spoken of Northern Ireland's troubled past on her state visit to Ireland in 2011. During a speech at a state banquet in Dublin Castle, the Queen had said: ""With the benefit of historical hindsight, we can all see things which we would wish had been done differently or not at all. ""In that line there was acknowledgement of history,""  Dr Good told the audience at Tuesday's launch. ""You talked about the need for truth. ""We're not going to move on to the next stage until we are open strong and honest enough with each other."" Loyalist Jackie McDonald said the Queen's actions should be an example to people He went on to say that it was up to adults in Northern Ireland to ""leave a better legacy to our children, the generation that's coming behind us than the one which we inherited"". He continued: ""Do you know one thing I worry about? Our children don't know our history. ""We need to find ways of helping them to understand our history. ""To understand the present you need to understand the past, and to understand the future we need to leave the past where it belongs. ""We're all saying integrated education, great idea. ""Do you know what worries me about that? We're asking our children to do something that we're not always prepared to do ourselves.""

"New Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng The Treasury is considering removing a cap on bankers' bonuses as part of a post-Brexit shake-up of City rules. Sources said no final decisions had been made, but confirmed chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng considered it a way of making London a more attractive place for global banks to do business. City bosses have long complained about the EU-wide bonus rules which cap bonuses at twice an employee's salary. They say they lead to higher base pay that pushes up banks' fixed costs. Those costs cannot be adjusted in line with the firm's financial performance, they add, making the UK less attractive than the US or Asia. People close to Mr Kwarteng confirmedreports in the Financial Times,externalthat the new chancellor is considering the move. Kwasi Kwarteng: Chancellor who likes a challenge Review of workers' employment rights scrapped Critics have argued that uncapped bonuses lead to the kind of excessive risk taking that spawned the financial crisis of 2008. But others argue that other new rules that can hold senior managers personally and potentially criminally responsible for misconduct, plus the ability to claw back bonuses years after they are granted, achieve a sufficient disincentive. Taking the lid off bankers' pay at a time when many households are facing hardship from the rising cost of living will undoubtedly provoke outrage in many quarters. The proposal ""sends a rather confused signal when people are being squeezed in terms of the cost of living, and the government is trying to encourage pay restraint in the public sector"", Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, told the BBC. ""To appear to allow bankers to have bigger bonuses at the same time, doesn't look very well timed. There may be some longer term arguments for pursing this policy but I think the timing would be very bad if they did it now."" Rachel Winter, from Killick & Co, told the BBC: ""It's an absolutely terrible time for this headline when you've got inflation [at] a 40-year high, you've got so many people struggling with the cost of living, do we really want to be reading headlines about banker bonuses? ""Arguably the banks do pay a lot of tax, so I think the chancellor is looking at ways to boost the UK economy to get more banks to come to London, to stay in London and pay more tax."" Removing the cap is just one of a number of deregulation initiatives being considered. The government is also keen to relax rules limiting the amount insurance and pension funds can invest in assets that are harder to sell at short notice - such as long-term infrastructure projects. These rules are part of pan-European regulations collectively known as Solvency II. But the Bank of England is concerned that relaxing the rules could expose pensioners' savings to greater long-term risk and that lowering the amount of ready cash firms are required to hold could see them pay out any money freed up to their shareholders rather than invest in projects favoured by the government. Pitting the Treasury and the financial services industry against the Bank of England is seen as a key test of the Bank's independence and senior officials at the Bank have privately conceded the fight over Solvency II is a political one they could well lose. Kwasi Kwarteng laid out his ""unashamedly pro-growth plan"" for the economy at a gathering of senior bankers two weeks ago. He would argue that the instincts that persuade him to cut banking regulations are the same instincts that persuaded him to throw a Â£100bn-plus shield over businesses and households to prevent high energy prices causing a job-and-growth-killing recession.

"Yvon Chouinard founded Patagonia in 1973 The billionaire founder of the outdoor fashion brand Patagonia has given away his company to a charitable trust. Yvon Chouinard said any profit not reinvested in running the business would go to fighting climate change. The label has amassed a cult following due to sustainability moves like guaranteeing its clothes for life and offering reasonably priced repairs. It is famous for an advert titled""Don't buy this jacket""asking shoppers to consider costs to the environment. The brand's website now states: ""Earth is now our only shareholder."" Mr Chouinard has always said he ""never wanted to be a businessman"". A rock climbing fanatic, he started out as making metal climbing spikes for himself and his friends to wedge into rocks, before moving into clothing and eventually creating a hugely successful sportswear brand with a cult following. Founded in 1973, Patagonia's sales were worth around $1.5bn this year, while Mr Chouinard's net worth is thought to be $1.2bn. But he has always shied away from his wealthy status, telling the New York Times he was ""horrified to be seen as a billionaire"". He claimed that profits to be donated to climate causes will amount to around $100m (Â£87m) a year, depending on the health of the company. ""Despite its immensity, the Earth's resources are not infinite, and it's clear we've exceeded its limits,"" the entrepreneur said of his decision to give up ownership. The firm's marketing campaigns - focused around asking people to buy only what they need - have not dampened sales and critics have argued by raising its prominence it has encouraged more spending rather than less. Prices are relatively high with jumpers, for example, costing around Â£200 and T-shirts around Â£40, but the company argues that the cost reflects the fact its clothes are meant to last a lifetime. Patagonia's chairman, Charles Conn, acknowledged the higher prices but said cheap fast fashion was ""anathema"" to the brand. ""We invest in making sure we use the least water, the least dangerous chemistries and dyes, and use the least carbon in the production of our products, which often means they cost a little bit more,"" he told the BBC. Sandra Halliday, UK editor for FashionNetwork.com, a global fashion news website, told the BBC Mr Chouinard's move could ironically end up boosting its sales further. However, she said the ""maverick"" founder had always been more committed to the environment than ""simply making money"". ""If this was simply a marketing ploy it would be an inspired one, but it's not, it's actually a genuine move to try to do something better for the planet."" Microsoft founderBill Gates this year vowed to ""drop off""the world's rich list as he made a $20bn donation to his philanthropic fund. The tech boss, who is thought to be worth $118bn, had pledged to give his wealth away to charity in 2010 but his net worth has more than doubled since then. Last year the boss of the Hut Group, which owns a range of online beauty and nutrition brands, donated Â£100m to a charitable foundation after becoming a billionaire when his firm was listed. Matthew Moulding said of his newfound wealth that he ""couldn't even comprehend the numbers"" and was trying to make a difference. In 2019, Julian Richer who founded hi-fi chain Richer Soundshanded over 60% of the business to staff The Californian firm was already donating 1% of its annual sales to grassroots activists and committed to sustainable practices. But inan open letter to customers,external, the apparently reluctant businessman said he wanted to do more. Mr Chouinard said he had initially considered selling Patagonia and donating the money to charity, or taking the company public. But he said both options would have meant giving up control of the business and putting its values at risk. Instead, the Chouinard family has transferred all ownership to two new entities. The Patagonia Purpose Trust, led by the family, remains the company's controlling shareholder but will only own 2% of its total stock, Mr Chouinard said. It will guide the philanthropy of the Holdfast Collective, a US charity ""dedicated to fighting the environmental crisis"" which now owns all of the non-voting stock - some 98% of the company. ""Each year the money we make after reinvesting in the business will be distributed as a dividend to help fight the crisis,"" Mr Chouinard said. Yvon Chouinard started out making metal spikes for rock climbing Patagonia combines high-end outdoor fashion with its own brand of environmental and social activism. It's a heady combination that certainly appeals to a loyal, if predominantly well-heeled following. Part of the attraction comes from the fact that its environmentally conscious stance isn't new. It was preaching eco-awareness years before sustainable fashion became fashionable. But it's still pretty hard to save the planet, if your business depends on selling stuff, however many recycled or renewable products you use. By ringfencing future profits for environmental causes, Patagonia's founder Yvon Chouinard has done his best to square that circle. But he is also clearly trying to ensure that Patagonia brand is future-proofed and can never fall into the hands of the kind of companies he has accused of greenwashing in the past. And if that doesn't appeal to wealthy outdoorsy types with a social conscience, nothing will. Is durable the new black?

"While some Wall Street banks launch return-to-office battles in London and New York, Citigroup is trying a different tack: offices at the beach. The bank has opened a new hub for junior staff in the seaside city of Malaga, on Spain's Costa del Sol. In addition to sun, staff are promised a reprieve from the industry's traditionally gruelling hours. Though salaries are also lower, more than 3,000 people applied for a spot, the bank said. The bank has hired 27 people so far, from a stated goal of 30. The group, most of them aged 22 to 26, is drawn from 22 countries and speaks 15 different languages. Its staff in Malaga will work eight-hour days with no weekend work for around half of the $100,000 (Â£86,000) starting salary offered for the same roles in London and New York. Accordingto one career website,external, investment bankers in London typically work a 65-70 hour week in quiet periods, although this can rise to as many as 100 hours in busy periods. Citi formally opened a new office in Malaga on Wednesday The first day at the office, which formally opened on Wednesday, included a round of hobnobbing with Malaga's mayor, Citi said. Officially, the new recruits will assist teams working with clients in a range of industries, including property, technology and healthcare. Bank representatives said the jobs are office-based, not remote, Citi first announced the plan in March, saying it was meant to help it reduce turnover and draw new people to the industry, which has seen its allure fade as tech companies and other firms in finance dangle similarly high salaries but less demanding days. ""Low levels of junior banker retention are being seen across the industry, and the message is clear: the key driver behind many junior-level departures is the search for a better work-life balance. At Citi, we are listening,"" Manolo FalcÃ³, the bank's global co-head of banking, capital markets and advisory said at the time. Goldman Sachs offers senior staff unlimited holiday The bank has also raised starting salaries, while Citi boss Jane Fraser, the first woman to lead a Wall Street bank, famously declared Zoom-free Fridays last year, calling for a ""reset"" from the ""relentlessness of the pandemic workday"". The moves come as the pandemic has lain bare strains in banking's infamously tough work culture. In recent years, for example, young staff at Goldman Sachs have revolted against senior managers, taking gripes about burnout, return-to-office demands and, most recently, allegedly stingy coffee perks to the press. In May, Goldman appeared to soften its image when it said senior staff would be allowed to take as much holiday as they wanted in order to ""rest and recharge"".  Junior bankers, however, will still only be entitled to a fixed amount of holiday. The bank follows tech firms LinkedIn, Bumble and Netflix in introducing the perk.
