"Jean-Marc Janaillac tendered his resignation after staff at the airline rejected a new pay deal. The survival of strike-hit Air France is in the balance, according to the country's economy minister. Bruno Le Maire's warning that Air France could ""disappear"" comes as staff begin another round of industrial action over a pay dispute. Despite the French state owning 14.3% of the Air France-KLM parent group, the loss-making airline would not be bailed out, he said. On Friday Air France-KLM's chief executive quit over the crisis. Air France-KLM is one of Europe's biggest airlines, but has seen a series of strikes in recent weeks. Monday's walk-out is the 14th day of action, as staff press for a 5.1% salary increase this year. The government's response is seen as a test oflabour reforms launched by French President Emmanuel Macron. There have also been strikes at the state-owned SNCF rail company. On Sunday, Mr Le Maire told French news channel BFM: ""I call on everyone to be responsible: crew, ground staff, and pilots who are asking for unjustified pay hikes. ""The survival of Air France is in the balance,"" he said, adding that the state would not serve as a backstop for the airline's debts. ""Air France will disappear if it does not make the necessary efforts to be  competitive,"" he warned. Despite the strike, the airline insisted that it would be able to maintain 99% of long-haul flights on Monday, 80% of medium-haul services and 87% of short-haul flights. On Friday, Jean-Marc Janaillac, chief executive of parent company Air France-KLM, resigned after staff rejected a final pay offer from him, which would have raised wages by 7% over four years. Employees of Air France-KLM's French operations have staged a series of strikes in recent days Air France-KLM reported a net loss of â¬269m (Â£238m) in the first quarter of the year. British Airways and Lufthansa have already undergone heavy cost-cutting in recent years, amid rising competition from low-cost airlines and carriers from the Gulf states. But many analysts say Air France has lagged far behind when it comes to restructuring and has failed to address its continued losses. The group has already downgraded expectations of its financial performance for 2018. Air France merged with Dutch carrier KLM in 2004. The joint company flies tens of millions of passengers around the world every year.

"Glasgow Queen Street has been named Britain's most unpopular railway station in a survey of passengers. Independent watchdog Transport Focus took the views of more than 28,000 people at 56 stations for its ranking. Only 58% of travellers were ""satisfied"" with Queen Street, Scotland's third busiest station. Glasgow Central nearby made the top 10 with a 91% approval. London King's Cross achieved a 96% score and was the most popular station, just above neighbouring St Pancras. Transport Focus said the top priorities for passengers were arrival time information, waiting rooms and the overall look of the station when it carried out the survey between September and November last year.

The recently refurbished London King's Cross was the top-rated station The four stations which ranked the highest have undergone major refurbishment works in recent years.

"Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson will have two days of talks with White House officials Boris Johnson is visiting Washington to urge the US not to scrap the international deal designed to prevent Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. The UK and its European allies have until 12 May to persuade President Donald Trump to stick with the deal. Mr Trump has strongly criticised the agreement, which he calls ""insane"". In a call with Theresa May on Saturday, the president ""underscored his commitment to ensure that Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon"". In the landmark deal - signed by the US, China, Russia, Germany, France, the UK and Iran - the latter agrees to limit its nuclear activities in return for the easing of sanctions on its economy. What is the Iran nuclear deal? Is Iran's economy better off since the nuclear deal? Could the deal collapse? European allies France, the UK and Germany all agree the current deal is the best way to stop Iran developing nuclear weapons and theUN also warned Mr Trump not to walk away from the deal. But Mr Trump has threatened to withdraw unless the signatories agree to ""fix the deal's disastrous flaws."" The British Ambassador to the US says France, UK and Germany have been working together for weeks to figure out a new way to address Mr Trump's concerns that the terms of the agreement are too lenient. However, Sir Kim Darroch insists all three countries are looking at how a deal would work even without the US. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani saysthe US will face ""historic regret"" if it pulls out. In remarks carried live on state television, he said Iran had ""a plan to counter any decision Trump may take and we will confront it"". This video can not be played A timeline of what Trump's said about the Iran deal Mr Johnson will meet US Vice-President Mike Pence, National Security Adviser John Bolton and foreign policy leaders in Congress. Ahead of the trip, Mr Johnson said the UK and US are ""in lockstep"" on many global foreign policy issues, citing the response to the use of chemical weapons in Syria and the Salisbury poisonings. He added: ""The UK, US and European partners are also united in our effort to tackle the kind of Iranian behaviour that makes the Middle East region less secure - its cyber activities, its support for groups like Hezbollah, and its dangerous missile programme, which is arming Houthi militias in Yemen."" The UK-US talks come after Israel revealed ""secret nuclear files"" accusing Iran of having run a secret nuclear weapons programme, which was reportedly mothballed 15 years ago. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the documents were authentic and show the 2015 Iran nuclear deal was ""built on lies"". Iran, in turn, accused Mr Netanyahu of lying. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said the documents produced by Israel were a rehash of old allegations already dealt with by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN's nuclear watchdog. Mr Trump has until the deadline of 12 May to make a decision on the deal - the next deadline for waiving sanctions. Earlier this month, Mr Johnson said it was important to keep the deal ""while building on it in order to take account of the legitimate concerns of the US"". Mr Johnson's discussions are also expected to cover the crisis in Syria and also North Korea, ahead of Mr Trump's meeting with Kim Jong-un, which now has a date and location arranged.

"Rosemary Carroll with Paul White, the leader of Pendle Conservatives at the election count Labour has demanded an apology after the Conservatives gained control of a council after reinstating a councillor suspended for sharing a racist joke on Facebook. Rosemary Carroll's return to Tory ranks handed the party control ofPendlecouncil in Lancashire by a single seat. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said it was ""unacceptable"". Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said he would ""have a look"" at the case. 'Racist joke' councillor rejoins Tories Local elections: The results in maps and charts Mr Lewis told Sky News Ms Carroll had taken part in diversity training and that her case had been ""dealt with locally"" last year. She has previously said she meant to delete the post, which compared an Asian person to a dog, but ended up publishing it by mistake. ""The reality is when we have these issues we deal with them and she is a good example of that, that was dealt with at the time and it was dealt with locally to be fair as well,"" he said. Mr McDonnell told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""To have the Conservative Party take control of that council by reinstating a councillor who used the foulest, foulest joke, a racist joke is unacceptable."" He called on Mr Lewis, who tweeted his congratulations to the Pendle Tories after the election, to apologise and for Ms Carroll to be suspended again. Conservative Business Secretary Greg Clark said he was sure that ""party authorities"" would be investigating. Ms Carroll was suspended for three months in June 2017 over the incident. After the suspension expired, she continued to sit as an independent councillor for the Earby ward. Previously she had held theyear-long post of Pendle's mayor,externalbetween 2016 and 2017. Pendle would have been a hung council following Thursday's local elections if she had continued as an independent, but on Friday the council said it had been notified Ms Carroll had ""re-joined the Conservative group"".

"This video can not be played Dr Joyce Tyldesley, of Manchester University, tells Today about the secrets of Tutankhamun's tomb Egyptian authorities have finished their quest to discover a secret chamber in the tomb of Tutankhamun - concluding that it does not exist. Previously, officials said they were ""90% sure"" of a hidden room behind the wall of the boy king's famous 3,000-year-old tomb. One theory suggested it could have been the tomb of Queen Nefertiti - who some think was Tutankhamun's mother. New research, however, has concluded the chamber simply is not there. The search for the hidden tomb began when English archaeologist Nicholas Reeves, examining detailed scans of the chamber, discovered what looked like faint traces, or ""ghosts"", of doors beneath the plaster. His 2015 paper The Burial of Nefertiti, he argued that the relatively small tomb had originally been designed for Queen Nefertiti - and her remains could possibly lie further within the tomb. Nefertiti's remains have never been discovered, but she has been the object of much speculation. A 3,000-year-old sculpture of the queen, immaculately preserved, has made her one of the most recognisable women of ancient Egypt. It is also thought she may have ruled Egypt as pharaoh herself between the death of her husband and the ascension of Tutankhamun. Nefertiti 'buried with King Tut' 'Eight accused' over King Tut's beard 'High chance' of chamber in Tut's tomb This bust of Queen Nefertiti, on display in Berlin, has added to her fame After Mr Reeves' sensational paper, a series of radar scans seemed to support his theory, leadingEgyptian authorities to declare it was ""90% sure"" that a further chamber existed. A second scan also seemed to support the theory, which would have been the most significant discovery of Egyptian antiquities in decades. However, Italian specialists from the University of Turin used new penetrating radar scans to reach their conclusion, saying they were confident in the results. ""It is maybe a little bit disappointing that there is nothing behind the walls of Tutankhamun's tomb, but I think on the other hand that this is good science,"" said Dr Francesco Porcelli, head of the research team. He said they had analysed three different sets of radar data and cross-checked the results, to eliminate ""complexity in the data"" which affected previous scan results. Egypt's Antiquities Minister, Khaled al-Anani, said the authorities in the country accepted the results. 'Eight accused' over King Tut's beard Would you visit a fake tourist attraction?

A type of stroke caused by bleeding in and around the brain. It results from the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm - a ballooning in an artery wall, causing it to thin and become weak. There are usually no warning signs, but it can sometimes happen during physical effort or straining. Symptoms include a sudden and very severe headache, being sick, seizures and loss of consciousness. It accounts for 5% of all strokes in the UK.

"Up to 1,500 junior doctors offered posts as registrars have had their job offers withdrawn, following a mistake in the recruitment process. Doctors say they have been left stressed and in limbo, and potentially out of pocket over plans to move home. The Royal College of Physicians, which oversees recruitment, apologised for the ""human error"" and is working over the weekend to restart the process. Doctors' union, the British Medical Association, said it was ""appalled"". The junior doctors were alerted to the error just before 17:00 BST on Friday, at the start of the bank holiday weekend. Fellow doctors described juniors as being in tears. Many were set to uproot their families to take up the job offers, selling homes, putting offers down on houses, moving children to new schools and partners resigning from jobs to find new ones. Rupert Simpson was delighted to be offered a job in London - ""I thought everything was perfect for us"" Rupert Simpson, 29, said he was in ""total limbo"" after the withdrawal of his job offer to work in cardiology in London. ""I'm getting married next month, and my fiancÃ©e lives and works in London - it would be very difficult for us if I don't receive another offer in London,"" he said. ""For years I've been moving from contract to contract as a junior doctor, so the idea of having a stable job for five years was amazing. ""It's hugely annoying and upsetting to have the carpet swept out from under us after someone made a spreadsheet error."" What exactly do junior doctors do? The junior doctors planning to move abroad A nationally co-ordinated system, known as ST3 Recruitment, is used for recruiting doctors across England, Scotland and Wales into a broad range of specialities. Last month, after attending interviews, up to 1,500 junior doctors entering their third year of specialist training received job offers in 24 different medical fields. Each candidate was given a score which determined how likely they were to get their choice of hospital and specialty. On Thursday, the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) discovered a significant number of candidates were credited with the wrong score, because of an error transferring data from one computer programme to another - and may therefore have received an incorrect job offer. On Friday, the RCP wrote to all those who had offers to say it was being rescinded. ""We are deeply sorry that it has been necessary to rerun the ST3 offer process due to a mistake in this round of processing,"" the letter from the RCP said. ""We have taken this approach to be fair to all candidates which can only be achieved with the real scores used."" In an updated statement,,externalthe RCP said it was working through the weekend to restart the recruitment process but it will take more than a week until the first offers start on Monday 14 May. It acknowledged the ""bad timing"" of the announcement but said ""we decided that it would be even worse to keep the information to ourselves for three days"" and wanted to be ""as transparent as early as possible"". I was offered my first choice training job in infectious diseases and microbiology, and as a result have taken out a loan to carry out work on my house, knowing I would not have to move home and having job security for five years. As well as this, I have turned down job offers for other positions. I am now in a much worse position than I was a month ago. I have also had to arrange childcare for my eight-month-old daughter in a suitable location. My wife is going back to work after maternity leave in August as well and is yet to know what hours she will be working. Needless to say stress levels in our household are very high. The timing couldn't have been worse as we were told the news on Friday afternoon before a bank holiday weekend. Speaking on behalf of the junior doctors, the BMA issued a statement saying: ""We cannot express how unacceptable we find this situation."" It said it had caused extreme anxiety for trainees and lamented ""the impact - both emotionally and financially - it is having on junior doctors across the UK"". Chairs Chaand Nagpaul and Jeeves Wijesuriya said they had spoken at length with Professor Jane Dacre, president of the Royal College of Physicians, ""to articulate the strength of feeling"". ""We have heard from trainees who have, after receiving these job offers, put down deposits on homes, arranged moves or whose families had adjusted their plans,"" they said. ""We have conveyed our expectation that college will support and compensate these trainees for any inconvenience."" The BMA said it would take legal advice regarding a possible breach of contract, and compensation. James Savage, 28, ended talks with other potential employers when he received his first choice job offer in renal medicine in the West Midlands. ""It's not well understood how much we move around as junior doctors. ""You move jobs every four months, hospitals and even locations every year. So these contracts were an offer of stability for the first time. ""Our morale is already extremely low. This isn't going to help things."" Liver doctor Ben Hudson said juniors were ""in tears"" while the RCP was ""carelessly playing with people's futures"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The RCP said the error was discovered on Thursday and the college had worked as quickly as they could to identify the nature and extent of the problem. ""We appreciate what a worrying time this is for you and will provide as much information as we can, when we can, so you know what is happening,"" the RCP stated in a letter sent out on Friday. The RCP added that those doctors who had accepted offers - and made significant plans and commitments based on those offers - would be treated on a case-by-case basis. ""We set the highest standards for our work and expect to be held to them.  We have not met them here and are truly sorry,"" it said. ""We will learn from our mistake and make any changes necessary to fix it."" The Department of Health said it was monitoring the matter closely and was satisfied there would be no impact on patient safety as the jobs were not due to begin until August.

"Relatives of the 16-year-old mourn in the village of Raja Kendua Indian police say they have arrested the main suspect in an alleged gang-rape and murder of a teenage girl. Dhanu Bhuiyan and his accomplices are accused of burning the 16-year-old alive on Friday in the state of Jharkhand. She was killed after her parents complained to village elders that she had been raped, according to police. The elders had told two accused rapists to do 100 sit-ups and pay a 50,000 rupee (Â£550; $750) fine as punishment. The men were allegedly so enraged by the penalty that they beat the girl's parents then set her on fire. ""The two accused thrashed the parents and rushed to the house where they set the girl ablaze with the help of their accomplices,"" Ashok Ram, the officer in charge of the local police station, told the AFP news agency. Police say they have arrested 15 of the 18 people they want to investigate in connection with the incidents. They say Mr Bhuiyan was arrested at a relative's house where he was hiding. The suspect has not commented on the accusations. Why India's rape crisis shows no signs of abating How do Indian parents talk to their children about rape? The girl was believed to have been abducted from her home while her parents were attending a wedding. She was then allegedly raped by two men in a forested area near the village of Raja Kendua. Upon discovering the assault, the 16-year-old's parents went to village elders to pursue charges against the suspected perpetrators. The victim and the accused appeared to have known each other, police inspector-general Shambu Thakur told AFP. A series of sexual assaults have triggered outrage across India Councils of village elders carry no legal weight. However, they have significant influence in many parts of rural India and are a way of settling disputes without having to go through India's expensive judicial system. However, several village elders have been charged with passing unlawful orders and tampering with evidence. The latest incident comes as India reels from a string of violent sexual crimes. About 40,000 rape cases were reported in India in 2016. Many cases, however, are believed to go unreported because of the stigma that is attached to rape and sexual assault.

"President Rouhani (right) says Iran is ready to ""confront"" any decision made by President Trump Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has warned that the US will face ""historic regret"" if Donald Trump scraps the nuclear agreement with Tehran. Mr Rouhani's comments come as the US president decides whether to pull out of the deal by a 12 May deadline. Mr Trump has strongly criticised the agreement, calling it ""insane"". The 2015 deal - between Iran, the US, China, Russia, Germany, France and the UK - lifted sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear programme. France, the UK and Germany have been trying persuade the US president that the current deal is the best way to stop Iran developing nuclear weapons. What is the Iran nuclear deal? Is Iran's economy better off since the nuclear deal? Could the deal collapse? British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is travelling to Washington on Sunday to discuss the matter with White House officials. This video can not be played Rouhani: The US would regret leaving nuclear deal 'like never before in history' The UN also warned Mr Trump not to walk away from the deal. However, he has threatened that the US will ""withdraw"" from the deal on 12 May - the end of a 120-day review period - unless Congress and European powers fixed its ""disastrous flaws"". In remarks carried live on Iranian state television on Sunday, President Rouhani said: ""If America leaves the nuclear deal, this will entail historic regret for it."" He warned Iran had ""a plan to counter any decision Trump may take and we will confront it"". Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and says it considers the deal non-renegotiable. This video can not be played What is the Iran nuclear deal? Last week, Israel revealed ""secret nuclear files"" which it said showed Iran had run a clandestine nuclear weapons programme before 2003, and had secretly retained the technological know-how, in breach of the agreement. Iran branded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a liar and said the documents he produced were a rehash of old allegations already dealt with by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN's nuclear watchdog. But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the documents were authentic and showed the 2015 Iran nuclear deal was ""built on lies"". Mr Trump is already unhappy that the current deal only limits Iran's nuclear activities for a fixed period and does not stop the development of ballistic missiles. He also said it had handed Iran a $100bn (Â£72bn) windfall that it used ""as a slush fund for weapons, terror, and oppression"" across the Middle East. Economic assets frozen by sanctions were returned to Iran under the terms of the deal. Iran has consistently denied US claims that it sponsors militant groups. This video can not be played A timeline of what Trump's said about the Iran deal During two days of talks in Washington,Mr Johnson will meet US Vice-President Mike Pence, National Security Adviser John Bolton and foreign policy leaders in Congress. Earlier this month, he said it was important to keep the deal ""while building on it in order to take account of the legitimate concerns of the US"". On Sunday, Mr Netanyahu again spoke out against Iran, saying it was better to confront Tehran sooner rather than later. Addressing a cabinet meeting, he accused Iran of supplying advanced weapons to the Syrian government that posed a danger to Israel. He added: ""We are determined to block Iran's aggression against us even if this means a struggle. Better now than later.""

"Most Facebook users in the US remain loyal, despite the recent data sharing scandal involving a political consultancy firm, a poll suggests. Facebook admitted last month thatthe data of 87 million users had been improperly sharedwith the UK-based firm, Cambridge Analytica. The Reuters/Ipsos survey found no clear loss or gain in use since then. A quarter of Facebook users said they used it less or had left it but another quarter said they used it even more. The remaining half said their use of the network had not changed. However, the survey was limited to the US and analysts are waiting to see how the social media giant's sales perform in the second quarter, when the scandal was at its height. In the first quarter, its sales rose by nearly 50%,with profits reaching $4.9bn (Â£3.6bn) compared to $3bn last year. Tech Tent: Do we now trust Facebook? Zuckerberg: I am responsible and I am sorry Reality Check: Is Facebook data worth nothing? Conducted online,the Reuters/Ipsos survey questioned 2,194 American adults,externalbetween 26 and 30 April. The poll has a margin of error of three percentage points. Some 64% percent said they used Facebook at least once a day, down slightly from the 68% recorded in a similar poll in late March, soon after the Cambridge Analytica story broke. Asked if they were aware of their current privacy settings, 74% of Facebook users said they were, and 78% said they knew how to change them. Among Twitter users, this was 55% and 58%, while for Instagram users, it was 60% and 65%. Cambridge Analytica: The story so far The global reach of Cambridge Analytica Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, told Reuters that Facebook had been lucky the data was apparently used only for political adverts and not anything more sinister. ""I have yet to read an article that says a single person has been harmed by the breach,"" he said. There was no immediate comment from Facebook, which apologised for the data scandal and acted to rein in third-party apps using its data. Accused of using Facebook users' personal data to sway the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election and the UK Brexit referendum,Cambridge Analytica announced this week it was closing down Facebook said its own investigation into the company's use of its data would continue.

"Jamie Acourt, pictured in police custody in Spain, was last seen in the UK in February 2016 UK fugitive Jamie Acourt will not challenge his extradition from Spain after being arrested over alleged drug offences, the Spanish High Court has said. Mr Acourt, who was one of Britain's most wanted fugitives, was arrested in Barcelona on Friday. He was sought by police investigating the large-scale supply of drugs. On Sunday, it was confirmed the 41-year-old from south London had accepted his extradition at a hearing in Madrid. Appearing via video-link from Barcelona in front of a High Court judge, Mr Acourt was denied bail. Armed officers arrested Mr Acourt after he left the Metropolitan Sagrada Familia Gym in the Spanish city on Friday afternoon. It is thought Mr Acourt's extradition to the UK will happen relatively quickly He was detained under a European Arrest Warrant as part of operation Captura, a joint effort by the National Crime Agency (NCA), Metropolitan Police and Spanish National Police. He was last seen in the UK on 1 February 2016, in the Eltham area and was known to visit south-west London and areas of Surrey. Mr Acourt was a former suspect in Stephen Lawrence's murder in 1993 but has always denied any involvement in the killing.

Mr Iqbal had just attended a rally in the Punjab city when he was hit at least once in the arm. He was taken to hospital and his life is not in danger. The attacker was arrested and is being questioned, officials said. The motive for the shooting is not yet clear. Pakistan is due to hold a general election on 15 July. Mr Iqbal is a senior member of the governing Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz). Pakistan country profile Ahsan Iqbal was airlifted to a hospital in Lahore A senior government source told Reuters news agency that early information suggested Mr Iqbal had been returning from a meeting with a Christian group. ""We are not sure whether it has got anything to do with the motive,"" the source said. ""We will know only after investigation of the attacker."" Mr Iqbal was shot in the right arm, Punjab government spokesman Malik Ahmed Khan told AFP news agency. Ahsan Iqbal (seen here last year) has reassured supporters from his hospital bed ""The attacker was about to fire a second shot when police and people in the meeting overpowered him,"" he said.

He is said to be affiliated to the hardline Islamist Tehreek-i-Labaik Ya Rasool Allah party, Reuters news agency reported citing a police report. The new ultra-religious party has been fiercely opposed to any weakening of Pakistan's controversial blasphemy laws. In a statement, party leader Khadim Hussain Rizvi condemned the attack on Mr Iqbal and said supporters were not authorised to take up arms, Reuters added. Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi ""strongly condemned"" the attack and called for an immediate report into the incident by Punjab's chief of police. Opposition leader Syed Khursheed Shah said the incident ""raised a major question mark on the security situation in the country"" and said tighter security was needed for the upcoming elections. The US ambassador to Pakistan, David Hale, said the US condemned the attack and wished Mr Iqbal a speedy recovery.

"North Korea has made relatively little criticism of the US in recent weeks North Korea has warned the US about using ""pressure and military threats"" against it as the two countries prepare for a historic summit. A Foreign Ministry official said the US was deliberately provoking the North by suggesting sanctions will not be lifted until it gives up nuclear weapons. US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un are due to meet in the next few weeks. It will be the first ever meeting between the two countries' leaders. North and South Korean leaders agreed last month to denuclearise the region, at a border summit which came after months of warlike rhetoric from the North and Mr Trump. Mr Kim became the first North Korean leader to set foot in South Korea since the end of Korean hostilities in 1953. N Korea nuclear test site 'to shut in May' Historic summit as it happened Five key moments from the meeting Read the Korean declaration in full,external North Korea regularly criticises the US - but there have been few attacks in recent weeks, amid plans for the summit. This latest statement is a reminder that discussions between the two countries will not be easy, says BBC Asia editor Michael Bristow. The North Korean official, quoted by state news agency KCNA, said that Washington was ""misleading public opinion"" by saying the denuclearisation pledge resulted from sanctions and other pressure. The US was also aggravating the current good atmosphere by deploying military assets on the Korean peninsula, they added. Will historic talks lead to lasting peace? Five conflicts that continued after they ended Profile: Kim Jong-un North Korea crisis in 300 words ""The US is deliberately provoking [North Korea] at the time when the situation on the Korean peninsula is moving toward peace and reconciliation thanks to the historic north-south summit and the Panmunjom Declaration,"" the statement said. Donald Trump says he will maintain a tough stance on North Korea ""This act cannot be construed otherwise than a dangerous attempt to ruin the hard-won atmosphere of dialogue and bring the situation back to square one. ""It would not be conducive to addressing the issue if the US miscalculates the peace-loving intention of [North Korea] as a sign of 'weakness' and continues to pursue its pressure and military threats against the latter."" Mr Trump has said he will maintain sanctions and other pressure on the North and suggested that his tough stance has helped facilitate reconciliation. On 27 April Mr Kim met South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the border village of Panmunjon. They said they would pursue talks with the US and China to formally end the Korean War, which ended in 1953 with a truce, not total peace, and made a commitment to the aim of ""a nuclear-free Korean peninsula"". Mr Trump says a date and venue for the talks have been decided, but has not revealed them. N Korea nuclear test site 'to shut in May' Will historic Koreas summit lead to peace?

"Listen to Chelsea v Liverpool online & 5 live Wenger's last home game with Arsenal against Burnley Man City receive Premier League title after 0-0 draw with Huddersfield Mike Henson Adieu to yeh and yeh and yeh and yeh. So long and farewell from Arsene Wenger and likewise from us. This live text is done, but there is only one day off before the Premier League is back. Tuesday night, Swansea v Southampton, an absolute tightrope walk of a six-pointer for both teams. See you there. FT: Chelsea 1-0 Liverpool Liverpool Liverpool full-back Andy Robertson:""The weather was warm for both teams which can play a part, but we did quite well in the game and its a scrappy goal for us to concede. ""At the end of the day I think we dominated the game but just couldn't create enough chances to score."" On Chelsea:""They made sure our front three couldn't have space and that showed, we couldn't get in the game and create the chances we normally create."" On being tired from midweek:""Of course Wednesday was tough but that's no excuse, the boys felt physically good to go. ""We've had four days to recover for this one, but now we've got a full week to prepare for Brighton and try to make sure we get a place in the top four because everything in this season has been leading up to that."" FT: Arsenal 5-0 Burnley Arsenal Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, speaking to BBC Match of the Day:""It is impossible to feel nothing unless you are completely robotic. It is 22 years of total commitment and togetherness. Overall I would like to thank everybody. I had the luxury of doing this job for 22 years at the same club and I am grateful for that. ""It is difficult to analyse this season for what this team has done. At home is has been championship stuff, but away from home it has not been enough. We also went to the League Cup final and Europa League semi-final. On next season:""The fans may be lost at the start, but they will have a new manager but they can continue the work as the basics are here."" According to reports in the French press, Liverpool have completed a Â£63m deal to sign Lyon's 24-year-old attackNabil Fekir.And apparently they are also interested in Barcelona's winger Ousmane Dembele. Jurgen Klopp has just been asked about the reports. ""During the game we agreed a deal? I would be surprised about that, he said. ""Who was the second name? Ousmane Dembele. He's on the market? Now I'm interested."" For what it is worth Lyon owner Jean-Michel Aulas has denied that Fekir is on his way. Make of all that what you will. FT: Arsenal 5-0 Burnley Burnley Burnley manager Sean Dyche, speaking to BBC Match of the Day:""I think Arsenal raised their performance considerably. After the results yesterday we suddenly had nothing to play for and that affects players, they need something on the game. ""Today Arsenal really turned up. ""It will be a different feel at home next weekend - our fans were great today and they know how good a season it has been. ""Arsene Wenger means a lot to the game, the only thing he'll be asking is if they could have done that more often. It's still quite fresh but in 10 years they'll probably be looking back ad thinking 'what an era'."" FT: Chelsea 1-0 Liverpool Chelsea Chelsea manager Antonio Conte:""Today was a must-win game against a really good team, but it was a good game and a great show of will to keep our hope of finishing in the top four alive. ""I'm very happy for the players and the fans, they deserve this type of game and this win."" On Liverpool:""Liverpool is a team who are very dangerous and if you leave a lot of space behind the defensive line their players are impressive the way they attack the space, but also playing through the lines and in their combinations. They are a very good team so it's right to give them compliments."" On Olivier Giroud:""He brought a personality, he's an international player with a lot of experience and we needed this kind of player. ""Today he played a very good game and worked very hard without the ball, but I am pleased for the whole performance of the whole team."" On finishing in the top four:""As I said previously our target is to finish the season in the best possible way and to give the best satisfaction to all the fans. I think in spite of the difficult season we are still alive and are fighting until the end. ""In this league it's very tough and in the past, in the present and in the future, and it could be even more difficult in the future. You start the season with the six top teams and anything can happen. We have to prepare in the right way and try to make as few mistakes as possible."" #bbcfootball or text on 81111 Ibsy86:Shame considering all the abuse he got. Well done Arsene for sticking in there. Tabyeesh:""I will always be an Arsenal fan. It is what unites us in every cell of our body, those dreams and worriesâ. Arsene Wenger. 06-May-2018.
Amen. Cold Bean:Manager and longevity.

That's last time you'll hear those words in the premiership. Arsenal Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger speaks to Sky Sports about the health of Sir Alex Ferguson:""I'm concerned because last week we were together. I just have a message of support and I trust his strength and his optimistic character to get over that
very quickly and very well especially."" #bbcfootball or text on 81111 Elliott Gilmore:Arsene Wenger is simply world class. As a person, a manager and more importantly a Man! Arsenal should be forever grateful. Jacob:Fair play to Burnley letting Arsenal play for Wenger today, you could have spoilt the party but took the shots like absolute legends you are. You deserve your place in Europe. Mesut Ozil, by the way, is at the Emirates today. The German international, who was unfit to play today, is on the pitch sporting a white cap with an enormous peak. FT: Chelsea 1-0 Liverpool Chelsea Chelsea manager Antonio Conte speaking to MOTD:""For sure it's a big win, today this game was a must-win game for us and the only possibility to keep the top four open was to win and get the three points. ""We did this and we played a good game, we had great commitment from the players to follow the plan and great effort from the strikers. ""Now we have to recover well and play an important game on Wednesday against Huddersfield. We must be ready to get three points because it won't be easy."" On nullifying Liverpool's threat:""To have one week to work and focus on this game was very important for us, we have had the possibility to prepare this game in the right way. ""Usually we prepare every game in the tactical aspect, but things can change, but today we played a good game and I'm very happy for our fans because they deserve this win."" On Olivier Giroud:""We are talking about a intentional player, with great experience and with great personality. It's important for us to have a player like this with great experience because we are a young team without too much experience. #bbcfootball or 81111 on text Khan Karn:Arsenal fans are terrible. If they had supported the team like today they would be in a much better position. Disgrace to their greatest ever. Daniel Potter:Got to ask where have all the fans singing ""one Arsene Wenger"" because for the last three years all I've pretty much heard is ""get out of our club!"" Two faced Arsenal fans.  You've got what you wanted. I hope you struggle for years to come. Andrew Priestley:Even after the way he has been treated by large sections of the fan base, Arsene Wenger remains a classy, honourable man to the very end of his time at Arsenal Football Club. A gentleman of football. A young fan, sat on his dad's shoulders, has a sign asking if he can have Arsene Wenger's tie as a momento. He can! Wenger strides over the hoarding to hand over the neckwear. I don't want to see that on an online auction site later this evening young man. FT: Chelsea 1-0 Liverpool Liverpool Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:""I hate the result but the performance was good enough to get a good point. It's clear against Chelsea you have to avoid crosses, but the cross came in and it's difficult against Giroud, and that's the goal. ""Chelsea were strong but we did well and had a few good moments. But we weren't clinical enough. The performance was okay but the result was exactly the opposite of what we wanted."" On Chelsea:""They had quality and a defensive plan, they played with eight men around the ball, and two very good attacking players. The longer the game goes on, it gets more difficult, we didn't have space to cross. ""We had these moments towards the end, and these high balls into the box where we were a little bit unlucky. But you cannot go to Chelsea and be shocked when you lose against them. On possibly being tired from midweek:""We don't have a big squad and we had injury problems, so when the boys that come back don't have rhythm We have 11 or 12 players that have been playing constantly, so, now we have one full week [before the next game] and that helps massively."" On Salah:""It's completely normal for attacking players to be like this, normally he can deal with he very physical teams, but today he didn't do so well."" On having 'two cup finals left to play':""The obvious one (the Champions League final) is so far away we don't think about it and [Brighton] is a very important game for us, but we've had a few of them in the past and they haven't been too bad."" By the way, the camera briefly flicked to the club's majority shareholder Stan Kroenke in the stands during Arsene Wenger's speech to the crowd. The American's face appeared on the jumbotron screens and was immediately greeted with jeers. Somewhere a director orders a quick change of shot, but the minor diplomatic incident has already occured. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger speaking to the Emirates Stadium:""Thank you for having me for such a long time but above all, I'm like you - I'm an Arsenal fan.""  Arsene Wenger:""I would like to thank everyone at the club who makes this club so special. ""This group of players has special quality, not only on the pitch, but off it too. Support them next season, because they deserve it. ""I will miss you. Thank you for being such an important part of my life. I hope to see you soon."" Arsene Wenger starts making an address to the crowd, no notes, speaking about what the club means to him. ""I will always be an Arsenal fan. It is what unites us in every cell of our body, those dreams and worries,"" he says. Legendary goalkeeper Bob Wilson is on the pitch and saying what Arsene Wenger means to him. ""Above all Arsene is a man who cares deeply about people and helping them be the best they can be. He is the greatest manager we have ever had,"" he says. ""Please give Arsene Wenger the biggest welcome you have."" The Frenchman will be presented with the special trophy that the club was awarded in recognition of his Invincibles seasons of 2003-04 to keep as a personal momento of his time at the club. #bbcfootball or text on 81111 Briyan:I think Chelsea are delaying their Europa league spot just like West Brom are delaying their relegation.

Pete Lymer said he referred to ""big breasted birds"" and others in risquÃ© slogans outside J W Ash & Son in Leek, Staffordshire. The 43-year-old said he used the adverts for the last decade without an issue, but officers have now warned him to tone down the content. He branded the situation ""political correctness gone mad"".

"Ms Daniels called for Mr Trump to resign in the sketch US porn star Stormy Daniels has made a surprise appearance on US TV show Saturday Night Live as her legal wrangle with President Trump over an alleged affair continues. Playing herself in the latest in the show's series of sketches lampooning the president, she mocked him, saying: ""I know you don't believe in climate change but a storm's a coming baby."" Ms Daniels was paid $130,000 by Mr Trump's lawyer in 2016 to keep quiet. Mr Trump denies the affair. However he has said he reimbursed his lawyer Michael Cohen for the $130,000 payment, which he says was designed to stop Ms Daniels from making ""false and extortionist"" statements. The big question at heart of Stormy Daniels scandal The conflicting statements in the Stormy Daniels saga The president and the porn star: Why this matters The Saturday Night Live sketch featured actors Alec Baldwin as Mr Trump and Ben Stiller as Mr Cohen. In it, Baldwin playing Mr Trump instructs his lawyer to ""call up Stormy Daniels and fix this once and for all"" and keep him on the line to listen in. Ms Daniels herself answers the phone to loud whoops from the audience. Stiller calls Ms Daniels and asks if she's alone, with Baldwin as Mr Trump then interrupting with: ""And what are you wearing?"" Baldwin as Mr Trump then takes over the call and tells Ms Daniels everyone knows the alleged affair is ""just an act"". ""I work in adult films, we're not really known for our acting,"" Ms Daniels replies. ""What do you need for this all to just go away,"" asks Baldwin, to which Ms Daniels says: ""A resignation."" ""I solved North and South Korea, why can't I solve us?"" asks Baldwin. Ms Daniels says: ""Sorry Donald, it's too late for that. I know you don't believe in climate change but a storm's a coming baby."" Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Earlier in the sketch, Stiller as Mr Cohen refers to contradictions in statements last week by Mr Trump and his new lawyer Rudy Giuliani about the legal case involving Ms Daniels.

Trump's health: Three big ethics questions Did comedian's Sarah Sanders 'roast' go too far? Kanye West defends Trump in new song Mr Trump on Friday said his new lawyer had made a mistakebecause he was new to the job and would ""get his facts straight"" before adding that he was ""not changing any stories"" with regard to Ms Daniels. Mr Giuliani later released a statement intended to ""clarify"" his remarks. The Saturday Night Live sketch also featured actors Scarlett Johansson as Ivanka Trump and Jimmy Fallon as Jared Kushner.

So long and farewell from Arsene Wenger and likewise from us. This live text is done, but there is only one day off before the Premier League is back. Tuesday night, Swansea v Southampton, an absolute tightrope walk of a six-pointer for both teams. See you there. FT: Chelsea 1-0 Liverpool Liverpool Liverpool full-back Andy Robertson:""The weather was warm for both teams which can play a part, but we did quite well in the game and its a scrappy goal for us to concede. ""At the end of the day I think we dominated the game but just couldn't create enough chances to score."" On Chelsea:""They made sure our front three couldn't have space and that showed, we couldn't get in the game and create the chances we normally create."" On being tired from midweek:""Of course Wednesday was tough but that's no excuse, the boys felt physically good to go. ""We've had four days to recover for this one, but now we've got a full week to prepare for Brighton and try to make sure we get a place in the top four because everything in this season has been leading up to that."" FT: Arsenal 5-0 Burnley Arsenal Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, speaking to BBC Match of the Day:""It is impossible to feel nothing unless you are completely robotic. It is 22 years of total commitment and togetherness. Overall I would like to thank everybody. I had the luxury of doing this job for 22 years at the same club and I am grateful for that. ""It is difficult to analyse this season for what this team has done. At home is has been championship stuff, but away from home it has not been enough. We also went to the League Cup final and Europa League semi-final. On next season:""The fans may be lost at the start, but they will have a new manager but they can continue the work as the basics are here."" According to reports in the French press, Liverpool have completed a Â£63m deal to sign Lyon's 24-year-old attackNabil Fekir.And apparently they are also interested in Barcelona's winger Ousmane Dembele. Jurgen Klopp has just been asked about the reports. ""During the game we agreed a deal? I would be surprised about that, he said. ""Who was the second name? Ousmane Dembele. He's on the market? Now I'm interested."" For what it is worth Lyon owner Jean-Michel Aulas has denied that Fekir is on his way. Make of all that what you will. FT: Arsenal 5-0 Burnley Burnley Burnley manager Sean Dyche, speaking to BBC Match of the Day:""I think Arsenal raised their performance considerably. After the results yesterday we suddenly had nothing to play for and that affects players, they need something on the game. ""Today Arsenal really turned up. ""It will be a different feel at home next weekend - our fans were great today and they know how good a season it has been. ""Arsene Wenger means a lot to the game, the only thing he'll be asking is if they could have done that more often. It's still quite fresh but in 10 years they'll probably be looking back ad thinking 'what an era'."" FT: Chelsea 1-0 Liverpool Chelsea Chelsea manager Antonio Conte:""Today was a must-win game against a really good team, but it was a good game and a great show of will to keep our hope of finishing in the top four alive. ""I'm very happy for the players and the fans, they deserve this type of game and this win."" On Liverpool:""Liverpool is a team who are very dangerous and if you leave a lot of space behind the defensive line their players are impressive the way they attack the space, but also playing through the lines and in their combinations. They are a very good team so it's right to give them compliments."" On Olivier Giroud:""He brought a personality, he's an international player with a lot of experience and we needed this kind of player. ""Today he played a very good game and worked very hard without the ball, but I am pleased for the whole performance of the whole team."" On finishing in the top four:""As I said previously our target is to finish the season in the best possible way and to give the best satisfaction to all the fans. I think in spite of the difficult season we are still alive and are fighting until the end. ""In this league it's very tough and in the past, in the present and in the future, and it could be even more difficult in the future. You start the season with the six top teams and anything can happen. We have to prepare in the right way and try to make as few mistakes as possible."" #bbcfootball or text on 81111 Ibsy86:Shame considering all the abuse he got. Well done Arsene for sticking in there.

Arsenal should be forever grateful. Jacob:Fair play to Burnley letting Arsenal play for Wenger today, you could have spoilt the party but took the shots like absolute legends you are. You deserve your place in Europe. Mesut Ozil, by the way, is at the Emirates today. The German international, who was unfit to play today, is on the pitch sporting a white cap with an enormous peak. FT: Chelsea 1-0 Liverpool Chelsea Chelsea manager Antonio Conte speaking to MOTD:""For sure it's a big win, today this game was a must-win game for us and the only possibility to keep the top four open was to win and get the three points. ""We did this and we played a good game, we had great commitment from the players to follow the plan and great effort from the strikers. ""Now we have to recover well and play an important game on Wednesday against Huddersfield. We must be ready to get three points because it won't be easy."" On nullifying Liverpool's threat:""To have one week to work and focus on this game was very important for us, we have had the possibility to prepare this game in the right way. ""Usually we prepare every game in the tactical aspect, but things can change, but today we played a good game and I'm very happy for our fans because they deserve this win."" On Olivier Giroud:""We are talking about a intentional player, with great experience and with great personality. It's important for us to have a player like this with great experience because we are a young team without too much experience. #bbcfootball or 81111 on text Khan Karn:Arsenal fans are terrible.

You've got what you wanted. I hope you struggle for years to come. Andrew Priestley:Even after the way he has been treated by large sections of the fan base, Arsene Wenger remains a classy, honourable man to the very end of his time at Arsenal Football Club. A gentleman of football. A young fan, sat on his dad's shoulders, has a sign asking if he can have Arsene Wenger's tie as a momento. He can! Wenger strides over the hoarding to hand over the neckwear. I don't want to see that on an online auction site later this evening young man. FT: Chelsea 1-0 Liverpool Liverpool Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:""I hate the result but the performance was good enough to get a good point. It's clear against Chelsea you have to avoid crosses, but the cross came in and it's difficult against Giroud, and that's the goal. ""Chelsea were strong but we did well and had a few good moments. But we weren't clinical enough. The performance was okay but the result was exactly the opposite of what we wanted."" On Chelsea:""They had quality and a defensive plan, they played with eight men around the ball, and two very good attacking players. The longer the game goes on, it gets more difficult, we didn't have space to cross. ""We had these moments towards the end, and these high balls into the box where we were a little bit unlucky. But you cannot go to Chelsea and be shocked when you lose against them. On possibly being tired from midweek:""We don't have a big squad and we had injury problems, so when the boys that come back don't have rhythm We have 11 or 12 players that have been playing constantly, so, now we have one full week [before the next game] and that helps massively."" On Salah:""It's completely normal for attacking players to be like this, normally he can deal with he very physical teams, but today he didn't do so well."" On having 'two cup finals left to play':""The obvious one (the Champions League final) is so far away we don't think about it and [Brighton] is a very important game for us, but we've had a few of them in the past and they haven't been too bad."" By the way, the camera briefly flicked to the club's majority shareholder Stan Kroenke in the stands during Arsene Wenger's speech to the crowd.

The MP for Lichfield tweeted that Ms Darcy had not said she was his constituent and he thought of the word as a synonym for ""twit"". Michael Fabricant responded to people who criticised him for his tweet to Darcy The exchange began with a tweet on Friday afternoon in which the Conservative MP said Labour was failing to meet expectations in the local elections and it had been a disappointing day for the party. Ms Darcy replied: ""Not as disappointing as Burntwood since you neglected it."" Minutes later, Mr Fabricant, 67, responded with the insult, saying she ""seems unaware that there is no vote this year in Burntwood! ""And I neglect no part of my lovely constituency. That's why I'm loved!"" Later, in a statement on Twitter, Mr Fabricant said Ms Darcy's profile did not indicate her age or location. He added that ""for all I know, she is a Russian troll in St Petersburg"" but he would be ""happy to meet and talk about politics"" if she contacted him ""the proper way through my Parliamentary website or letter"". Ms Darcy, a media student who lives in Burntwood, said she felt Mr Fabricant had tried to ""publicly humiliate"" her. ""It isn't the way I would expect any professional to behave,"" she said. ""My mum is a teacher and my dad works for the NHS and if they had spoken to clients or students that way, they would be sacked,"" she added. ""I don't want him to be sacked. I just want an apology, just to say 'I am sorry I shouldn't have said that'."" Michael Fabricant has been an MP since 1992 ""I feel like he used [the word] in a way to try and shut people down. But I feel I want to stand up for myself and other young women,"" she said. ""I never attacked him personally.""

"North Korea has made relatively little criticism of the US in recent weeks North Korea has warned the US about using ""pressure and military threats"" against it as the two countries prepare for a historic summit. A Foreign Ministry official said the US was deliberately provoking the North by suggesting sanctions will not be lifted until it gives up nuclear weapons. US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un are due to meet in the next few weeks. It will be the first ever meeting between the two countries' leaders. North and South Korean leaders agreed last month to denuclearise the region, at a border summit which came after months of warlike rhetoric from the North and Mr Trump. Mr Kim became the first North Korean leader to set foot in South Korea since the end of Korean hostilities in 1953. N Korea nuclear test site 'to shut in May' Historic summit as it happened Five key moments from the meeting Read the Korean declaration in full,external North Korea regularly criticises the US - but there have been few attacks in recent weeks, amid plans for the summit. This latest statement is a reminder that discussions between the two countries will not be easy, says BBC Asia editor Michael Bristow. The North Korean official, quoted by state news agency KCNA, said that Washington was ""misleading public opinion"" by saying the denuclearisation pledge resulted from sanctions and other pressure. The US was also aggravating the current good atmosphere by deploying military assets on the Korean peninsula, they added. Will historic talks lead to lasting peace? Five conflicts that continued after they ended Profile: Kim Jong-un North Korea crisis in 300 words ""The US is deliberately provoking [North Korea] at the time when the situation on the Korean peninsula is moving toward peace and reconciliation thanks to the historic north-south summit and the Panmunjom Declaration,"" the statement said. Donald Trump says he will maintain a tough stance on North Korea ""This act cannot be construed otherwise than a dangerous attempt to ruin the hard-won atmosphere of dialogue and bring the situation back to square one. ""It would not be conducive to addressing the issue if the US miscalculates the peace-loving intention of [North Korea] as a sign of 'weakness' and continues to pursue its pressure and military threats against the latter."" Mr Trump has said he will maintain sanctions and other pressure on the North and suggested that his tough stance has helped facilitate reconciliation. On 27 April Mr Kim met South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the border village of Panmunjon. They said they would pursue talks with the US and China to formally end the Korean War, which ended in 1953 with a truce, not total peace, and made a commitment to the aim of ""a nuclear-free Korean peninsula"". Mr Trump says a date and venue for the talks have been decided, but has not revealed them. N Korea nuclear test site 'to shut in May' Will historic Koreas summit lead to peace?

"The government has talked publicly about two potential options for its customs relationship with the European Union after Brexit. Here's a look at them in more detail: This would involve the UK acting on the EU's behalf when imports arrive from the rest of the world. What it means in practice is that the UK would apply theEU's own tariffs and rules of originto all goods arriving in the UK that are intended for the EU. So when goods - bits of machinery or computers or consignments of food - arrive at UK ports en route to the EU after Brexit, UK customs officials would collect the money due and hand it on to Brussels. A customs paper published by the government last year suggested that new IT systems could be used to track whether items eventually ended up in the UK or crossed into the EU, and tariffs would be charged accordingly. An alternative suggestion was that all companies would have to pay whichever tariff rate (EU or UK) was higher, and then claim a potential refund once goods reached their final destination. The UK paper doesn't say anything about whether the EU would have to put the same system in place for goods heading from the EU to the UK. But the assumption is that it would, which would mean a lot of additional work in big ports such as Rotterdam. So could it work? No-one really knows, but it would take a long time to set up any new system of this kind. The government acknowledges that the proposal is both unprecedented and untested. It doesn't happen anywhere else in the world. One initial response from Brussels described the proposal as ""magical thinking"". And there is still a huge amount of scepticism. A lot would have to be taken on trust. Supporters of the idea in the UK say it would remove the need for customs processes at the UK-EU border, but would still allow the UK to negotiate its own trade deals around the world. Critics - including many leading backers of Brexit - say it is unworkable, and would not amount to a clean break with the EU. They fear it would mean the UK staying in the customs union by default. The second proposal - also known as maximum facilitation or max-fac - aims to create as frictionless a customs border as possible, rather than to remove it altogether. It would employ new technologies (including some that are still being developed) and automation to streamline procedures and remove the need for physical customs checks wherever possible. According to the government's customs paper, it would build on existing schemes such as authorised economic operators or trusted traders, and introduce unilateral improvements to the UK's customs regime to make trade with the EU and the rest of the world easier. The paper acknowledges, though, that the EU would be required to implement equivalent arrangements at its borders to make any such scheme a success. The EU says it is happy to discuss anything that would facilitate trade, but (again), it could take years to introduce some of the technology needed. So the timescale of Brexit is an issue. In her speech at the Mansion House in March, the prime minister also said there would have to be specific provisions for Northern Ireland, including no new restrictions on small traders who carry out the majority of transactions across the Irish border. The European Commission is cautious about that, and worried about opportunities for smuggling. Critics also argue that a streamlined arrangement is not the same as having no customs border at all, and that this proposal would not meet the challenge of maintaining an invisible border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. But supporters of Brexit tend to prefer this option overall, because they see it as a cleaner break with the European Union. It's also worth remembering that there is one other large fly in the ointment here - the whole border debate isn't just about customs and tariffs. It's also about the rules and regulations which apply to products that move around the EU single market. So, even the most innovative customs system in the world doesn't get rid of the need for border checks entirely.

"Arlene Foster was interviewed on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show DUP leader Arlene Foster has said she she would like the European Union to take a more sensible approach to the Brexit negotiations. Mrs Foster said she would like to see less rhetoric and more engagement from the EU on the way forward. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, was in Northern Ireland earlier this week. Mrs Foster said she regretted the tone of what he had to say. Q & A: Brexit and the Irish border Barnier denies Foster's claims of 'aggression' ""What he [Mr Barnier] was saying was that it was up to the UK to come up with a solution and they would wait for that solution to come and that is not the way forward,"" Mrs Foster told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. ""The way forward is to have a negotiation where both sides are engaged in the negotiation and we look for a solution that will make the difference."" Mrs Foster said the DUP did not believe that the UK needed to stay in the customs union to have ""free flow between ourselves and the Republic of Ireland"". ""In August of last year, the government put forward various proposals,"" she said. ""We were disappointed there was not the engagement from the European Union at that time. ""What we would like to see from the European Union is less rhetoric and actually more engagement in relation to the pragmatic way forward."" On his visit to Northern Ireland, Mr Barnier said that the EU would consider ""any solution"" on Brexit which would allow it to maintain the integrity of the Belfast Agreement. He said that it was important to maintain relationships in Northern Ireland. He previously told a press conference on 30 April at the beginning of the all-island Brexit forum that his ""door is open"" to Arlene Foster and the DUP. He said he had not approached the negotiations in a ""spirit of revenge"". The UK and EU have agreed there should be no hardening of the Irish border The UK government has said it is leaving the customs union but ministers have not yet agreed what will come next. Prime Minister Theresa May asked officials to draw up ""revised proposals"" after last week's meeting of her key Brexit committee. Mrs Foster said she had a telephone conversation with Mrs May on Saturday about customs solutions. All EU members are part of the customs union, within which there are no internal tariffs (taxes) on goods transported between them. There is also a common tariff agreed on goods entering from outside. The UK government has said it is leaving the EU customs union so that it can strike its own trade deals around the world, something it cannot do as a member. This means the UK and the EU will have to agree a new arrangement for what happens at their border post-Brexit. The UK is under pressure to make progress on the issue before next month's EU summit.

"This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? A new ""customs partnership"" with the EU - which is fiercely opposed by some Tory Brexiteers - is still on the table, the business secretary says. Greg Clark warned about the effect of border checks on manufacturing jobs, saying whatever replaces the customs union was of ""huge importance"". He added whichever option was chosen would ""take some time"" to put in place. Eurosceptic backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg criticised ""Project Fear"" warnings about job losses after Brexit. He said if the partnership model was adopted, ""we would not in effect be leaving the European Union"". But Mr Clark was supported by former home secretary Amber Rudd, while Remain-supporting Tories criticised pro-Brexit ""ideologues"", saying they did not represent the party at large. Reality Check: The government's customs options Why is the customs union so important? May requests 'revised' customs proposals All EU members are part of the customs union, within which there are no internal tariffs (taxes) on goods transported between them. There is also a common tariff agreed on goods entering from outside. The UK government has said it is leaving the EU customs union so that it can strike its own trade deals around the world, something it cannot do as a member. But ministers have not yet agreed how to replace it. The UK is under pressure to make progress on the issue before next month's EU summit. How to avoid customs checks has become a key Brexit debating point Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Clark said the UK would leave the customs union in 2019 with Brexit, and that finding the right replacement was of ""huge importance"", pointing to the needs of manufacturers like Toyota to avoid friction at the borders. At last week's Brexit sub-committee meeting of senior ministers, several are believed to have voiced concerns about one of the two options put forward by the government - whereby Britain would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU for goods destined for member states. Mr Clark said the ministers had had ""a much more professional, collegiate discussion"" than reports suggested. And he said the partnership proposal had not been killed off, saying it offered the ""very important"" feature of avoiding paperwork at UK-EU borders. But he added that this model was ""not perfect"" because arrangements would be needed to refund firms if they were only liable for lower UK rates. He said this, and an alternative proposal of using technology and advanced checks to minimise border disruption, needed ""further work"", and that whichever was chosen, ""it will take some time to have them put in place and available"". The business secretary said it was ""possible"" this could take two or three years after the UK leaves the EU, suggesting that different elements of the plan could be implemented at different times. Former home secretary Amber Rudd - who resigned last Sunday over a deportations row - backed Mr Clark's comments. Ms Rudd, a leading voice in the 2016 campaign to stay in the EU, tweeted that the business secretary was ""quite right"" to argue for a ""Brexit that protects existing jobs and future investment"".

A 'highly streamlined' customs arrangement - This would minimise customs checks rather than getting rid of them altogether, by using new technologies and things like trusted trader schemes, which could allow companies to pay duties in bulk every few months rather than every time their goods cross a border A customs partnership - This would remove the need for new customs checks at the border. The UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the UK on behalf of the EU. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs on them were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. Some Tory MPs are urging Theresa May to drop one of her customs proposals Mrs May has been repeatedly urged by Brexiteers to abandon the partnership option, which critics say would keep the UK tied to EU rules. The Sunday Telegraph quoted a cabinet source,externalsaying it would be ""unimaginable for the prime minister to press on with the hybrid model after it has been torn apart by members of her own Brexit committee"". Speaking on ITV's Peston on Sunday, influential backbench MP Jacob Rees-Mogg - who has previously labelled the proposal ""cretinous"" - dismissed warnings about the impact on jobs if it is rejected. ""This Project Fear has been so thoroughly discredited that you would have thought it would have come to an end by now,"" he said. ""We will have control of goods coming into this country - we will set our own laws, our own policies, our own regulations, and therefore we will determine how efficient the border is coming into us."" The customs debate is central to the question of border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, with supporters of a customs union saying anything else will mean checks and a ""hard border"". But Arlene Foster, who leads the Democratic Unionist Party, said a ""free flow"" of trade did not require a customs union, adding that a border was already in place between the two different jurisdictions. Nicky Morgan criticised Brexiteer voices inside the Tory party However, some pro-EU Tories are still pushing for much closer economic ties to the EU. Asked about Mr Rees-Mogg and other Brexiteers, former education secretary Nicky Morgan told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 live people who ""shout loudest"" did not necessarily represent the majority of Conservatives. She said Tory rebels on her side of the debate would be prepared to defy the party whip in key votes ""in the national interest"" but that the MPs who were ""sabre-rattling about leadership"" were those who wanted ""the hardest of hard Brexits"". And ex-business minister Anna Soubry told The Sunday Politics Mrs May had to ""see off"" those who operate a ""party within a party"" who do not represent ""the country at large"". ""These are ideologues,"" she added. The CBI welcomed Mr Clark's commitment to ""frictionless"" trade, saying the customs union should remain in place ""unless and until an alternative is ready and workable"". Labour, meanwhile, faced criticism of its position on Brexit from pro-EU voices in the party. The leadership was accused of ""complete cowardice"" by Labour peer Lord Alli for not supporting a Lords amendment aimed at keeping the UK within the European Economic Area (EEA), like Norway, after Brexit. EEA members get access to the single market - with free movement of people, goods, service and money - without being EU members. But shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said such an arrangement would reduce the UK to being a ""rule taker"" without a seat at the table when decisions on regulations are made. Labour says it would seek to draw up a new customs union with the EU after Brexit, and would try to persuade Brussels to change the rules and allow it to strike deals around the world. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the Marr show that despite the criticism, the party had not lost votes by not being ""anti-Brexit"" or ""trying to reverse the referendum"". ""What people want is a traditional British compromise,"" he said. ""Respect the referendum result, but get the best deal you can to protect our economy and protect our jobs.""

"There are more than 50,000 junior doctors in England. The term covers those who are fresh out of medical school through to others who have a decade of experience behind them. So what responsibilities do they have? The BBC News website talks to three doctors at different stages of their career. Who:Melody Redman, 25, from York Job:Second year of foundation training After graduating in 2014, Melody started two years of foundation training. The first was spent in Scunthorpe Hospital, doing three four-month stints in different specialities, known as rotations. She worked in A&E, general surgery and gastroenterology. At the moment, she is based at a GP practice, in the first of three rotations in her second year. Her day starts at 08:15, and she sees her first patient at 09:00, then more throughout the morning. At the end of the surgery, she has a debrief with another GP to discuss the patients she has seen and talk about anything she is not certain about. There are prescriptions to be written over lunch, notes to be updated, phone calls to be made about test results and then more patients to see during the afternoon. Melody's day working at the GP surgery ends between 18:30 and 19:30. But her work isn't over. Once home, she has to fit in revision for exams, sometimes she has to prepare ""goodwill"" teaching sessions for other junior doctors and from time to time there are opportunities to present research to conferences. Moving from one rotation to another means moving from place to place every four months. Experiencing different hospitals and teams is all part and parcel of learning, but it can make life difficult. ""It's hard being the new kid on the block again. There are lots of things that are individual to each rotation - getting to know your way around a new hospital, coping with a different IT system,"" she says. ""And you've got to start from the beginning each time."" Melody has eight years of training ahead of her - once she starts her chosen specialty of children's medicine next year - and that's if she doesn't choose to take time out along the way. ""It scares me a little bit because I see exhausted colleagues further along in training trying to juggle personal responsibilities, and I know the long days and nights are going to be even more challenging as I get older,"" she says. ""Sometimes I feel I'm letting family and friends down because I can't see them."" It's a long road full of real challenges, but they are also the ""real joys of medicine"", she says. Who:Ellen McCourt, 31, from Newcastle Job:A&E trainee in north Yorkshire in her third year of speciality training After completing the two-year foundation programme in north-west England, Ellen went through a competitive process to qualify to do core surgical training. But after completing the training, she decided surgery wasn't the right area for her. She decided to take a year out to do research in London and then spent another year volunteering as a doctor in Africa, before settling on the specialty of emergency medicine. Working in A&E is an unpopular lifestyle choice because of the hours, she says, but she loves the buzz. ""I really enjoy the immediacy of emergency medicine. Patients can arrive having any problems at all,"" she says. ""I get to see people at their worst moments - when I urgently need to find out what's wrong with them and sometimes save their life."" Ellen has to work one in every two or three weekends. She works blocks of night shifts, late shifts, twilight shifts and day shifts, which she says can make it difficult to see family and friends outside of work and have any other interests. Leading a nocturnal existence for three or four weeks on the trot is not unusual. With each passing year, junior doctors are given more responsibility - for patients and for other more junior colleagues. ""I work with other junior doctors who will ask me for advice, doctors more senior than me who I will ask for advice and consultants too,"" Ellen says. ""It's important we are all there working together."" Ellen's career path has not been straightforward - but that's not unusual. Many junior doctors take time out during their training, to teach, travel or do research. She now has five more years to go in emergency medicine before she completes her training. Who:Daniel Davis, 37, from London Job:Consultant in geriatric medicine after nine years of training ""Becoming a consultant after so many years of training wasn't a massive thing for me,"" Daniel says. He had set his heart on becoming a champion for the most vulnerable people in society at an early stage of his training - straight after graduating in 2003. Since then, the multiple health problems of elderly people - particularly dementia, frailty and incontinence - have been his focus. ""Medicine is a vocation. I felt the need to be an advocate for older people because they are one of the worst-served populations in the NHS. ""But there's so little research into dementia compared to cancer, for example."" He took time out during his training, to gain experience of different specialties with the aim of becoming a better geriatrician. He was also awarded funding to carry out research into why and how the health problems of older people arise. With a wife and two children, training as a junior doctor and moving around the country to gain experience in different hospitals was ""a huge juggling act"". He spent time in numerous different places, including Edinburgh, Oxford, Cambridge and north, east and south-west London, during his training. Family life suffered, but Daniel says it's even worse for nurses in training. As a consultant, he is often expected to be on call for seven days in a row, working from 07:00 until 20:00 or 21:00. Although he will be in the hospital quite a lot of that time, he can also take time out to do paperwork. Doing the very best for his patients is what drives him. What is the junior doctors row about?

"Theresa May has asked officials to draw up ""revised proposals"" for post-Brexit customs arrangements after a key meeting with her most senior ministers. The Brexit sub committee met to try to agree on a new model to replace the UK's membership of the customs union. One of the government's preferred options - a ""customs partnership"" - has faced heavy criticism from Brexiteers. A succession of senior ministers challenged her over this plan in Wednesday's meeting. Reality Check: The government's customs options Mark D'Arcy: What do 10 Lords defeats mean? Two separate sources have told the BBC that a narrow majority of ministers expressed fears about the proposal - what some have described as ""killing"" it. But Downing Street denied this, saying the meeting acknowledged there were ""challenges"" to the existing proposals but that both the options put forward so far by the UK are still on the table. Mrs May has now asked for more work to be done on both options. Brexit Secretary David Davis told MPs on Thursday that both options had merits and both had drawbacks ""which is why we are taking more time over them"". All EU members are part of the customs union, within which there are no internal tariffs (taxes) on goods transported between them. There is also a common tariff agreed on goods entering from outside. The UK government has said it is leaving the EU customs union so that it can strike its own trade deals around the world, something it cannot do as a member. This means the UK and the EU will have to agree a new arrangement for what happens at their border post-Brexit. The UK, which put forward two alternative proposals last year, has yet to confirm its favoured model. It is under pressure to make progress on the issue before next month's EU summit. Please upgrade your browser A 'highly streamlined' customs arrangement - This would minimise customs checks rather than getting rid of them altogether, by using new technologies and things like trusted trader schemes, which could allow companies to pay duties in bulk every few months rather than every time their goods cross a border A customs partnership - This would remove the need for new customs checks at the border. The UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the UK on behalf of the EU. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs on them were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. The EU does not appear to be keen on either option. Earlier Mrs May told MPs there were ""a number of ways"" to deliver Britain's objectives on customs arrangements after Brexit. She says the final arrangement must avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic - which is part of the EU - and that a customs border down the Irish Sea would be unacceptable. On the eve of the Brexit cabinet meeting, Brexiteers urged Mrs May to abandon the partnership option, presenting a 30-page dossier claiming it would make meaningful trade deals ""impossible"" to forge and render the UK's International Trade Department ""obsolete"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg Theresa May therefore asked for more work to be done, and for revised proposals to be produced. Essentially, she told colleagues and officials to go away and come back with better ideas. You can make your own judgement on whether that is a good thing or not. But it does mean that as things stand, the UK government, nearly two years after the referendum, does not have an agreed position on how customs will work after Brexit that has the full backing of the cabinet - let alone Parliament - and let alone the country or the rest of the EU. That means too that the government is saying to Brussels, where demands are building for more detail: ""We're still not quite ready to talk."" Three separate sources have also told me that six ministers out of the 11 on the committee expressed fears about the viability of the customs partnership - yes, the ""unicorn"" proposal we've discussed here before. Those ministers included Gavin Williamson and Sajid Javid, who were both Remainers during the referendum, but neither of whom as things stand were ready to back what's thought to be the PM's preferred option.

"This video can not be played Trump mimics Paris attackers killing victims to underline support for gun ownership US President Donald Trump has outraged French opinion by suggesting the 2015 attacks on Paris could have been stopped by giving people guns. He mimicked gunmen summoning and shooting victims one by one, saying ""Boom! Come over here!"" and using his hand to imitate a gun being fired. In reality, the attackers sprayed many of their 130 victims with semi-automatic fire and set off bomb belts. The French foreign ministry called for the victims' memory to be respected. ""France expresses its firm disapproval of the comments by President Trump about the attacks of 13 November 2015 in Paris and asks for the memory of the victims to be respected,"" the foreign ministry said. Paris attacks: What happened on the night FranÃ§ois Hollande, who was French president at the time of the attacks, said Mr Trump's remarks were ""shameful"". They ""said a lot about what he thinks of France and its values"", he added. Manuel Valls, who was France's prime minister in 2015, tweeted: ""Indecent and incompetent. What more can I say?""

"Jason Seebaluk Fears have been raised that some junior doctors could quit their jobs in the UK for work overseas if new contracts come into force. Dr Jason Seebaluk, 27, works in Euston, London. He is moving to Australia permanently in August because of the government's proposed amendments to junior doctors' contracts, which will seea change in pay and working hours. The government believes the changes are needed to enable them to rota more doctors on at weekends and that the new contract is a good deal for junior doctors. The General Medical Council says so far this year, it has issued more than 2,200 Certificates of Current Professional Status which doctors need in order to work abroad, although not all who request them actually leave. The Department of Health have said the figures do not reflect the actual number of doctors planning to leaving the UK. They added: ""Our latest data shows only 90 fewer training places have been filled this year compared to last and we still have two more recruitment rounds to go."" Today's strike is the fourth junior doctors'protest to date, with further strikes in emergency care scheduled at the end of April. BBC News has been speaking to Dr Seebaluk and other junior doctors who are considering their future: ""I am finishing my foundation year two and in August, I will be moving to Australia permanently,"" says Dr Seebaluk. ""I have always wanted to gain some experience working overseas but because of the proposed changes to junior doctor contracts I am quite certain my fiancee and I will now settle in Australia for good. ""I am passionate about medicine and I realise this is the country where I was raised, but currently the rotas we are on just do not allow for any kind of work-life balance. ""The NHS is a great example of how medicine should be practised around the world but it is in a bit of a mess at the moment."" ""I do feel a sense of guilt leaving but I have to think about my future."" Live updates as junior doctors strike The junior doctors row explained What patients need to know during walkout Dagan Lonsdale Dr Dagan Lonsdale works at St George's Hospital in south London. He believes thousands of doctors have a similar story and will move overseas to places like Australia or the Middle East if new contracts come into force in England. Dr Lonsdale, 32, an intensive care registrar in clinical pharmacology, believes the lure of working abroad could lead to a brain drain of NHS junior doctors. ""My wife and I are both doctors. ""We moved to Australia in 2011 and returned in 2012 because we wanted to work in the NHS. ""We believe in its core values, but we think trying to stretch five days staffing over seven will inevitably lead to doctors working excessive hours, and the reduction in safeguards to prevent this puts our ability to deliver safe care at risk. ""We are now considering our options, one of which may be to leave to work overseas again. ""I know there is an attempt to lure British medics overseas. I receive regular emails from recruitment agencies. Until recently, I used to ignore them. Dagan Lonsdale taking part in a protest ""I have an 18-month-old son and it's not an unreasonable expectation to want to spend time with him and my family. Doctors are people too. ""I always work weekends and have worked seven Christmases since qualifying. ""I expect to work antisocial hours, but I believe increasing the amount of these hours will stop me being able to provide a family life for my son. ""The appeal of working overseas is understandable. In Australia, a 36-hour week is common, as employers know junior doctors who are tired make mistakes. ""In addition, doctors are expected to report any breaches of working hours. The health and safety of doctors and patients is inbuilt in the Australian system. ""I believe a junior doctor brain drain is inevitable if this contract is imposed, and that will lead to a crisis in the NHS of epic proportions."" In 2015, more than 8,000 CCPS requests were granted to UK doctors. The General Medical Council says: ""Applications spiked in September last year because of a social media campaign when doctors began to protest against the proposed change to employment contracts. ""We were unable to distinguish between doctors making a protest application and those actually considering working abroad. ""The number of doctors registered in the UK has also risen year on year. This has been followed by a rise in CCPS requests."" Dr Thea Bishop moved to Australia two years ago. She had intended to return but has decided to stay on partly because of the new contracts. ""I left my job as a junior doctor in the NHS in August 2014. I decided to go to Australia for a year to gain some experience and complete my emergency medical training. ""But over a year on and I have no desire to return and these new contracts play a big factor in that decision. ""Working in Australia, I feel valued, I am rested in between my shifts. I can choose when to take leave.  I still work incredibly hard as it is a very demanding job but  I come into work every day enthusiastic, and that is something I didn't feel working in the NHS. ""Working here allows me to care for my patients safely, and sensitively. I don't want to have a rushed consultation, especially if I'm breaking bad news. ""Many of my colleagues back in the UK are leaving the profession altogether. ""I know that where I work we receive lots of inquiries from doctors in the UK looking for jobs in Australia."" ""It's not an easy decision to continue living here. My family lives in the UK, as does my husband's, and it can be tough being so far from home. ""I never intended to stay here and neither did the other 15 junior doctors in our group who moved to Australia 18 months ago. ""Out of just our group, only three have returned and of those three, only one is going back to the NHS. ""I do feel sad about 'jumping ship' but we have to protect our physical, and emotional wellbeing."" Junior doctors' row: The dispute explained Junior doctors' dispute - where now?

"Manchester United's landscape - and that of British football - changed forever just after 9am on Wednesday, 8 May 2013. This was when the domestic game's towering figure called time on the successes, trials and tribulations of 26 years at Old Trafford. Sir Alexander Chapman Ferguson announced his retirement. The 71-year-old Scot, with a stand bearing his name and a statue on the concourse outside, will take charge of his final game at the self-styled Theatre of Dreams when United face Swansea City on Sunday. It was an announcement that came as a seismic shock to football's system, coming so soon after a series of bullish statements from Ferguson hinting at exactly the opposite of walking away. How swiftly the scenery has been moved at Old Trafford. It was only in March, as Ferguson prepared to face Real Madrid in the Champions League, that he wrote these words in his programme notes: ""This is what it is all about - a packed Old Trafford, the floodlights on, the pitch glistening and two of the greatest and most romantic clubs in the game about to do battle. ""People ask me why I don't retire after so many years in the game, but how could anyone with an ounce of passion for football in their soul voluntarily walk away from the opportunity to be involved in this kind of occasion?"" And yet he has. After winning 13 Premier League titles, two Champions Leagues, two domestic league and FA Cup doubles and a career spent building a monument to success at a stadium that grew in size in line with the successes he fashioned, Ferguson will take his leave. From the now demolished Manor Ground in Oxford on 8 November 1986 to The Hawthorns and West Bromwich Albion on Sunday, 19 May 2013, Ferguson has cast a giant shadow over all he surveyed. From the early years of struggle, which ended with the 1990 FA Cup win against Crystal Palace in a Wembley replay, through all the glories at home and abroad, Ferguson concludes his time at Old Trafford as a uniquely enduring personality. Given the quick fix demands and impatience of the modern Premier League era, his like will never been seen again. Following his aborted first retirement in 2002, there was never going to be the uncertainty of a long goodbye but the speed with which whispers about his retirement turned to a scream painted a picture of a stunning series of events. At the weekend it was announced Ferguson would require hip surgery in the summer, prompting a rush of bets at the bookmakers in support of Everton manager David Moyes as his successor. Finally, definitively, the rumours on the golf course at Dunham Massey in Greater Manchester on Tuesday - scene of a United players versus coaches game - led to the official announcement. Say what you like about Ferguson, and plenty will, but no-one can question his stellar contribution to football and British sporting life. Charismatic, explosive, contrary. Love him or hate him, football in general and Manchester United in particular will be poorer for his departure. He was a character of rare contrasts. Members of the media who were often on the wrong end of his rages also found themselves receiving his kindness and support in troubled times. His former assistant with Scotland, and briefly at Old Trafford, Walter Smith, once told me: ""He is so well read, interesting and great company. ""If you asked me the old question about who you would have at your ideal dinner party, Sir Alex would be at mine."" For all the talk of the ""hairdryer"" and the fiery temper that could see players, officials and the media verbally demolished, Ferguson was never a managerial dinosaur sticking to old values and principles. Ferguson, and this was one of his greatest skills, moved with football's times. Whereas it would be hard to imagine Brian Clough or Bill Shankly coping with some of today's more money-driven quirks, Ferguson adapted in his management techniques and tactically. He was devout in his pursuit of attacking football and trust in young players. The history and tradition of Manchester United ran red through his veins. Ferguson was a moderniser but one principle never changed. He ruled, and anyone who challenged that rule was moved on. It applied to the greatest as strictly as anyone else, with Roy Keane, David Beckham, Jaap Stam and Ruud van Nistelrooy the prime exhibits. But to suggest Ferguson simply ruled by iron fist is to do him a grave disservice. How could his United teams play with such freedom and flair if they lived in fear of their manager? Players spoke of his gift for man-management, his ability to say the right things at the right time. In short, he is a man who deserves his place among the true greats - and even those who support fierce rivals such as Liverpool cannot seriously argue with that. Perhaps there were signs that he was getting ready to say goodbye but few detected them. Assistant Mike Phelan admitted Ferguson was ""too distraught"" to face the media after this season's Champions League defeat to Real Madrid in March, believing Turkish referee Cuneyt Cakir's decision to send off Nani with United ahead robbed them of victory. The pain was obvious, particularly as Ferguson has always believed United could have achieved more than the two Champions League wins he brought. Did he believe his last great chance, and the opportunity to win the tournament at Wembley as Sir Matt Busby's United did against Benfica in 1968, had gone? This video can not be played Archive: Ferguson embarks on Man Utd journey in 1986 If this was a low, surely the highest high was the night in Barcelona's Nou Camp in May 1999 when stoppage-time goals from Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer turned defeat into victory and had Ferguson uttering his now famous phrase: ""Football - bloody hell."" Ferguson has even added to football's own lexicon with phrases such as ""Fergie Time"" coined to describe those extra minutes many felt he was awarded simply by force of character that allowed United to win so many games. One phrase sums up Ferguson more than any other - winner. And now United must find a man to cope with the pressure of succession. United infamously botched the next move after Busby retired in the late '60s. Ferguson will remain in the boardroom but his influence must surely be limited. Moyes, so strongly supported and admired by Ferguson, is the heavily-backed favourite but has no serious European pedigree or record of success in 11 years at Goodison Park. There are others who suggest Moyes's work at Everton has set the platform for the sort of opportunity Old Trafford would afford him. Jose Mourinho is expected to be available shortly when he leaves Real Madrid, but Chelsea is his expected destination and senior figures inside Old Trafford are known to have reservations about his style and also his tendency to be a short-stay coach. An outsider could be Borussia Dortmund's Jurgen Klopp, whose masterly guidance has taken them to an all-Bundesliga Champions League final against Bayern Munich. He is a progressive coach and looks to have the confidence and personality to cope with Old Trafford's unique demands. And what of promotion from within? Ryan Giggs is coming towards the end of his Old Trafford playing career but it would be a gamble of epic proportions to entrust the task of succeeding Ferguson to a managerial novice. Whatever the next twist in this drama, one thing is certain. Sir Alex Ferguson's power, influence and personality means football in this country will never be the same again.

"This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? A new ""customs partnership"" with the EU - which is fiercely opposed by some Tory Brexiteers - is still on the table, the business secretary says. Greg Clark warned about the effect of border checks on manufacturing jobs, saying whatever replaces the customs union was of ""huge importance"". He added whichever option was chosen would ""take some time"" to put in place. Eurosceptic backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg criticised ""Project Fear"" warnings about job losses after Brexit. He said if the partnership model was adopted, ""we would not in effect be leaving the European Union"". But Mr Clark was supported by former home secretary Amber Rudd, while Remain-supporting Tories criticised pro-Brexit ""ideologues"", saying they did not represent the party at large. Reality Check: The government's customs options Why is the customs union so important? May requests 'revised' customs proposals All EU members are part of the customs union, within which there are no internal tariffs (taxes) on goods transported between them. There is also a common tariff agreed on goods entering from outside. The UK government has said it is leaving the EU customs union so that it can strike its own trade deals around the world, something it cannot do as a member. But ministers have not yet agreed how to replace it. The UK is under pressure to make progress on the issue before next month's EU summit. How to avoid customs checks has become a key Brexit debating point Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Clark said the UK would leave the customs union in 2019 with Brexit, and that finding the right replacement was of ""huge importance"", pointing to the needs of manufacturers like Toyota to avoid friction at the borders. At last week's Brexit sub-committee meeting of senior ministers, several are believed to have voiced concerns about one of the two options put forward by the government - whereby Britain would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU for goods destined for member states. Mr Clark said the ministers had had ""a much more professional, collegiate discussion"" than reports suggested. And he said the partnership proposal had not been killed off, saying it offered the ""very important"" feature of avoiding paperwork at UK-EU borders. But he added that this model was ""not perfect"" because arrangements would be needed to refund firms if they were only liable for lower UK rates. He said this, and an alternative proposal of using technology and advanced checks to minimise border disruption, needed ""further work"", and that whichever was chosen, ""it will take some time to have them put in place and available"". The business secretary said it was ""possible"" this could take two or three years after the UK leaves the EU, suggesting that different elements of the plan could be implemented at different times. Former home secretary Amber Rudd - who resigned last Sunday over a deportations row - backed Mr Clark's comments. Ms Rudd, a leading voice in the 2016 campaign to stay in the EU, tweeted that the business secretary was ""quite right"" to argue for a ""Brexit that protects existing jobs and future investment"".

A 'highly streamlined' customs arrangement - This would minimise customs checks rather than getting rid of them altogether, by using new technologies and things like trusted trader schemes, which could allow companies to pay duties in bulk every few months rather than every time their goods cross a border A customs partnership - This would remove the need for new customs checks at the border. The UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the UK on behalf of the EU. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs on them were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. Some Tory MPs are urging Theresa May to drop one of her customs proposals Mrs May has been repeatedly urged by Brexiteers to abandon the partnership option, which critics say would keep the UK tied to EU rules. The Sunday Telegraph quoted a cabinet source,externalsaying it would be ""unimaginable for the prime minister to press on with the hybrid model after it has been torn apart by members of her own Brexit committee"". Speaking on ITV's Peston on Sunday, influential backbench MP Jacob Rees-Mogg - who has previously labelled the proposal ""cretinous"" - dismissed warnings about the impact on jobs if it is rejected. ""This Project Fear has been so thoroughly discredited that you would have thought it would have come to an end by now,"" he said. ""We will have control of goods coming into this country - we will set our own laws, our own policies, our own regulations, and therefore we will determine how efficient the border is coming into us."" The customs debate is central to the question of border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, with supporters of a customs union saying anything else will mean checks and a ""hard border"". But Arlene Foster, who leads the Democratic Unionist Party, said a ""free flow"" of trade did not require a customs union, adding that a border was already in place between the two different jurisdictions. Nicky Morgan criticised Brexiteer voices inside the Tory party However, some pro-EU Tories are still pushing for much closer economic ties to the EU. Asked about Mr Rees-Mogg and other Brexiteers, former education secretary Nicky Morgan told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 live people who ""shout loudest"" did not necessarily represent the majority of Conservatives. She said Tory rebels on her side of the debate would be prepared to defy the party whip in key votes ""in the national interest"" but that the MPs who were ""sabre-rattling about leadership"" were those who wanted ""the hardest of hard Brexits"". And ex-business minister Anna Soubry told The Sunday Politics Mrs May had to ""see off"" those who operate a ""party within a party"" who do not represent ""the country at large"". ""These are ideologues,"" she added. The CBI welcomed Mr Clark's commitment to ""frictionless"" trade, saying the customs union should remain in place ""unless and until an alternative is ready and workable"". Labour, meanwhile, faced criticism of its position on Brexit from pro-EU voices in the party. The leadership was accused of ""complete cowardice"" by Labour peer Lord Alli for not supporting a Lords amendment aimed at keeping the UK within the European Economic Area (EEA), like Norway, after Brexit. EEA members get access to the single market - with free movement of people, goods, service and money - without being EU members. But shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said such an arrangement would reduce the UK to being a ""rule taker"" without a seat at the table when decisions on regulations are made. Labour says it would seek to draw up a new customs union with the EU after Brexit, and would try to persuade Brussels to change the rules and allow it to strike deals around the world. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the Marr show that despite the criticism, the party had not lost votes by not being ""anti-Brexit"" or ""trying to reverse the referendum"". ""What people want is a traditional British compromise,"" he said. ""Respect the referendum result, but get the best deal you can to protect our economy and protect our jobs.""

"Women voting in Batroun, to the north of Beirut Lebanon has held parliamentary elections for the first time in almost a decade. The last elections in the country were in 2009, for what was supposed to be a four-year term. But parliament extended its term twice due to instability in neighbouring Syria, and to reform the country's electoral laws. It changed the voting system, reduced the number of districts, and allowed expatriate voting for the first time. Hezbollah, the armed group considered a terrorist organisation by the United States and others, is seeking to increase its parliamentary representation. Profile: Lebanon's Hezbollah Lebanon country profile Voting for all 128 seats was supposed to close at 19:00 local time (16:00 GMT), however it was extended by an hour at some polling stations. Turnout was 49.2%, compared to 54% in 2009, Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk said. Official results are not expected until Monday or Tuesday. Voters in the northern city of Tripoli cast their ballots Tens of thousands of Lebanese citizens living aboard already cast their votes earlier this week - the first time such expatriate voting has been allowed. The change is down to the new electoral system being used. It reduces the number of districts, and uses a list-based proportional system for voting, with seats distributed among the various Christian and Islamic groups. Lebanon has long had a power-sharing political system between the different religious denominations. The number of seats in parliament is split between Christians and Muslims, and the president, prime minister, and speaker of the parliament must each come from a specific religious background. Current Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri caused a significant political crisis in November, when he fled the country for Saudi Arabia, announcing his resignation in a televised addressin which he said he feared an assassination attempt. Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri shows his ink-stained finger He ""suspended"" his own resignation two weeks later after speaking to President Michel Aoun back in Lebanon, andwithdrew his decision entirely in December. The European Union said it had deployed election observers to all of Lebanon's voting districts. Major issues facing the newly-elected parliament include the fate of a large number of refugees who have entered the country since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war, and continuing economic difficulties.

"Sex workers took part in the May Day march event in Glasgow A group of sex workers have taken part in the May Day march in Glasgow for the first time. Campaigners from the charity Scot-Pep and the Sex Worker Advocacy and Resistance Movement attended the event. The protest is part of efforts to decriminalise sex work and to win better protection against deportation for migrant sex workers. The May Day march on Sunday was led by members of the Glasgow Equal Pay Campaign. With this year marking the 100th anniversary of women being given the right to vote, the focus was on equality. Members of the Glasgow Equal Pay Campaign were dressed in the style of the women workers at Ford's Dagenham plant The sex workers taking part were also be highlighting the problem of violence against those working in the industry. Scot-Pep tweeted afterwards: ""So many good reactions today - someone came up to us and said 'I've been part of the trade union movement for decades, good on you for being being here!""' Speaking ahead of the demonstration, sex worker Harley said: ""I've never been a part of a workers' movement before, but I think it is vital for sex workers to be visible in places like this. ""Too often we are talked down to and made to feel like our struggles are not welcome in the workers' rights movement, we're here to say that we can speak for ourselves and no longer be spoken for. We demand workers' rights."" Fellow sex worker Molly added: ""It's important for sex workers to be here on this iconic day for workers of all sorts. We are so often overlooked by the trade union movement, which in the past has even supported the continued criminalisation of our workplaces. ""Ironically, criminalisation makes us very vulnerable to workplace exploitation and abuse. We're here demanding labour rights and solidarity, not criminalisation and poverty."" The Glasgow May Day poster was designed by Lorna Miller Members of the Glasgow Equal Pay Campaign took part in the march dressed in the style of the women workers at Ford's Dagenham plant, who campaigned on the issue in 1968. The 2018 May Day poster was designed by artist Lorna Miller, who combined three generations of Glasgow campaigners. Mary McArthur was a suffragette who founded the women's trade union league, Agnes McLean was union convenor at Rolls Royce in Hillingdon and led strikes for equal pay, and Denise Phillips is a home carer and part of the current Glasgow City Council collective dispute. Jennifer McCarey, chairwoman of Glasgow Trades Council, said that 50 years since the strike at Dagenham ""Glasgow is currently at the forefront of Scotland's largest equal pay battle"". ""Our May Day celebrations will be led by these campaigners,"" she added. The annual protest and celebration of rights is part of International Workers Day, which takes place on May Day each year.

Speaking ahead of the demonstration, sex worker Harley said: ""I've never been a part of a workers' movement before, but I think it is vital for sex workers to be visible in places like this. ""Too often we are talked down to and made to feel like our struggles are not welcome in the workers' rights movement, we're here to say that we can speak for ourselves and no longer be spoken for. We demand workers' rights."" Fellow sex worker Molly added: ""It's important for sex workers to be here on this iconic day for workers of all sorts. We are so often overlooked by the trade union movement, which in the past has even supported the continued criminalisation of our workplaces. ""Ironically, criminalisation makes us very vulnerable to workplace exploitation and abuse. We're here demanding labour rights and solidarity, not criminalisation and poverty."" The Glasgow May Day poster was designed by Lorna Miller Members of the Glasgow Equal Pay Campaign took part in the march dressed in the style of the women workers at Ford's Dagenham plant, who campaigned on the issue in 1968. The 2018 May Day poster was designed by artist Lorna Miller, who combined three generations of Glasgow campaigners. Mary McArthur was a suffragette who founded the women's trade union league, Agnes McLean was union convenor at Rolls Royce in Hillingdon and led strikes for equal pay, and Denise Phillips is a home carer and part of the current Glasgow City Council collective dispute. Jennifer McCarey, chairwoman of Glasgow Trades Council, said that 50 years since the strike at Dagenham ""Glasgow is currently at the forefront of Scotland's largest equal pay battle"". ""Our May Day celebrations will be led by these campaigners,"" she added. The annual protest and celebration of rights is part of International Workers Day, which takes place on May Day each year.

"Manchester United's landscape - and that of British football - changed forever just after 9am on Wednesday, 8 May 2013. This was when the domestic game's towering figure called time on the successes, trials and tribulations of 26 years at Old Trafford. Sir Alexander Chapman Ferguson announced his retirement. The 71-year-old Scot, with a stand bearing his name and a statue on the concourse outside, will take charge of his final game at the self-styled Theatre of Dreams when United face Swansea City on Sunday. It was an announcement that came as a seismic shock to football's system, coming so soon after a series of bullish statements from Ferguson hinting at exactly the opposite of walking away. How swiftly the scenery has been moved at Old Trafford. It was only in March, as Ferguson prepared to face Real Madrid in the Champions League, that he wrote these words in his programme notes: ""This is what it is all about - a packed Old Trafford, the floodlights on, the pitch glistening and two of the greatest and most romantic clubs in the game about to do battle. ""People ask me why I don't retire after so many years in the game, but how could anyone with an ounce of passion for football in their soul voluntarily walk away from the opportunity to be involved in this kind of occasion?"" And yet he has. After winning 13 Premier League titles, two Champions Leagues, two domestic league and FA Cup doubles and a career spent building a monument to success at a stadium that grew in size in line with the successes he fashioned, Ferguson will take his leave. From the now demolished Manor Ground in Oxford on 8 November 1986 to The Hawthorns and West Bromwich Albion on Sunday, 19 May 2013, Ferguson has cast a giant shadow over all he surveyed. From the early years of struggle, which ended with the 1990 FA Cup win against Crystal Palace in a Wembley replay, through all the glories at home and abroad, Ferguson concludes his time at Old Trafford as a uniquely enduring personality. Given the quick fix demands and impatience of the modern Premier League era, his like will never been seen again. Following his aborted first retirement in 2002, there was never going to be the uncertainty of a long goodbye but the speed with which whispers about his retirement turned to a scream painted a picture of a stunning series of events. At the weekend it was announced Ferguson would require hip surgery in the summer, prompting a rush of bets at the bookmakers in support of Everton manager David Moyes as his successor. Finally, definitively, the rumours on the golf course at Dunham Massey in Greater Manchester on Tuesday - scene of a United players versus coaches game - led to the official announcement. Say what you like about Ferguson, and plenty will, but no-one can question his stellar contribution to football and British sporting life. Charismatic, explosive, contrary. Love him or hate him, football in general and Manchester United in particular will be poorer for his departure. He was a character of rare contrasts. Members of the media who were often on the wrong end of his rages also found themselves receiving his kindness and support in troubled times. His former assistant with Scotland, and briefly at Old Trafford, Walter Smith, once told me: ""He is so well read, interesting and great company. ""If you asked me the old question about who you would have at your ideal dinner party, Sir Alex would be at mine."" For all the talk of the ""hairdryer"" and the fiery temper that could see players, officials and the media verbally demolished, Ferguson was never a managerial dinosaur sticking to old values and principles. Ferguson, and this was one of his greatest skills, moved with football's times. Whereas it would be hard to imagine Brian Clough or Bill Shankly coping with some of today's more money-driven quirks, Ferguson adapted in his management techniques and tactically. He was devout in his pursuit of attacking football and trust in young players. The history and tradition of Manchester United ran red through his veins. Ferguson was a moderniser but one principle never changed. He ruled, and anyone who challenged that rule was moved on. It applied to the greatest as strictly as anyone else, with Roy Keane, David Beckham, Jaap Stam and Ruud van Nistelrooy the prime exhibits. But to suggest Ferguson simply ruled by iron fist is to do him a grave disservice. How could his United teams play with such freedom and flair if they lived in fear of their manager? Players spoke of his gift for man-management, his ability to say the right things at the right time. In short, he is a man who deserves his place among the true greats - and even those who support fierce rivals such as Liverpool cannot seriously argue with that. Perhaps there were signs that he was getting ready to say goodbye but few detected them. Assistant Mike Phelan admitted Ferguson was ""too distraught"" to face the media after this season's Champions League defeat to Real Madrid in March, believing Turkish referee Cuneyt Cakir's decision to send off Nani with United ahead robbed them of victory. The pain was obvious, particularly as Ferguson has always believed United could have achieved more than the two Champions League wins he brought. Did he believe his last great chance, and the opportunity to win the tournament at Wembley as Sir Matt Busby's United did against Benfica in 1968, had gone? This video can not be played Archive: Ferguson embarks on Man Utd journey in 1986 If this was a low, surely the highest high was the night in Barcelona's Nou Camp in May 1999 when stoppage-time goals from Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer turned defeat into victory and had Ferguson uttering his now famous phrase: ""Football - bloody hell."" Ferguson has even added to football's own lexicon with phrases such as ""Fergie Time"" coined to describe those extra minutes many felt he was awarded simply by force of character that allowed United to win so many games. One phrase sums up Ferguson more than any other - winner. And now United must find a man to cope with the pressure of succession. United infamously botched the next move after Busby retired in the late '60s. Ferguson will remain in the boardroom but his influence must surely be limited. Moyes, so strongly supported and admired by Ferguson, is the heavily-backed favourite but has no serious European pedigree or record of success in 11 years at Goodison Park. There are others who suggest Moyes's work at Everton has set the platform for the sort of opportunity Old Trafford would afford him. Jose Mourinho is expected to be available shortly when he leaves Real Madrid, but Chelsea is his expected destination and senior figures inside Old Trafford are known to have reservations about his style and also his tendency to be a short-stay coach. An outsider could be Borussia Dortmund's Jurgen Klopp, whose masterly guidance has taken them to an all-Bundesliga Champions League final against Bayern Munich. He is a progressive coach and looks to have the confidence and personality to cope with Old Trafford's unique demands. And what of promotion from within? Ryan Giggs is coming towards the end of his Old Trafford playing career but it would be a gamble of epic proportions to entrust the task of succeeding Ferguson to a managerial novice. Whatever the next twist in this drama, one thing is certain. Sir Alex Ferguson's power, influence and personality means football in this country will never be the same again.

"Women voting in Batroun, to the north of Beirut Lebanon has held parliamentary elections for the first time in almost a decade. The last elections in the country were in 2009, for what was supposed to be a four-year term. But parliament extended its term twice due to instability in neighbouring Syria, and to reform the country's electoral laws. It changed the voting system, reduced the number of districts, and allowed expatriate voting for the first time. Hezbollah, the armed group considered a terrorist organisation by the United States and others, is seeking to increase its parliamentary representation. Profile: Lebanon's Hezbollah Lebanon country profile Voting for all 128 seats was supposed to close at 19:00 local time (16:00 GMT), however it was extended by an hour at some polling stations. Turnout was 49.2%, compared to 54% in 2009, Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk said. Official results are not expected until Monday or Tuesday. Voters in the northern city of Tripoli cast their ballots Tens of thousands of Lebanese citizens living aboard already cast their votes earlier this week - the first time such expatriate voting has been allowed. The change is down to the new electoral system being used. It reduces the number of districts, and uses a list-based proportional system for voting, with seats distributed among the various Christian and Islamic groups. Lebanon has long had a power-sharing political system between the different religious denominations. The number of seats in parliament is split between Christians and Muslims, and the president, prime minister, and speaker of the parliament must each come from a specific religious background. Current Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri caused a significant political crisis in November, when he fled the country for Saudi Arabia, announcing his resignation in a televised addressin which he said he feared an assassination attempt. Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri shows his ink-stained finger He ""suspended"" his own resignation two weeks later after speaking to President Michel Aoun back in Lebanon, andwithdrew his decision entirely in December. The European Union said it had deployed election observers to all of Lebanon's voting districts. Major issues facing the newly-elected parliament include the fate of a large number of refugees who have entered the country since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war, and continuing economic difficulties.
