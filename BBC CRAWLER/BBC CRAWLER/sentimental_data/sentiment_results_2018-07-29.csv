Organisers of the event at Dorset's Lulworth Estateannounced the closure of the arenas on social media,externalon Sunday afternoon. They said they were ""utterly devastated and heartbroken"" to have made the ""tough decision"" after being advised not to reopen them for safety reasons. The team added its ticket refunds policy would be issued ""as quickly as possible"". The Met Office issued a yellow warning for rain and wind for the area between 03:00 and 15:00 BST on Sunday.

"The Carr fire has burned through an area larger than the city of San Francisco Firefighters have made some progress against California's deadliest current wildfire, which had been getting larger, officials say. The Carr fire is now 20% contained, up from 5% on Sunday when wind and dry conditions were causing it to grow. It is one of eight major wildfires currently burning in the state. The fire, in the Shasta County in northern California, has killed six people so far, including two children and their great-grandmother. Melody Bledsoe, 70, Emily Roberts, five, and James Roberts, four, died when they were caught in its pathas they were about to evacuate their home in the town of Redding, about 150 miles (240km) north of Sacramento, on Thursday.

The Carr fire has already burned nearly 100,000 acres and destroyed more than 720 homes and 240 other buildings. Nearly 200 more buildings have been damaged and 5,000 more are under threat. The blaze is being fought by nearly 3,400 firefighters with equipment including 330 fire appliances and 17 helicopters. It began on Monday. On Thursday it became a firestorm, jumping across the Sacramento River. This video can not be played Experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years California department of forestry and fire protection (CalFire) chief Ken Pimlott told reporters they were ""seeing fire whirls - literally what can be described as a tornado"". ""This fire was whipped up into a whirlwind of activity"" by gale-force winds, he said, ""uprooting trees, moving vehicles, moving parts of roadways"". A total of 38,000 people have been evacuated from Shasta County. California's Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency in the area, as well as three others. US President Donald Trump has approved federal aid for the counties. The Carr is the largest ofeight big fires burning in California,,externaland 90 across the country, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. There are currently 12,000 firefighters battling the flames across the state. Wildfires are a common occurrence in California during the state's long, hot, dry summers. However,experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years,external- partly due to the 2012-2017 drought that killed off large amounts of vegetation. UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain told the Los Angeles Times much of the state's vegetation had reached ""explosively dry"" levels. In December,Governor Jerry Brown said devastating wildfires fuelled by climate change had become ""the new normal"", and that large fires ""could happen every year or every few years"".

"The youngster had been visiting the seaside resort from Erith, south-east London A six-year-old girl has died after going into the sea at Margate harbour. The youngster, from Erith, south-east London, was taken to hospital after the alarm was raised at 15:15 BST on Saturday. She later died despite the rescue efforts of the South East Coast Ambulance Service and lifeguards. Kent Police said officers had been ""called to concerns for a girl in the sea"". The force added there were no suspicious circumstances. A report is being prepared for the coroner. Jane Fright was walking with her husband when she looked out to sea and thought ""that doesn't look right""'. She said she saw the girl floating in the water and that she appeared to be alone, which is when her husband called the emergency services. ""It was a nice day, but the sea was really rough,"" she added. The girl was taken to the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital in Margate but later died Another witness, who did not want to be named, said the beach was ""heaving"" with tourists on what he described as a ""warm but windy day"". He said he saw the emergency services ""swarm"" the harbour as they tried to rescue the girl. The father of three said: ""[It] makes me want to avoid going in the water."" Shannon Owen told the BBC that she heard a lot of sirens. ""Got up to look out of the window to see the police running across the beach while the girl was getting CPR."" The same ambulance crew had been called to Westbook Bay in Margate at about 12:50 on Saturday after reports a boy had got into difficulties in the water. He was taken to the hospital in a serious condition, a South East Coast Ambulance Service spokeswoman told the BBC. She said the ambulance service had had a lot of ""water-related calls"" during the hot weather, and was warning the public to be aware of the dangers around water. Margate beach was crowded with visitors enjoying the hot weather when the girl was recovered from the sea Two bodies were recovered on Saturday in separate incidents. A 15-year-old boy whose body was found near Clacton Pier in Essex has beennamed locally as Ben Quartermaine. The body of a man in his 20swas pulled from the Great Ousein Bedfordshire, amid reports someone had got into difficulty in the water on Friday afternoon.

"This video can not be played Robert Mugabe refused to back Emmerson Mnangagwa Zimbabwe's ex-president Robert Mugabe says he will not vote for his successor and former ally in Monday's elections. In a surprise speech, Mr Mugabe said he could not support Zanu-PF's Emmerson Mnangagwa after being forced from office by the ""party I founded"". ""I cannot vote for those who tormented me,"" he said. He added that he had not chosen among the other candidates but wished the main opposition leader well. Mr Mugabe was ousted last year after almost four decades as leader. Mr Mnangagwa's main challenger is the candidate from the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Nelson Chamisa. Can post-Mugabe vote heal divisions? Video: What do young voters want? Have Zimbabwe's generals turned into democrats? When asked by the BBC's Fergal Keane if he would like to see Mr Chamisa win, Mr Mugabe, 94, indicated that he was the only viable candidate. Allow Twitter content?

In response to the comments, Mr Mnangagwa accused his former boss of making a deal with the opposition. ""It is clear to all that Chamisa has forged a deal with Mugabe, we can no longer believe that his intentions are to transform Zimbabwe and rebuild our nation,"" he said. Speaking from his home in the capital, Harare, on Sunday, the former president again said he had been ""sacked"" as part of a military coup and that he left office in order to ""avoid conflict"". ""I hope the choice of voting tomorrow will throw, thrust away the military government and bring us back to constitutionality,"" he said. Grace Mugabe accompanied her husband for his address in Harare on Sunday Mr Mugabe said that MDC leader Nelson Chamisa was the only viable candidate Mr Mugabe also denied that, as president, he had planned to hand the leadership to his wife, Grace, saying it was ""utter nonsense"". He suggested that ex-defence minister Sydney Sekeramayi should have taken over. By Pumza Fihlani, BBC News, Harare Robert Mugabe has hardly been seen or heard from since his unceremonious removal from the presidency last November. If Sunday's surprise news conference is anything to go by, the former statesman has not forgiven those who took his Zimbabwe away from him. At times he appeared frail, but his words were cutting. He spent much of his address criticising the current government led by Mr Mnangagwa, once a close ally. He believes President Mnangagwa's rise to the top job was unconstitutional. Perhaps the strongest sign of their fractured relationship was the revelation that he would not be voting for Zanu-PF, the party he helped found. But does Mr Mugabe still matter here in Zimbabwe? Not in any way he would appreciate; there is an overwhelming sense especially from young people that he is out of touch with the challenges facing Zimbabweans today. And while Zimbabwe might owe its independence to Mr Mugabe, there's a new Zimbabwe waiting to be born. More than five million Zimbabweans are preparing to go to the polls to vote in presidential, parliamentary and local elections. There are 23 candidates on the presidential ballot. The country is expecting a high turnout of first-time voters, where the youth vote is expected to be key, with almost half of those registered being under the age of 35. Video: Comedians poke fun after Mugabe The 'crocodile' who snapped back The crusader taking on the 'crocodile' The impoverished country, which has known decades of repressive rule, faces severe economic challenges. These include issues of investment, education, healthcare and jobs - some estimates suggest that the unemployment rate in Zimbabwe is as high as 90%. This video can not be played Why Zimbabwe's election is historic The frontrunners in addressing these challenges are Zanu-PF's President Mnangagwa, 75, and the MDC's Mr Chamisa, 40. An opinion poll last week saw the MDC close the gap with Zanu-PF from 11 percentage points to three, with 20% of voters undecided. It was only the second of two opinion polls. 5,635,706 people have re-registered to a new voters' roll; the opposition still has doubts about its accuracy 43.5% of registered voters are under 35 10,985 polling stations 16 years since EU and US observers were allowed to monitor elections Can post-Mugabe vote heal Zimbabwe?

"Mr Trump said he and Mr Sulzberger had a ""very good"" meeting The publisher of the New York Times has urged President Donald Trump not to continue labelling reporters ""enemies of the people"", saying it could ""lead to violence"" against the media. AG Sulzberger made the details of their off-the-record meeting public after Mr Trump tweeted about it. In his initial tweet, the president said it had been a ""very good"" meeting. But he later accused media of putting people's lives at risk through their reporting. His first tweet read: ""Spent much time talking about the vast amounts of Fake News being put out by the media & how that Fake News has morphed into phrase, 'Enemy of the People.' Sad!"" He did not refer to his own repeated use of the phrase. The New York Times then released its statement,external, saying it had decided to ""respond to the president's characterisation of their conversation"".

In the UK, watchReporting Trump's First Year, following the inner workings of The New York Times onBBC iPlayer. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter The first time Donald Trump called the media ""the enemy of the people"", it elicited outrage. Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake called it an example of an ""unprecedented"" White House assault on the free press. The second, third and fourth times Mr Trump used the phrase, it barely merited a shrug. Such is the unique talent of this president - to take an action or opinion that once seemed outrageous and turn it into a new kind of normal. Even when the words don't generate headlines anymore, however, journalists still take note. Whena newsroom in Maryland was sprayed with bulletsjust a few weeks ago, the perils of the profession - even in an established, ""safe"" Western democracy - were put in stark relief. Mr Sulzberger tried to drive this point home in his previously secret meeting with Mr Trump nine days ago. The message, however, may not have been received. In his Sunday morning tweet, the president suggests it's the media's fault that he has labelled them ""enemies of the American people"". For Mr Trump, this kind of language - if it is a problem - is a problem the media have to fix, not him. In February 2017 he tweeted that the New York Times as well as other outlets NBC, ABC, CNN and CBS were ""the enemy of the American people"". He reportedly then used the phrase again during a conference the following week. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"BT will continue to broadcast UFC until 3 December BT is understood to have lost the rights to broadcast NBA basketball and UFC ultimate fighting after walking away from a bidding contest. ""We won't bid any more than the rights are worth to us,"" a spokesperson for the telecoms giant told the BBC. The move comes weeks after BT lost the rights to Italian Serie A football. The firm spends around Â£1bn a year on sports rights, such as Premier League and Champions League football, a sum which some investors have criticised. BT's sports channels will continue to show NBA Basketball until the end of October and UFC until 3 December. BT boss Gavin Patterson to step down Eleven Sports win Serie A rights The loss means BT's sport channels will show fewer popular sports, but the firm's spokesperson said it was focusing on gaining more subscribers for its offering as well as ""investing in more broadcast innovations."" They said the firm had ""long-term deals in place for our core content"" including ""great football, rugby and boxing next season"". Marc Allera, head of BT Consumer, told the Financial Times that the strategy for BT Sport - which launched five years ago - had moved on from its initial ""emotionally driven start-up mentality"". ""It's like a big football club in the transfer window. If a striker is worth Â£50m I won't pay Â£70m for him. At the wrong price, everything is expendable,"" he said. Mr Patterson led BT for 5 years before stepping down last month Shareholders have been agitated for some time about the cost and direction of BT Sport, something which in part led tothe departure of chief executive Gavin Pattersonlast month. Mr Patterson led BT for five years and under his direction the firm established itself as a major sports broadcaster, with the rights to screen a significant number of Premier League games. But the firm was criticised for spending money in this way, and not on improving both the breadth and speed of its broadband coverage. Last month, Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, said BT's ""expensive move into football rights was a mistake"", because it had failed to lead to a rise in new subscribers for the firm's TV offering.

"Zara Tindall and her husband Mike with her oldest daughter, Mia Zara Tindall has spoken about suffering two miscarriages before having her second child. The Queen's granddaughter had announced in 2016 that a pregnancy announced the previous month had ended in a miscarriage. Now she has toldthe Sunday Times she,externallater suffered another miscarriage before becoming pregnant with her daughter Lena, who was born in June. She said for a time ""you don't talk about it because it's too raw"". ""But as with everything, time's a great healer,"" she said. Royal Family tree and succession line Who are the youngest royals? The Olympic medal-winning equestrian is married to ex-England rugby captain Mike Tindall. The pair have a four-year-old daughter Mia as well as Lena. Mrs Tindall does not hold a royal title and is not an HRH but, as a descendant of the Queen, her pregnancies were announced publicly. After announcing that she hadlost her baby in 2016she said she and her husband had been inundated with letters from people saying they had been through the same thing. In a joint interview with her brother Peter Phillips, Mrs Tindall said: ""For me, the worst bit was that we had to tell everyone, everyone knew."" The 37-year-old went on: ""I had to go through having the baby because it was so far along. ""I then had another miscarriage really early on."" Mrs Tindall praised her ""concerned"" husband and ""protective"" brother, saying: ""It was a time when my family came to the fore and I needed them."" Mrs Tindall said: ""In our case, it was something that was really rare; it was nature saying, 'This one's not right.'."" The couple were at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in May Mr Phillips explained how he and his wife Autumn and their two daughters live 200 yards from Mrs Tindall and her family. He said: ""When Mia arrived it was quite difficult to compute. Zara has always been the little sister and suddenly I thought: 'Christ, you've properly grown up now'. ""That rather annoying little sister is now a well-respected equestrian and an exceptional mother. If my daughters come close to achieving what Zara's achieved, I'd be happy."" Miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy up to but not including 24 weeks of pregnancy. If the baby is lost after this point it is classed as a stillbirth Unlike stillbirths, miscarriages do not have to be registered or recorded anywhere so there are no official statistics, but it is estimated that about one in four pregnancies ends in miscarriage The majority of miscarriages happen within the first 12 weeks and by far the majority of those happen within the first eight weeks. When a woman gets to the second trimester - the middle three months of pregnancy - there is a much smaller likelihood of miscarriage About half of miscarriages are thought to happen because something has gone wrong with the early development of the egg cell or sperm cell Miscarriages can also happen because of a blood clotting problem which can starve the baby of oxygen, hormonal problems, a problem with the shape or strength of the uterus or cervix, large fibroids (non-cancerous growths) in the uterus, or infection The main two risk factors for miscarriage are a woman's age and the number of miscarriages she has had before. As women age, their eggs too get older and there are more likely to be abnormalities Source: Miscarriage Association,external Zara Tindall gives birth to baby girl Zara and Mike Tindall lose their baby Full Sunday Times interview with Zara Tindall and Peter Phillips The Miscarriage Association LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Henri Le Masne went missing after skiing in a storm near the Matterhorn in March 1954 A French skier who disappeared in Italy more than 60 years ago has been identified after his story was shared on social media, Italian police say. Human remains, ski equipment and glasses had been found in 2005, high in a valley in Italy's Aosta region. But investigators were unable to identify the victim, and, last month, shared their findings on Facebook. A French family then matched the glasses to a relative, Henri Le Masne, which sparked a forensic investigation. The belongings were discovered 3,000 metres (10,000 ft) high in the Alps, near the Swiss border. There were some clues about the man's identity - such as clothing embroidered with initials and wooden skis, which at the time of use would have been expensive - but the investigators remained puzzled. They established that the remains belonged to a man who would have been about 1.75 metres tall and aged about 30, with his death likely to have occurred in the spring, said Marinella Laporta, an investigator with the forensic police unit in Turin. Forensic investigators analyse a tooth found in July 2005 In June, the Aosta valley prosecutor's findings were shared on social media with an appeal for readers to spread the information, especially in France and Switzerland.

"Thousands of people came together in the capital, Addis Ababa Ethiopian police have fired tear gas to keep back thousands of people who gathered to pay their final respects to the chief engineer of a controversial dam project. Simegnew Bekele was found shot dead in the capital Addis Ababa on Thursday. It is not clear if his death was connected to the $4bn (Â£3bn) Grand Renaissance Dam project. Mr Simegnew's death prompted an outpouring of grief. Hundreds packed a cathedral, with thousands more outside. The police say they are still investigating the shooting. Why Ethiopia is grieving 'hero' dam engineer Simegnew Bekele The 'water war' brewing over the new River Nile dam Egyptian authorities have opposed the project over fears the supply of water from the River Nile will be affected. Simegnew Bekele's coffin was draped in the Ethiopian flag For many the engineer had come to represent the country's ambitions As news of Mr Simegnew's death spread on Thursday, there was a spontaneous demonstration outside the state broadcaster's offices in Addis Ababa, with people calling for ""justice for the engineer"". Thousands then gathered on Sunday for his burial. Videos shared on social media showed the crowd being dispersed with tear gas. Other pictures show injured mourners being carried by Ethiopian security forces. According to pro-opposition Ethiopia Live Updates, the crowd had been calling for the arrest of those who killed Mr Simegnew. Mr Simegnew, pictured in 2015, leaves behind a wife, daughter and two sons The crowd were reportedly calling for those responsible for Mr Simegnew's death to be arrested A number of people were reportedly injured in clashes Matina Stevis-Gridneff, Africa correspondent for the Wall Street Journal, told the BBC Mr Simegnew had come to represent Ethiopia's ambitions for the future. He was also seen as the symbol of the dam, which has been called the most ambitious infrastructure project ever achieved on the continent. According to the state-affiliated Fana Broadcasting Corporation, his funeral was attended by relatives and friends, as well as President Mulatu Teshome and Deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen.

"Holiday giant Thomas Cook has announced it will stop selling trips to animal parks that keep killer whales. The firm said more than 90% of its customers were concerned about animal welfare. The two parks it will stop selling tickets to as a result are SeaWorld, in Florida, and Loro Parque in Tenerife. ""This was not a decision we took lightly,"" chief executive Peter Fankhauser said as he announced the new policy. In a blog post, heacknowledged that both parks had met standards,externaland had made improvements to how animals were kept. But, he said: ""From next summer, we will no longer sell any animal attractions that keep orcas in captivity. ""We have actively engaged with a range of animal welfare specialists in the last 18 months, and taken account of the scientific evidence they have provided. Can orcas ever be healthy in captivity? The killer whale that can say 'hello' and 'bye bye' Orca spotted pushing dead calf for two days ""We have also taken feedback from our customers, more than 90% of whom told us that it was important that their holiday company takes animal welfare seriously. ""And when so many of our customers are so clear in their view, I could not allow our business to ignore them,"" Mr Fankhauser said. ""I am clear about the kind of business that we want to be. That's why we introduced our animal welfare policy 18 months ago, and that's why we've taken this decision today."" SeaWorld said it no longer bred killer whales, but the ones it already had ""will be with us and our visitors for many years"". It said ""millions of UK guests"" had visited its parks and that it would continue to ""welcome the public"" to them. ""They have seen first-hand the incredible care we provide all of our animals and learned about how we are protecting and saving species in the wild,"" it said in a statement. Criticism of keeping orcas in captivity has intensified since a 2013 Netflix documentary Blackfish about a performing killer whale called Tilikum. SeaWorld's visitor numbers fell, although the theme park described Blackfish as ""manipulative"". Last year, Thomas Cook began an audit of 49 animal parks to see if they met its policy on animal welfare, based on standards set by ABTA (the Association of British Travel Agents). Some 29 failed, and the travel firm stopped selling tickets. The latest ban was announced on Sunday. Mr Fankhauser said: ""We will work with both [theme parks] over the next 12 months to prepare for our exit.... We will also continue to work ourselves to identify more sustainable alternatives.""

"Blue badge parking permits are to be made available for people in England with ""hidden disabilities"" such as autism or mental health problems. The Department for Transport said people with non-physical disabilities would have an equal right to free parking from next year. Currently the rules do not explicitly exclude hidden disabilities, but councils' interpretations can vary. Similar changes have come into effect in Scotland and Wales. When the changes to the blue badge scheme in England are introduced, they will extend eligibility to: people who cannot make a journey without ""a risk of serious harm to their health and safety"" or that of others, such as young children with autism people for whom travel causes ""very considerable psychological distress"" and those with considerable difficulty walking, meaning ""both the physical act and experience of walking"" About 2.4 million disabled people in England currently have a blue badge. The scheme, first introduced in 1970 to make access easier for disabled people, costs Â£10. It allow holders to park for free in pay-and-display spaces across the UK and for up to three hours on yellow lines. The blue badge concessions do not apply to privately-run car parks. They also can not be used in central London, where residents need to apply for a special permit, although they do provide an exemption from the congestion charge. Thousands share experience of invisible disabilities Transport Minister Jesse Norman said: ""Blue badges are a lifeline for disabled people, giving them the freedom and confidence to get to work and visit friends independently."" The change follows aconsultation,externallaunched in January which saw 6,000 responses. Three in four disabled people say they would go out less often without the parking permit, the DfT said. Jane Harris, director of external affairs at the National Autistic Society, said the change would ""make a massive difference to the lives of many of the 600,000 autistic people in England, and their families"". Many autistic people experience major challenges in travelling, making detailed preparations and suffering ""overwhelming anxiety"" about things going wrong, she said. She said that some can be unaware of the dangers of the road while others can feel panic in busy or loud environments. Siobhan Fairclough said her autistic daughter Jenny found walking through crowded places hard. Siobhan Fairclough, from Edgware in north London, said she had been refused a blue badge for her daughter Jenny, 21, who is autistic with learning disabilities and rheumatoid arthritis. She welcomed the change. ""We wouldn't have to worry,"" she said. ""When we're walking and there are too many people around, she gets overwhelmed and it's likely to cause a meltdown."" People with other disabilities and their carers also said easier parking would have a significant impact on their lives. Jenette Kingsbury in south Norfolk said her husband, who has 50% vision loss, auditory processing issues and cancer of the bone marrow, had been rejected for a blue badge because he is physically mobile. But she said his disabilities put him at risk in traffic and she hoped he would benefit from the rule change. ""Just small things make big differences when every day poses a challenge,"" she said. Scotland and Wales have already changed their eligibility criteria for the Blue badge scheme to include some mental impairments, where people cannot follow the route of a journey without assistance, but the rules are yet to be altered in Northern Ireland.

"Lewis Hamilton won a tense strategic battle at the Hungarian Grand Prix to head into Formula 1's summer break with a 24-point championship lead. Ferrari appeared to blow their best chance to challenge the Mercedes driver, delaying a pit stop for Sebastian Vettel long enough to lose their advantage over Hamilton's team-mate Valtteri Bottas and emerge behind the Finn. It was a critical error thatcould have cost Vettel second place- but he fought back and passed Bottas with five laps to go. Bottas misjudged an attempt to defend from Vettel, who passed on the outside on the run to Turn Two. Trying to keep the place from too far back, Bottas locked a wheel, slid onto the kerb, hit Vettel and damaged the Mercedes' front wing. Vettel emerged unscathed and Bottas carried on, only to have another contact with Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo when the Australian tried to pass around the outside at Turn One and Bottas locked up and slid into him. Bottas' troubles allowed Kimi Raikkonen to come through into third place behind his Ferrari team-mate, while Ricciardo passed him on the last lap to take fourth. Despite the late drama, the big picture is that Ferrari have now lost two races in a row that they might have won in different circumstances. Hamilton's advantage with nine races to go is almost a race victory andputs him in a strong positionfor when the season re-starts in Belgium at the end of August. 'Hamilton shows he will take some beating as momentum turns' Hamilton to 'turn up heat' in second half of season Hungarian GP - race results 'Did you connect the bottle?' - Raikkonen's water worry Mercedes went into the race pondering how best to maintain the first and second positions they earned thanks to rain in qualifying - had it been dry, they were resigned to the Ferraris being faster. Mercedes accepted that Ferrari would be faster in the race, too, so it was a case of how best to play the strategy to try to keep Hamilton in the lead. Hamilton and Bottas led from the start and Vettel passed Raikkonen to run third in the early laps. The Mercedes were on the ultra-soft tyres, while Vettel was on the more durable softs, planning to run long and attack at the end of the race. The plan was working well for a while. An early pit stop for Raikkonen on lap 14 triggered a response from Mercedes a lap later with Bottas, and now Vettel was in second behind Hamilton. But the world champion's tyres were hanging on better than might have been feared and he held an eight-second lead over Vettel until beginning to lose time shortly before his pit stop on lap 25. That put Vettel in the lead, and by lap 29 the German had enough of a lead over Bottas to make a pit stop and re-emerge in the lead. But Ferrari preferred to wait, to ensure he did not have too long to run on the ultra-soft tyres in his final stint. They arguably waited too long. For a few laps, Vettel had five seconds in hand beyond the 20 seconds that would be lost in a pit stop, but from lap 35 Bottas began to eat into Vettel's advantage. The Finn then unleashed a fastest lap on lap 38, two seconds quicker than he had been going before, and when Vettel pulled into the pits on lap 39 it was now touch and go whether he would get out in front. A problem fitting the left front wheel delayed Vettel and ensured he emerged behind the Mercedes. From hoping to attack Hamilton, Vettel now had to try to find a way past Bottas. How the Hungarian Grand Prix unfolded Listen: Vettel's slow pit stop Listen: Bottas' crashes with Vettel and Ricciardo And despite the Mercedes' fading tyres, and the Ferrari right behind him for 30 laps, Bottas drove superbly to hold on until five laps to go and the critical incident. Vettel closed in at Turn One, Bottas squirmed under power on the exit and Vettel got the run on the Mercedes into Turn Two. Bottas then seemed to lose his head. Not only did he clash with Vettel but he made another error in the incident with Ricciardo, who despite being forced off track caught the Mercedes again. Bottas was ordered by his team to give the place back, perhaps hoping to avoid a penalty when the stewards investigate after the race. Bottas was given a 10-second penalty but it made no difference to the result. The McLarens enjoyed a strong race after a smart strategy call - but only one of their drivers came away with points Ricciardo drove well to fight from 12th on the grid to finish fourth for Red Bull, despite the damage from the Bottas incident. Their second driver Max Verstappen retired from fifth place in the early stages with the latest in a series of engine problems, causing the Dutchman toswear into the radio at his frustration at the repeated problems. Pierre Gasly took a strong sixth for Toro Rosso, from the same place on the grid after excelling in qualifying, ahead of Haas driver Kevin Magnussen. And there was finally some good news for Fernando Alonso on the two-time world champion's 37th birthday. McLaren made the same strategy as Vettel work beautifully, jumping Alonso and team-mate Stoffel Vandoorne ahead of Renault's Carlos Sainz, Haas' Romain Grosjean, Toro Rosso's Brendon Hartley and Renault's Nico Hulkenberg to take eighth. Sadly for the under-pressure Vandoorne, after his best race for some time, the Belgian's gearbox broke with 19 laps to go and he had to retire. Two wins in a week for Hamilton - and two driver of the days. He was superb at the front, driving a measured race thanks to excellent strategy from Mercedes and questionable judgement from Ferrari Nearly four weeks off, until F1 reconvenes at the Belgian Grand Prix on the magnificent Spa-Francorchamps circuit, followed by the Italian Grand Prix at Monza a week later. Can Ferrari rebound? They need to. Six of the best: Lewis Hamilton was already the record winner in Hungary and his latest triumph was his sixth at the track.

"This video can not be played Indonesia earthquake: 'Massive damage' in Lombok village A powerful earthquake has struck a popular tourist destination in Indonesia, killing at least 14 people. The 6.4 magnitude quake hit the central island of Lombok just before 07:00 local time (00:00 GMT) on Sunday. The island attracts tourists from around the world due to its beaches and hiking trails, and is located about 40km (25 miles) east of Bali. More than 160 people are injured and thousands of homes are damaged, officials say. A Malaysian tourist who was on a hiking trip to Mount Rinjani is among those killed. The US Geological Survey said the epicentre of the earthquake was 50km (31 miles) north-east of the city of Mataram, in northern Lombok. It was followed by more than 60 smaller earthquakes, with the largest recorded at a magnitude of 5.7. The main quake was followed by dozens of aftershocks Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the country's disaster agency, said that most casualties occurred when victims were hit by debris and falling blocks of concrete. ""The main focus now is evacuation and rescue. Some of the injured are still being treated at clinics,"" he said. He also posted images showing collapsed buildings and streets littered with rubble.

"Thousands of people came together in the capital, Addis Ababa Ethiopian police have fired tear gas to keep back thousands of people who gathered to pay their final respects to the chief engineer of a controversial dam project. Simegnew Bekele was found shot dead in the capital Addis Ababa on Thursday. It is not clear if his death was connected to the $4bn (Â£3bn) Grand Renaissance Dam project. Mr Simegnew's death prompted an outpouring of grief. Hundreds packed a cathedral, with thousands more outside. The police say they are still investigating the shooting. Why Ethiopia is grieving 'hero' dam engineer Simegnew Bekele The 'water war' brewing over the new River Nile dam Egyptian authorities have opposed the project over fears the supply of water from the River Nile will be affected. Simegnew Bekele's coffin was draped in the Ethiopian flag For many the engineer had come to represent the country's ambitions As news of Mr Simegnew's death spread on Thursday, there was a spontaneous demonstration outside the state broadcaster's offices in Addis Ababa, with people calling for ""justice for the engineer"". Thousands then gathered on Sunday for his burial. Videos shared on social media showed the crowd being dispersed with tear gas. Other pictures show injured mourners being carried by Ethiopian security forces. According to pro-opposition Ethiopia Live Updates, the crowd had been calling for the arrest of those who killed Mr Simegnew. Mr Simegnew, pictured in 2015, leaves behind a wife, daughter and two sons The crowd were reportedly calling for those responsible for Mr Simegnew's death to be arrested A number of people were reportedly injured in clashes Matina Stevis-Gridneff, Africa correspondent for the Wall Street Journal, told the BBC Mr Simegnew had come to represent Ethiopia's ambitions for the future. He was also seen as the symbol of the dam, which has been called the most ambitious infrastructure project ever achieved on the continent. According to the state-affiliated Fana Broadcasting Corporation, his funeral was attended by relatives and friends, as well as President Mulatu Teshome and Deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen.

"Geraint Thomas was racing in his ninth Tour de France There was a time when Geraint Thomas appeared to be blessed with talent but cursed by the rider it made him. A rider described by Sir Dave Brailsford as one who could do everything, a racer who seemed destined instead to ride for others, who kept crashing when openings came. Down on the final descent of the Olympic road race in 2016, down twice at the Tour de France in 2017, down when in wonderful form at the Giro d'Italia the same year. Your chances in elite sport come fast and slip away faster. Now that curse is gone, blown away over the past three weeks in relentless and spectacular fashion. In its place, a certain giddiness, a happy disbelief, a triumph bigger than any of those disappointments combined. Thomas watched his old Great Britain team-mate Bradley Wiggins win the 2012 Tour de France. He has helped Chris Froome to the podium in Paris three times, once having ridden for 20 days with a fractured pelvis. He has stood aside so Froome could chase other Grand Tours that Thomas might otherwise have won. At 32, an age when riders start looking over their shoulder at younger, fresher talents, Thomas' reward has come. And when he stood on the Champs-Elysees on Sunday evening, blinking at the hundreds of photographers and thousands of fellow Welshmen who had travelled to witness the coronation, his happiness was shared far beyond. Thomas became 'clear' team leader after winning stage 11 - Froome Thomas wins Tour de France BeSpoke at the Tour podcast: A special day on the Champs-Elysees Stage by stage - how Thomas won the Tour This video can not be played 'It's just insane really' - Thomas reacts to Tour de France win Some sporting heroes seem to have landed from another world. Thomas inhabits the same one as all of us. His first bike as a kid was a cheap mountain bike called The Wolf. On the handlebars he had a small box that made big noises - police sirens, ambulances, fire engines. He rode it to the park with his little brother and dad to play football and rugby. When he was given his first pair of cycling shorts, he had no idea you weren't supposed to wear pants under them. When he went out for his first long ride, from his home in the Cardiff suburbs to the Storey Arms outdoor centre in Brecon, he got lost on the way back and was so tired on his eventual return that he had to press the doorbell with his forehead. When his mum realised this cycling thing wasn't going away, she used to fuel her son the night before rides with barbecue spare ribs and egg-fried rice from the local Chinese takeaway, and with jam sandwiches wrapped in foil for the adventure itself. This video can not be played The rise of Thomas from the early days with Maindy Flyers As the rides got longer and the successes began to come, winning Olympic gold in Beijing 2008 as part of the GB team pursuit quartet, the boy grew up but stayed the same. He shared a house with Mark Cavendish and Ed Clancy near the National Cycling Centre in Manchester and was berated by Cavendish for not washing up to sufficiently exacting standards. He rode the same roads as all the amateurs and weekenders in the north-west - the Cat and Fiddle climb out of Macclesfield, the Brickworks out of Pott Shrigley, Winnats Pass, Holme Moss. The Tour de France was both real and impossible. When Thomas rode it for the first time, as a chunky 21-year-old in the colours of the struggling Barloworld team, he found the pace of it baffling. Sent back to the team car mid-stage to fetch water bottles for his team-mates, he could only get back to the peloton by lobbing all the bottles away. Thomas was 140th out of 141 finishers on his Tour debut in 2007 On climbs he would be dropped instantly. On flat stages he would be dropped all the same. Sometimes his bike computer would auto-pause, assuming he had stopped because he was ascending the big mountains so slowly. All the time the same thought was rattling round his exhausted mind: how can you come to a race like this and actually try to win it? It's hard enough to finish a day... The transformation came slowly but inexorably. From finishing the Tour to becoming Froome's key lieutenant. Losing the puppy fat, losing some of the muscle that gives track riders their power. Horrendous training reps up Mount Teide in Tenerife, taking in altitude and long drags and brutal climbs. Ditching the spring one-day Classics for summer's Grand Tours, finishing 15th at the Tour, learning from Wiggins and Froome and everything Team Sky's coaches and nutritionists could throw at him. This July he has ridden with the experience of a veteran and the confidence of a man who knows his time at last has come. There are those who would put it down to luck, to the punctures and crashes sustained by his rivals. Richie Porte out after a fall on the road to Roubaix, Vincenzo Nibali brought down by a spectator on Alpe d'Huez. Tom Dumoulin lost time to a flat tyre and then a penalty for drafting before the Mur de Bretagne. Froome crashed on the very first stage. Had Dumoulin and Froome stayed safe throughout, they would still not be within 45 seconds of Thomas. On seven different stages in this Tour, Thomas has taken time out of Dumoulin, the man who will finish second. Dumoulin took time from Thomas only on the penultimate stage on Saturday, and even then only 14 seconds. Has Thomas been lucky? Luck at the Tour comes with cleverness, with putting yourself in the right place in a constantly shifting mass of 100 or more riders racing at 45 miles per hour, of reading the body language and moves of those looking to attack you and ambush you, of eating right and holding the concentration not only on the climbs but on treacherous, slippery descents too. Luck comes from reconnoitring mountains and throwing yourself into the brutal training sessions that can get you through them. Thomas had ridden the time trial course three times weeks before the Tour began. Sky have once again been the dominant team at this race. They have won each of the past four Grand Tours, and six of the past seven Tours de France. In riders like Michal Kwiatowski and Egan Bernal, they have domestiques who would be outright leaders at other teams. Geraint Thomas won two stages in this year's Tour de France Thomas would not have won this race without Sky. Sky would not have won three other Tours without Thomas. You invest and you work and you accept the dividend that comes your way. There are multiple subplots across the three weeks and 3,300km of a Tour. Some flare brightly before dying away like meteors across the night sky: the early sprint-stage wins of Fernando Gaviria and Dylan Groenewegen, the redemption of John Degenkolb on the cobbles of Roubaix. Some light up the darkness for longer. Thomas' successes, first in the breathless summit finish on La Rosiere, then the unforgettable win up the iconic hairpins of Alpe d'Huez, have burned his name into the firmament. The extraordinary could not have happened to a more down-to-earth man. The Tour has not always been blessed nor enhanced by its victors. There are asterisks where some winners once were and questions over others. Thomas may never win another Grand Tour. But he will remain the inadvertent anti-Lance: always amiable, usually praising others first, never cocky, consistently self-deprecating. He will probably struggle for some time to accept that he has finally won his sport's greatest prize. The Tour in turn should feel grateful that the kid who started on Caerphilly Mountain, who first fell in love with cycling on the Rhigos - a climb that starts by a south Wales industrial estate and rises past an old colliery - who respects this race's traditions and who learned how to tame it, has now claimed its greatest prize as his own.

"Geraint Thomas in action at the Tour de France last week, and where it all began on a Maindy Flyers' club ride in 1997 It could have been very different for Geraint Thomas, the Welshman who is set to win the Tour de France on Sunday. His childhood coach said he might not have cycled at all had he not, aged nine, been leaving a Cardiff swimming pool one day 23 years ago. But fortunately for Thomas - and for his many fans - Maindy Flyers Youth Cycling Club's then coach Debbie Wharton was taking a session. ""It was lucky he came for a swim and it was lucky we had a bike that fit him,"" she said, explaining how he was sold as soon as he saw other children cycling around the outdoor velodrome. Thomas, a former pupil of Whitchurch High School which also boasts Sam Warburton and Gareth Bale among its alumni, just needs to cross the finish line in Paris on Sunday to be named the race champion. Debbie Wharton, childhood cycling coach of Geraint Thomas, said she was ""really proud"" to see him competing for the biggest prize in cycling. The Welshman finished third behind Tom Dumoulin and teammate Chris Froome in Saturday's time trial butstill leads the Dutchman by one minute, 51 seconds. Tour convention dictates that the race leader is never challenged on the final stage, so Thomas only needs to reach the finish in Paris on Sunday to win. The Maindy Flyers club, a small, ""oversubscribed"" 200-member club which has proved an unlikely, highly-productive stable for professional Welsh cyclists, is where it all started for Thomas. Geraint Thomas, second from left, soon after joining Maindy Flyers in 1995, with his then coach Debbie Wharton, top right. In addition to Thomas, Olympic and world champion Elinor Barker and her sister Meg rode with the Flyers, as did Owain Doull, the first Welsh speaker to win Olympic gold. Coach Faris Soliman said Thomas is still a regular at the club where it all began, helping inspire the next generation. Maindy Flyers' coach Faris Soliman ""He has been down a couple of times to see the kids and he's taken a couple of sessions,"" said Mr Soliman, a doctor at the University Hospital of Wales. ""Year on year, he is progressing - that's what is fantastic to watch. ""Not only is he at the top level of cycling, but he is a great role model - he puts time back into the club."" Geraint Thomas's signature on the wall of the Maindy Flyers, where coaches say he still visits to inspire the next generation of cyclists. Ms Wharton resisted the urge to say she always recognised Thomas as a potential future winner of the Tour de France, but said he showed early promise. ""He was always good - he looked really nice on the bike, he was interested in the Tour de France - but he just progressed suddenly,"" said Ms Wharton. ""His parents were really sensible, making sure he wasn't doing too much training."" Taste for success: Geraint Thomas ""progressed suddenly"" at the age of 14, his former coach said. People really started to take notice of Thomas when he was 14 after he swept aside much older competition to win a medal at the national track championships. ""People wondered 'how can he go so fast?' That was when people started saying 'there's something special here',"" she explained. ""It wasn't that we were making him fast, it was just that he had the opportunity to train and compete."" How to get into cycling The Geraint Thomas effect: 'Bike sales jump' on back of success Why is there no women's Tour de France? ""If the cycling club wasn't here, I don't think Geraint would have got into cycling because it was harder to get into the sport back then,"" she added. Thomas's success in this year's Tour is ""surreal"", added Ms Wharton, who watched him grow as a person and a cyclist. For his fans who have made the long journey out to France, Thomas's success has filled them with pride. Welsh Geraint Thomas fan Trefor Williams said he was ""really proud"" of what he has achieved. ""It is just an amazing feeling seeing one of our own - a Welshman, Cymro - there with the best in the world, sticking it to them, beating Froome,"" said Trefor Williams in France. And Tim Fry, who was watching with his three-year-old son Elliot, added: ""I can't quite believe we are here really. Tim Fry and his son Elliot have been watching the Tour de France ""We saw some Australian people on the way. They had flown from all the way across the world and there's a man from Whitchurch here leading the race."" As for the Maindy Flyers' members hoping to follow in Thomas's footsteps, they spoke of the invaluable inspiration he provides. Fifteen-year-old Ben, who cycles in the Wales Youth Programme after just 18 months at the club, said Thomas was a ""massive inspiration"". Ben, 15, said Thomas was ""super humble"" ""Coming from a small club like this, he is showing the world what people from Wales and Britain can do,"" he said. ""He came down here not long ago with Owain Doull - he is super humble and super nice on and off the bike."" And 11-year-old Sophie added: ""He tries to make you pursue your dream which helps you go that extra mile. ""We are trying to achieve what they have achieved and that makes you more confident and gives you motivation to do good in races."" Sophie, 11, said hearing Thomas' words of encouragement had made her push harder in races. But Thomas's victory tomorrow will be in no danger of going to his head, Ms Wharton reassured. ""He often comes back here and talks to the kids, rides around the track with them - he is very true to his roots, very humble. ""I sent him a message last week saying 'don't let Froome win'. He text me back and said: 'I will try not to'.""

"This video can not be played 'It's just insane really' - Thomas reacts to Tour de France win Geraint Thomas became the third Briton to win the Tour de France when he crossed the finish line in Paris. The Team Sky rider, 32, follows Sir Bradley Wiggins in 2012 and four-time Tour champion Chris Froome as Britain celebrates a sixth win in seven years. Alexander Kristoff won the final sprint finish on the Champs-Elysees as Thomas crossed the line arm-in-arm with Froome after three weeks of racing. He beat Dutchman Tom Dumoulin by one minute 51 seconds, with Froome third. The Welshman, who rode in support of Froome in each of his four wins, had built up that lead over the previous 20 stages and Tour convention dictates that the yellow jersey is not challenged on the final stage. ""When I rode on the Champs-Elysees for the first time in 2007, that was insane - just to finish the race and just to be a part of it,"" Thomas told ITV. ""To now be riding round winning it is just incredible. It's just a whirlwind. I seem to be floating around on cloud nine. ""Maybe when I'm 70, sat in a corner of a pub telling some 18-year-old what I used to be, it will sink in. It's incredible, the stuff of dreams."" 'So tired he rang the doorbell with his head' - Thomas' journey to Tour champion Thomas became 'clear' team leader after winning stage 11 - Froome BeSpoke at the Tour podcast: A special day on the Champs-Elysees Stage by stage - how Thomas won the Tour Froome was heavy favourite to become the fifth rider to win a record-equalling fifth Tour de France title. He came into the race as defending champion and holder of all three Grand Tour titles, having won the Vuelta a Espana last September and the Giro d'Italia in May. However, he was only cleared to race the week before the Tour started, after his anti-doping case was dropped by cycling's world governing body, the UCI. The 33-year-old was under investigation after more than the permitted level of legal asthma drug salbutamol was found in his urine during his Vuelta victory. But his hopes of matching Eddy Merckx's record of four consecutive Grand Tour victories were ended in the Pyrenees mountains in the final week as Thomas proved the strongest rider. The moment Thomas crossed the finish line in Paris - with four-time champion Froome The final 116km stage began in Houilles, to the north-west of Paris, and the riders took a leisurely pace into the capital before embarking on eight laps of the city centre. Team Sky led the peloton into Paris, having allowed France's Sylvain Chavanel to ride clear for one lap in his final Tour in recognition of his achievement of completing a record 18th race. Six riders attacked off the front of the peloton and built an advantage of about 45 seconds, but they were eventually reeled in on the final lap, with 6km remaining. World champion Peter Sagan's Bora-Hansgrohe team-mates did the bulk of the chasing, hoping to help the winner of the green points classification jersey to a first win in Paris, but Norwegian Kristoff outsprinted Frenchman Arnaud Demare and Germany's John Degenkolb after Yves Lampaert's late attack failed. Thomas rode over the line a few seconds later, alongside Froome, the man he dethrones as champion. Geraint Thomas was keen to show off the Welsh flag on the run-in to Paris Thomas' victory comes in his ninth Tour, one fewer than the record for most appearances before winning, held by 1980 winner Joop Zoetemelk of the Netherlands. Thomas first rode in the Tour in 2007, when he finished 140th of the 141 finishers. Like many British riders, he raced on both the track and the road in the early part of his career, winning two Olympic and three world team pursuit titles on the track between 2007 and 2012. His sacrifice in helping Froome win four Tours has meant Thomas' best finish before this year was 15th. He has also been dogged by bad luck. He fractured his pelvis on stage one in 2013 but rode the remaining 20 stages to help Froome win; in 2015 he crashed head first into a telegraph pole; and in 2017 broke a collarbone on stage nine. This year, he has ridden a near faultless race to cement his place among Britain's greatest cyclists. Mark Cavendish,a former Team Sky and Great Britain team-mate of Thomas, said he was ""so, so proud"" of his achievement. Asked if he ever thought Thomas could win a Grand Tour, Cavendish, who has won 30 Tour de France stages, told BBC Sport: ""Recently, yes. But there is a definite hierarchy in Team Sky so I didn't know if he'd get the opportunity. ""If they (Team Sky) had said to Geraint 'right, now you've got to work for Froome' he'd have done it. That's the kind of guy he is. That's what is special about him and why he deserves the win. ""He's the most loyal guy you'll ever meet. He's incredible. I love him. I'm so, so proud of him."" Peter Kennaugh,another former Team Sky and GB team-mate, added: ""It's incomprehensible. It's 'G' and he's won the Tour de France. I can't imagine how he feels. I'm just so proud of him."" Ex-Team Sky team-mate Ben Swift,who shared a house with Thomas in Manchester, said: ""It's amazing to see. We've grown up together, been at the British Academy together, lived together, so to see him do this is incredible."" Three-time world team pursuit world championDani Rowesaid: ""I did see him as a Tour winner. He's one of the most hard-working riders I've ever come across, so I think he deserves this more than anyone."" Former British cyclistChris Boardman,who won three Tour stages and wore the yellow jersey, said: ""He's the most popular winner for years. No disrespect to those who have gone before him but he's always laid it down for someone else and sacrificed himself for someone else."" Thomas went in to this year's race saying he was hoping to challenge team leader Froome. He told BBC Sport: ""The team have said with the way I've been riding they're confident to give me that role of a back-up guy and to race at least until the first rest day (after stage nine)."" He was second after stage nine and took hold of the race leader's yellow jersey on stage 11. Stage 3:Team Sky finish second in the team trial to propel Thomas up the standings to third, three seconds adrift of race leader Greg van Avermaet. Stage 6:A tactically aware Thomas picks up two bonus seconds near the finish to move himself up to second overall. Stage 11:Thomas attacks with 6km remaining on the final ascent to the summit finish at La Rosiere in the Alps to finish 20 seconds ahead of Dumoulin and Froome and take the race leader's yellow jersey. Stage 12:Another late surge sees Thomas become the first British rider to win on the fabled Alpe d'Huez as he again leaves Dumoulin and Froome in his wake to cement his position as a real threat in the race. ""There wasn't a chance in hell I was going to win,"" Thomas said. ""I just kept following Dumoulin and Froome. Can we just go to Paris now?"" Stage 17:Into the Pyrenees and an attack in the closing few hundred metres helps Thomas finish third to put another nine seconds into Dumoulin as Froome falters on the final climb, finishing 48 seconds behind his team-mate. Stage 19:The final stage in the mountains and Thomas follows the attacks of all his rivals before sprinting to second on the stage to pick up more bonus seconds and move two minutes five seconds clear. He has accrued 33 bonus seconds, 21 more than Dumoulin. Stage 20:Dumoulin wins the time trial, beating Froome by one second, but Thomas finishes third on the stage to maintain a lead of one minute 51 seconds. Mark Cavendishset out looking to make further inroads in Eddy Merckx's record of 34 Tour stage wins, but the Dimension Data rider was unable to add to his tally of 30. He missed out on the early sprint stages and was eliminated when he missed the time cut on the mountainous 11th stage. Mitchelton-Scott riderAdam Yateswon the young rider classification in 2016 and was tipped to go well this year, but dehydration in the Alps - he was dropped on the way to La Rosiere on stage 11 and again on the next stage to Alpe d'Huez - cost him dearly. To end a miserable Tour, he crashed while leading on stage 16 and finished third. The third British rider in Team Sky's squad,Luke Rowe,finished 130th - almost four hours behind the winner - but his sacrifices to help compatriot Thomas win will live long in both their memories. Three-time world champion Sagan romped away with the green points jersey, which rewards consistently high finishes on each stage. It is a joint record sixth victory in the classification for the Slovak, matching Germany's Erik Zabel. Sagan won three stages and finished in the top 10 on nine others to amass 477 points, more than double Kristoff in second. The polka dot 'king of the mountains' jersey was claimed by Julian Alaphilippe, who comfortably beat fellow Frenchman Warren Barguil. Another home rider, Pierre Latour, won the white jersey awarded to the best young rider (under the age of 26). Final standings: 1. Geraint Thomas (GB/Team Sky) 83hrs 17mins 13secs 2.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Jeremy Corbyn is pressed over his handling of anti-Semitism within the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn has come under fire for not saying he is sorry for anti-Semitism in the Labour Party in a BBC interview. It's something that's been going on for a while now andMr Corbyn has apologised to Jewish people in the past. But when asked, four times, for an apology this week, Mr Corbyn didn't offer one. He described racism as ""a total poison"" in our society and said he wanted to work with all communities to eliminate it. Mr Corbyn has said this before, and in early November 2019spoke about suspending membersof the Labour party for anti-Semitic activity. To understand the issue, you first have to know two very important definitions. Decades of on-off talks between Israel and the Palestinians have failed to produce peace Zionism is a political movement which supports the right of Jewish people to their own homeland in the land of their ancestors - modern-day Israel. There are variations of Zionism - for example, some Zionists believe Israel has a right to some areas of land beyond its territory. Other Zionists disagree. The vast majority of Jewish people are Zionists, though a small minority oppose Zionism, for either religious or political reasons. Non-Jewish people can be Zionists as well. Anti-Zionism can be generally defined as opposition to the existence of the State of Israel. Anti-Semitism, on the other hand, means prejudice against Jewish people and has existed for centuries. The State of Israel was declared in 1948. Since then, in some cases when people have strongly criticised Israel it has been difficult to know whether or not the criticism is motivated by anti-Semitism. This has led to accusations that anti-Zionism - rejection of the Jewish state - is merely a modern form of anti-Semitism. Those who reject this comparison say this argument is used as a tool by Israel's supporters to silence reasonable criticism of Israel by portraying that criticism as racist. Read more on the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism Jeremy Corbyn (far right) as part of a group against Israeli military action in the Palestinian territory of Gaza in 2009 Anti-Semitism is not just a problem in the left wing of British politics. In fact, historically, most Jewish people voted for the Labour Party, when it was supportive of the State of Israel. But the party's stance on Israel began to change after the 1967 Middle East war - when Palestinians in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip came under Israeli occupation. Traditionally the left wing has spoken up for the rights of oppressed minorities in the UK and around the world - and the Labour Party now aligns itself with the Palestinian cause. Palestinians want their own state and face some severe restrictions from Israel. Israel says that, in the absence of any peace settlement, these measures are to protect it from Palestinian violence. By the 1980s, people with strong views on Israel became more prominent within Labour. This contributed to the party developing an association with anti-Zionism, something which had previously been limited to the far-left. Israel and the Palestinians: Can settlement issue be solved? How widespread is anti-Semitism in the UK? This video can not be played MPs given standing ovations after anti-Semitism speeches This story dates back to 2016, when Mr Corbyn announced anindependent inquiryinto anti-Semitism and other forms of racism in the Labour Party. The inquiry found that there is an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"" of anti-Semitism within the party. Labour 'not overrun by anti-Semitism' Speaking to the BBC in April 2018, thechairwoman of the inquiryaccepted that her recommendations hadn't fully been implemented by the party. In July 2018, John Woodcock MPresigned fromthe Labour Party and a month later, Frank Field MPquitthe party's group in Parliament. They both gave anti-Semitism within the party as among their reasons for quitting - although it wasn't the only reason. Then in February 2019, the MP Luciana Berger, who is Jewish, was thecentre of a rowwithin the party when her local branch tried to deselect her. She has been critical of the party's handling of anti-Semitism and has also been the target of abuse online. She wasone of seven MPsto quit Labour at that time - although not all of them left due to concerns over anti-Semitism. A guide to Labour Party anti-Semitism claims Then in May 2019, theEquality and Human Rights Commissionlaunched a formal investigation into the Labour Party over allegations of anti-Semitism. Labour said it would co-operate fully with the watchdog. A party spokesman rejected ""any suggestion that the party does not handle anti-Semitism complaints fairly and robustly, or that the party has acted unlawfully"". The charge against the Labour leader isn't usually that he's anti-Semitic himself - but that he has been tooslow to take actionto stamp it out. He has insisted time and time again there is no place for anti-Semitism in Labour. The issue flared up again in March 2018, when Luciana Berger shared screenshots which showed a Facebook post from 2012. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

American graffiti artist Mear One had posted a picture of his street art, which was alleged to have been anti-Semitic and was eventually removed. The allegation was that it promoted a conspiracy of powerful Jewish people controlling and oppressing others. The six men all have exaggerated physical features often used to ridicule and stereotype Jewish people. This video can not be played The work by an American artist appeared in Brick Lane three weeks ago It emerged that Jeremy Corbyn had commented under the Facebook post, questioning the removal of the wall painting. He has since expressed""sincere regret""for not looking more closely at the picture before he commented on it. Labour's former Deputy Leader Tom Watsoncalled it""a horrible anti-Semitic mural that was rightly taken down"". The artist Mear One denies it was an anti-Semitic piece of work, saying it was about ""class and privilege"". Protests were held at the time against anti-Semitism and the Labour leader met Jewish leaders to address the issue. The leaders claimed Mr Corbyn did not agree to any of the concrete actions they asked for, but he said he was ""committed to rooting out anti-Semitism"". Did Corbyn's meeting with Jewish leaders help rebuild trust? Ever since he became Labour leader in 2015, Jeremy Corbyn has had to oversee a divided party. Some of his allies say that the anti-Semitism row is a plot to undermine his leadership. The seven MPs who quit in 2019 were all well-known critics of Corbyn and have said bullying within the party as well as its handling of Brexit were reasons they split. Some people in the party deny the claim that he has not taken action to solve the problem. They say that he has now speeded up the complaints system and is doing everything possible to rid the party of the problem. Labour: 673 anti-Semitism reports in 10 months In the 10 months up to January 2019, 96 members were immediately suspended from the party for their conduct and 12 were expelled. Labour party figures also point to the fact that many complaints have been made about theTories' attitude to Islamophobia. There arecalls from the Muslim Council to hold a full investigationinto what is going on in the Conservative Party, just as the EHRC is undertaking a formal inquiry into the Labour Party.

"An estimated 3,000 polar bears enjoy Svalbard's icy climes A polar bear has been shot dead after it attacked a cruise ship guard on Norway's Svalbard archipelago, within the Arctic Circle. The guard suffered non-life-threatening head injuries and is said to be in a stable condition. He was assigned to protect tourists who had landed on Svalbard's northernmost island from the MS Bremen, which is operated by Hapag-Lloyd Cruises. The German cruise company said a second guard shot the bear ""in self-defence"". The injured man was airlifted to hospital in the town of Longyearbyen, on Spitsbergen island. Polar bear mauls Canadian father to death Polar bears 'running out of food' Svalbard is a wilderness of glaciers and ice caps that lies between Norway and the North Pole. An estimated 60% of it is covered with ice, and its 3,000 polar bears are said to outnumber the human population. Cruise company Hapag-Lloyd said the bear was shot in ""self-defence"" All ships in the area are obliged to employ bear guards to protect passengers on sightseeing tours. ""There are very strict rules here as the islands are visited by many polar bears in the summer, so we all need to be vigilant when we are ashore,"" one guide wrote in a post on Hapag-Lloyd's website. Critics online, including British comedian Ricky Gervais, blamed the attack on human intrusion into polar bear territories. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The Qatar World Cup will take place from 21 Nov to 18 Dec 2022 Football's world governing body Fifa has been urged to conduct an ""independent investigation"" into claims the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid team ran a secret campaign in 2010 to sabotage competing host bids. The chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee Damian Collins said the ""serious allegations"",published in the Sunday Times,external, would be a breach of Fifa's rules if true. ""It requires a proper independent investigation and Fifa should make clear that will happen,"" he said. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, he added: ""If the Qataris have broken the rules, they should face some sanctions."" In a statement Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy said it ""rejects each and every allegation put forward by the Sunday Times"". The paper claims to have seen leaked documents that show the Qatari bid team employed a US PR firm and ex-CIA agents to smear its rivals - mainly the United States and Australia. The alleged aim was to create propaganda to give the impression that a World Cup would not be supported domestically. The Qatar tournament organisers deny the allegations. A campaign such as that alleged by the Sunday Times would have broken Fifa's bidding rules. Qatar beat rival bids from the United States, Australia, South Korea and Japan to the right to host the 2022 World Cup. Fifa's rules say World Cup bidders should not make ""any written or oral statements of any kind, whether adverse or otherwise, about the bids or candidatures of any other member association"". The Qatar bid team has been previously accused of corruption,but was cleared following a two-year Fifa inquiry. A respected academic was paid $9,000 (Â£6,870) to write a negative report on the huge economic cost of an American World Cup, which was then distributed to news media around the world. Journalists, bloggers and high-profile figures were recruited in each country to hype up negative aspects of their respective bids. A group of American physical education teachers were recruited to ask their US Congressmen to oppose a US World Cup on the grounds that the money would be better used on high school sports. Grassroots protests were organised at rugby games in Australia opposing the country's bid. Intelligence reports were compiled on individuals involved in rival bids. The documents seen by the Sunday Times - which the paper says were leaked by a whistleblower who worked on the 2022 bid team - were apparently unavailable during the Fifa inquiry. The Qatar bid team is alleged to have employed the New York office of communications company Brown Lloyd Jones, which is now BLJ Worldwide, along with a team of former intelligence officers to run a campaign aimed at undermining one of Fifa's key criteria in the bidding process - that each bid should have strong backing at home. In its statement, Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy said: ""We have been thoroughly investigated and have been forthcoming with all information related to our bid, including the official investigation led by US attorney Michael Garcia. ""We have strictly adhered to all Fifa's rules and regulations for the 2018/2022 World Cup bidding process."" A Fifa statement said ""a thorough investigation was conducted by Michael Garcia and his conclusions are available in the report"", referring to the completed two-year inquiry. BLJ Worldwide did not respond to a request for comment from The Sunday Times. Qatar won the right to stage the tournament in December 2010. Russia was awarded the 2018 World Cup at the same time, beating three other bids, including England's. Dan Roan, BBC's Sports Editor Once again, Qatar's hosting of the 2022 World Cup is mired in controversy. Ever since its shock win in the race to stage the event eight years ago, the country has faced questions over how it triumphed, its winter scheduling, and the human cost of building the infrastructure required. So what will these latest allegations mean? On the one hand, we do not yet know the explanations of those named in the documents obtained by the Sunday Times. The allegations relate to events several years ago, and some will point out that Qatar's is hardly the first bid suspected of using private intelligence and covert tactics. Indeed it has been claimed England's 2018 bid spied on its rivals. Crucially, Qatar was cleared of corruption by Fifa's two-year long investigation, headed up by American lawyer Michael Garcia. However, there is bound to be speculation that if this is found to be a breach of the rules, linked directly to the bid team, and that Garcia was not aware of this new information, then it could increase the risk of Qatar being sensationally stripped of the event. With the tournament now just four years away and tens of billions of pounds already spent on preparations, that remains unlikely. Fifa would be worried about the threat of being sued if it took such action. However, its new leadership has vowed to regain trust after the years of scandal, so perhaps it will feel it has no choice but to launch a fresh investigation. Qatar is embroiled in a diplomatic dispute with some of its neighbours, which perhaps explains the timing of this leak. And with Fifa president Gianni Infantino known to be keen on a 48-team 2022 World Cup, this could lead to fresh pressure being applied on Qatar to agree, and to share their tournament with other countries in the region. But less than two weeks after Fifa hailed Russia's World Cup, it has not taken long for the governing body - and its next host - to face yet more scrutiny.

"The youngster was on holiday with his family near Silves on the Algarve A five-year-old British boy has died after drowning in a swimming pool in the Algarve on a family holiday. He had been playing with his two siblings at a resort near Silves, but it is not clear whether anyone else was in the pool at the time, local police officers said. It is the second case in two weeks of a child from a holidaymaking family drowning in a pool in Portugal. The Foreign Office has said officials are providing support for the family. Paramedics confirmed the boy's death shortly after 16:50 BST on Saturday. The PA news agency said it happened in the resort of Amendoeira. A week earlier, a six-year-old Belgian boy became trapped in a pool filter and later died in hospital. Public prosecutors are investigating that boy's death and are expected to do the same in this latest case.

"This video can not be played Is this skeleton of Jamestown hero George Yeardley? Established in 1607, Jamestown was the first permanent British colony in America. But it nearly didn't survive. The fact it did, is due in large part to Sir George Yeardley, a military man, social reformer - and one of the first English slaveholders in the colonies. Archaeologists now think they've discovered his remains. Barely 60 people survived the winter of 1609 at Jamestown. Hundreds had died of starvation or were picked off by Powhatan Indians if they ventured beyond the walls of the settlement. By the time relief arrived in 1610, conditions were so dire that some of the settlers had resorted to cannibalism. Sir Thomas Gates, who headed the first rescue mission, was so appalled by the suffering he decided to evacuate the colony and head for Newfoundland where he hoped to find passage back to England. But as they waited for the tide to turn, a longboat was spotted coming towards them. It was an advance party of another expedition headed by Lord De La Warr consisting of three ships, 150 colonists and enough food to last a year. It also carried Captain George Yeardley, who was to have such an impact on the future of America. Supplies arrived at the stricken colony just in time Much to their distress, the Jamestown survivors were ordered back to the fort and Yeardley was one of the commanders in charge of imposing martial law to keep order. ""Things couldn't have been worse. But Yeardley and Gates turned it around,"" says historian and author Jim Horn, President of Jamestown Rediscovery, which manages the historic site. Yeardley returned to England in 1616 and two years later was appointed Captain General and Lord Governor of Virginia. He arrived back at Jamestown in April 1619 with instructions to transform the colony from a military regime to a civil society in an effort to attract more settlers. ""The Virginia Company (which controlled the colony) wanted a society that was an improvement on England,"" says Dr Horn author of an upcoming book, 1619: Jamestown and the Forging of American Democracy. ""There would be work for all and everyone would have a role and a place in society - even Indian people, which was quite progressive for the time. It was a Christian commonwealth that included the Powhatan Indians and it was Sir George Yeardley's task to implement those Great Reforms."" America's first General Assembly, with Yeardley presiding, seated in red Private property was extended to white males, the rule of law based on the English judicial system was introduced and representative government established the principle of consent by the governed. Support for the Church of England was another key component. ""I think he was a very intelligent man, but he was also clearly someone on the make,"" says Dr Horn. ""In Virginia at this time you could make a fortune from tobacco if you had the resources to acquire land and labour. In 1619, around the time of the General Assembly (which introduced the Great Reforms) the first enslaved Africans arrived in the colony and Sir George became one of the largest English slave owners. They remained in his family for half a century."" The story of America's earliest democratic experiment and the beginnings of slavery is often eclipsed by the arrival of the Plymouth Rock pilgrims in 1620 and the Massachusetts pilgrims a decade later. Historic Jamestown ""But American society begins here at Jamestown. This is the place where private property was established and the rule of law and representative government. All those things were critical to the future of early America, and tragically, the development of slavery in this country. ""Racism did not develop out of the Civil War; it did not develop out of the great migrations of the 19th and early 20th Centuries. It was already well established in this country and reaches back over 400 years. We had this canker at the heart of the democratic experiment and that is something important for people to know."" That's why the discovery of the remains of Sir George Yeardley - if indeed they are his - is so significant. American settlers 'turned cannibal' First English US founders identified The grave is located in what was the middle aisle of one of the first churches at Jamestown. Another church was built on top but the position indicates a high status burial. It is one of hundreds of graves of early colonists but a monumental tombstone, discovered in the early 1900s, and other records directed archaeologists from Jamestown Rediscovery to this particular site. Ground-penetrating radar confirmed the presence of a skeleton of the right age and build for Yeardley who died in 1627 aged about 40. DNA taken from teeth and bones and matched against his known living descendants will help confirm - or disprove his identity. Tests are being carried out by the FBI and Professor Turi King, a geneticist at the University of Leicester who helped identify the remains of King Richard III found under a city car park in 2012. Only fragments of the skull were found in the grave but DNA can also be extracted from teeth and Professor King believes she has enough material to work with. The results could take several months but should be available in time for next year's 400th Anniversary of Sir George Yeardley's Great Reforms and the first General Assembly which introduced them.

"Pro-choice activists in Buenos Aires dressed as handmaids on Wednesday Dozens of women march in silence through a rainy cityscape. Heads bowed, dressed in red cloaks and white bonnets, it looks like a scene from Gilead, the theocratic patriarchy Margaret Atwood created in dystopian 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale. But this is Buenos Aires. It is Wednesday, and the women involved are calling for abortion to be decriminalised in a country where complications arising from illegal abortion are a leading cause of maternal death. When they reach the Congress building in Argentina's capital, an activist reads a letter from Atwood herself,according to the Associated Press,external. ""Nobody likes abortion, even when safe and legal,"" the Canadian author had written. ""But nobody likes women bleeding to death on the bathroom floor from illegal abortions, either. What to do?"" Why The Handmaid's Tale is so relevant today Dystopian fantasy? The Handmaid's Tale is based entirely on real history 'Handmaid's tale' protest at US Ohio abortion bill In many parts of the world, women's-rights campaigners - particularly those concerned with reproductive rights and abortion - have embraced the symbolism of The Handmaid's Tale. Language and iconography from the book and TV series are increasingly prevalent on marches, protests and social media. Pro-choice advocates protested in Toronto in May According to Amazon,external, Atwood's 1985 novel was the most read in the US in 2017. Kindle and Audible sales data indicates it topped the charts in 48 of 50 states. That resurgent popularity is no doubt driven in no small part by thesuccess of the Hulu television adaptation starring Elisabeth Moss, but activists also point to concerns about women's rights following the inauguration of Donald Trump as president in January 2017. In the election campaign, footage emerged ofthe Republican making obscene remarks about women. Trump also alarmed many pro-choice advocates when hesuggested there should be ""some form of punishment"" for women who have abortions, later clarifying he meant the doctor or practitioner should be punished, not the woman. Emboldened,anti-abortion activistshope Trump's nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court - which would ensure a conservative majority - could see a reversal of the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision which legalises abortion nationally. Pro-choice campaigners worry that bitterly fought victories on reproductive rights are at risk. Atwood's dystopia provides a stark, recognisable illustration of their fears; a visual shorthand for the oppression of women.The author highlights many of these protests on her own Twitter account.,external ""Donald Trump's Supreme Court pick, Brett Kavanaugh, is an immediate threat to our hard-won fundamental rights and freedoms,"" say the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League (Naral) Pro-Choice America group, which campaigns for women's reproductive rights and pro-choice legislation.

From March 2017, Naral activists in Texas intermittently dressed as handmaids to stage protests against anti-abortion legislation in the Texas State Capitol building, in what appears to be one of the first contemporary examples of handmaid protests to winglobal attention,external.

""Back in 2015, we had folks in hospital gowns to protest [against] another abortion restriction. We had an inkling that this kind of thing is effective, and the timing of the show coming out, and with the book experiencing a resurgence in popularity, it seemed like the perfect convergence of all those things.""

In February 2018, Croatian women's-rights activists donned the familiar red cloaks toprotest against their government's failure to ratify the Istanbul Convention,external, which aims to eradicate violence against women and domestic violence. Parliament voted to ratify the convention in April. In May, demonstrators dressed as handmaids were among theactivists protesting against Northern Ireland's anti-abortion laws in Belfast,external. In Dublin, among those who successfully campaigned forthe Republic of Ireland to overturn its abortion ban in a historic referendum votewere many women in red and white. Chiara Capraro was among those to dress as handmaids during anti-Trump protests in London In London, Chiara Capraro, a women's human-rights programme manager at Amnesty International, was among the crowds marching to voice their opposition to President Trump, who visited the UK earlier in July. She attended the protest with a friend, also dressed as a handmaid. Once there, they met other protesters in similar dress. Speaking in a personal capacity, she told the BBC: ""I read the book a long time ago."" ""I think that it feels less and less dystopian. Immediately when I heard there was going to be a protest I knew I would go as a handmaid. ""The symbolism is so powerful, reducing women to their reproductive functions. Women become just vehicles to produce children. It's a symbol to say we need to be vigilant, to be careful."" Ms Capraro was born in Italy, though she lives in London. Abortion in the first 90 days of pregnancy has been legal in her home country since a 1978 referendum. But medical professionals in the predominantly Catholic country can refuse to carry out the procedures on the basis of their religious convictions.Some 70% of gynaecologists in Italy refuse to perform abortions,external- a figure that has grown significantly over the past two decades. ""It's not just a thing that's happening in the US. It's happening all over the world,"" Ms Capraro said. ""It's disheartening to have to take the same battles and fight attempts to oppress women. It's a reminder that rights are not won for ever. ""People who are attacked under these agendas tend to be the most marginalised. ""But the feminist movement is finding strength again, if you look at what is happening inPolandand Argentina."" And so to Buenos Aires. In June, Argentina's lower house narrowly backed a bill which would legalise elective abortion in the Catholic nation during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. The bill still needs to pass through Argentina's senate, where it is expected to face an uphill battle. Several senators have expressed opposition. If successful, Argentina will become just the third Latin American nation - after Uruguay and Cuba - to legalise elective abortion. It is unlikely that activists will be putting away their cloaks and bonnets in the foreseeable future.

"Blue badge parking permits are to be made available for people in England with ""hidden disabilities"" such as autism or mental health problems. The Department for Transport said people with non-physical disabilities would have an equal right to free parking from next year. Currently the rules do not explicitly exclude hidden disabilities, but councils' interpretations can vary. Similar changes have come into effect in Scotland and Wales. When the changes to the blue badge scheme in England are introduced, they will extend eligibility to: people who cannot make a journey without ""a risk of serious harm to their health and safety"" or that of others, such as young children with autism people for whom travel causes ""very considerable psychological distress"" and those with considerable difficulty walking, meaning ""both the physical act and experience of walking"" About 2.4 million disabled people in England currently have a blue badge. The scheme, first introduced in 1970 to make access easier for disabled people, costs Â£10. It allow holders to park for free in pay-and-display spaces across the UK and for up to three hours on yellow lines. The blue badge concessions do not apply to privately-run car parks. They also can not be used in central London, where residents need to apply for a special permit, although they do provide an exemption from the congestion charge. Thousands share experience of invisible disabilities Transport Minister Jesse Norman said: ""Blue badges are a lifeline for disabled people, giving them the freedom and confidence to get to work and visit friends independently."" The change follows aconsultation,externallaunched in January which saw 6,000 responses. Three in four disabled people say they would go out less often without the parking permit, the DfT said. Jane Harris, director of external affairs at the National Autistic Society, said the change would ""make a massive difference to the lives of many of the 600,000 autistic people in England, and their families"". Many autistic people experience major challenges in travelling, making detailed preparations and suffering ""overwhelming anxiety"" about things going wrong, she said. She said that some can be unaware of the dangers of the road while others can feel panic in busy or loud environments. Siobhan Fairclough said her autistic daughter Jenny found walking through crowded places hard. Siobhan Fairclough, from Edgware in north London, said she had been refused a blue badge for her daughter Jenny, 21, who is autistic with learning disabilities and rheumatoid arthritis. She welcomed the change. ""We wouldn't have to worry,"" she said. ""When we're walking and there are too many people around, she gets overwhelmed and it's likely to cause a meltdown."" People with other disabilities and their carers also said easier parking would have a significant impact on their lives. Jenette Kingsbury in south Norfolk said her husband, who has 50% vision loss, auditory processing issues and cancer of the bone marrow, had been rejected for a blue badge because he is physically mobile. But she said his disabilities put him at risk in traffic and she hoped he would benefit from the rule change. ""Just small things make big differences when every day poses a challenge,"" she said. Scotland and Wales have already changed their eligibility criteria for the Blue badge scheme to include some mental impairments, where people cannot follow the route of a journey without assistance, but the rules are yet to be altered in Northern Ireland.

"This video can not be played Indonesia earthquake: 'Massive damage' in Lombok village A powerful earthquake has struck a popular tourist destination in Indonesia, killing at least 14 people. The 6.4 magnitude quake hit the central island of Lombok just before 07:00 local time (00:00 GMT) on Sunday. The island attracts tourists from around the world due to its beaches and hiking trails, and is located about 40km (25 miles) east of Bali. More than 160 people are injured and thousands of homes are damaged, officials say. A Malaysian tourist who was on a hiking trip to Mount Rinjani is among those killed. The US Geological Survey said the epicentre of the earthquake was 50km (31 miles) north-east of the city of Mataram, in northern Lombok. It was followed by more than 60 smaller earthquakes, with the largest recorded at a magnitude of 5.7. The main quake was followed by dozens of aftershocks Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the country's disaster agency, said that most casualties occurred when victims were hit by debris and falling blocks of concrete. ""The main focus now is evacuation and rescue. Some of the injured are still being treated at clinics,"" he said. He also posted images showing collapsed buildings and streets littered with rubble.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Jeremy Corbyn is pressed over his handling of anti-Semitism within the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn has come under fire for not saying he is sorry for anti-Semitism in the Labour Party in a BBC interview. It's something that's been going on for a while now andMr Corbyn has apologised to Jewish people in the past. But when asked, four times, for an apology this week, Mr Corbyn didn't offer one. He described racism as ""a total poison"" in our society and said he wanted to work with all communities to eliminate it. Mr Corbyn has said this before, and in early November 2019spoke about suspending membersof the Labour party for anti-Semitic activity. To understand the issue, you first have to know two very important definitions. Decades of on-off talks between Israel and the Palestinians have failed to produce peace Zionism is a political movement which supports the right of Jewish people to their own homeland in the land of their ancestors - modern-day Israel. There are variations of Zionism - for example, some Zionists believe Israel has a right to some areas of land beyond its territory. Other Zionists disagree. The vast majority of Jewish people are Zionists, though a small minority oppose Zionism, for either religious or political reasons. Non-Jewish people can be Zionists as well. Anti-Zionism can be generally defined as opposition to the existence of the State of Israel. Anti-Semitism, on the other hand, means prejudice against Jewish people and has existed for centuries. The State of Israel was declared in 1948. Since then, in some cases when people have strongly criticised Israel it has been difficult to know whether or not the criticism is motivated by anti-Semitism. This has led to accusations that anti-Zionism - rejection of the Jewish state - is merely a modern form of anti-Semitism. Those who reject this comparison say this argument is used as a tool by Israel's supporters to silence reasonable criticism of Israel by portraying that criticism as racist. Read more on the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism Jeremy Corbyn (far right) as part of a group against Israeli military action in the Palestinian territory of Gaza in 2009 Anti-Semitism is not just a problem in the left wing of British politics. In fact, historically, most Jewish people voted for the Labour Party, when it was supportive of the State of Israel. But the party's stance on Israel began to change after the 1967 Middle East war - when Palestinians in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip came under Israeli occupation. Traditionally the left wing has spoken up for the rights of oppressed minorities in the UK and around the world - and the Labour Party now aligns itself with the Palestinian cause. Palestinians want their own state and face some severe restrictions from Israel. Israel says that, in the absence of any peace settlement, these measures are to protect it from Palestinian violence. By the 1980s, people with strong views on Israel became more prominent within Labour. This contributed to the party developing an association with anti-Zionism, something which had previously been limited to the far-left. Israel and the Palestinians: Can settlement issue be solved? How widespread is anti-Semitism in the UK? This video can not be played MPs given standing ovations after anti-Semitism speeches This story dates back to 2016, when Mr Corbyn announced anindependent inquiryinto anti-Semitism and other forms of racism in the Labour Party. The inquiry found that there is an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"" of anti-Semitism within the party. Labour 'not overrun by anti-Semitism' Speaking to the BBC in April 2018, thechairwoman of the inquiryaccepted that her recommendations hadn't fully been implemented by the party. In July 2018, John Woodcock MPresigned fromthe Labour Party and a month later, Frank Field MPquitthe party's group in Parliament. They both gave anti-Semitism within the party as among their reasons for quitting - although it wasn't the only reason. Then in February 2019, the MP Luciana Berger, who is Jewish, was thecentre of a rowwithin the party when her local branch tried to deselect her. She has been critical of the party's handling of anti-Semitism and has also been the target of abuse online. She wasone of seven MPsto quit Labour at that time - although not all of them left due to concerns over anti-Semitism. A guide to Labour Party anti-Semitism claims Then in May 2019, theEquality and Human Rights Commissionlaunched a formal investigation into the Labour Party over allegations of anti-Semitism. Labour said it would co-operate fully with the watchdog. A party spokesman rejected ""any suggestion that the party does not handle anti-Semitism complaints fairly and robustly, or that the party has acted unlawfully"". The charge against the Labour leader isn't usually that he's anti-Semitic himself - but that he has been tooslow to take actionto stamp it out. He has insisted time and time again there is no place for anti-Semitism in Labour. The issue flared up again in March 2018, when Luciana Berger shared screenshots which showed a Facebook post from 2012. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

American graffiti artist Mear One had posted a picture of his street art, which was alleged to have been anti-Semitic and was eventually removed. The allegation was that it promoted a conspiracy of powerful Jewish people controlling and oppressing others. The six men all have exaggerated physical features often used to ridicule and stereotype Jewish people. This video can not be played The work by an American artist appeared in Brick Lane three weeks ago It emerged that Jeremy Corbyn had commented under the Facebook post, questioning the removal of the wall painting. He has since expressed""sincere regret""for not looking more closely at the picture before he commented on it. Labour's former Deputy Leader Tom Watsoncalled it""a horrible anti-Semitic mural that was rightly taken down"". The artist Mear One denies it was an anti-Semitic piece of work, saying it was about ""class and privilege"". Protests were held at the time against anti-Semitism and the Labour leader met Jewish leaders to address the issue. The leaders claimed Mr Corbyn did not agree to any of the concrete actions they asked for, but he said he was ""committed to rooting out anti-Semitism"". Did Corbyn's meeting with Jewish leaders help rebuild trust? Ever since he became Labour leader in 2015, Jeremy Corbyn has had to oversee a divided party. Some of his allies say that the anti-Semitism row is a plot to undermine his leadership. The seven MPs who quit in 2019 were all well-known critics of Corbyn and have said bullying within the party as well as its handling of Brexit were reasons they split. Some people in the party deny the claim that he has not taken action to solve the problem. They say that he has now speeded up the complaints system and is doing everything possible to rid the party of the problem. Labour: 673 anti-Semitism reports in 10 months In the 10 months up to January 2019, 96 members were immediately suspended from the party for their conduct and 12 were expelled. Labour party figures also point to the fact that many complaints have been made about theTories' attitude to Islamophobia.

"This video can not be played Damian Collins, the committee's chairman, says ""sophisticated"" fake news is causing a ""crisis for democracy"" The volume of disinformation on the internet is growing so big that it is starting to crowd out real news, the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee chairman has said. Tory MP Damian Collins said people struggle to identify ""fake news"". MPsin their committee report,externalsaid the issue threatens democracy and called for tougher social network regulation. The government said it plans to introduce a requirement for electoral adverts to have a ""digital imprint"". This would mean that all political communications carried online would need to clearly identify who they were published by. Labour said the government ""needs to wake up to the new challenges we face and finally update electoral laws"". The report follows the Cambridge Analytica data scandal earlier this year. The London-based data analytics firms and tech giant Facebook were at the centre of a dispute over the harvesting and use of personal data - and whether it was used to influence the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election or the UK Brexit referendum. Both firms deny any wrongdoing. Arron Banks, the businessman who was the chief backer of the unofficial Leave.EU campaign, donating millions of pounds, was criticised for misleading the committee about his business dealings with Russia and for failing to demonstrate the source of the money. Vote Leave broke electoral law, says Electoral Commission Vote Leave's targeted adverts revealed Cambridge Analytica 'planted fake news' The not so brief history of fake news Cambridge Analytica: The story so far MPs also considered evidence from around the world of how elections could be manipulated and heard how Russian agencies worked to influence votes by running adverts on Facebook. Mr Collins told the BBC this had happened without the knowledge of the social network. ""That's why we feel that this is now a threat to our democracy,"" he said. ""If these tools that are so powerful, that can reach millions and millions of people all around the world at the touch of a button, if they can be effectively used to spread disinformation without the source of that information ever being revealed, as appears to be the case here, then that is a threat we have to confront."" He made clear the term ""fake news"" as used by figures like US President Donald Trump is different to the ""concerted campaigns of disinformation"" in which people or agencies deliberately spread false stories. This video can not be played A brief history of fake news New laws must be introduced to clamp down on the ""wild west"" social media world, their report said. The committee also repeated its call for Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg to give evidence. Facebook said it shared the committee's goal of making political advertising more fair and transparent. It said it was working on ways to authenticate and label these type of adverts in the UK. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been asked to give evidence to the committee The committee concluded that Arron Banks had misled them about his meetings with the Russian Embassy and had walked out of an evidence session to avoid scrutiny on the topic. It said that it was ""unclear"" where he had obtained the money for his donation to the leave campaign, and he had failed to demonstrate that it came from within the UK. Mr Banks ""seemed to want to hide the extent of his contacts with Russia"", which had discussed potential gold and diamond deals with him, and his spokesman Andy Wigmore was ""a self-confessed liar"", the committee said. Mr Collins said: ""If it turned out to be the case that he profited from these relationships with the Russian people he was meeting and discussing business deals with, and he used that money to invest in the Brexit campaign, then I think that would be a really serious matter."" The Information Commissioner's Office is also investigating whether the Leave.EU campaign, which Mr Banks co-founded, misused customer data from his insurance company for political purposes. Mr Banks has said that the funding for his donation came from his personal wealth and has described the information commissioner's investigation as ""a politically motivated attack"". Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie and the firm's former chief executive, Alexander Nix, were among the 61 witnesses who did give evidence. A copy of the report was leaked on Friday,externalby Dominic Cummings, the director of the official Brexit campaign group Vote Leave, who published it on his own blog. Mr Cummingswas askedand officially summoned to take part in the inquiry - to respond to allegations made against the Vote Leave campaign - but he refused. Mr Cummings called the report ""fake news"". The report said people were increasingly finding out about what is happening in the country, local communities and the world through social media - rather than through traditional forms of communication such as television, print media or the radio. People were also less likely to question information shared on social media because most trust their friends and family. The MPs said this is where malicious actors come in to try to influence the billions of people who use social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. Fake news can come in a wide spectrum of forms, from satire and parody to fabricated images or propaganda, the report said. The report made a series of recommendations. It said: Electoral law needs to be updated to reflect the modern world A new tax on social networks could pay for digital literacy programmes in schools The Electoral Commission should set up a code for political advertising on social media There should be greater transparency around online advertising There should be a ""digital Atlantic charter"" to protect personal information and rights Mr Collins said: ""Data crimes are real crimes, with real victims. This is a watershed moment in terms of people realising they themselves are the product, not just the user of a free service. ""Their rights over their data must be protected."" Labour's shadow secretary for digital, culture, media and sport, Tom Watson, said Britain's electoral laws needed updating ""for the modern campaigning environment"". ""Labour called for increased powers for the Electoral Commission during the passage of the Data Protection Bill on digital imprints, the disclosure of funding sources and settings for targeted adverts and increasing the commission's investigatory powers. ""These calls were rejected by the Conservatives,"" he said. Meanwhile, the Electoral Commission welcomed the committee's report and said it backs calls to modernise electoral law. A spokeswoman said: ""The government takes disinformation very seriously, as with all types of online manipulation and internet harms. ""That is why we have said we will come forward with new online safety laws to make sure the UK is the safest place to be online. ""We note the committee's report and will consider its final recommendations"" The government is expected to publish a white paper later this year on proposals to reform laws to make the internet and social media safer. The committee's final report is expected before the end of the year.

"MyShake: An app which allows users' phones to act as seismometers Earthquake early warning detection is more effective for minor quakes than major ones. This is according toa new study,externalfrom the United States Geological Survey. Seismologists modelled ground shaking along California's San Andreas Fault, where an earthquake of magnitude 6.5 or more is expected within 30 years. They found that warning time could be increased for residents if they were willing to tolerate a number of ""false alarms"" for smaller events. This would mean issuing alerts early in an earthquake's lifespan, before its full magnitude is determined. Those living far from the epicentre would occasionally receive warnings for ground shaking they could not feel. ""We can get [greater] warning times for weak ground motion levels, but we can't get long warning times for strong shaking,"" Sarah Minson, lead author of the study, told BBC News. ""Alternatively, we could warn you every time there was an earthquake that might produce weak ground shaking at your location... A lot of baby earthquakes don't grow up to become big earthquakes,"" she added. 'Phone seismometers' prove their worth Gravity signals show true size of giant earthquakes History of deadly earthquakes California: Earthquake drills have been run in anticipation of ""the big one"" Earthquake early warning systems have been in place in Mexico and Japan for years. Now, a system called ShakeAlert is being developed for the west coast of North America. So how can it predict the unpredictable? In short, it can't. ""It's a misnomer... because it's not earthquake early warning, the earthquake has already happened... It's ground motion early warning,"" said Dr Minson. Earthquakes occur along tectonic plate boundaries and faults in the Earth's crust - long fractures where friction has built up over time. Dr Lucy Jones, a seismologist who was not involved in the study, explained: ""The whole fault doesn't move at once. It starts at an epicentre and the rupture moves down the fault like how you would rip a piece of paper."" This release of energy moves in two parts. Seismic activity is closely monitored around the world Primary waves (p-waves) accordion out first and fastest. They are followed by slower secondary, or s-waves, which cause the ground to ripple up and down - the shaking that people experience during a quake. The physics of earthquakes is one of the reasons why a single, universal warning system hasn't been rolled out across all quake prone countries. California and Japan have populations living directly alongside fault lines, and cannot waste precious seconds before warning their citizens. In both countries, the p-waves and some very rapid algorithms determine the potential magnitude and dispatch an alert. But in Mexico, the capital city is about 300km from the nearest tectonic plate boundary. This allows geologists to use a system that can take some more time to issue a warning. They wait to detect the s-waves. Sirens blare in the streets of Mexico City whenever ground shaking above M5 is detected. However, the country's usually robust SASMEX early warning system didn't have sufficient time to respond to last September's second earthquake. Mexico City: extensive damage was caused by two earthquakes in September 2017 The system can usually provide up to a minute's warning but the M7.1 earthquake originated much nearer the city than usual. The ground began to shake almost immediately after the alarm was triggered. A new algorithm was being tested for the SASMEX system at the time, which could, in the future, issue a warning 8-10 seconds earlier. Similarly, Japanese seismologists have looked to improve their early warning system after the devastating 2011 M9 earthquake. Japan 2011: Early warning systems gave residents a brief evacuation window Dr Mitsuyuki Hoshiba, who has developed the new PLUM algorithm launched this week, explained. ""In PLUM method: strength of shaking is predicted directly from observed shaking, skipping the process of estimation of epicentre and magnitude."" This will, Dr Hoshiba says, reduce the problem of missed alarms for future earthquakes. Back in California, work continues on ShakeAlert. It is due to have a limited public rollout later this year, supported by federal funding which was approved on Friday 23 March. The system will use both ground-based seismometers and satellite observations to provide the maximum warning time to populations on the west coast. The work done by Dr Minson and her colleagues shows that for San Francisco this may be about 50 seconds for minor shaking, or as little as eight seconds for a major earthquake. If the system is to be as sensitive as possible, false alerts may also become a necessary part of life for Californians in the future. San Francisco is expected to experience a M6.5 earthquake within the next 30 years Dr Cochran, who spent time in Mexico following the 2017 earthquakes, noted that ""people wanted as much information as they could get, and they were not particularly bothered as long as they heard there was an earthquake associated with that alert."" Dr Jones agrees: ""I do not believe that is a great shortcoming of early warning systems as long as it is understood... we need to invest in appropriate education for the general public about early warning for the information to be most effectively used.""

"The youngster had been visiting the seaside resort from Erith, south-east London A six-year-old girl has died after going into the sea at Margate harbour. The youngster, from Erith, south-east London, was taken to hospital after the alarm was raised at 15:15 BST on Saturday. She later died despite the rescue efforts of the South East Coast Ambulance Service and lifeguards. Kent Police said officers had been ""called to concerns for a girl in the sea"". The force added there were no suspicious circumstances. A report is being prepared for the coroner. Jane Fright was walking with her husband when she looked out to sea and thought ""that doesn't look right""'. She said she saw the girl floating in the water and that she appeared to be alone, which is when her husband called the emergency services. ""It was a nice day, but the sea was really rough,"" she added. The girl was taken to the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital in Margate but later died Another witness, who did not want to be named, said the beach was ""heaving"" with tourists on what he described as a ""warm but windy day"". He said he saw the emergency services ""swarm"" the harbour as they tried to rescue the girl. The father of three said: ""[It] makes me want to avoid going in the water."" Shannon Owen told the BBC that she heard a lot of sirens. ""Got up to look out of the window to see the police running across the beach while the girl was getting CPR."" The same ambulance crew had been called to Westbook Bay in Margate at about 12:50 on Saturday after reports a boy had got into difficulties in the water. He was taken to the hospital in a serious condition, a South East Coast Ambulance Service spokeswoman told the BBC. She said the ambulance service had had a lot of ""water-related calls"" during the hot weather, and was warning the public to be aware of the dangers around water. Margate beach was crowded with visitors enjoying the hot weather when the girl was recovered from the sea Two bodies were recovered on Saturday in separate incidents. A 15-year-old boy whose body was found near Clacton Pier in Essex has beennamed locally as Ben Quartermaine. The body of a man in his 20swas pulled from the Great Ousein Bedfordshire, amid reports someone had got into difficulty in the water on Friday afternoon.

"Diane Abbott and Boris Johnson both received high levels of online abuse during the 2017 election Online trolls who intimidate election candidates or campaigners could be barred from public office under government proposals being considered. Extreme intimidation cases are already punishable with a jail sentence. A 2017 parliamentary report,externalhighlighted the ""significant factor"" of social media abuse of candidates in that year's general election. Constitution Minister Chloe Smith said intimidation was putting ""talented people"" off standing for election. She added that the measures being consulted on would ""protect voters, candidates and campaigners so they can make their choice at the ballot box or stand for public service without fear of being victims of misinformation or abuse"". The length of the ban on convicted abusers standing for or holding public office would be a part of the consultation, a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said. MPs call for misogyny to be hate crime MPs 'being advised to quit Twitter' Outlaw online abuse, Katie Price tells MPs A joint analysis of tweets in the run-up to the election in 2017, by the University of Sheffield and BuzzFeed News.,externalfound that male Conservative candidates received the highest percentage of abuse on Twitter. Amnesty International had carried out a separate analysis of,externalthe accounts of 177 female MPs in the six months leading up to the election and found that Labour's Diane Abbott received almost half (45.1%) of all abusive tweets that were sent to female MPs. By BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth In reality this may not prevent swathes of people from standing for office who otherwise would have. There are existing rules which stop those convicted of crimes carrying a certain sentence from standing as an MP or local councillor. In addition, the vetting processes of political parties should - in theory at least - stop unsuitable candidates from being selected. But there has been pressure for ministers to do something to tackle online trolls who target people in public office. After last year's general Election, several MPs reported some of the worst abuse and harassment that they'd experienced. There was even a debate in Parliament during which men and women from all political parties recounted their experience of sexist and racist comments, graphic language and even death threats. No doubt the government is keen to be seen to be taking this seriously. Currently, to stand in a general election, you must be at least 18 years old and either a British citizen, a citizen of the Republic of Ireland or an eligible Commonwealth citizen. Certain people are disqualified from becoming an MP including: civil servants members of police forces members of the armed forces judges a person who has been convicted of an offence and has been detained for more than a year peers who can sit in the House of Lords bishops of the Church of England who are entitled to sit in the House of Lords someone currently subject to a bankruptcy restrictions order MPs call for misogyny to be hate crime MPs 'being advised to quit Twitter' Outlaw online abuse, Katie Price tells MPs LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"This video can not be played Ahed Tamimi is released from prison A Palestinian teenager who was filmed assaulting an Israeli soldier in the occupied West Bank has been freed after eight months in jail. Video showing Ahed Tamimi slapping and kicking the soldier outside her home in Nabi Saleh last year went viral. For Palestinians, she became a symbol of resistance to Israeli occupation, but many Israelis see her as a publicity-seeking troublemaker. The 17-year-old was mobbed by well-wishers as she returned to her town. ""Resistance is continuing until the occupation is removed,"" she told the crowd. Speaking to the media later, she said she had resolved ""to study law and to focus on holding the occupation accountable"". Spotlight turns on viral slap video teen Sixteen at the time, she was originally charged with 12 counts of assault, incitement, interference with soldiers and stone throwing. In March, she agreed to plead guilty to four of the charges, including incitement and assault. The day before Ahed Tamimi was released, two Italians were arrested for drawing a 4m (13ft) mural of the teenager's face on the wall that separates Bethlehem from Jerusalem. Israeli border police said the two Italian men, and a Palestinian who was also arrested, were suspected of ""damaging and vandalising the security fence in the Bethlehem area"". The mural was created in the last week The group then allegedly tried to flee when confronted by police. Last Wednesday, one of the men identified himself as Italian street artist Jorit Agoch. He postedan appeal for help on his Instagram page,externalon Saturday, saying he had been arrested. Ahed Tamimi was filmed by her mother, Nariman, shouting at and shoving two soldiers in the driveway of her family home on 15 December 2017. The incident was streamed onNariman Tamimi's Facebook page,externaland video of the confrontation was widely viewed. In the footage she kicks one soldier and slaps his face, and threatens to punch the other. Both Ahed Tamimi (R) and her mother Nariman served time in jail over the incident Ahed Tamimi told a pre-trial hearing that she had lashed out at the soldiers because she had seen them shoot her 15-year-old cousin Mohammed in the head with a rubber bullet that same day. The Israeli military said it had dispatched the soldiers to the Tamimis' home, where Palestinian youths had been throwing stones at troops sent to quell violent protests. It also later contested the cause of Mohammed's head injury,external, saying he had told interrogators he had fallen off his bike. However according to Palestinian hospital records he had been shot by Israeli soldiers; Mohammed also retracted his account, saying he had made it out of fear of being arrested for protesting. saying last month that the boy had told interrogators he sustained it from falling off a bike. Ahed Tamimi's case sparked an outpouring of deeply opposing views between Israelis and Palestinians. Many Israelis say Ahed Tamimi has long been exploited by her family, who they accuse of using her to try to provoke Israeli soldiers on film. Her mother was also charged with incitement on social media and assault, while her cousin Nour, who participated in the incident, was charged with assault. Israel's Education Minister Naftali Bennett said Ahed and Nour Tamimi deserved to ""finish their lives in prison"". For Palestinians, Ahed Tamimi has become a national icon for what they see as acts of bravery in standing up to armed soldiers on occupied land.

"Michael Gove says water firms ""have much more to do to tackle leakage"" Michael Gove has asked water company bosses to explain why they have failed to meet leakage targets, at a time of one of the driest summers for years. The environment secretary said customers expect a ""reliable and resilient water supply"". It comes as farmers are due to discuss the effect of the extensive heatwave on food supplies at a ""drought summit"". The UK has seen the driest start to the summer since 1961 with rainfall on Thursday and Friday the first in weeks. Water levels are low in some reservoirs and supplierUnited Utilities (UU) has said it will introduce a hosepipe banaffecting seven million people in the north-west of England from 5 August. Reality Check: Do hosepipe bans work? What are the effects of a heatwave? Mr Gove said water firms ""have much more to do to tackle leakage"", adding: ""That is why I have repeatedly made clear that companies must improve and recently wrote to them to outline my expectations during this period of dry weather. ""Next week I will ask the chief executives of the water companies that have failed to meet their leakage targets to a meeting at Defra [Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) to discuss how they are going to address this serious issue and improve their performance."" UU has been accused of ""wasting"" 430 million litres of water every day from leaks. The GMB union said its research showed the supplier was allowing 175 Olympic-sized swimming pools' worth of water to go ""down the plughole"" every day. This video can not be played Continued dry weather could see further hosepipe bans Earlier this month, UU said ""reducing leaks is a top priority"". On Sunday, a spokesman for Water UK, the trade body for the major water companies, told the BBC: ""Tackling leakage is one of the water industry's top priorities. ""We know how important it is for customers, and since the mid-1990s companies have successfully managed to reduce leakage levels by a third. ""We know there is more to do, which is why water companies are currently developing ambitious plans to cut leakage even further."" At separate talks with government officials, chaired by National Farmers' Union (NFU) president Minette Batters, irrigation water shortages, a lack of fresh forage for animals and growing conditions for cereal crops will be discussed. Ms Batters will meet Defra officials, rural agencies and farming charities on Wednesday, after a month that has seen England receive just 15% of its long-term average rainfall. She described the situation as ""hugely challenging"" for farming, warning the thunderstorms and showers some areas are receiving ""won't mitigate the many issues farmers are experiencing"". She said: ""There could be serious concerns for many farmers if this extended spell of warmer, drier weather continues as the long-range forecast suggests."" The EA said it has responded to 44 ""significant"" environmental incidents since the end of June, including moorland fires, algal blooms, dry boreholes, low river flows and fish rescues. The last month of dry, hot weather followed the driest June since 1925, according to the EA. It has caused the water level in many reservoirs to fall dramatically.

"An estimated 3,000 polar bears enjoy Svalbard's icy climes A polar bear has been shot dead after it attacked a cruise ship guard on Norway's Svalbard archipelago, within the Arctic Circle. The guard suffered non-life-threatening head injuries and is said to be in a stable condition. He was assigned to protect tourists who had landed on Svalbard's northernmost island from the MS Bremen, which is operated by Hapag-Lloyd Cruises. The German cruise company said a second guard shot the bear ""in self-defence"". The injured man was airlifted to hospital in the town of Longyearbyen, on Spitsbergen island. Polar bear mauls Canadian father to death Polar bears 'running out of food' Svalbard is a wilderness of glaciers and ice caps that lies between Norway and the North Pole. An estimated 60% of it is covered with ice, and its 3,000 polar bears are said to outnumber the human population. Cruise company Hapag-Lloyd said the bear was shot in ""self-defence"" All ships in the area are obliged to employ bear guards to protect passengers on sightseeing tours. ""There are very strict rules here as the islands are visited by many polar bears in the summer, so we all need to be vigilant when we are ashore,"" one guide wrote in a post on Hapag-Lloyd's website. Critics online, including British comedian Ricky Gervais, blamed the attack on human intrusion into polar bear territories. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The Qatar World Cup will take place from 21 Nov to 18 Dec 2022 The Qatar 2022 World Cup bid team ran a secret campaign in 2010 to sabotage competing host bids, according to a report published by the Sunday Times. The paperclaims to have seen,externalleaked documents that show the Qatari bid team employed a US PR firm and ex-CIA agents to smear its rivals - mainly the United States and Australia. The alleged aim was to create propaganda to give the impression that a World Cup would not be supported domestically. The Qatar tournament organisers deny the allegations. Such a campaign alleged by the Sunday Times would have broken Fifa's bidding rules. Qatar beat rival bids from the United States, Australia, South Korea and Japan to the right to host the 2022 World Cup. Fifa's rules say World Cup bidders should not make ""any written or oral statements of any kind, whether adverse or otherwise, about the bids or candidatures of any other member association"". The Qatar bid team has been previously accused of corruption,but was cleared following a two-year Fifa inquiry. A respected academic was paid $9,000 to write a negative report on the huge economic cost of an American World Cup, which was then distributed to news media around the world. Journalists, bloggers and high-profile figures were recruited in each country to hype up negative aspects of their respective bids. A group of American physical education teachers were recruited to ask their US Congressmen to oppose a US World Cup on the grounds that the money would be better used on high school sports. Grassroots protests were organised at rugby games in Australia opposing the country's bid. Intelligence reports were compiled on individuals involved in rival bids. The documents seen by the Sunday Times - which the paper says were leaked by a whistleblower who worked on the 2022 bid team - were apparently unavailable during the Fifa inquiry. The Qatar bid team is alleged to have employed the New York office of communications company Brown Lloyd Jones, which is now BLJ Worldwide, along with a team of former intelligence officers to run a campaign aimed at undermining one of Fifa's key criteria in the bidding process - that each bid should have strong backing at home. In a statement Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy said it ""rejects each and every allegation put forward by the Sunday Times"". ""We have been thoroughly investigated and have been forthcoming with all information related to our bid, including the official investigation led by US attorney Michael Garcia,"" it said. ""We have strictly adhered to all FIFA's rules and regulations for the 2018/2022 World Cup bidding process."" A Fifa statement said ""a thorough investigation was conducted by Michael Garcia and his conclusions are available in the report"", referring to the completed two-year inquiry. BLJ Worldwide did not respond to a request for comment from The Sunday Times. Qatar won the right to stage the tournament in December 2010. Russia was awarded the 2018 World Cup at the same time, beating three other bids including England. Dan Roan, BBC's Sports Editor Once again, Qatar's hosting of the 2022 World Cup is mired in controversy. Ever since its shock win in the race to stage the event eight years ago, the country has faced questions over how it triumphed, its winter scheduling, and the human cost of building the infrastructure required. So what will these latest allegations mean? On the one hand, we do not yet know the explanations of those named in the documents obtained by the Sunday Times. The allegations relate to events several years ago, and some will point out that Qatar's is hardly the first bid suspected of using private intelligence and covert tactics. Indeed it has been claimed England's 2018 bid spied on its rivals. Crucially, Qatar was cleared of corruption by Fifa's two-year long investigation, headed up by American lawyer Michael Garcia. However, there is bound to be speculation that if this is found to be a breach of the rules, linked directly to the bid team, and that Garcia was not aware of this new information, then it could increase the risk of Qatar being sensationally stripped of the event. With the tournament now just four years away and tens of billions of pounds already spent on preparations, that remains unlikely. Fifa would be worried about the threat of being sued if it took such action. However, its new leadership has vowed to regain trust after the years of scandal, so perhaps it will feel it has no choice but to launch a fresh investigation. Qatar is embroiled in a diplomatic dispute with some of its neighbours, which perhaps explains the timing of this leak. And with Fifa President Gianni Infantino known to be keen on a 48-team 2022 World Cup, this could lead to fresh pressure being applied on Qatar to agree, and to share their tournament with other countries in the region. But less than two weeks after Fifa hailed Russia's World Cup, it has not taken long for the governing body - and its next host - to face yet more scrutiny.

"The 2011 Tohoku earthquake was initially estimated to be 7.9 magnitude Researchers have developed a new approach to estimate the true size of very large earthquakes. At present, scientists use seismic waves from a rupture to work out the scale of the event. But a new analysis of the Tohoku earthquake in Japan in 2011 shows that changes in gravity can give more rapid information. This method could have accurately estimated that magnitude 9 tremor in minutes, not the hours actually taken. As Japan'slargest recorded earthquake, the Tohoku event is probably best remembered for the huge tsunami it unleashed. As well as killing around 12,000 people it triggered the meltdown of three nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant. The 330-tonne trawler Kyotomaru was swept 500 metres inland by the tsunami in 2011 Experts believe that the quake was caused by the rupture of a stretch of the subduction zone associated with the Japan Trench, which separates the Eurasian Plate from the downward-sliding Pacific Plate. Initial estimates of magnitude by Japan'smeteorological agency,externalindicated it was a 7.9 tremor.  Three hours later, this was corrected to 8.8. Eventually the Tohoku quake was upgraded to 9.1 magnitude. These estimates are based on seismic waves generated by the earthquake which travel through the Earth and are recorded on seismometers all over the world. Scientists look for what are termedP-waves,externalas the fastest way to deduce what is happening in an event. These travel at around 7-8km per second. However, French researchers have been looking at the possibility of using small shifts in gravity to estimate scale. Large tremors can cause perturbations in the Earth's gravitational field - and as these signals travel at the speed of light, they open up the possibility of much more rapid detection of quake magnitude. Up to now, gravitational signals have been difficult to detect above the seismic noise, but the French research team developed their model to analyse the Tohoku event using data recorded with broadband seismometers located some 1,000 to 2,000km from the quake. ""As soon as you have the location and origin time of the earthquake, you know when the seismic waves will arrive at good quality stations inland,"" said lead author Dr Martin VallÃ©e, from theParis Institute of Earth Physics,external. A map showing the intensity of shaking due to the 2011 quake ""And if you look to see a gravity signal before the arrival time of the seismic waves, if you can see this, it really means you have a large event. If you cannot see it you will be in a magnitude 8.5 or below."" According to the authors, this method of analysis would have reliably detected that the Tohoku quake was greater than magnitude 9 within three minutes of the origin time. This could have had major implications especially for the tsunami that followed it. ""Knowing that a quake is very large a few minutes after is not very useful for the areas that are directly affected because the seismic waves will already have affected the area,"" said Dr VallÃ©e. ""But it is for the tsunamis which often arrive half an hour after an earthquake, they are much slower than the seismic waves, and here you have some time to react. It is very useful."" At present, the research team say that the ideal places to test the method are in locations that have had an earthquake greater than magnitude 9 in recent centuries, such as the Cascadia region of the US and Canada. Looking ahead, the scientists believe that with refinement, their method of analysing gravity signals could allow more rapid detection of the size of smaller events. ""It will be really important if in the future we have instruments that can measure the signal and are more sensitive,"" said Dr VallÃ©e. ""We will be able to apply the same analysis to smaller earthquakes, and when I say smaller I mean magnitude 7 or 8 which in fact are very large and can destroy a lot."" Thestudy has been published,externalin the journal, Science. by Jonathan Amos, BBC Science Correspondent It's not possible to predict earthquakes but it is possible to issue alerts once a major event is under way. And for those not living directly above the point of rupture, but some distance away, such warnings can give people vital seconds to prepare. These systems - they have them in places like Japan and Mexico - work on the basis of detecting the different arrival times of seismic waves. So-called P-waves are less destructive vibrations that run ahead of the far stronger and more damaging S-waves. But neither move as swiftly as the changes that become apparent in the gravity field once a quake has moved a great mass of rock inside the Earth. If you could practically harness this signal in an early warning system then it could provide just a few seconds more grace for the surgeon to lift their scalpel away from a patient's organ or for the driver of a packed commuter train to slow down. However the gravity signal is very subtle and it will be challenging to make use of it in all but the very largest events. On average there is only about one ""great quake"" of magnitude 8 or higher a year. But there is hope the technologies can be improved. This new research came out of discussions surrounding the detection of gravitational waves from black hole mergers in space. That technique had its doubters for a long while but eventually proved its worth. Even if a gravity signal cannot be woven into an early warning system, just knowing the true scale of a quake much faster will be important information for first responders.

"The Qatar World Cup will take place from 21 Nov to 18 Dec 2022 The Qatar 2022 World Cup bid team ran a secret campaign in 2010 to sabotage competing host bids, according to a report published by the Sunday Times. The paperclaims to have seen,externalleaked documents that show the Qatari bid team employed a US PR firm and ex-CIA agents to smear its rivals - mainly the United States and Australia. The alleged aim was to create propaganda to give the impression that a World Cup would not be supported domestically. The Qatar tournament organisers deny the allegations. Such a campaign alleged by the Sunday Times would have broken Fifa's bidding rules. Qatar beat rival bids from the United States, Australia, South Korea and Japan to the right to host the 2022 World Cup. Fifa's rules say World Cup bidders should not make ""any written or oral statements of any kind, whether adverse or otherwise, about the bids or candidatures of any other member association"". The Qatar bid team has been previously accused of corruption,but was cleared following a two-year Fifa inquiry. A respected academic was paid $9,000 to write a negative report on the huge economic cost of an American World Cup, which was then distributed to news media around the world. Journalists, bloggers and high-profile figures were recruited in each country to hype up negative aspects of their respective bids. A group of American physical education teachers were recruited to ask their US Congressmen to oppose a US World Cup on the grounds that the money would be better used on high school sports. Grassroots protests were organised at rugby games in Australia opposing the country's bid. Intelligence reports were compiled on individuals involved in rival bids. The documents seen by the Sunday Times - which the paper says were leaked by a whistleblower who worked on the 2022 bid team - were apparently unavailable during the Fifa inquiry. The Qatar bid team is alleged to have employed the New York office of communications company Brown Lloyd Jones, which is now BLJ Worldwide, along with a team of former intelligence officers to run a campaign aimed at undermining one of Fifa's key criteria in the bidding process - that each bid should have strong backing at home. In a statement Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy said it ""rejects each and every allegation put forward by the Sunday Times"". ""We have been thoroughly investigated and have been forthcoming with all information related to our bid, including the official investigation led by US attorney Michael Garcia,"" it said. ""We have strictly adhered to all FIFA's rules and regulations for the 2018/2022 World Cup bidding process."" A Fifa statement said ""a thorough investigation was conducted by Michael Garcia and his conclusions are available in the report"", referring to the completed two-year inquiry. BLJ Worldwide did not respond to a request for comment from The Sunday Times. Qatar won the right to stage the tournament in December 2010. Russia was awarded the 2018 World Cup at the same time, beating three other bids including England. Dan Roan, BBC's Sports Editor Once again, Qatar's hosting of the 2022 World Cup is mired in controversy. Ever since its shock win in the race to stage the event eight years ago, the country has faced questions over how it triumphed, its winter scheduling, and the human cost of building the infrastructure required. So what will these latest allegations mean? On the one hand, we do not yet know the explanations of those named in the documents obtained by the Sunday Times. The allegations relate to events several years ago, and some will point out that Qatar's is hardly the first bid suspected of using private intelligence and covert tactics. Indeed it has been claimed England's 2018 bid spied on its rivals. Crucially, Qatar was cleared of corruption by Fifa's two-year long investigation, headed up by American lawyer Michael Garcia. However, there is bound to be speculation that if this is found to be a breach of the rules, linked directly to the bid team, and that Garcia was not aware of this new information, then it could increase the risk of Qatar being sensationally stripped of the event. With the tournament now just four years away and tens of billions of pounds already spent on preparations, that remains unlikely. Fifa would be worried about the threat of being sued if it took such action. However, its new leadership has vowed to regain trust after the years of scandal, so perhaps it will feel it has no choice but to launch a fresh investigation. Qatar is embroiled in a diplomatic dispute with some of its neighbours, which perhaps explains the timing of this leak. And with Fifa President Gianni Infantino known to be keen on a 48-team 2022 World Cup, this could lead to fresh pressure being applied on Qatar to agree, and to share their tournament with other countries in the region. But less than two weeks after Fifa hailed Russia's World Cup, it has not taken long for the governing body - and its next host - to face yet more scrutiny.

"Diane Abbott and Boris Johnson both received high levels of online abuse during the 2017 election Online trolls who intimidate election candidates or campaigners could be barred from public office under government proposals being considered. Extreme intimidation cases are already punishable with a jail sentence. A 2017 parliamentary report,externalhighlighted the ""significant factor"" of social media abuse of candidates in that year's general election. Constitution Minister Chloe Smith said intimidation was putting ""talented people"" off standing for election. She added that the measures being consulted on would ""protect voters, candidates and campaigners so they can make their choice at the ballot box or stand for public service without fear of being victims of misinformation or abuse"". The length of the ban on convicted abusers standing for or holding public office would be a part of the consultation, a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said. MPs call for misogyny to be hate crime MPs 'being advised to quit Twitter' Outlaw online abuse, Katie Price tells MPs A joint analysis of tweets in the run-up to the election in 2017, by the University of Sheffield and BuzzFeed News.,externalfound that male Conservative candidates received the highest percentage of abuse on Twitter. Amnesty International had carried out a separate analysis of,externalthe accounts of 177 female MPs in the six months leading up to the election and found that Labour's Diane Abbott received almost half (45.1%) of all abusive tweets that were sent to female MPs. By BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth In reality this may not prevent swathes of people from standing for office who otherwise would have. There are existing rules which stop those convicted of crimes carrying a certain sentence from standing as an MP or local councillor. In addition, the vetting processes of political parties should - in theory at least - stop unsuitable candidates from being selected. But there has been pressure for ministers to do something to tackle online trolls who target people in public office. After last year's general Election, several MPs reported some of the worst abuse and harassment that they'd experienced. There was even a debate in Parliament during which men and women from all political parties recounted their experience of sexist and racist comments, graphic language and even death threats. No doubt the government is keen to be seen to be taking this seriously. Currently, to stand in a general election, you must be at least 18 years old and either a British citizen, a citizen of the Republic of Ireland or an eligible Commonwealth citizen. Certain people are disqualified from becoming an MP including: civil servants members of police forces members of the armed forces judges a person who has been convicted of an offence and has been detained for more than a year peers who can sit in the House of Lords bishops of the Church of England who are entitled to sit in the House of Lords someone currently subject to a bankruptcy restrictions order MPs call for misogyny to be hate crime MPs 'being advised to quit Twitter' Outlaw online abuse, Katie Price tells MPs LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"An extra Â£2m of funding will be used to tackle problems which cause Scottish mothers to stop breastfeeding Funding to encourage more mothers in Scotland to breastfeed for longer is to be almost doubled. The Scottish government has announced an extra Â£2m investment. Figures show that over the last year 63% of babies had been breastfed at some point, but the rate dropped to 41% at six weeks. The cash boost, ahead of World Breastfeeding Week, will go to health boards to tackle problems which see some mothers stop breastfeeding. An NHS report published last year said breastfeeding rates were low in Scotland when compared with other countries worldwide. The Scottish government said it is already working to reduce the drop-off rate for breastfeeding by the time babies are six to eight weeks old by 10% by 2025. More older babies are fed by bottle The latest figures show 63% of babies born in Scotland in 2016-17 had been breastfed at some point, with 41% still being breastfed at six to eight weeks. Ministers already provide Â£2.3m a year to NHS boards to support breastfeeding - with the World Health Organisation saying this gives babies the best nutritional start, and can also improve the long-term health of mothers and their children. Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick said: ""Breastfeeding has many long and short-term health benefits for both the mother and the child but we know that for some mums and babies breastfeeding can be challenging. ""It is vital that mums are well supported throughout their time breastfeeding, especially where they may be experiencing difficulties, and this additional funding will help with some of the common issues they may face early on.

"Dragoslav Ognjanovic served on the legal team for Mr Milosevic during his trial at The Hague A prominent lawyer who helped defend the former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic at his war crimes trial has been shot dead. Dragoslav Ognjanovic, 57, was killed on Saturday evening outside his apartment building in the capital, Belgrade. His 26-year-old son was also wounded in the shooting, the interior ministry said in a statement. Mr Ognjanovic served on the legal team for Mr Milosevic during his trial at The Hague in the early 2000s. The former president of Serbia was arrested in 2001 and held at the UN war crimes tribunal for genocide and other war crimes. But he was found dead in his cell in 2006,externalbefore his trial could be completed. Notorious leader Milosevic revived in show One man's hunt for his brothers' killers Serbia country profile He was facing three indictments relating to atrocities carried out in Kosovo, another for crimes in Croatia, and the third alleging genocide in Bosnia between 1992 and 1995. In a statement, the head of the Bar Association in Belgrade said the shooting of Mr Ognjanovic was an attack on all lawyers. ""[We will] exert maximum pressure on the competent state authorities in order to find the perpetrators of this crime,"" Viktor Gostiljac said. Milosevic was found dead in his cell before his trial for genocide had been completed Mr Ognjanovic also served as a defence lawyer in several high-profile mafia cases in Serbia and Montenegro. A number of prominent members of Serbian and Montenegrin organised crime networks have been killed in Belgrade in recent years.

"This video can not be played Damian Collins, the committee's chairman, says ""sophisticated"" fake news is causing a ""crisis for democracy"" The volume of disinformation on the internet is growing so big that it is starting to crowd out real news, the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee chairman has said. Tory MP Damian Collins said people struggle to identify ""fake news"". MPsin their committee report,externalsaid the issue threatens democracy and called for tougher social network regulation. The government said it plans to introduce a requirement for electoral adverts to have a ""digital imprint"". This would mean that all political communications carried online would need to clearly identify who they were published by. Labour said the government ""needs to wake up to the new challenges we face and finally update electoral laws"". The report follows the Cambridge Analytica data scandal earlier this year. The London-based data analytics firms and tech giant Facebook were at the centre of a dispute over the harvesting and use of personal data - and whether it was used to influence the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election or the UK Brexit referendum. Both firms deny any wrongdoing. Arron Banks, the businessman who was the chief backer of the unofficial Leave.EU campaign, donating millions of pounds, was criticised for misleading the committee about his business dealings with Russia and for failing to demonstrate the source of the money. Vote Leave broke electoral law, says Electoral Commission Vote Leave's targeted adverts revealed Cambridge Analytica 'planted fake news' The not so brief history of fake news Cambridge Analytica: The story so far MPs also considered evidence from around the world of how elections could be manipulated and heard how Russian agencies worked to influence votes by running adverts on Facebook. Mr Collins told the BBC this had happened without the knowledge of the social network. ""That's why we feel that this is now a threat to our democracy,"" he said. ""If these tools that are so powerful, that can reach millions and millions of people all around the world at the touch of a button, if they can be effectively used to spread disinformation without the source of that information ever being revealed, as appears to be the case here, then that is a threat we have to confront."" He made clear the term ""fake news"" as used by figures like US President Donald Trump is different to the ""concerted campaigns of disinformation"" in which people or agencies deliberately spread false stories. This video can not be played A brief history of fake news New laws must be introduced to clamp down on the ""wild west"" social media world, their report said. The committee also repeated its call for Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg to give evidence. Facebook said it shared the committee's goal of making political advertising more fair and transparent. It said it was working on ways to authenticate and label these type of adverts in the UK. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been asked to give evidence to the committee The committee concluded that Arron Banks had misled them about his meetings with the Russian Embassy and had walked out of an evidence session to avoid scrutiny on the topic. It said that it was ""unclear"" where he had obtained the money for his donation to the leave campaign, and he had failed to demonstrate that it came from within the UK. Mr Banks ""seemed to want to hide the extent of his contacts with Russia"", which had discussed potential gold and diamond deals with him, and his spokesman Andy Wigmore was ""a self-confessed liar"", the committee said. Mr Collins said: ""If it turned out to be the case that he profited from these relationships with the Russian people he was meeting and discussing business deals with, and he used that money to invest in the Brexit campaign, then I think that would be a really serious matter."" The Information Commissioner's Office is also investigating whether the Leave.EU campaign, which Mr Banks co-founded, misused customer data from his insurance company for political purposes. Mr Banks has said that the funding for his donation came from his personal wealth and has described the information commissioner's investigation as ""a politically motivated attack"". Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie and the firm's former chief executive, Alexander Nix, were among the 61 witnesses who did give evidence. A copy of the report was leaked on Friday,externalby Dominic Cummings, the director of the official Brexit campaign group Vote Leave, who published it on his own blog. Mr Cummingswas askedand officially summoned to take part in the inquiry - to respond to allegations made against the Vote Leave campaign - but he refused. Mr Cummings called the report ""fake news"". The report said people were increasingly finding out about what is happening in the country, local communities and the world through social media - rather than through traditional forms of communication such as television, print media or the radio. People were also less likely to question information shared on social media because most trust their friends and family. The MPs said this is where malicious actors come in to try to influence the billions of people who use social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. Fake news can come in a wide spectrum of forms, from satire and parody to fabricated images or propaganda, the report said. The report made a series of recommendations. It said: Electoral law needs to be updated to reflect the modern world A new tax on social networks could pay for digital literacy programmes in schools The Electoral Commission should set up a code for political advertising on social media There should be greater transparency around online advertising There should be a ""digital Atlantic charter"" to protect personal information and rights Mr Collins said: ""Data crimes are real crimes, with real victims. This is a watershed moment in terms of people realising they themselves are the product, not just the user of a free service. ""Their rights over their data must be protected."" Labour's shadow secretary for digital, culture, media and sport, Tom Watson, said Britain's electoral laws needed updating ""for the modern campaigning environment"". ""Labour called for increased powers for the Electoral Commission during the passage of the Data Protection Bill on digital imprints, the disclosure of funding sources and settings for targeted adverts and increasing the commission's investigatory powers. ""These calls were rejected by the Conservatives,"" he said. Meanwhile, the Electoral Commission welcomed the committee's report and said it backs calls to modernise electoral law. A spokeswoman said: ""The government takes disinformation very seriously, as with all types of online manipulation and internet harms. ""That is why we have said we will come forward with new online safety laws to make sure the UK is the safest place to be online. ""We note the committee's report and will consider its final recommendations"" The government is expected to publish a white paper later this year on proposals to reform laws to make the internet and social media safer. The committee's final report is expected before the end of the year.

"Blue badge parking permits are to be made available for people in England with ""hidden disabilities"" such as autism or mental health problems. The Department for Transport said people with non-physical disabilities would have an equal right to free parking from next year. Currently the rules do not explicitly exclude hidden disabilities, but councils' interpretations can vary. Similar changes have come into effect in Scotland and Wales. When the changes to the blue badge scheme in England are introduced, they will extend eligibility to: people who cannot make a journey without ""a risk of serious harm to their health and safety"" or that of others, such as young children with autism people for whom travel causes ""very considerable psychological distress"" and those with considerable difficulty walking, meaning ""both the physical act and experience of walking"" About 2.4 million disabled people in England currently have a blue badge. The scheme, first introduced in 1970 to make access easier for disabled people, costs Â£10. It allow holders to park for free in pay-and-display spaces across the UK and for up to three hours on yellow lines. The blue badge concessions do not apply to privately-run car parks. They also can not be used in central London, where residents need to apply for a special permit, although they do provide an exemption from the congestion charge. Thousands share experience of invisible disabilities Transport Minister Jesse Norman said: ""Blue badges are a lifeline for disabled people, giving them the freedom and confidence to get to work and visit friends independently."" The change follows aconsultation,externallaunched in January which saw 6,000 responses. Three in four disabled people say they would go out less often without the parking permit, the DfT said. Jane Harris, director of external affairs at the National Autistic Society, said the change would ""make a massive difference to the lives of many of the 600,000 autistic people in England, and their families"". Many autistic people experience major challenges in travelling, making detailed preparations and suffering ""overwhelming anxiety"" about things going wrong, she said. She said that some can be unaware of the dangers of the road while others can feel panic in busy or loud environments. Siobhan Fairclough said her autistic daughter Jenny found walking through crowded places hard. Siobhan Fairclough, from Edgware in north London, said she had been refused a blue badge for her daughter Jenny, 21, who is autistic with learning disabilities and rheumatoid arthritis. She welcomed the change. ""We wouldn't have to worry,"" she said. ""When we're walking and there are too many people around, she gets overwhelmed and it's likely to cause a meltdown."" People with other disabilities and their carers also said easier parking would have a significant impact on their lives. Jenette Kingsbury in south Norfolk said her husband, who has 50% vision loss, auditory processing issues and cancer of the bone marrow, had been rejected for a blue badge because he is physically mobile. But she said his disabilities put him at risk in traffic and she hoped he would benefit from the rule change. ""Just small things make big differences when every day poses a challenge,"" she said. Scotland and Wales have already changed their eligibility criteria for the Blue badge scheme to include some mental impairments, where people cannot follow the route of a journey without assistance, but the rules are yet to be altered in Northern Ireland.

Minnie the shih tzu was in Oliver Clough's parked vehicle while the farrier was working in Hatfield, South Yorkshire in June 2016. A thief jumped in the truck and drove off. It was found two weeks later on an estate, but Minnie had gone. Mr Clough's partner Carrie Ryan said she was in ""floods of tears"" when told Minnie had been found alive. The dog was eventually tracked down in a village just over six miles away.

The post was shared more than 7,000 times on Facebook. Ms Ryan said: ""The months passed and then the years passed and you try not to lose hope, but not knowing is torture.

"Mary Ellis was a pioneering woman pilot of the Air Transport Auxiliary Mary Ellis blazed a trail for female aviators, as one of the first women to fly Spitfires, heavy bombers and jet aircraft. She was a member of the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA), which employed civilians to deliver planes from factories to airfields during the Second World War. However, her contribution to the war effort was not always appreciated. At one RAF base, the ground crew refused to believe she was the pilot of the Wellington bomber she had just landed. ""They actually went inside the aeroplane and searched it,"" she recalled. ""Everybody was flabbergasted that a little girl like me could fly these big aeroplanes all by oneself."" Mary Ellis died on Tuesday at the age of 101. Born Mary Wilkins to a farming family in Leafield, Oxfordshire, she grew up close to RAF bases at Bicester and Port Meadow. ""I was interested in aeroplanes from almost the year dot,"" she said. As a child, her father paid a flying circus to take her on a pleasure flight in a de Havilland 60 Moth. ""I think that sealed my fate forever,"" she later recalled. Her teenage ""passion for the skies"" led to flying lessons at Witney airfield. When war broke out, a flying licence and that experience made her a suitable candidate for the ATA, which allowed qualified women to join as pilots from 1940. Mary Ellis joined the ATA in 1941 after hearing an advertisement on BBC radio This video can not be played Mary Ellis said she had flown ""about 1,000 aeroplanes"" during the war The idea had a mixed reception. The Aeroplane magazine fumed in a 1940 editorial: ""Women anxious to serve their country should take on work more befitting their sex instead of encroaching on a man's occupation."" Another editor wrote: ""The menace is the woman who thinks that she ought to be flying in a high-speed bomber when she really has not the intelligence to scrub the floor of a hospital properly."" ""Girls flying aeroplanes was almost a sin at that time,"" Mary Ellis later recalled. Against this background and despite her mother's misgivings, she applied to the ATA after hearing an advertisement on BBC radio and was ""readily accepted"" in 1941. The first ATA women had a mixed reception in the media She was soon flying ""fast and furious aeroplanes and bombers all over the country"", as aircraft production and casualties rose. The work was ""exhilarating and sometimes very dangerous"", she recalled. Pilots often flew unfamiliar aircraft, guided by the ""Ferry Pilots notes"", which gave landing instructions. ""We'd say to each other, 'Oh look what I've got, look what I've got'. And that was terribly exciting. Sometimes frightening as well because the aeroplanes were all different. You'd get out of a Tiger Moth into a Wellington bomber and then into a Spitfire."" Based at an all-women's ATA pool in Hamble, Hampshire, she recalled that she flew ""about 1,000"" aircraft during the war including 76 different types. Mary Ellis said the women ""proved that we could handle aeroplanes and do the job that we were supposed to do."" Mary Ellis came close to death on several occasions. She was shot at over Bournemouth, possibly by friendly fire, and had a near-miss as she landed in fog at the same time as another Spitfire coming in the opposite direction. She also survived a crash-landing when the undercarriage on her Spitfire jammed, causing the engine to overheat. ""I just knew that I had to do something before the engine blew up. One didn't get excited or anything else. It's just a part of the job of coping with an aeroplane."" Nearly one in 10 of the ATA's 168 female members were killed during the war, including aviation pioneer Amy Johnson. Mary's friend Dora Lang died in a crash in 1944. ""I missed her terribly"", she recalled. ""And for two days I was not allowed to fly - I didn't want to. But after that one realised, well, there is a war on, we must get on with our jobs. And we did."" Mrs Ellis recalled flying ""about 1,000 aeroplanes"" during the war The ATA's founder, Pauline Gower, had joked the organisation's acronym could stand for ""Always Terrified Airwomen"". But Mary said the women ""proved that we could handle aeroplanes and do the job that we were supposed to do."" They were also able to enjoy an active social life. ""We had lots of boyfriends. Because at that time we were called the 'glamour girls' - I don't know why. But there were always plenty of escorts around."" Mary Ellis said the Spitfire was ""everybody's favourite"" aircraft When the ATA was disbanded in 1945, Mary Wilkins was seconded to the RAF, where she became one of the first women to fly Britain's first jet fighter, the Gloster Meteor. She went on to become manager of Sandown Airport on the Isle of Wight in the 1950s and 1960s, hiring a former ATA colleague, Vera Strodl, as chief flying instructor. A correspondent for Flight Magazine, visiting the airport in 1951, described it as a ""woman pilots' Utopia"", whose ""extra quota of feminine charm... has had no disturbing effect on the enthusiasm of club members."" Away from the airport, she indulged a love of fast cars, entering and winning sports car rallies, and ran a fashion boutique. ""She is the most glamorous person I know,"" her niece Rosemarie Martin recalled before Mary's death. ""She enjoys fashion and always wears nail polish. Very strong on etiquette - the right china, the right cutlery, your manners, she could write a book on that."" At the age of 101, Mary Ellis was still driving daily to local shops Mary married Don Ellis, a fellow pilot, in 1961, and began to host ""legendary parties"", Ms Martin said. She continued to live in the marital home beside the runway at Sandown after his death in 2009. At the age of 101, she was still driving daily to local shops. In November 2016, she and fellowATA pilot Joy Lofthousewere honoured in front of members of the Royal Family at the annual Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall in London. ""Being an ATA pilot was fantastic,"" Mary Ellis recalled. ""Up in the air on your own. And you can do whatever you like. I flew 400 Spitfires. And occasionally I would take one up and go and play with the clouds. ""I would like to do it all over again. There was a war on but otherwise it was absolutely wonderful.""
