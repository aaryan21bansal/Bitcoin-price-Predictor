"This video can not be played Audio of a 999 call made by trapped father Marcio Gomes. Warning: this recording includes audio that may cause distress. A father trapped with his family in Grenfell Tower was told ""don't give up"" by a 999 call operator as they tried to escape the blaze. Marcio Gomes, his heavily-pregnant wife Andreia, and the couple's two daughters, escaped from their flat, which was on the 21st floor. But their unborn son Logan was stillborn in hospital after the fire. An audio clip of the family's 999 call - as they struggled to breathe and lost each other - was played on Friday. The recordingwas heard by the public inquiry,externalinto the Grenfell Tower fire, which began on 14 June 2017 and killed 72 people. In the 999 call - which was made at around 03:25 GMT - the call handler guides Mr Gomes and his family out of their flat and into the smoke-filled stairwell. She tells Mr Gomes to wrap himself and his family in wet towels and to hold hands. ""Well done, you're doing really, really well,"" she says, adding: ""Don't give up now."" Marcio Gomes escaped the fire with his wife, Andreia, and two daughters - but his unborn baby died Mr Gomes can be heard telling his family to ""keep going"" and pleading with his daughters: ""Girls, come on, it's better down here, come on."" He adds: ""Girls, listen to my voice, come on. Even if you have to crawl down, crawl down."" 'Impossible decision' over Grenfell father 'I wish I had strength to help more in fire' Grenfell Tower inquiry podcast: Family flees 21st floor During the call Mr Gomes said he cannot find his wife - who was seven months pregnant - and his daughters, who had been beside him. ""I can't leave them,"" he can be heard saying. ""They're not here, I don't know where they are."" As he goes back up the tower to find them he says: ""Oh please, please God. Take me, not my girls."" Marcio and Andreia Gomes lost their unborn child, who they had already named Logan During the call, the 999 operator says: ""Be proud of yourself, be so proud. I tell you, anyone would like a dad like you, anybody."" Giving evidence on Friday, Mr Gomes recalled stepping over bodies, fearing they were his family. ""I tripped... I tripped up on some,"" he said. ""So I started thinking that... that the bodies that I stepped over was my wife and my daughter."" The family made it out of the tower but baby Logan was stillborn and delivered by Caesarean section in King's College Hospital while Andreia was in an induced coma. The inquiry heard Mrs Gomes is now pregnant again. The public inquiry is in its first phase and is hearing evidence from survivors of the fire and those who lost loved ones.

"This video can not be played Trump says Florida vote count 'dishonest' President Donald Trump has lambasted Florida's election recount process, calling it an attempt by Democrats to win a US Senate seat with fake votes. Mr Trump told reporters ""there's a lot of dishonesty"" over contested votes in Broward County. However, there has been no evidence of voter fraud. The gap between the two candidates - Republican Rick Scott and Democrat Bill Nelson - narrowed to 0.2% as of Friday as Broward County votes were counted. Both candidates are suing the state. Mr Scott, who claimed victory on Tuesday, is suing officials over an election recount, while Mr Nelson is suing over uncounted ballots. The county, which is part of the greater Miami metropolitan area, is known to be a Democratic region of the Republican-leaning state. Florida senate race recount triggered US mid-terms: When voting goes wrong ""Rick Scott was up by 50,000+ votes on Election Day, now they 'found' many votes and he is only up 15,000 votes,"" Mr Trump tweeted on Friday. ""How come they never find Republican votes?"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tara McKelvey, BBC News White HouseReporter Trump wanted to talk. With Marine One waiting for him on the lawn, he headed over to a spot near the White House where I was standing - along with my colleagues. The president was - as one reporter near me said - ""on fire"". When another journalist asked about the Florida race, Trump lit into the subject, telling us about ""bad things"" that have gone on in Broward County, Florida, the place where votes are being counted in a Senate race between Republican Rick Scott and Democrat Bill Nelson. Earlier Scott said he'd won. Now the electoral gap's narrowing, and the president is not pleased. There's a history behind Florida recounts, though, one that the president didn't mention. In 2000, George W Bush and Al Gore faced an epic impasse - with lawyers. Then Bush became president, while Democrats steamed. Today the president acted as if that'd never happened. For some Democrats, though, the wound's still there. For them, the president's tone about a disputed Florida race is hard to take. Republican Senate candidate Rick Scott had initially claimed a victory on Tuesday night Before leaving for Paris to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of WWI on Friday, Mr Trump told reporters he believes Mr Scott clearly won the election. He said that local election supervisor Brenda Snipes, a Democrat, has a ""horrible history"" and is ""finding votes out of nowhere"". The president's comments followed the news of Mr Scott's lawsuit against Ms Snipes and another Democrat, Palm Beach Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher. His lawsuit, announced on Thursday night, claims the election officials did not provide enough information and transparency around uncounted ballots. ""I will not stand idly by while unethical liberals try to steal an election,"" Mr Scott said during a news conference. ""Tonight I am asking the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate this immediately and I am considering every single legal option available."" Mr Trump said on Friday he would send his lawyers to Florida ""to expose the fraud"", calling the Nelson campaign's recount lawyer Marc Elias an election stealer. Allow Twitter content?

Senator Nelson filed his own lawsuit on Friday against the Florida secretary of state in order to ensure all provisional and mail-in ballots that were initially disregarded due to signature mismatches are validated in the recount.

"Most plug-in hybrids in the UK are bought for company fleets Tens of thousands of plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) bought with generous government grants may be burning as much fuel as combustion-engine cars. âData compiled for the BBC suggests that such vehicles in corporate fleets averaged just 40 miles per gallon (mpg), when they could have done 130. Many drivers may never have unwrapped their charging cables, The Miles Consultancy said. Subsidies for new PHEVs were recently scrapped, after seven years. The plug-in grant was introduced in 2011, gifting buyers up to Â£4,500 off new cars. The incentive helped the UK become the biggest market for PHEVs in Europe. The majority of the tens of thousands of eligible vehicles sold were bought by company fleets, including more than 70% of the 37,000 plug-in hybrids sold so far in 2018. But data from The Miles Consultancy, a Cheshire firm which advises 300 blue-chip companies on fuel management, reveals that many businesses simply used the grant to save on buying regular cars. When regularly charged, PHEVs can achieve more than 130 miles per gallon Mileage records from 1,500 models, including Audi, BMW, Mercedes and Volvo vehicles, showed an average real-world mpg of 39.27, against an average manufacturer advertised mpg of 129.68. Figures for 2,432 hybrids - including non plug-in varieties - showed an average real-world mpg of 49.06, still vastly lower than the potential range. ""There are some examples where employees aren't even charging these vehicles up,"" said Paul Hollick, The Miles Consultancy's managing director. ""The charge cables are still in the boot, in a cellophane wrapper, while the company and the employee are going in and out of petrol stations, paying for all of this additional fuel. This practice, he added, was ""ridiculous"". The UK government subsidised plug in hybrids for seven years The British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA), which represents many fleets, said higher taxes on diesel cars incentivised companies to buy plug-ins, even if they had no intention of using their electric capability. ""We unfortunately have got a situation where a poorly designed tax regime is driving some poor behaviours,"" said Toby Poston, âthe BVRLA's communications director. ""We have got some situations where company drivers are choosing the vehicle based on their tax liability, rather than having the right vehicle for the right job."" Some companies, he explained, were buying PHEVs - which are best suited to local trips - for employees who did a lot of motorway driving. When presented with The Miles Consultancy's findings, a Department for Transport spokesperson said the government believed plug-in hybrids ""bring significant environmental benefits"", but would ""now focus its support on zero emission models like pure electric and hydrogen fuel cell cars"". Plug-in hybrid vehicles continue to receive some government support, through lower car tax rates, grants for charging infrastructure and, in some local authorities, free parking. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reiterated its dismay at the scrapping of the plug-in car grant. ""We need policies that encourage consumers and businesses to invest in the cleanest cars, however they are powered,"" chief executive Mike Hawes said.

"This video can not be played Theresa May met the leaders of France and Belgium for Armistice remembrance ceremonies. Theresa May has used the words of World One War poets to pay tribute to fallen soldiers in France and Belgium. Visiting the St Symphorien Military Cemetery in Mons with the Belgian prime minister, she laid wreaths at the graves of the first and last UK soldiers killed in the war. Using words from a 1914 poem, she thanked those who died for being ""staunch to the end"". Her visit comes ahead of the Armistice Centenary this Sunday. During her trip to France, she and French President Emmanuel Macron paid their respects at the Thiepval Memorial, which commemorates more than 72,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers. Mr Macron's British great-grandfather, Bristol-born butcher George William Robertson, fought at the Somme and was decorated for bravery. He stayed in France after the war. Long read:The forgotten female soldier on the forgotten frontline Video:War footage brought alive in colour Interactive:,externalWhat would you have done between 1914 and 1918? Living history:Why 'indecent' Armistice Day parties ended The prime minister visited a French cemetery on Friday afternoon In the ceremony at Mons on Friday morning, the prime minister - accompanied by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel - laid wreaths at the graves of Londoner John Parr, the first UK soldier to be killed in 1914, and the last, George Ellison. Mr Ellison, who was born in York and lived in Leeds, was killed on the Western Front at 09:30 GMT, before the Armistice came into effect at 11:00, 100 years ago this Sunday. The two men's graves are opposite each other at the cemetery. Messages on poppy wreaths were taken from poems, with the one on Mr Ellison's grave bearing lines from Laurence Binyon, reading: ""They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted. We will remember them."" Mrs May chose lines from Rupert Brooke's sonnet The Soldier for Mr Parr's grave, writing ""in that rich earth a richer dust concealed"". Mrs May quoted a 1914 poem by Laurence Binyon, in a card left at the grave of George Ellison Lines from a Rupert Brooke poem were written on the card left at Mr Parr's grave Theresa May bowed her head at the grave of Private Ellison, the last British soldier to be killed in the war On the way to the cemetery in Mons, a policeman on a motorbike was hurt when a vehicle tried to drive between Mrs May and Mr Michel's convoys - not realising there were two separate convoys. A spokesman for Mr Michel said the policeman and another officer, who was also on a motorbike, ""had to manoeuvre so as not to crash into that car"" and ""narrowly escaped crashing into the Belgian prime minister's vehicle"". The officer fell off his bike and was ""injured but not heavily so"", the spokesman said. Mr Michel got out of his car to make sure the policeman was OK and waited for an ambulance to arrive. Mrs May and her companions were in front so did not see what happened but were briefed afterwards. Mrs May stood alongside Belgium's Prime Minister Charles Michel at the ceremony at the St Symphorien Military Cemetery Mrs May and Mr Michel later attended a reception, where they met British and Belgian serving members of the armed forces. The prime minister then travelled to France to meet Mr Macron in Albert, a town in the heart of the Somme region of France which suffered heavy bombardment during World War One. Mrs May and the French president had a private meeting and working lunch before attending the war cemetery. The two leaders laid a wreath at the French-British memorial at Thiepval in northern France The pair were also shown graves at the cemetery The two leaders then attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the nearby Thiepval Memorial. A wreath combining the poppy and le bleuet (or cornflower) - the two national emblems of remembrance for Britain and France - was made for the occasion. On the wreath, Mrs May left a card with an extract from poem A Soldier's Cemetery by Sergeant John William Streets, reading: ""There lie the flower of youth, the men who scorn'd to live (so died) when languished liberty."" Mrs May said the visit was a chance to reflect on the time the countries spent fighting side by side in Europe, but also to look ahead to a ""shared future, built on peace, prosperity and friendship"". She said the ceremony at Mons was ""a fitting and poignant symbol"" for ""every member of the armed forces who gave their lives to protect what we hold so dear"".

"Claire Busby said her super king-size double divan was in a ""defective state"" (stock image) A woman left paralysed after being ""catapulted"" from her new bed during sex has lost a seven-figure damages claim. Claire Busby, 46, suffered spinal injuries when she landed on her head after shifting position and falling from the super king-size double divan. She said a ""defective"" product supplied by Berkshire Bed Company, trading as Beds Are Uzzz, was to blame. But a High Court judge ruled the case was a ""tragic accident"". Rejecting her case, Judge Barry Cotter found the bed was ""not defective"", and the claim had failed. The court previously heard Ms Busby, of Maidenhead, Berkshire, was having sex with her then partner John Marshall a week after the bed was delivered. Claire Busby suffered spinal injuries when she fell from the super king-size double divan She told the court she had been kneeling before she ""swung her legs"" out from underneath her, causing the bed to give way. ""I spun around, I put my hand down and then I felt like I was catapulted off the back,"" she said. ""I fell to the side and heard what felt like a spring in my body snap"". Mr Marshall said he had been badly affected by the accident,which he had initially laughed off. Ms Busby claimed the bed had not been properly assembled when it was received in August 2013 - which was denied by lawyers for the company. The firm had argued the lovers had ""simply lost balance and toppled backwards"" as a result of being too close to the edge of the mattress. In his ruling, Judge Cotter said the ""simple accident"" was caused by ""a most unfortunate and unusual combination of positioning on the bed and movement,"" he said. The judge said Ms Busby had no means of support, other than placing her arm down on the bed, as she attempted to swing her legs around from underneath her in what was ""not an easy manoeuvre"". He added: ""Having carefully considered the totality of the evidence I am not satisfied that the difference in level between the two divans played any part in Ms Busby's loss of balance backwards. ""Rather, I am satisfied that this was a simple but tragic fall; she simply overbalanced probably in part because she was sitting on a mattress as opposed to a firm surface, and underestimated the amount of give underneath her body."" Richard Manders, director of Berkshire Bed Company, said: ""We are delighted the court has ruled in our favour. ""We are sorry that Ms Busby was injured and we wish her and her family well for the future.""

"There has been a remarkable global decline in the number of children women are having, say researchers. Their report found fertility rate falls meant nearly half of countries were now facing a ""baby bust"" - meaning there are insufficient children to maintain their population size. The researchers said the findings were a ""huge surprise"". And there would be profound consequences for societies with ""more grandparents than grandchildren"". The study,published in the Lancet,,externalfollowed trends in every country from 1950 to 2017. In 1950, women were having an average of 4.7 children in their lifetime. The fertility rate all but halved to 2.4 children per woman by last year. But that masks huge variation between nations. The fertility rate in Niger, west Africa, is 7.1, but in the Mediterranean island of Cyprus women are having one child, on average. In the UK, the rate is 1.7, similar to most Western European countries. The total fertility rate is the average number of children a woman gives birth to in their lifetime (it's different to the birth rate which is the number of children born per thousand people each year). Whenever a country's rate drops below approximately 2.1 then populations will eventually start to shrink (this ""baby bust"" figure is significantly higher in countries which have high rates of death in childhood). At the start of the study, in 1950, there were zero nations in this position. 'Why I never want babies' 'I'm not having children because I want to save the planet' Hans Rosling, population prophet: Five final thoughts Prof Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, told the BBC: ""We've reached this watershed where half of countries have fertility rates below the replacement level, so if nothing happens the populations will decline in those countries. ""It's a remarkable transition. ""It's a surprise even to people like myself, the idea that it's half the countries in the world will be a huge surprise to people."" More economically developed countries including most of Europe, the US, South Korea and Australia have lower fertility rates. It does not mean the number of people living in these countries is falling, at least not yet as the size of a population is a mix of the fertility rate, death rate and migration. It can also take a generation for changes in fertility rate to take hold. But Prof Murray said: ""We will soon be transitioning to a point where societies are grappling with a declining population."" Half the world's nations are still producing enough children to grow, but as more countries advance economically, more will have lower fertility rates. Rachael Jacobs, 38, of Kent, had her first and only child seven years ago I'd always focused on my career. When I was pregnant I was still focusing on my career. I know now that we can survive on what we earn as a family and still go on holiday every year. If we had more than one child we couldn't go on holiday. We'd rather give our daughter the best of everything than have multiple children that we can just about feed and clothe. My partner and I are also thinking about the future. We want to be in a position where we can help her financially with university or housing. I don't want to ever have to say that she can't go to a party or have a new Christmas jumper. The fall in fertility rate is not down to sperm counts or any of the things that normally come to mind when thinking of fertility. Instead it is being put down to three key factors: Fewer deaths in childhood meaning women have fewer babies Greater access to contraception More women in education and work In many ways, falling fertility rates are a success story. Without migration, countries will face ageing and shrinking populations. Dr George Leeson, director of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing, says that does not have to be a bad thing, as long as the whole of society adjusts to the massive demographic change. He told the BBC: ""Demography impacts on every single aspect of our lives, just look out of your window at the people on the streets, the houses, the traffic, the consumption, it is all driven by demography. ""Everything we plan for is not just driven by the numbers in the population, but also the age structure and that is changing, so fundamentally we haven't got our heads around it."" He thinks workplaces are going to have to change and even the idea of retiring at 68, the current maximum in the UK, will be unsustainable. The report, part of the Global Burden of Diseases analysis, says affected countries will need to consider increasing immigration, which can create its own problems, or introducing policies to encourage women to have more children, which often fail. Report author Prof Murray argues: ""On current trends there will be very few children and lots of people over the age of 65 and that's very difficult to sustain global society. ""Think of all the profound social and economic consequences of a society structured like that with more grandparents than grandchildren. ""I think Japan is very aware of this, they're facing declining populations, but I don't think it's hit many countries in the West, because low fertility has been compensated with migration. ""At a global level there is no migration solution,"" Prof Murray says. But while the change may challenge societies, it may also have environmental benefits given the impact of our species. China has seen huge population growth since 1950, going from around half a billion inhabitants to 1.4 billion. But it too is facing the challenge of fertility rates, which stood at only 1.5 in 2017, and has recently moved away from its famous one child policy. The reason developed countries need a fertility rate of 2.1 is because not all children survive to adulthood and babies are ever so slightly more likely to be male than female. But in China, the report shows for every 100 girls born there were 117 boys which ""imply very substantial sex-selective abortion and even the possibility of female infanticide"". That means even more children need to be born to have a stable population.

"Former First Lady Michelle Obama has released a memoir in which she reveals difficulties about her marriage and pregnancy with her two daughters. In the book, Becoming, Mrs Obama reveals that she had a miscarriage and used in vitro fertilisation to conceive both children, Malia and Sasha. Mrs Obama told ABC's Good Morning America she felt ""lost and alone"" after her miscarriage 20 years ago. She also criticised Donald Trump for ""putting my family's safety at risk"". Mrs Obama and her husband, former President Barack Obama, sought couples therapy, she also revealed for the first time in her 426-page book, which will be released on Tuesday. Following publication,the first African-American first lady will tour 10 cities including London. Michelle Obama dances with Parker the portrait girl Mrs Obama, a former lawyer and hospital administrator, told ABC that after her miscarriage, ""I felt like I failed because I didn't know how common miscarriages were because we don't talk about them. ""We sit in our own pain, thinking that somehow we're broken,"" she said, adding that ""it's important to talk to young mothers about the fact that miscarriages happen"". She said that when she was around 34 years old, she realized that ""the biological clock is real"" and that ""egg production is limited"", which made her decide to seek in-vitro fertilisation. ""I think it's the worst thing that we do to each other as women, not share the truth about our bodies and how they work,"" Mrs  Obama told ABC's Robin Roberts on Good Morning America. Mrs Obama revealed that the couple's relationship struggled at times, especially after her husband joined the state legislature, leaving her at home where she was forced to administer IVF shots herself. ""Marriage counselling for us was one of those ways where we learned how to talk out our differences,"" she told ABC. ""I know too many young couples who struggle and think that somehow there's something wrong with them. And I want them to know that Michelle and Barack Obama, who have a phenomenal marriage and who love each other, we work on our marriage. ""And we get help with our marriage when we need it.""

The Obamas and their children whitewater rafted in Indonesia in 2017 In Becoming, Mrs Obama says she would ""never forgive"" President Trump for championing the ""birther"" theory that her husband was not born in the US, according to excerpts obtained by US media. ""The whole [birther] thing was crazy and mean-spirited, of course, its underlying bigotry and xenophobia hardly concealed,"" she wrote. ""What if someone with an unstable mind loaded a gun and drove to Washington? What if that person went looking for our girls? Donald Trump, with his loud and reckless innuendos, was putting my family's safety at risk. And for this I'd never forgive him."" She said she reacted in shock to Mr Trump's presidential victory and ""tried to block it all out"". Before departing the White House for Paris on Friday, Mr Trump addressed some of the quotes from Mrs Obama's book. ""Michelle Obama got paid a lot of money to write a book and they always insist you come up with controversy. I'll give you some back. ""I'll never forgive him for what he did to our United States military by not funding it properly,"" Mr Trump said, referring to his predecessor, Mr Obama.

"Rehana Popal said more solicitors and barristers need to share their experiences The only female Afghan barrister in England and Wales says she has become numb to discrimination after a client sacked her to appoint a white man. Rehana Popal said other clients have told her they wanted someone white ""because the judge will believe them"". She said it suggested there was a ""serious concern"" with how the justice system was being perceived. The Ministry of Justice said it was committed to increasing the diversity of the judiciary. Ms Popal, an immigration and civil law specialist barrister at 10 KBW chambers in the Temple,tweeted:,external""Just had a solicitor call to tell me... the client has said he doesn't want an Asian female but a white male barrister."" The barrister, who came to the UK as a child refugee, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme it had happened several times before and was ""just sadly the reality"" of what ethnic minorities faced at the Bar. ""They will have had to hold some prejudicial views, for them to have come to say that,"" she explained, ""but equally there is a serious problem here in relation to perception, because clients have thought their cases will be more likely to be believed by a judge if it is presented by a white male barrister. ""That is a serious concern, because if they're having that perception, then there's something wrong with how the justice system is being perceived by outsiders and that needs to be remedied urgently."" Ms Popal said the sad thing was she had become ""numb"" to it as it had happened so often. ""When it happened it's almost 'eye-roll, here it happens again'. The first time it happened it was heartbreaking...but I've just got to shrug it off, move on and let my work speak for itself."" Legal aid: Barristers to strike over 'relentless cuts' Government says diversity target for judges is 'wrong way' Bias against ethnic minorities 'needs to be tackled' in justice system She said she had an overwhelming response to her tweet, with both male and female lawyers saying they had been dis-instructed because of their race or religion. ""There needs to be an honest dialogue, more solicitors need to come out and say this is an issue they have faced and how they have dealt with it,"" she said. The Bar Council, which represents the 15,000 practising barristers in England and Wales, told solicitors they needed to challenge clients who discriminated against barristers because of their gender, race or any other protected characteristic. Andrew Walker QC said: ""Wherever discrimination does arise, it must be challenged by all branches of the legal profession. The close working relationship between barristers, their clerks and solicitors means that no-one should turn a blind eye."" The Ministry of Justice said in a statement: ""The Lord Chancellor is committed to increasing the diversity of our world-renowned judiciary, and we are pleased that recent statistics show increased black and ethnic minority and gender representation. ""But we know more must be done, and we recently launched a programme to help more candidates from under-represented groups apply to be judges."" But Ms Popal said the MoJ needed to do more in the recruitment and retention of female barristers and solicitors, as they were the people who would later become judges. ""There needs to be a better campaign in recruiting them from BME backgrounds and more women, so eventually, in 10-15 years, when it comes to recruiting from the profession for the judiciary, they have a wider pool to choose from,"" she said.

"This video can not be played The attacker set a car on fire and stabbed three people A man who set a car on fire and stabbed three people - one fatally - in the Australian city of Melbourne has died in hospital after being shot by police. Authorities now say they are treating the attack as terror-related. The attacker, 31, was shot after confronting officers on a busy city street, authorities said. He was taken into custody in a critical condition. The two survivors are in hospital, neither are in a serious condition. The suspect has not been named. Police said they were ""not looking for anyone further at this early stage"". ""We don't believe there is an ongoing threat at this stage, but certainly we are treating it as a terrorism incident,"" said Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton. He said the suspect, who is of Somali origin, was ""someone that is known"" to both local police and federal intelligence, adding it was ""mainly in respect to relatives"" who are ""certainly persons of interest to us"". Footage from the scene showed police confronting the man The Islamic State (IS) group said on Friday that one of its ""fighters"" was behind the attack, its Amaq news agency reported. Officers were initially called to reports of a car fire near Bourke Street, a busy thoroughfare, at about 16:20 local time (05:20 GMT), just before the evening rush hour. Police later discovered that the vehicle was packed with ""barbecue-style"" gas cylinders. Footage circulating on social media shows the vehicle crashed into shop fronts, engulfed by flames. However, the cylinders did not explode, police said. ""As they got out of the car, they were confronted by a male brandishing a knife and threatening them,"" Supt David Clayton said at a news conference. The incident happened in the heart of Melbourne's business district A burnt out vehicle was later seen on the same street ""At the same time, passers-by were calling out that members of the public had been stabbed."" Other footage shared on Twitter shows at least two police officers confronting the man, who is brandishing a large knife. At one point, what appears to be a member of the public tries to help, using a shopping trolley to push the assailant back. None of the three men reportedly stabbed at the scene have been officially named. However Tasmanian Premier Will Hodgman said on Twitter that local businessman Rod Patterson was among those attacked. ""A nicer bloke you wouldn't meet,"" Mr Hodgman tweeted.,external""It's not surprising he would step in to help others. We all wish him well."" According to Victoria Police, a 26-year-old and 58-year-old were both taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries. A police officer was also treated at the scene No. This incident comes asa man is on trial for a 2017 attack on the same street which left six people dead and dozens wounded. James Gargasoulas is accused of deliberately driving his car into pedestrians on Bourke Street, hitting 33 people. His defence barrister has said he was in a drug-induced psychosis at the time.

"A Ryanair plane has been seized by French authorities in a row over money in the latest problem for the airline. The French civil aviation authority grounded the Boeing 737 on Thursday at Bordeaux airport, before it was due to fly to Stansted with 149 passengers. It said the move was ""a last resort"". The dispute was caused by French subsidies paid to Ryanair for flights from AngoulÃªme regional airport between 2008 and 2009, which the European Commission later deemed illegal. The French civil aviation authority did not say how much money was involved, but regional airport officials said the sum was â¬525,000 (Â£457,000). The authority said the plane ""will remain immobilised until the sum is paid"". Ryanair profits hit by strikes and higher fuel costs Ryanair sacks staff who 'slept on floor' Ryanair tops airline compensation appeal claims ""It is unfortunate that the state had to take such action, which led to the inevitable inconvenience of the 149 passengers on board the immobilised plane,"" the French civil aviation authority said. ""Those passengers were able to eventually reach their destination later that evening on another Ryanair plane, but with a five-hour delay."" It is the latest in a series of setbacks for Ryanair, which has recently faced a series of strikes by pilots and cabin crew across Europe. But despite flight cancellations, Ryanair reported an 11% rise in traffic in October, as it carried 13.1 million passengers.

The 20,000 acre (8,100 hectare) Camp Fire, which started on Thursday near Camp Creek, has destroyed the town of Paradise. The Butte County Sheriff's office said five victims had been burned to death in their cars and could not immediately be identified. The fire is being driven west by 35 mph (56 km/h) winds, fire officials said. This video can not be played The Camp Fire has been fuelled by strong winds and dry forest Fire officials have issued evacuation notices for parts of Chico, a town of 93,000 people north of Sacramento. By the BBC's James Cook in northern California Driven by hot desert winds, the wildfire raced into Paradise, devouring the equivalent of 80 football pitches a minute. The town sits on a ridge and the few roads out quickly became clogged with traffic as 27,000 people tried to flee, many driving through walls of flame. Some motorists abandoned their cars and ran for their lives with children and pets in their arms. Residents are now using social media to search for missing friends and family members. In Paradise, rescuers used a bulldozer to push abandoned cars out of the way in order to reach a hospital and evacuate patients as the fire engulfed the building, Butte County Supervisor Doug Teeter said. ""There's nothing left standing,"" said Scott Maclean, the state's forestry and fire protection spokesman. The town of Paradise was destroyed, officials said Patients were evacuated from a hospital in Paradise that later burned down The two blazes are among 16 currently active fires in California,external.

"This video can not be played Theresa May met the leaders of France and Belgium for Armistice remembrance ceremonies. Theresa May has used the words of World One War poets to pay tribute to fallen soldiers in France and Belgium. Visiting the St Symphorien Military Cemetery in Mons with the Belgian prime minister, she laid wreaths at the graves of the first and last UK soldiers killed in the war. Using words from a 1914 poem, she thanked those who died for being ""staunch to the end"". Her visit comes ahead of the Armistice Centenary this Sunday. During her trip to France, she and French President Emmanuel Macron paid their respects at the Thiepval Memorial, which commemorates more than 72,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers. Mr Macron's British great-grandfather, Bristol-born butcher George William Robertson, fought at the Somme and was decorated for bravery. He stayed in France after the war. Long read:The forgotten female soldier on the forgotten frontline Video:War footage brought alive in colour Interactive:,externalWhat would you have done between 1914 and 1918? Living history:Why 'indecent' Armistice Day parties ended The prime minister visited a French cemetery on Friday afternoon In the ceremony at Mons on Friday morning, the prime minister - accompanied by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel - laid wreaths at the graves of Londoner John Parr, the first UK soldier to be killed in 1914, and the last, George Ellison. Mr Ellison, who was born in York and lived in Leeds, was killed on the Western Front at 09:30 GMT, before the Armistice came into effect at 11:00, 100 years ago this Sunday. The two men's graves are opposite each other at the cemetery. Messages on poppy wreaths were taken from poems, with the one on Mr Ellison's grave bearing lines from Laurence Binyon, reading: ""They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted. We will remember them."" Mrs May chose lines from Rupert Brooke's sonnet The Soldier for Mr Parr's grave, writing ""in that rich earth a richer dust concealed"". Mrs May quoted a 1914 poem by Laurence Binyon, in a card left at the grave of George Ellison Lines from a Rupert Brooke poem were written on the card left at Mr Parr's grave Theresa May bowed her head at the grave of Private Ellison, the last British soldier to be killed in the war On the way to the cemetery in Mons, a policeman on a motorbike was hurt when a vehicle tried to drive between Mrs May and Mr Michel's convoys - not realising there were two separate convoys. A spokesman for Mr Michel said the policeman and another officer, who was also on a motorbike, ""had to manoeuvre so as not to crash into that car"" and ""narrowly escaped crashing into the Belgian prime minister's vehicle"". The officer fell off his bike and was ""injured but not heavily so"", the spokesman said. Mr Michel got out of his car to make sure the policeman was OK and waited for an ambulance to arrive. Mrs May and her companions were in front so did not see what happened but were briefed afterwards. Mrs May stood alongside Belgium's Prime Minister Charles Michel at the ceremony at the St Symphorien Military Cemetery Mrs May and Mr Michel later attended a reception, where they met British and Belgian serving members of the armed forces. The prime minister then travelled to France to meet Mr Macron in Albert, a town in the heart of the Somme region of France which suffered heavy bombardment during World War One. Mrs May and the French president had a private meeting and working lunch before attending the war cemetery. The two leaders laid a wreath at the French-British memorial at Thiepval in northern France The pair were also shown graves at the cemetery The two leaders then attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the nearby Thiepval Memorial.

"The Irish border is the last outstanding issue in the Brexit withdrawal negotiations DUP leader Arlene Foster has said her party will ""not be able to support"" Theresa May's latest proposals aimed at resolving the Brexit deadlock. The party accused the PM of breaking promises over plans to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The plans were revealed in a letter from Theresa May to Mrs Foster,leaked to the Times.,external Downing Street reiterated the PM's commitment to avoiding a hard border. Mrs May relies on the support of the DUP's 10 MPs in key votes because she does not have a majority in the House of Commons. Agreeing a backstop - a contingency plan designed to keep an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland until the UK and European Union settle their future relationship - remains the main obstacle in the way of a wider deal between the two sides. Mrs May describes it in her letter to the DUP as ""an insurance policy that no-one in the UK or the EU wants or expects to use"". The DUP leader said the party could not back the deal if it came before Parliament and said the PM ""needs to reflect"" on that. Mrs Foster told the BBC that a response to a letter sent to the PM last week ""unfortunately does say that she's in a position where she's considering regulatory alignment"". ""We would not be able to support this if it came to parliament in the form that it is in the letter,"" said the DUP leader. ""Now there are stages to go through before it comes to parliament. She still has to have a cabinet meeting in relation to this matter and we believe that there is a chance for her to reflect on the fact that we will not be able to support it in its current form.

The UK and EU have failed, so far, to reach agreement on how to ensure there are no border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, if a free trade deal is not in place by the end of the post-Brexit ""transition period"" in December 2020. This is known as the ""backstop"". The EU's proposal, to keep Northern Ireland in its customs union and single market, is unacceptable to the UK because it would mean Northern Ireland having different regulations to the rest of the UK. But the UK's proposal, which would effectively keep the whole of the UK in the EU customs union for a limited period after Brexit, includes an ""expected"" end date of 2021 - something which is unacceptable to the EU, which says any ""backstop"" must apply ""unless and until"" it is no longer needed. It says its Northern Ireland-only proposal should remain in place, in case the issue of the Irish border was not sorted out by that end date. Theresa May relies on the votes of DUP MPs, such as Sammy Wilson and Nigel Dodds TheBBC's John Campbell saidwhat was upsetting the DUP in Mrs May's letter was the issue of single market regulations, not customs. He said the letter suggested the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland may require alignment with EU single market regulations ""in some scenarios"" adding that any such alignment would have to be ""carefully circumscribed to what is strictly necessary to avoid any hard border"". The DUP has interpreted the wording of her letter to mean that the EU's proposal will be in the Brexit divorce deal, despite Mrs May's insistence it will never come into effect.

The 20,000 acre (8,100 hectare) Camp Fire, which started on Thursday near Camp Creek, has destroyed the town of Paradise. The Butte County Sheriff's office said five victims had been burned to death in their cars and could not immediately be identified. The fire is being driven west by 35 mph (56 km/h) winds, fire officials said. This video can not be played The Camp Fire has been fuelled by strong winds and dry forest Fire officials have issued evacuation notices for parts of Chico, a town of 93,000 people north of Sacramento. By the BBC's James Cook in northern California Driven by hot desert winds, the wildfire raced into Paradise, devouring the equivalent of 80 football pitches a minute. The town sits on a ridge and the few roads out quickly became clogged with traffic as 27,000 people tried to flee, many driving through walls of flame. Some motorists abandoned their cars and ran for their lives with children and pets in their arms. Residents are now using social media to search for missing friends and family members. In Paradise, rescuers used a bulldozer to push abandoned cars out of the way in order to reach a hospital and evacuate patients as the fire engulfed the building, Butte County Supervisor Doug Teeter said. ""There's nothing left standing,"" said Scott Maclean, the state's forestry and fire protection spokesman. The town of Paradise was destroyed, officials said Patients were evacuated from a hospital in Paradise that later burned down The two blazes are among 16 currently active fires in California,external. Officials have put most of Northern California under a Red Flag Warning, which means ""extreme fire behaviour"" can occur within 24 hours.

"The UK economy grew by 0.6% in the three months to September, with warm weather boosting consumer spending, the Office for National Statistics said. The figure for the third quarter,externalis in line with predictions from the Bank of England and other forecasters. However, buoyant growth in July was offset by a slowdown in August and September. It is the highest quarterly growth figure since the fourth quarter of 2016, when the economy grew 0.7%. Analysts warned the economy had ""little underlying momentum"" and growth would decline in the final three months. The ONS also issueda separate monthly figure for September,external, which, like the previous month, showed zero growth. Services, which make up three-quarters of the economy, only grew by 0.3% in the three months to September. After a slow start to the year, construction activity grew by 2.1% in the quarter. Manufacturing also picked up after a slow second quarter, thanks to strong car manufacturing numbers for the quarter. Household spending grew by 0.5% in the quarter, but business investment shrank by 1.2%, suggesting uncertainty among companies over the effects of Brexit. Business investment had been expected to rise by 0.2%, according to forecasts. It has now contracted for three quarters in a row. Simon Jack, business editor The overall picture is one of an economy still recovering from an exceptionally weak, weather-affected start to the year. Construction and energy production both had a strong quarter and the weather played its part again in July, as sunshine and the World Cup boosted consumer spending. It's the strongest quarter for nearly two years, but the economy didn't keep up the strong momentum of July, with August and September registering no additional growth at all. Worryingly but perhaps not surprisingly, business investment was down sharply, matching anecdotal evidence of firms' caution ahead of Brexit. Although car production was up compared with the second quarter of this year, it is down compared with the same period last year and domestic car sales were very weak - it's exports that are keeping the car industry ticking over. Plenty for the chancellor to be cheerful about today, but a third quarter of falling business investment - the first time that's happened since the financial crisis - shows that firms think the sun may be shining now, but big clouds are looming. Read more from Simon Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ""Today's positive growth of 0.6% is proof of the underlying strength in our economy. We are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade."" ONS head of national accounts Rob Kent-Smith said: ""The economy saw a strong summer, although longer-term economic growth remained subdued. There are some signs of weakness in September, with slowing retail sales and a fallback in domestic car purchases. ""However, car manufacture for export grew across the quarter, boosting factory output. Meanwhile, imports of cars dropped substantially, helping to improve Britain's trade balance."" Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""Two consecutive months of stagnation in GDP underline that the economy has little momentum and that the strong quarter-on-quarter growth rate simply reflects the weather-related rebound in the summer. ""The expenditure breakdown of GDP, meanwhile, shows that business investment fell by 1.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3, taking the total decline since the peak in Q4 2017 to 2.4%. The risk of a no-deal Brexit is the clear driver of the downturn."" Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""It remains likely that the stronger growth recorded in the third quarter is a one-off for the UK economy, with persistent Brexit uncertainty and the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses likely to weigh increasingly on economic activity in the coming quarters.""

"There has been a remarkable global decline in the number of children women are having, say researchers. Their report found fertility rate falls meant nearly half of countries were now facing a ""baby bust"" - meaning there are insufficient children to maintain their population size. The researchers said the findings were a ""huge surprise"". And there would be profound consequences for societies with ""more grandparents than grandchildren"". The study,published in the Lancet,,externalfollowed trends in every country from 1950 to 2017. In 1950, women were having an average of 4.7 children in their lifetime. The fertility rate all but halved to 2.4 children per woman by last year. But that masks huge variation between nations. The fertility rate in Niger, west Africa, is 7.1, but in the Mediterranean island of Cyprus women are having one child, on average. In the UK, the rate is 1.7, similar to most Western European countries. The total fertility rate is the average number of children a woman gives birth to in their lifetime (it's different to the birth rate which is the number of children born per thousand people each year). Whenever a country's rate drops below approximately 2.1 then populations will eventually start to shrink (this ""baby bust"" figure is significantly higher in countries which have high rates of death in childhood). At the start of the study, in 1950, there were zero nations in this position. 'Why I never want babies' 'I'm not having children because I want to save the planet' Hans Rosling, population prophet: Five final thoughts Prof Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, told the BBC: ""We've reached this watershed where half of countries have fertility rates below the replacement level, so if nothing happens the populations will decline in those countries. ""It's a remarkable transition. ""It's a surprise even to people like myself, the idea that it's half the countries in the world will be a huge surprise to people."" More economically developed countries including most of Europe, the US, South Korea and Australia have lower fertility rates. It does not mean the number of people living in these countries is falling, at least not yet as the size of a population is a mix of the fertility rate, death rate and migration. It can also take a generation for changes in fertility rate to take hold. But Prof Murray said: ""We will soon be transitioning to a point where societies are grappling with a declining population."" Half the world's nations are still producing enough children to grow, but as more countries advance economically, more will have lower fertility rates. Rachael Jacobs, 38, of Kent, had her first and only child seven years ago I'd always focused on my career. When I was pregnant I was still focusing on my career. I know now that we can survive on what we earn as a family and still go on holiday every year. If we had more than one child we couldn't go on holiday. We'd rather give our daughter the best of everything than have multiple children that we can just about feed and clothe. My partner and I are also thinking about the future. We want to be in a position where we can help her financially with university or housing. I don't want to ever have to say that she can't go to a party or have a new Christmas jumper. The fall in fertility rate is not down to sperm counts or any of the things that normally come to mind when thinking of fertility. Instead it is being put down to three key factors: Fewer deaths in childhood meaning women have fewer babies Greater access to contraception More women in education and work In many ways, falling fertility rates are a success story. Without migration, countries will face ageing and shrinking populations. Dr George Leeson, director of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing, says that does not have to be a bad thing, as long as the whole of society adjusts to the massive demographic change. He told the BBC: ""Demography impacts on every single aspect of our lives, just look out of your window at the people on the streets, the houses, the traffic, the consumption, it is all driven by demography. ""Everything we plan for is not just driven by the numbers in the population, but also the age structure and that is changing, so fundamentally we haven't got our heads around it."" He thinks workplaces are going to have to change and even the idea of retiring at 68, the current maximum in the UK, will be unsustainable. The report, part of the Global Burden of Diseases analysis, says affected countries will need to consider increasing immigration, which can create its own problems, or introducing policies to encourage women to have more children, which often fail. Report author Prof Murray argues: ""On current trends there will be very few children and lots of people over the age of 65 and that's very difficult to sustain global society. ""Think of all the profound social and economic consequences of a society structured like that with more grandparents than grandchildren. ""I think Japan is very aware of this, they're facing declining populations, but I don't think it's hit many countries in the West, because low fertility has been compensated with migration. ""At a global level there is no migration solution,"" Prof Murray says. But while the change may challenge societies, it may also have environmental benefits given the impact of our species. China has seen huge population growth since 1950, going from around half a billion inhabitants to 1.4 billion. But it too is facing the challenge of fertility rates, which stood at only 1.5 in 2017, and has recently moved away from its famous one child policy. The reason developed countries need a fertility rate of 2.1 is because not all children survive to adulthood and babies are ever so slightly more likely to be male than female. But in China, the report shows for every 100 girls born there were 117 boys which ""imply very substantial sex-selective abortion and even the possibility of female infanticide"". That means even more children need to be born to have a stable population.

And there are several other ministers of a similar rank, who hold very similar views. Not long ago, one of them said, ""for me, it could be an issue of party or country"".

Theresa May relies on the votes of DUP MPs, such as Sammy Wilson and Nigel Dodds TheBBC's John Campbell saidwhat was upsetting the DUP in Mrs May's letter was the issue of single market regulations, not customs. He said the letter suggested the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland may require alignment with EU single market regulations ""in some scenarios"" adding that any such alignment would have to be ""carefully circumscribed to what is strictly necessary to avoid any hard border"". The DUP has interpreted the wording of her letter to mean that the EU's proposal will be in the Brexit divorce deal, despite Mrs May's insistence it will never come into effect. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the row came down to an issue of trust between Mrs May and her DUP allies, who were suspicious she might sign up to a deal with the EU they did not agree with.

Irish PM Leo Varadkar told a press conference: ""The most important thing to me is the objective, and that is to give everyone in Northern Ireland the assurance that a hard border will not develop between north and south, no matter what else may happen in the years ahead.

"This video can not be played The Brexit deal ""will see us cede control"" - Jo Johnson Jo Johnson has quit as transport minister and called for the public to have a fresh say on Brexit. The MP, who is Boris Johnson's brother but voted Remain in the referendum, said the  deal being negotiated with the EU ""will be a terrible mistake"". Arguing Britain was ""on the brink of the greatest crisis"" since World War Two,he said what was on offer wasn't ""anything like what was promised"",external. Downing Street thanked him for his work but ruled out another referendum. Jo Johnson voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum while his brother Boris, who quit as foreign secretary in July, was a leading Brexiteer. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: All you need to know DUP accuses PM of breaking promises His brother praised his decision, saying they were ""united in dismay"" at the PM's handling of the negotiations. Cabinet ministers have been invited this week to read the UK's draft withdrawal deal with the EU. Theresa May has said the withdrawal deal is 95% done - but there is no agreement yet on how to guarantee no hard border in Northern Ireland. On Friday the DUP, whose support Theresa May relies on for votes in the Commons, saidthey cannot support any dealwhich included the possibility that Northern Ireland would be treated differently from the rest of the UK. Mr Johnson, the MP for Orpington in Greater London, said the choice being finalised was either: an agreement which would leave the UK ""economically weakened with no say in the EU rules it must follow"", or a ""no-deal Brexit"" which would ""inflict untold damage on our nation"". He described this as ""a failure of British statecraft unseen since the Suez crisis"" but said even a no-deal Brexit ""may well be better than the never-ending purgatory"" being put forward by the prime minister. But in a warning to his brother and fellow Brexiteers, he added: ""Inflicting such serious economic and political harm on the country will leave an indelible impression of incompetence in the minds of the public."" The ""democratic thing to do is to give the public the final say"", he argued. Mr Johnson was elected MP for Orpington in 2010 and was made transport minister in January Analysis by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg For some time, Jo Johnson has struggled with the unfolding reality of Brexit. A well-respected and liked member of the government, he has decided that what was promised to people during the referendum campaign is now so different to what is on the table that he has quit the government instead. He's not the first, nor the best-known minister to resign over Brexit. But to leave at this moment, right when Theresa May is trying to stitch together a final deal, could have a serious impact. Read Laura's full blog He added: ""This would not be about re-running the 2016 referendum, but about asking people whether they want to go ahead with Brexit now that we know the deal that is actually available to us, whether we should leave without any deal at all or whether people on balance would rather stick with the deal we already have inside the European Union. ""Britain stands on the brink of the greatest crisis since the Second World War. My loyalty to the party is undimmed. I have never rebelled on any issue before now. ""But my duty to my constituents and our great nation has forced me to act."" In response, a Downing Street spokesman said: ""The referendum in 2016 was the biggest democratic exercise in this country's history. We will not under any circumstances have a second referendum. ""The prime minister thanks Jo Johnson for his work in government."" Mr Johnson is the sixth minister in Theresa May's government to resign specifically over Brexit, following David Davis, Boris Johnson, Philip Lee, Steve Baker and Guto Bebb. For Labour, Shadow Brexit Minister Jenny Chapman said Mrs May had ""lost all authority and is incapable of negotiating a Brexit deal within her own party, let alone with the EU"". But asked in an interviewwith the German magazine Der Spiegel,externalwhether he would stop Brexit if he had the chance, Jeremy Corbyn replied: ""We can't stop it, the referendum took place."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, whose party supports calls for a ""People's Vote"" on the final deal, said: ""We warmly welcome Jo Johnson's support of the campaign to give the people the final say on the deal and a chance to exit from Brexit. ""This is a fascinating situation in which Jo and his sister are united in opposing their brother Boris and his Brexit plans."" Brexiteer Tory MP Andrea Jenkynstweeted,externalthat she did not agree with him about another referendum - but his intervention highlighted unease on both sides of the debate, with the PM's efforts to secure a deal. And pro-Remain Conservative Anna Soubry supported his decision and said it was time for another referendum. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"An increasing number of South Korean women are choosing not to marry, not to have children, and not even to have relationships with men. With the lowest fertility rate in the world, the country's population will start shrinking unless something changes. ""I have no plans to have children, ever,"" says 24-year-old Jang Yun-hwa, as we chat in a hipsterish cafe in the middle of Seoul. ""I don't want the physical pain of childbirth. And it would be detrimental to my career."" Like many young adults in South Korea's hyper-competitive job market, Yun-hwa, a web comic artist, has worked hard to get where she is and isn't ready to let all that hard graft go to waste. ""Rather than be part of a family, I'd like to be independent and live alone and achieve my dreams,"" she says. Yun-hwa isn't the only young Korean woman who sees career and family as mutually exclusive. There are laws designed to prevent women being discriminated against for getting pregnant, or for just being of an age where that's a possibility - but in practice, unions say, they're not enforced. The story of Choi Moon-jeong, who lives in one of Seoul's western suburbs, is a powerful illustration of the problem. When she told her boss she was expecting a child, she was shocked by his reaction. ""My boss said, 'Once you have a child your child is going to be your priority and the company will come second, so can you still work?'"" Moon-jeong says. ""And he kept repeating this question."" Choi Moon-jeong today Moon-jeong was working as a tax accountant at the time. As the busiest time of the year approached, her boss piled even more work on her - and when she complained, he said she lacked dedication. Eventually the tensions came to a head. ""He was yelling at me. I was sitting in my chair and, with all the stress, my body started convulsing and I couldn't open my eyes,"" says Moon-jeong, her open, freckly face crumpling into a frown. ""My co-worker called a paramedic and I was taken to hospital."" At the hospital the doctors told her that stress was bringing about signs of miscarriage. Listen to Simon Maybin's reportNot making babies in South Koreaon Assignment, on the BBC World Service For transmission times, or to listen online, click here When Moon-jeong returned to work after a week in hospital, her pregnancy saved, she felt her boss was doing everything he could to force her out of her job. She says this kind of experience isn't uncommon. ""I think there are many cases where women get concerned when they're pregnant and you have to think very hard before announcing your pregnancy,"" she says. ""Many people around me have no children and plan to have no children."" A culture of hard work, long hours and dedication to one's job are often credited for South Korea's remarkable transformation over the last 50 years, from developing country to one of the world's biggest economies. But Yun-hwa says the role women played in this transformation often seems to be overlooked. ""The economic success of Korea also very much depended on the low-wage factory workers, which were mostly female,"" she says. ""And also the care service that women had to provide in the family in order for men to go out and just focus on work."" Now women are increasingly doing jobs previously done by men - in management and the professions. But despite these rapid social and economic changes, attitudes to gender have been slow to shift. ""In this country, women are expected to be the cheerleaders of the men,"" says Yun-hwa. More than that, she says, there's a tendency for married women to take the role of care-provider in the families they marry into. ""There's a lot of instances when even if a woman has a job, when she marries and has children, the child-rearing part is almost completely her responsibility,"" she says. ""And she's also asked to take care of her in-laws if they get sick."" The average South Korean man spends 45 minutes a day on unpaid work like childcare, according to figures from the OECD, while women spend five times that. ""My personality isn't fit for that sort of supportive role,"" says Yun-hwa. ""I'm busy with my own life."" It's not just that she is not interested in marriage, though. She doesn't even want boyfriends. One reason for that is the risk of becoming a victim of revenge porn, which she says is a ""big issue"" in Korea. But she's also concerned about domestic violence. The Korean Institute of Criminology published the results of a survey last year in which 80% of men questioned admitted to having been abusive towards romantic partners. When I ask Yun-hwa how men see women in South Korea, she has a one-word answer: ""Slave."" It's clear to see how this feeds into South Korea's baby shortage. The marriage rate in South Korea is at its lowest since records began - 5.5 per 1,000 people, compared with 9.2 in 1970 - and very few children are born outside marriage. Only Singapore, Hong Kong and Moldova have a fertility rate (the number of children per woman) as low as South Korea's. All are on 1.2, according to World Bank figures, while the replacement rate - the number needed for a population to remain level - is 2.1. Another factor putting people off starting a family is the cost. While state education is free, the competitive nature of schooling means parents are expected to fork out for extra tuition just so their child can keep up. All these ingredients have combined to produce a new social phenomenon in South Korea: the Sampo Generation. The word ""sampo"" means to give up three things - relationships, marriage and children. Defiantly independent, Yun-hwa says she hasn't given those three things up - she's chosen not to pursue them. She won't say whether she intends to be celibate, or to pursue relationships with women. Speak to South Koreans from older generations about the low fertility rate and the contrast in attitude is sharp. They see people like Yun-hwa as too individualistic and selfish. I start chatting to two women in their 60s enjoying the stream-side park that runs through central Seoul. One tells me she has three daughters in their 40s, but none has had children. ""I try to instil patriotism and duty to the country with the kids, and of course I would love to see them continuing the line,"" she says. ""But their decision is not to do that."" ""There should be that sense of duty to the country,"" her friend chips in. ""We're very worried about the low fertility rate here."" Yun-hwa and her contemporaries, the children of a globalised world, aren't persuaded by such arguments. When I put it to her that if she and her contemporaries don't have children her country's culture will die, she tells me that it's time for the male-dominated culture to go. ""Must die,"" she says, breaking into English. ""Must die!"" Join the conversation - find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,external,YouTube,externalandTwitter,external.

"Hans Rosling, the Swedish professor who made global health statistics compelling viewing,died from cancer in February. Co-founder ofGapminder.org,external, which continues his work, he was enthusiastically trying to change old-fashioned notions of the world even as his illness took hold. In his final BBC interview - for the BBC World Service seriesEconomic Tectonics- the statistician highlighted five key ways that demographics are shaping the world around us. Why bedrooms are driving economies Why do I as a professor from public health speaking about health and demography get invited to Goldman Sachs [and] all these big banks around the world? Because I tell them I can see on my screen when economic growth comes, before you can see it. In the past, economic growth was driving demographics, and now it's the other way around. First, I see decent life coming and I see children born-per-woman drop. I see the two-child family, and I see the economic growth starting in Vietnam, in Thailandâ¦ not only in China. And this change is coming, so if you want to know where to invest in Africa go and look at demographics. Governments can't run bedrooms. Bedrooms run the world. If you have countries where the fertility rate is coming down, just segmentise the population. Look at the most educated 20% in Ghana, in Tanzania, in Ethiopia: you will find two to three children per woman. You will find an emerging China in Africa. Go there to invest if you want to earn money, if you want to have nice pensions when you retire, place part of your capital there because there you will see fast growth. Source: Gapminder.org Africa is still growing, and there's such a difference within Africa. Some African countries are doing great from different levels: Ghana, most of Ethiopia, Tanzania. They are doing great: better schooling, better health, contraceptives being available. Other tragic examples: Central African Republic, Congo, civil wars; north Nigeria, very risky, troublesome. They are delayed. They need jobs. If they get jobs, you will get stable countries, and you will get economic growth. But there's an old vision of over-population and population causing disastrous environmental effects. If we look into the middle of this century, and if Africa makes it - stability, economic growth, social progress, rights for women, stable government, they get two child families - then they will be a burden on the environment. Source: United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2013) So an Africa that is successful will consume much more in 2050 than an Africa that is not successful. That will be a problem further on even if you manage to get down the population growth rate and Nigeria will level off at half a billion instead of one billion, Africa will level off at two billion instead of four billion. That doesn't mean that the environmental actions can rest. It's the other way around. Then, it's more urgent to take action because the rapidly successful two and a half billion in Africa, they will be a greater burden because they have money, they consume, they want bathrooms, they want refrigerators. People living longer The consequences of this are two possibilities - either those who work have to pay higher taxes or people have to work longer. Our former prime minister was bold. He told the Swedes you have to work until 75. We can't have a period between 65 and 75 where people play golf. Look at this as an opportunity. Many young couples work intensively to take care of kids, to have a professional life. The grandparents can come in. They can be more active, they are healthier, you know. There's a lot of ways in which this healthy old group of people can make a very valuable contribution to society. Source: Gapminder.org  The state retirement age for the vast majority of these countries is between 60 and 65 Whether it will be done non-monetary, to the tragedy of the minister of finance, or whether it's done by working and bringing in taxes for the greedy minister of finance, that's another thing. But it's open. It's a new situation because these older people are healthier. The period of life when you are disabled and sick and blind and cannot work, that has not increased, it has just been delayed. There is a problem with diseases like dementia and so on that takes out many healthy years, you know, but mainly there is an opportunity in this and it's just that the old systems have to change. What you see in Asia now is an amazing similarity from Japan, South Korea, the coast of China, Taiwan, Thailand. They are panicking in Singapore because the babies per woman is diving down to one. Taiwan, which we know as a country without [a] Communist party, they have one child per woman without any government policy, and China actually has 1.6. So why don't we get more babies there? I got the answer during a dinner in Hong Kong. I had lectured for a bank, and at the dinner I ended up next to the young banker who was extremely successful. She was 37 years old. She told me everything about financial trends in Asia and we got friendly with each other. So at the dessert I asked her: ""Do you have a family?"" ""Oh no,"" she said. ""I'm just working. I'm working all the time."" But I pushed on because I'm curious and said: ""Do you want to have a family?"" And she leaned backwards, looked out of the window that was the Bay of Hong Kong outside, and then she said with a smile: ""Yes, I'm thinking about children every day. It's the idea of a husband I can't stand."" I like it when one phrase can catch a trend in a whole part of the world. The educated, skilful women in Asia, from Japan to Singapore, in different political circumstances, they have been accepted and they made their way to the labour market, but they are still oppressed by old-fashioned values that they should take care of their husband and their parents-in-law. My best friend and former PhD student in Tanzania was annoyed by immigrants because a Kenyan got a job he hoped his son would get, because the Kenyan had quite good qualifications on their education system. You have today immigration in Africa from Europe because African countries are needing skilled professional people. Look at Portugal - the Portuguese are going back to Angola and Mozambique, so migration is at all skills levels. Some very skilled people need to do their work in different parts of the world, and the people at the lowest levels will also go and seek opportunities. Many people who have a big heart and haven't thought so much they may think that Western Europe can solve the problems of the world by receiving all poor people and all refugees. That won't work. I think it's good that we receive many refugees, but I'd rather have them coming with their families together rather than forcing them out on these dangerous trips where they lose all their money to criminal organisations. If we can manage migration in the world, it can benefit the person who migrates with their family, the country from where they come and the country to where they go.

"Former First Lady Michelle Obama has released a memoir in which she reveals difficulties about her marriage and pregnancy with her two daughters. In the book, Becoming, Mrs Obama reveals that she had a miscarriage and used in vitro fertilisation to conceive both children, Malia and Sasha. Mrs Obama told ABC's Good Morning America she felt ""lost and alone"" after her miscarriage 20 years ago. She also criticised Donald Trump for ""putting my family's safety at risk"". Mrs Obama and her husband, former President Barack Obama, sought couples therapy, she also revealed for the first time in her 426-page book, which will be released on Tuesday. Following publication,the first African-American first lady will tour 10 cities including London. Michelle Obama dances with Parker the portrait girl Mrs Obama, a former lawyer and hospital administrator, told ABC that after her miscarriage, ""I felt like I failed because I didn't know how common miscarriages were because we don't talk about them. ""We sit in our own pain, thinking that somehow we're broken,"" she said, adding that ""it's important to talk to young mothers about the fact that miscarriages happen"". She said that when she was around 34 years old, she realized that ""the biological clock is real"" and that ""egg production is limited"", which made her decide to seek in-vitro fertilisation. ""I think it's the worst thing that we do to each other as women, not share the truth about our bodies and how they work,"" Mrs  Obama told ABC's Robin Roberts on Good Morning America. Mrs Obama revealed that the couple's relationship struggled at times, especially after her husband joined the state legislature, leaving her at home where she was forced to administer IVF shots herself. ""Marriage counselling for us was one of those ways where we learned how to talk out our differences,"" she told ABC. ""I know too many young couples who struggle and think that somehow there's something wrong with them. And I want them to know that Michelle and Barack Obama, who have a phenomenal marriage and who love each other, we work on our marriage. ""And we get help with our marriage when we need it.""

"The Irish border is the last outstanding issue in the Brexit withdrawal negotiations DUP leader Arlene Foster has said her party will ""not be able to support"" Theresa May's latest proposals aimed at resolving the Brexit deadlock. The party accused the PM of breaking promises over plans to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The plans were revealed in a letter from Theresa May to Mrs Foster,leaked to the Times.,external Downing Street reiterated the PM's commitment to avoiding a hard border. Mrs May relies on the support of the DUP's 10 MPs in key votes because she does not have a majority in the House of Commons. Agreeing a backstop - a contingency plan designed to keep an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland until the UK and European Union settle their future relationship - remains the main obstacle in the way of a wider deal between the two sides. Mrs May describes it in her letter to the DUP as ""an insurance policy that no-one in the UK or the EU wants or expects to use"". The DUP leader said the party could not back the deal if it came before Parliament and said the PM ""needs to reflect"" on that. Mrs Foster told the BBC that a response to a letter sent to the PM last week ""unfortunately does say that she's in a position where she's considering regulatory alignment"". ""We would not be able to support this if it came to parliament in the form that it is in the letter,"" said the DUP leader. ""Now there are stages to go through before it comes to parliament. She still has to have a cabinet meeting in relation to this matter and we believe that there is a chance for her to reflect on the fact that we will not be able to support it in its current form.

Analysis: DUP and government not on same page Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: All you need to know UK must be able to end backstop, says Fox If sufficient progress is made on the issue in the next few days, it is thought a special cabinet meeting could be held early next week for ministers to approve the draft agreement on the terms of the UK's exit. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The government will not agree anything that brings about a hard border on the island of Ireland."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The UK and EU have failed, so far, to reach agreement on how to ensure there are no border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, if a free trade deal is not in place by the end of the post-Brexit ""transition period"" in December 2020. This is known as the ""backstop"". The EU's proposal, to keep Northern Ireland in its customs union and single market, is unacceptable to the UK because it would mean Northern Ireland having different regulations to the rest of the UK. But the UK's proposal, which would effectively keep the whole of the UK in the EU customs union for a limited period after Brexit, includes an ""expected"" end date of 2021 - something which is unacceptable to the EU, which says any ""backstop"" must apply ""unless and until"" it is no longer needed. It says its Northern Ireland-only proposal should remain in place, in case the issue of the Irish border was not sorted out by that end date. Theresa May relies on the votes of DUP MPs, such as Sammy Wilson and Nigel Dodds TheBBC's John Campbell saidwhat was upsetting the DUP in Mrs May's letter was the issue of single market regulations, not customs. He said the letter suggested the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland may require alignment with EU single market regulations ""in some scenarios"" adding that any such alignment would have to be ""carefully circumscribed to what is strictly necessary to avoid any hard border"". The DUP has interpreted the wording of her letter to mean that the EU's proposal will be in the Brexit divorce deal, despite Mrs May's insistence it will never come into effect. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the row came down to an issue of trust between Mrs May and her DUP allies, who were suspicious she might sign up to a deal with the EU they did not agree with. This video can not be played Philip Hammond: We won't put the United Kingdom at risk Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ""We have always said that we can't accept the [EU] commission proposal for a Northern Ireland-specific solution."" Irish PM Leo Varadkar told a press conference: ""The most important thing to me is the objective, and that is to give everyone in Northern Ireland the assurance that a hard border will not develop between north and south, no matter what else may happen in the years ahead. ""That is why we are seeking one that is legally operative and one that gives us that guarantee that is necessary."" UK must be able to end backstop, says Fox What are the Brexit backstop options?

"The Only Grape is Essex: TOWIE star Gemma Collins has been pictured enjoying a fine fizz Essex could rival the Champagne region as a major producer of fizz, experts have claimed. Scientists identified about 86,000 acres of countryside - with similar traits to the French plonk powerhouse - deemed ""prime"" land for vineyards. The areas, including some in Suffolk, had ideal soil, terrain and climate for grape growing, experts from the University of East Anglia (UEA) said. But they also warned budding winemakers to expect expensive set-up costs. Climate change had led to ""warmer growing seasons"" in England and Wales, researchers said. As a result, areas ""where relatively few vineyards currently exist"" could have unexplored winemaking potential. They said Essex, more commonly associated with reality star haunt the Sugar Hut, was drier, warmer and more stable than some more established vineyard locations. Prof Steve Dorling, from the UEA's School of Environmental Sciences, said the summer's heatwave had led to a ""record grape harvest"" and ""a vintage year for English and Welsh wine"". But, he said, the season had been ""quite unusual in terms of weather"" and more work was needed to find the best places to plant vineyards able to withstand the UK's ""often fickle weather"". Lead author Dr Alistair Nesbitt echoed Prof Dorling, and said there was ""definitely room for improvement"" but it was hoped the research could ""help boost future productivity"". Could we one day see these brands on our supermarket shelves? Brutlingsea Moet & Clacton Bolly-riccay Cava Island Chugwell Proseccolchester Spot of Basil-Dom Perignon, anyone? The research, funded by the Natural Environment Research Council, has been published in the Journal of Land Use Science. Charles Macaudy, manager of Wyken Wines, near Bury St Edmunds, said climate change had enabled East Anglia vineyards to grow the same varieties of grapes as vineyards in Champagne. Despite it being the ""driest area of the UK and also the sunniest"", those varieties would not previously grow successfully in East Anglia. ""Now we can make sparkling wine more like Champagne, but even better,"" he said. But Mr Macaudy said the spring frost could make or break the harvest, after 80% of their crop was wiped out in April 2017.

"Former First Lady Michelle Obama has released a memoir in which she reveals difficulties about her marriage and pregnancy with her two daughters. In the book, Becoming, Mrs Obama reveals that she had a miscarriage and used in vitro fertilisation to conceive both children, Malia and Sasha. Mrs Obama told ABC's Good Morning America she felt ""lost and alone"" after her miscarriage 20 years ago. She also criticised Donald Trump for ""putting my family's safety at risk"". Mrs Obama and her husband, former President Barack Obama, sought couples therapy, she also revealed for the first time in her 426-page book, which will be released on Tuesday. Following publication,the first African-American first lady will tour 10 cities including London. Michelle Obama dances with Parker the portrait girl Mrs Obama, a former lawyer and hospital administrator, told ABC that after her miscarriage, ""I felt like I failed because I didn't know how common miscarriages were because we don't talk about them. ""We sit in our own pain, thinking that somehow we're broken,"" she said, adding that ""it's important to talk to young mothers about the fact that miscarriages happen"". She said that when she was around 34 years old, she realized that ""the biological clock is real"" and that ""egg production is limited"", which made her decide to seek in-vitro fertilisation. ""I think it's the worst thing that we do to each other as women, not share the truth about our bodies and how they work,"" Mrs  Obama told ABC's Robin Roberts on Good Morning America. Mrs Obama revealed that the couple's relationship struggled at times, especially after her husband joined the state legislature, leaving her at home where she was forced to administer IVF shots herself. ""Marriage counselling for us was one of those ways where we learned how to talk out our differences,"" she told ABC. ""I know too many young couples who struggle and think that somehow there's something wrong with them. And I want them to know that Michelle and Barack Obama, who have a phenomenal marriage and who love each other, we work on our marriage. ""And we get help with our marriage when we need it.""

The Obamas and their children whitewater rafted in Indonesia in 2017 In Becoming, Mrs Obama says she would ""never forgive"" President Trump for championing the ""birther"" theory that her husband was not born in the US, according to excerpts obtained by US media. ""The whole [birther] thing was crazy and mean-spirited, of course, its underlying bigotry and xenophobia hardly concealed,"" she wrote. ""What if someone with an unstable mind loaded a gun and drove to Washington? What if that person went looking for our girls? Donald Trump, with his loud and reckless innuendos, was putting my family's safety at risk. And for this I'd never forgive him."" She said she reacted in shock to Mr Trump's presidential victory and ""tried to block it all out"". Before departing the White House for Paris on Friday, Mr Trump addressed some of the quotes from Mrs Obama's book. ""Michelle Obama got paid a lot of money to write a book and they always insist you come up with controversy. I'll give you some back. ""I'll never forgive him for what he did to our United States military by not funding it properly,"" Mr Trump said, referring to his predecessor, Mr Obama.

"Retailers will no longer have to pay millions of pounds in business rates for cash machines outside their shops, following a ruling by the Appeal Court. Since 2010 supermarkets and convenience stores have been liable to pay rates on the machines. But the court ruled that about Â£300m they have already been charged will now have to be refunded. Part of that money will have to come from the government, and part from local authorities. The shops that will immediately benefit include Sainsbury's and Tesco, which had taken the case to appeal. The court also decided that The Valuation Office - which brought the original case - should not be allowed to appeal to the Supreme Court. However the Valuation Office can still petition the Supreme Court should it wish to do so. Cash machines close at record rate The High Streets with too many ATMs Tesco said it welcomed the judgement, which applies only to England and Wales. ""We recognise the vital role that ATMs play in the daily lives of our customers and remain committed to providing this service to them,"" a spokesperson said. ""We welcome today's result and the confirmation of our belief that ATMs should not be separately rateable."" The Co-Op said it was a victory for people who rely on ATMs. ""The case had threatened the viability of the ATM network, and risked the future of much-needed banking services across communities,"" a Co-Op spokesperson said. But the ruling now leaves a question mark over how the money raised from cash machines will be replaced. This year that is likely to amount to Â£44.54m, according to the business rates consultancy Altus. Cash machines inside shops will remain zero-rated, the court ruled ATM operator Cardtronics was also involved in bringing the case. Jerry Schurder, the head of business rates at Gerald Eve, which represented Cardtronics, said: ""Retailers with ATMs within their properties will be extremely pleased at a decision that will lead to both refunds for previous payments backdated as far as April 2010 and reductions to future bills. ""The UK's High Street is under enormous pressure from all directions, and a big part of this has been the unfair nature of the business rates system."" The Appeal Court also rejected an attempt by the Valuation Office to get retailers to pay business rates on machines inside their shops as well. This would have hit many small shops and convenience stores. ""We especially welcome the Court's rejection of the Valuation Office's attempt to separately rate internal machines, the consequences of which would have been dire,"" tweeted Mr Schurder. The Valuation Office said it was now considering its position.

"Charlotte, 38, is considering moving home as she is too old to qualify for IVF in her current area Women over 34 are being automatically refused IVF treatment on the NHS in 12 areas of England, the Victoria Derbyshire programme has found. IVF should be offered to women until age 42, guidelines say, but new figures show around 80% of areas are failing to do this. Campaign group Fertility Fairness said it ""penalises women who take longer to find a partner"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said ""blanket bans"" were ""not acceptable"". Couples in Wales and Scotland are offered IVF until they are 42, as long as certain criteria are met. 'The food supplement that ruined my liver' The murder that changed America SinÃ©ad O'Connor converts to Islam One 38-year-old woman, Charlotte - whose surname we are not using - told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she was considering moving house to a different area, having been told she was too old to qualify for the procedure in Southampton. Southampton City Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) has a cut-off age for women of 34. ""It's just unfair, because I am not over the hill,"" she said. ""To say that 35 and over is the end of having children is ridiculous."" Charlotte was first tested aged 34, and said the ""most upsetting"" aspect was not being told about the age limit sooner. ""I would have liked to have known when I was younger,"" she said. ""It would have enabled us to make a decision earlier about selling the house, and given us another year on what is already a timed situation."" Southampton City CCG said it had ""taken into account the relative cost-effectiveness [of IVF] compared to other treatments that could be funded with the resources we have available"". Guidelines from health watchdog NICE recommend that women under 40 should be offered three full cycles of IVF, and those between 40 and 42 one full cycle. But data from all 195 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England - obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by Fertility Fairness and analysed by the Victoria Derbyshire programme - shows that seven have stopped offering IVF on the NHS entirely. Of the others, 12 deny treatment to women over 34 - offering only one full cycle to those under that age. 85 CCGs, some 43% of the total, have cut IVF for women over 39. England's Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Victoria Derbyshire such restrictions were ""not acceptable"". ""Decisions on the treatments that are made available to people should be made on their clinical need,"" he said. ""There is a reason we have guidelines in the first place - and that's to provide the standard the country should expect."" The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists blamed ""inadequate government funding"". It said it was ""very concerned that women and their partners are turning to costly private clinics for treatment"". This video can not be played Happy Birthday IVF: Five things you might not know Sarah Norcross, co-chair of campaign group Fertility Fairness, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme that it ""penalises the women who take longer to find a partner or wish to put themselves on a secure financial footing before trying to conceive"". The group's 2018 report into IVF rationing found that 30 CCGs have ""slashed NHS fertility services"" in the last two years. It said many CCGs were setting their own access criteria - with 27% now using a man's body mass index (BMI) to determine whether a couple can be referred for IVF on the NHS, and 8% stipulating men must be aged below 55. NHS England said in a statement: ""Ultimately these are decisions for local GPs, who rightly decide how best to balance the various competing demands on the NHS.""

"Women who regularly eat fast food and not enough fruit are more likely to struggle to conceive, a study suggests. A survey of 5,598 women found those who ate fast food four or more times a week took nearly a month longer to get pregnant than those who never or rarely ate it. Regular junk food eaters were also less likely to conceive within a year,the report in Human Reproduction found,external. Experts said it suggested a good diet boosted the chances of conceiving. However, there were some limitations to the study, including that it relied on women having to remember what they had eaten before pregnancy. Painkillers may affect babies' fertility Fully funding IVF 'would improve safety' Women in Australia, New Zealand, the UK and Ireland were quizzed about what they had eaten in the month before they became pregnant with their first child. Midwives visited the women when they were about 14-16 weeks pregnant and asked them how often they ate fruit, green leafy vegetables and fish, as well as foods, such as burgers, pizza, fried chicken and chips, from fast food outlets. Researchers found the women who had eaten fruit less than one to three times a month took on average half a month longer to become pregnant than those who had eaten it three or more times a day. They also calculate that the women with the lowest intake of fruit had a 12% risk of having been unable to conceive within a year, while this was 16% for those who had eaten fast food four or more times a week. This compared with a risk of 8% in the group as a whole. Couples were excluded from the analysis if the male partner was receiving fertility treatment. Prof Claire Roberts, from the University of Adelaide, Australia, who led the study, said: ""These findings show that eating a good quality diet that includes fruit and minimising fast food consumption improves fertility and reduces the time it takes to get pregnant."" UK's most polluted towns and cities revealed Plus-size model praised for unedited pics WATCH: Are you fat on the inside? However, while researchers found an association between the consumption of fruit and fast foods and the time it took to get pregnant, perhaps surprisingly their study found no link with eating green leafy vegetables and fish. Although the study was large, it incorporated only a limited range of foods. Information on the fathers' diets was not collected, and it is possible that other unknown factors might have affected the results, researchers said. But experts said it still added to evidence that women's diet before pregnancy had an impact on their chances of conceiving. Dr Gino Pecoraro, a senior Lecturer at the University of Queensland, who was not involved in the research, said: ""Generally, the study does support what most health professionals would intuitively believe - having a healthy diet is good for couples trying to conceive.""

"BTS have seen huge success within and outside South Korea A Japanese TV show has cancelled an appearance by hugely popular K-pop group BTS, amid controversy over a shirt worn by one of the band members. A picture of Jimin wearing a T-shirt depicting the US atomic bombing of Japan, which killed hundreds of thousands of people, started being shared online. It stirred anger among some Japanese BTS fans, who called it an ""insult"". BTS later apologised to its fans for not being able to make an appearance.,external The ""atomic bomb"" T-shirt also featured Korean independence slogans. It was seen by some in Japan as celebrating the bomb which eventually led to the independence of the Korean peninsula from Japanese colonial rule. Japan and Korea's shared wartime history remains an extremely sensitive topic in both countries. BTS, a seven-member Korean pop group, was originally scheduled to perform on TV Asahi's Music Station show on 9 November. ""A t-shirt design worn by one of the members caused controversy... we had been discussing it with the record label.However, we decided to postpone their appearance this time,"" said TV Asahi in a statement published online.,external It is unclear when exactly Jimin wore the shirt in question, but pictures of him in it started circulating online in October. Who are BTS? K-pop star gives speech at the UN The shirt, which is still available for sale online,,externalbears the slogan ""Patriotism Our History Liberation Korea"" and features an iconic photo of the atomic bomb dropped on a Japanese city. During the Second World War in 1945, two atomic bombs were dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki - the first and only time atomic bombs were used in a war. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed instantly and many more died in the years to come as a result of radiation sickness. Atomic bomb mushroom clouds over Hiroshima (left) and Nagasaki (right) The bombings led to Japan's surrender and the end of World War Two in Asia- as well as the end of Japan's colonial rule of the Korean peninsula which began in 1910. There are conflicting reports as to when exactly Jimin wore the shirt. Some Korean media reports say it was worn last year while others say he wore it on 15 August this year to mark Korea's Liberation Day. Photos of Jimin in the shirt started to gain traction on social media in early November. It wasn't long before the Japanese words for #Unforgiveable and #AtomicBomb started trending on Twitter - and some Japanese social media users were furious. ""I am a resident of Hiroshima, I will not allow BTS to appear on the Music Station. They made a joke of the atomic bomb,"" one Twitter user had said ahead of the cancelled performance.

"Rehana Popal said more solicitors and barristers need to share their experiences The only female Afghan barrister in England and Wales says she has become numb to discrimination after a client sacked her to appoint a white man. Rehana Popal said other clients have told her they wanted someone white ""because the judge will believe them"". She said it suggested there was a ""serious concern"" with how the justice system was being perceived. The Ministry of Justice said it was committed to increasing the diversity of the judiciary. Ms Popal, an immigration and civil law specialist barrister at 10 KBW chambers in the Temple,tweeted:,external""Just had a solicitor call to tell me... the client has said he doesn't want an Asian female but a white male barrister."" The barrister, who came to the UK as a child refugee, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme it had happened several times before and was ""just sadly the reality"" of what ethnic minorities faced at the Bar. ""They will have had to hold some prejudicial views, for them to have come to say that,"" she explained, ""but equally there is a serious problem here in relation to perception, because clients have thought their cases will be more likely to be believed by a judge if it is presented by a white male barrister. ""That is a serious concern, because if they're having that perception, then there's something wrong with how the justice system is being perceived by outsiders and that needs to be remedied urgently."" Ms Popal said the sad thing was she had become ""numb"" to it as it had happened so often. ""When it happened it's almost 'eye-roll, here it happens again'. The first time it happened it was heartbreaking...but I've just got to shrug it off, move on and let my work speak for itself."" Legal aid: Barristers to strike over 'relentless cuts' Government says diversity target for judges is 'wrong way' Bias against ethnic minorities 'needs to be tackled' in justice system She said she had an overwhelming response to her tweet, with both male and female lawyers saying they had been dis-instructed because of their race or religion. ""There needs to be an honest dialogue, more solicitors need to come out and say this is an issue they have faced and how they have dealt with it,"" she said. The Bar Council, which represents the 15,000 practising barristers in England and Wales, told solicitors they needed to challenge clients who discriminated against barristers because of their gender, race or any other protected characteristic. Andrew Walker QC said: ""Wherever discrimination does arise, it must be challenged by all branches of the legal profession. The close working relationship between barristers, their clerks and solicitors means that no-one should turn a blind eye."" The Ministry of Justice said in a statement: ""The Lord Chancellor is committed to increasing the diversity of our world-renowned judiciary, and we are pleased that recent statistics show increased black and ethnic minority and gender representation. ""But we know more must be done, and we recently launched a programme to help more candidates from under-represented groups apply to be judges."" But Ms Popal said the MoJ needed to do more in the recruitment and retention of female barristers and solicitors, as they were the people who would later become judges. ""There needs to be a better campaign in recruiting them from BME backgrounds and more women, so eventually, in 10-15 years, when it comes to recruiting from the profession for the judiciary, they have a wider pool to choose from,"" she said.

"A total of nine mining rigs were found installed at the school in Hunan A Chinese headmaster has been fired after a secret stack of crypto-currency mining machines was found connected to his school's electricity supply. Teachers at the school in Hunan became suspicious of a whirring noise that continued day and night, local media report. This led to the discovery of the machines, which were mining the crypto-currency Ethereum. They racked up an electricity bill of 14,700 yuan (Â£1,600). The excessive electricity consumption had previously been reported to the headmaster, Lei Hua, but he reportedly dismissed it as being caused by air conditioners and heating devices. Bitcoin energy use in Iceland set to overtake homes Russian nuclear scientists arrested for 'Bitcoin mining plot' Mining crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum involves connecting computers, usually specialised ""mining machines"", to the currency network. By providing computing power for validating transactions on that network, mining-machine owners are rewarded with newly generated coins, making it a potentially lucrative exercise - especially when done at scale. This video can not be played Bitcoin explained: How do crypto-currencies work? In this case, a total of eight mining machines were installed in the Hunan school's computer room between summer 2017 and summer 2018. The headmaster had originally spent 10,000 yuan on a single machine for use at home, but allegedly decided to move it to the school after he saw how much electricity it consumed. The deputy headmaster also became involved in the scheme and allegedly acquired a ninth machine for himself in January, which was also installed at the school. The computer network in the building became overloaded as a result of the mining activity, according to reports, and this ""interfered"" with teaching. The headmaster was fired in October and his deputy received an official warning. A local authority responsible for ""discipline inspection"" has claimed the money that was made through the mining activities. ""The noise and heat of nine actively running mining machines would have been very noticeable,"" said Matthew Hickey, a cyber-security expert at Hacker House. ""Sadly, stealing electricity is one way that people have tried to maximize their revenue - by avoiding those costs it can drastically improve returns on a mining operation."" Surreptitious crypto-currency mining has been discovered elsewhere. In February,several scientists at a top-secret Russian nuclear warhead facility were arrestedfor allegedly mining Bitcoin with the facility's supercomputers.

Theresa May has used the words of World One War poets to pay tribute to fallen soldiers in France and Belgium. Visiting the St Symphorien Military Cemetery in Mons with the Belgian prime minister, she laid wreaths at the graves of the first and last UK soldiers killed in the war. Using words from a 1914 poem, she thanked those who died for being ""staunch to the end"". Her visit comes ahead of the Armistice Centenary this Sunday. During her trip to France, she and French President Emmanuel Macron paid their respects at the Thiepval Memorial, which commemorates more than 72,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers. Mr Macron's British great-grandfather, Bristol-born butcher George William Robertson, fought at the Somme and was decorated for bravery. He stayed in France after the war.

Living history:Why 'indecent' Armistice Day parties ended The prime minister visited a French cemetery on Friday afternoon In the ceremony at Mons on Friday morning, the prime minister - accompanied by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel - laid wreaths at the graves of Londoner John Parr, the first UK soldier to be killed in 1914, and the last, George Ellison. Mr Ellison, who was born in York and lived in Leeds, was killed on the Western Front at 09:30 GMT, before the Armistice came into effect at 11:00, 100 years ago this Sunday. The two men's graves are opposite each other at the cemetery. Messages on poppy wreaths were taken from poems, with the one on Mr Ellison's grave bearing lines from Laurence Binyon, reading: ""They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted. We will remember them."" Mrs May chose lines from Rupert Brooke's sonnet The Soldier for Mr Parr's grave, writing ""in that rich earth a richer dust concealed"". Mrs May quoted a 1914 poem by Laurence Binyon, in a card left at the grave of George Ellison Lines from a Rupert Brooke poem were written on the card left at Mr Parr's grave Theresa May bowed her head at the grave of Private Ellison, the last British soldier to be killed in the war On the way to the cemetery in Mons, a policeman on a motorbike was hurt when a vehicle tried to drive between Mrs May and Mr Michel's convoys - not realising there were two separate convoys. A spokesman for Mr Michel said the policeman and another officer, who was also on a motorbike, ""had to manoeuvre so as not to crash into that car"" and ""narrowly escaped crashing into the Belgian prime minister's vehicle"". The officer fell off his bike and was ""injured but not heavily so"", the spokesman said. Mr Michel got out of his car to make sure the policeman was OK and waited for an ambulance to arrive.

Mrs May stood alongside Belgium's Prime Minister Charles Michel at the ceremony at the St Symphorien Military Cemetery Mrs May and Mr Michel later attended a reception, where they met British and Belgian serving members of the armed forces. The prime minister then travelled to France to meet Mr Macron in Albert, a town in the heart of the Somme region of France which suffered heavy bombardment during World War One. Mrs May and the French president had a private meeting and working lunch before attending the war cemetery. The two leaders laid a wreath at the French-British memorial at Thiepval in northern France The pair were also shown graves at the cemetery The two leaders then attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the nearby Thiepval Memorial. A wreath combining the poppy and le bleuet (or cornflower) - the two national emblems of remembrance for Britain and France - was made for the occasion. On the wreath, Mrs May left a card with an extract from poem A Soldier's Cemetery by Sergeant John William Streets, reading: ""There lie the flower of youth, the men who scorn'd to live (so died) when languished liberty."" Mrs May said the visit was a chance to reflect on the time the countries spent fighting side by side in Europe, but also to look ahead to a ""shared future, built on peace, prosperity and friendship"". She said the ceremony at Mons was ""a fitting and poignant symbol"" for ""every member of the armed forces who gave their lives to protect what we hold so dear"".

Messages on poppy wreaths were taken from poems, with the one on Mr Ellison's grave bearing lines from Laurence Binyon, reading: ""They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted. We will remember them."" Mrs May chose lines from Rupert Brooke's sonnet The Soldier for Mr Parr's grave, writing ""in that rich earth a richer dust concealed"". Mrs May quoted a 1914 poem by Laurence Binyon, in a card left at the grave of George Ellison Lines from a Rupert Brooke poem were written on the card left at Mr Parr's grave Theresa May bowed her head at the grave of Private Ellison, the last British soldier to be killed in the war On the way to the cemetery in Mons, a policeman on a motorbike was hurt when a vehicle tried to drive between Mrs May and Mr Michel's convoys - not realising there were two separate convoys. A spokesman for Mr Michel said the policeman and another officer, who was also on a motorbike, ""had to manoeuvre so as not to crash into that car"" and ""narrowly escaped crashing into the Belgian prime minister's vehicle"". The officer fell off his bike and was ""injured but not heavily so"", the spokesman said. Mr Michel got out of his car to make sure the policeman was OK and waited for an ambulance to arrive. Mrs May and her companions were in front so did not see what happened but were briefed afterwards. Mrs May stood alongside Belgium's Prime Minister Charles Michel at the ceremony at the St Symphorien Military Cemetery Mrs May and Mr Michel later attended a reception, where they met British and Belgian serving members of the armed forces. The prime minister then travelled to France to meet Mr Macron in Albert, a town in the heart of the Somme region of France which suffered heavy bombardment during World War One. Mrs May and the French president had a private meeting and working lunch before attending the war cemetery. The two leaders laid a wreath at the French-British memorial at Thiepval in northern France The pair were also shown graves at the cemetery The two leaders then attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the nearby Thiepval Memorial. A wreath combining the poppy and le bleuet (or cornflower) - the two national emblems of remembrance for Britain and France - was made for the occasion. On the wreath, Mrs May left a card with an extract from poem A Soldier's Cemetery by Sergeant John William Streets, reading: ""There lie the flower of youth, the men who scorn'd to live (so died) when languished liberty."" Mrs May said the visit was a chance to reflect on the time the countries spent fighting side by side in Europe, but also to look ahead to a ""shared future, built on peace, prosperity and friendship"". She said the ceremony at Mons was ""a fitting and poignant symbol"" for ""every member of the armed forces who gave their lives to protect what we hold so dear"". ""We remember the heroes who lost their lives in the horror of the trenches. As the sun sets on 100 years of remembrance, we will never forget their sacrifice.""

"England's previous away win came against Bangladesh in 2016 First Test, Galle (day four of five) England 342 & 322-6 dec:Jennings 146*, Stokes 62 Sri Lanka 203 & 250:Mathews 53; Moeen 4-71, Leach 3-60 England win by 211 runs Scorecard England completed a thumping 211-run victory on day four of the first Test against Sri Lanka to end their 13-match winless streak away from home. The tourists steadily took top-order wickets in the first two sessions before taking the final five after tea. Moeen Ali claimed 4-71 and Jack Leach 3-60, while Adil Rashid and Ben Stokes picked up a wicket each. The win puts England 1-0 up in the three-match series and is their first in an overseas Test since October 2016. Between them, the tourists' three spinners took 16 wickets in the match - the second best return by English spinners in a Test since 1958. A dominant performance from England over the first three days had left Sri Lanka needing to bat out the final two days to draw - or score a record 462 to win. Beginning the day 15-0, the hosts survived the first hour unscathed but lost three quick wickets before lunch. Angelo Mathews offered resistance with 53 but he chipped Moeen to mid-wicket shortly after tea as England closed in. Rangana Herath - playing in his final Test - was the last wicket to fall, run out by Stokes. The win is Joe Root's first as captain away from home and is England's first at Galle. ""It is right up there as one of my best wins,"" said Root. ""We were in control for the majority of the game which shows how skilful and consistent we have been. ""As a group we have all contributed in some form but to see young inexperienced guys put together really important match-wining performances is really pleasing. It shows the plans are right, the preparation is right."" Hard to pick team from 'fantastic squad' says Root - plus select your XI TMS podcast: A win overseas and wicket-taking number threes Moeen Ali (left) finished with match figures of 8-137 England's bowling attack has struggled for potency overseas in recent years, but here Root was able to call on a variety of bowlers who all contributed. Root started day four with seamers James Anderson and Sam Curran before turning quickly to spin when there continued to be no swing. He first introduced left-arm spinner Leach, followed by off-spinner Moeen, and the pair removed the Sri Lanka openers, with Leach trapping Kaushal Silva lbw for 30 and Moeen catching Dimuth Karunaratne off his own bowling for 26. All-rounder Stokes had a light workload with the ball in this Test but he dismissed Dhananjaya de Silva on the stroke of lunch and bowled a hostile spell after the interval. He peppered Mathews and Kusal Mendis with excellent short bowling and should have had been rewarded with another wicket but Anderson dropped a simple catch from Mathews. Leach bowled a long, accurate spell in the afternoon session and claimed the two wickets to fall, having Mendis caught at mid-off and bowling Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal with a brilliant spinning delivery. Moeen then returned after tea and for the second time in the match took a wicket with the first ball of the final session, this time having Dhananjaya de Silva caught by Stokes at slip. Shortly afterwards Moeen saw off Mathews and leg-spinner Rashid claimed his first wicket of the innings by dismissing Dilruwan Perera for an aggressive 30, before the victory was sealed by the run out of Herath. Other than Root, who bowled one over on day four, every England bowler took a wicket in the match but it will be the spinners who pleased the England captain most. Their combined 16 wickets is the second-best spinners' haul for England for 60 years, beaten only by the 19 Graeme Swann and Monty Panesar shared in Mumbai in 2012. ""The spinners performed beautifully,"" Root added. ""They controlled when required, attacked when they could and I always felt we would take wickets throughout the game."" England wicketkeeper Ben Foakes, who scored a first-innings century, was man of the match on his debut England's losing run overseas stretched back all the way to 30 October 2016 when they lost to Bangladesh in Dhaka. Since then England have lost series 4-0 in both India and Australia, plus 1-0 in New Zealand earlier this year, with three draws accompanying the nine defeats. Previously at Galle England had drawn twice and lost twice but on this occasion, after being reduced to 103-5 before lunch on day one, they then dominated the match. As well as the bowlers the batsmen also contributed, with man-of-the-match Ben Foakes and Keaton Jennings hitting centuries in the first and second innings respectively. ""To be able to contribute to the team is just amazing,"" Foakes said. ""It has been one of the best weeks of my career so far, if not the best. ""It's a dream come true."" A win in the second Test in Pallekele, starting on Wednesday, would seal England's first away series win since beating South Africa in 2016. Rangana Herath made his Test debut in 1999 For Sri Lanka, the final wicket summed up their disappointing performance in this Test. Their bowlers were not as effective as England's, their fielding disappointed and some of their batsmen again fell to reckless shots on the fourth day. Making an albeit unlikely attempt to save the Test, Karunaratne was out attacking Moeen, hitting the ball straight back for a catch in the morning session, and Mendis foolishly charged down the wicket and skewed a shot to mid-off. The ball before Dhananjaya edged to Stokes at first slip in the final over before lunch, he had played a wild drive to the Durham all-rounder which had been given out caught behind, only to be overturned on review. Herath's dismissal - sprawled in the dirt after failing to beat Stokes' powerful throw - was an ignominious finish for a player who ended with 433 Test wickets - putting him joint eighth on the all-time list - but also a strange one as he had called for the risky second run. The 40-year-old's team-mates celebrated his retirement at the end of play by carrying the spinner around his home ground on their shoulders but Sri Lanka will now have to do without him for the remaining two Tests. ""It's a hard day for us, because we know how much Rangana has done for the team and Sri Lanka cricket,"" reflected Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal, who struggled in this match with a groin injury sustained while fielding. ""We'll have to say 'sorry' to him, we couldn't give him a really good farewell. ""Our batting was below par during the game, you can't stay in the game [with this kind of batting]. ""Credit goes to England, they played some outstanding cricket. We had a really good start in the first session but we couldn't capitalise on it."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan on The Cricket Social podcast:""It's been a tremendous performance. ""They have been testing conditions and after the first session on the first day, England produced a wonderfully professional performance. ""They played proper Test cricket and it was the youngster Ben Foakes who led the way, then Keaton Jennings scored a hundred in the second innings. ""Those two players have been the difference between the sides. ""The variations Joe Root has got in the field are wonderful and England can be very proud of the way they played. ""I hope they are honest, though - yes, celebrate a win but be realistic that a better team wouldn't have allowed them back into the Test match after that first morning. ""This England team, though, has got everything it needs to be an outstanding Test match team - they have power, variations, three spin options and they just need to find the right mentality at the top of the order and read situations better. ""I suppose they don't have a 95mph bowler, but not many sides do. I just hope they use this opportunity to build some momentum this winter, against Sri Lanka and West Indies, heading into next summer's Ashes series.""

"Retailers will no longer have to pay millions of pounds in business rates for cash machines outside their shops, following a ruling by the Appeal Court. Since 2010 supermarkets and convenience stores have been liable to pay rates on the machines. But the court ruled that about Â£300m they have already been charged will now have to be refunded. Part of that money will have to come from the government, and part from local authorities. The shops that will immediately benefit include Sainsbury's and Tesco, which had taken the case to appeal. The court also decided that The Valuation Office - which brought the original case - should not be allowed to appeal to the Supreme Court. However the Valuation Office can still petition the Supreme Court should it wish to do so. Cash machines close at record rate The High Streets with too many ATMs Tesco said it welcomed the judgement, which applies only to England and Wales. ""We recognise the vital role that ATMs play in the daily lives of our customers and remain committed to providing this service to them,"" a spokesperson said. ""We welcome today's result and the confirmation of our belief that ATMs should not be separately rateable."" The Co-Op said it was a victory for people who rely on ATMs. ""The case had threatened the viability of the ATM network, and risked the future of much-needed banking services across communities,"" a Co-Op spokesperson said. But the ruling now leaves a question mark over how the money raised from cash machines will be replaced. This year that is likely to amount to Â£44.54m, according to the business rates consultancy Altus. Cash machines inside shops will remain zero-rated, the court ruled ATM operator Cardtronics was also involved in bringing the case. Jerry Schurder, the head of business rates at Gerald Eve, which represented Cardtronics, said: ""Retailers with ATMs within their properties will be extremely pleased at a decision that will lead to both refunds for previous payments backdated as far as April 2010 and reductions to future bills. ""The UK's High Street is under enormous pressure from all directions, and a big part of this has been the unfair nature of the business rates system."" The Appeal Court also rejected an attempt by the Valuation Office to get retailers to pay business rates on machines inside their shops as well. This would have hit many small shops and convenience stores. ""We especially welcome the Court's rejection of the Valuation Office's attempt to separately rate internal machines, the consequences of which would have been dire,"" tweeted Mr Schurder. The Valuation Office said it was now considering its position.

"BTS have seen huge success within and outside South Korea A Japanese TV show has cancelled an appearance by hugely popular K-pop group BTS, amid controversy over a shirt worn by one of the band members. A picture of Jimin wearing a T-shirt depicting the US atomic bombing of Japan, which killed hundreds of thousands of people, started being shared online. It stirred anger among some Japanese BTS fans, who called it an ""insult"". BTS later apologised to its fans for not being able to make an appearance.,external The ""atomic bomb"" T-shirt also featured Korean independence slogans. It was seen by some in Japan as celebrating the bomb which eventually led to the independence of the Korean peninsula from Japanese colonial rule. Japan and Korea's shared wartime history remains an extremely sensitive topic in both countries. BTS, a seven-member Korean pop group, was originally scheduled to perform on TV Asahi's Music Station show on 9 November. ""A t-shirt design worn by one of the members caused controversy... we had been discussing it with the record label.However, we decided to postpone their appearance this time,"" said TV Asahi in a statement published online.,external It is unclear when exactly Jimin wore the shirt in question, but pictures of him in it started circulating online in October. Who are BTS? K-pop star gives speech at the UN The shirt, which is still available for sale online,,externalbears the slogan ""Patriotism Our History Liberation Korea"" and features an iconic photo of the atomic bomb dropped on a Japanese city. During the Second World War in 1945, two atomic bombs were dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki - the first and only time atomic bombs were used in a war. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed instantly and many more died in the years to come as a result of radiation sickness. Atomic bomb mushroom clouds over Hiroshima (left) and Nagasaki (right) The bombings led to Japan's surrender and the end of World War Two in Asia- as well as the end of Japan's colonial rule of the Korean peninsula which began in 1910. There are conflicting reports as to when exactly Jimin wore the shirt. Some Korean media reports say it was worn last year while others say he wore it on 15 August this year to mark Korea's Liberation Day. Photos of Jimin in the shirt started to gain traction on social media in early November. It wasn't long before the Japanese words for #Unforgiveable and #AtomicBomb started trending on Twitter - and some Japanese social media users were furious. ""I am a resident of Hiroshima, I will not allow BTS to appear on the Music Station. They made a joke of the atomic bomb,"" one Twitter user had said ahead of the cancelled performance.

"Claire Busby said her super king-size double divan was in a ""defective state"" (stock image) A woman left paralysed after being ""catapulted"" from her new bed during sex has lost a seven-figure damages claim. Claire Busby, 46, suffered spinal injuries when she landed on her head after shifting position and falling from the super king-size double divan. She said a ""defective"" product supplied by Berkshire Bed Company, trading as Beds Are Uzzz, was to blame. But a High Court judge ruled the case was a ""tragic accident"". Rejecting her case, Judge Barry Cotter found the bed was ""not defective"", and the claim had failed. The court previously heard Ms Busby, of Maidenhead, Berkshire, was having sex with her then partner John Marshall a week after the bed was delivered. Claire Busby suffered spinal injuries when she fell from the super king-size double divan She told the court she had been kneeling before she ""swung her legs"" out from underneath her, causing the bed to give way. ""I spun around, I put my hand down and then I felt like I was catapulted off the back,"" she said. ""I fell to the side and heard what felt like a spring in my body snap"". Mr Marshall said he had been badly affected by the accident,which he had initially laughed off. Ms Busby claimed the bed had not been properly assembled when it was received in August 2013 - which was denied by lawyers for the company. The firm had argued the lovers had ""simply lost balance and toppled backwards"" as a result of being too close to the edge of the mattress. In his ruling, Judge Cotter said the ""simple accident"" was caused by ""a most unfortunate and unusual combination of positioning on the bed and movement,"" he said. The judge said Ms Busby had no means of support, other than placing her arm down on the bed, as she attempted to swing her legs around from underneath her in what was ""not an easy manoeuvre"". He added: ""Having carefully considered the totality of the evidence I am not satisfied that the difference in level between the two divans played any part in Ms Busby's loss of balance backwards. ""Rather, I am satisfied that this was a simple but tragic fall; she simply overbalanced probably in part because she was sitting on a mattress as opposed to a firm surface, and underestimated the amount of give underneath her body."" Richard Manders, director of Berkshire Bed Company, said: ""We are delighted the court has ruled in our favour. ""We are sorry that Ms Busby was injured and we wish her and her family well for the future.""

"About 14 shops are closing every day as UK High Streets face their toughest trading climate in five years, a report has found. A net 1,123 stores disappeared from Britain's top 500 high streets in the first six months of the year, according to the accountancy firm PwC. It said fashion and electrical stores had suffered most as customers did more shopping online. Restaurants and pubs also floundered as fewer people go out to eat or drink. New Look may lose more than 120 UK stores UK's 'unhealthiest' High Streets revealed Will Hammond's Budget save the High Street? London was the worst-hit region, PwC said, while Wales had the lowest number of closures. ""Looking ahead, the turmoil facing the sector is unlikely to abate,"" said Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC. ""Store closures in the second half of the year due to administrations and company voluntary arrangements [a form of insolvency] already announced will further intensify the situation."" According to PwC, 2,692 shops shut across the UK in the first half of 2018, while only 1,569 new stores opened. The data looks at retail chains with more than five outlets. Electrical goods stores were among the biggest casualties, largely due to the collapse of Maplin in February that resulted in 50 stores being closed. Italian restaurants also struggled, as Jamie's Italian and Prezzo both shut stores after striking rescue deals with their creditors, while Strada also made closures. PwC said there was net decline of 104 fashion shops and 99 pubs as openings failed to replace closures ""at a fast enough rate"". There were some bright spots, however, with supermarkets, booksellers, ice cream parlours and coffee shops all seeing slim net gains in their store counts. According to PwC, Greater London had the largest number of store closures of any UK region, with a fall of 716, while only 448 were opened. None of the UK regions analysed by PwC recorded a net gain in store count in the first six months of the year. Newcastle fared worst in the North East, with a net decline of 17 stores, while Nottingham fell by 35. Other cities that suffered included Leeds, which opened nine stores but closed 35, and Reading where there were 39 closures and only 18 openings. Retailers are facing a perfect storm of pressures as consumers rein in their spending and do more of their shopping online. As a result, many retailers have found themselves struggling to pay their rents and other overheads, such as a rising minimum wage and business rates. In last month's Budget, Chancellor Philip Hammond promised to spend Â£900m on reducing the business rates bill of 500,000 small retailers by a third. He also promised a new tax for online firms that employ fewer staff and pay far lower business rates. However, the British Retail Consortium said the chancellor was ""tinkering around the edges"" and called for ""wholesale reform"" of the business rates system. Jake Berry, the minister responsible for High Streets, said the government was determined to make them thrive. ""We have created a Â£675m fund to help high streets adapt, slashed business rates ... and are creating a task force guided by Sir John Timpson, one of the UK's most experienced retailers, to ensure that High Streets are adapting for rapid change and are fit for the future,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Theresa May met the leaders of France and Belgium for Armistice remembrance ceremonies. Theresa May has used the words of World One War poets to pay tribute to fallen soldiers in France and Belgium. Visiting the St Symphorien Military Cemetery in Mons with the Belgian prime minister, she laid wreaths at the graves of the first and last UK soldiers killed in the war. Using words from a 1914 poem, she thanked those who died for being ""staunch to the end"". Her visit comes ahead of the Armistice Centenary this Sunday. During her trip to France, she and French President Emmanuel Macron paid their respects at the Thiepval Memorial, which commemorates more than 72,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers. Mr Macron's British great-grandfather, Bristol-born butcher George William Robertson, fought at the Somme and was decorated for bravery. He stayed in France after the war. Long read:The forgotten female soldier on the forgotten frontline Video:War footage brought alive in colour Interactive:,externalWhat would you have done between 1914 and 1918? Living history:Why 'indecent' Armistice Day parties ended The prime minister visited a French cemetery on Friday afternoon In the ceremony at Mons on Friday morning, the prime minister - accompanied by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel - laid wreaths at the graves of Londoner John Parr, the first UK soldier to be killed in 1914, and the last, George Ellison. Mr Ellison, who was born in York and lived in Leeds, was killed on the Western Front at 09:30 GMT, before the Armistice came into effect at 11:00, 100 years ago this Sunday. The two men's graves are opposite each other at the cemetery. Messages on poppy wreaths were taken from poems, with the one on Mr Ellison's grave bearing lines from Laurence Binyon, reading: ""They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted. We will remember them."" Mrs May chose lines from Rupert Brooke's sonnet The Soldier for Mr Parr's grave, writing ""in that rich earth a richer dust concealed"". Mrs May quoted a 1914 poem by Laurence Binyon, in a card left at the grave of George Ellison Lines from a Rupert Brooke poem were written on the card left at Mr Parr's grave Theresa May bowed her head at the grave of Private Ellison, the last British soldier to be killed in the war On the way to the cemetery in Mons, a policeman on a motorbike was hurt when a vehicle tried to drive between Mrs May and Mr Michel's convoys - not realising there were two separate convoys. A spokesman for Mr Michel said the policeman and another officer, who was also on a motorbike, ""had to manoeuvre so as not to crash into that car"" and ""narrowly escaped crashing into the Belgian prime minister's vehicle"". The officer fell off his bike and was ""injured but not heavily so"", the spokesman said. Mr Michel got out of his car to make sure the policeman was OK and waited for an ambulance to arrive. Mrs May and her companions were in front so did not see what happened but were briefed afterwards. Mrs May stood alongside Belgium's Prime Minister Charles Michel at the ceremony at the St Symphorien Military Cemetery Mrs May and Mr Michel later attended a reception, where they met British and Belgian serving members of the armed forces. The prime minister then travelled to France to meet Mr Macron in Albert, a town in the heart of the Somme region of France which suffered heavy bombardment during World War One. Mrs May and the French president had a private meeting and working lunch before attending the war cemetery. The two leaders laid a wreath at the French-British memorial at Thiepval in northern France The pair were also shown graves at the cemetery The two leaders then attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the nearby Thiepval Memorial. A wreath combining the poppy and le bleuet (or cornflower) - the two national emblems of remembrance for Britain and France - was made for the occasion. On the wreath, Mrs May left a card with an extract from poem A Soldier's Cemetery by Sergeant John William Streets, reading: ""There lie the flower of youth, the men who scorn'd to live (so died) when languished liberty."" Mrs May said the visit was a chance to reflect on the time the countries spent fighting side by side in Europe, but also to look ahead to a ""shared future, built on peace, prosperity and friendship"". She said the ceremony at Mons was ""a fitting and poignant symbol"" for ""every member of the armed forces who gave their lives to protect what we hold so dear"".

"A total of nine mining rigs were found installed at the school in Hunan A Chinese headmaster has been fired after a secret stack of crypto-currency mining machines was found connected to his school's electricity supply. Teachers at the school in Hunan became suspicious of a whirring noise that continued day and night, local media report. This led to the discovery of the machines, which were mining the crypto-currency Ethereum. They racked up an electricity bill of 14,700 yuan (Â£1,600). The excessive electricity consumption had previously been reported to the headmaster, Lei Hua, but he reportedly dismissed it as being caused by air conditioners and heating devices. Bitcoin energy use in Iceland set to overtake homes Russian nuclear scientists arrested for 'Bitcoin mining plot' Mining crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum involves connecting computers, usually specialised ""mining machines"", to the currency network. By providing computing power for validating transactions on that network, mining-machine owners are rewarded with newly generated coins, making it a potentially lucrative exercise - especially when done at scale. This video can not be played Bitcoin explained: How do crypto-currencies work? In this case, a total of eight mining machines were installed in the Hunan school's computer room between summer 2017 and summer 2018. The headmaster had originally spent 10,000 yuan on a single machine for use at home, but allegedly decided to move it to the school after he saw how much electricity it consumed. The deputy headmaster also became involved in the scheme and allegedly acquired a ninth machine for himself in January, which was also installed at the school. The computer network in the building became overloaded as a result of the mining activity, according to reports, and this ""interfered"" with teaching. The headmaster was fired in October and his deputy received an official warning. A local authority responsible for ""discipline inspection"" has claimed the money that was made through the mining activities. ""The noise and heat of nine actively running mining machines would have been very noticeable,"" said Matthew Hickey, a cyber-security expert at Hacker House. ""Sadly, stealing electricity is one way that people have tried to maximize their revenue - by avoiding those costs it can drastically improve returns on a mining operation."" Surreptitious crypto-currency mining has been discovered elsewhere. In February,several scientists at a top-secret Russian nuclear warhead facility were arrestedfor allegedly mining Bitcoin with the facility's supercomputers.

"Fast food outlets in Blackpool, which has the third most unhealthy High Street in the UK Britain's High Streets are getting unhealthier, according to areport analysing 70 major UK towns and cities.,external The Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) ranked High Streets with more payday lenders, bookmakers, tanning salons and fast food outlets the worst. Grimsby led the unhealthy High Street list ahead of Walsall and Blackpool, while Edinburgh, Canterbury and Taunton had the healthiest outlets. There was a clear link between deprived areas and unhealthy High Streets. Outlets that were considered healthy included leisure centres, health services, libraries, museums and art galleries. The report also considered pubs and bars as being a positive presence on the High Street because they are centres for social interaction. However, pubs are in decline and many people are using the UK's 22,000 coffee shops as places to socialise, eat and drink instead. 'The food supplement that ruined my liver' Richer or poorer? Ask the calculator Ruddock 'deliberately broke Cole's legs' The number of fast-food outlets on UK streets rose by 4,000 between 2014 and 2017, mostly in deprived areas. The links between typically high-fat fast food, weight gain and obesity are well documented. Fast food outlets sometimes engage in what the RSPH report calls ""upselling""; where staff are trained to persuade customers to buy additional or larger portions. Payday lenders and bookmakers were considered unhealthy businesses because of the ""devastating consequences"" debt can have on health as well as on family and work life, the report said. London's High Streets were not considered in the report, as they have been ranked separately. Grimsby Walsall Blackpool Stoke-on-Trent Sunderland Northampton Bolton Wolverhampton Huddersfield Bradford Edinburgh Canterbury Taunton Shrewsbury Cheltenham York Brighton & Hove Eastbourne Exeter Cambridge The report paints a picture of the rapidly changing British High Street dominated by cafes and coffee shops, convenience stores, off-licences, vape shops and boarded-up premises. Vape shops were counted as a 'healthier' business, because of their role in discouraging smoking. However, the report added the ""precise long-term effects of vaping are unknown"". 'Five times more fast food' in poor areas Will Hammond's Budget save the High Street? Fast food shops 'flooding high streets' Shirley Cramer, RSPH chief executive said: ""When our time and money are converted into a loss at the bookmaker, a tan from a sunbed, a high-cost loan or a bucket of fried chicken, the High Street is enabling and supporting poor health behaviours. ""Our Health on the High Street rankings illustrate how unhealthy businesses concentrate in areas which already experience higher levels of deprivation, obesity and lower life expectancy. ""Reshaping these High Streets to be more health-promoting could serve as a tool to help redress this imbalance."" The RSPH developed what they call the ""Richter Scale of Health"" to evaluate the high streets. Each business was scored on the basis of whether it encouraged healthy lifestyle choices, promoted social interaction, mental wellbeing and greater access to health services. Scores ranged between 8 and -4.  Pubs, for example, scored 2 and libraries scored 5. Empty premises and tanning shops scored -1 and fast food shops -2. The scores for each outlet on the high street were added up and then divided by the total number of businesses on each street to reach a final score. Canterbury has the second healthiest High Street in the country Empty businesses on Freeman Street in Grimsby, which used to be the town's main shopping area The rise in online retail is linked to the growing numbers of empty premises, which have increased from 7% in 2007 to 11% in 2017. This year the High Street has seen several big name closures including Toys R Us and Maplin and, in this week's Budget, Chancellor Philip Hammond cut the business rates for small retailers, and proposed a new tax on online retailers in an effort to boost physical shops. An empty shop in Grimsby However industry bodies said the changes didn't go far enough. The RSPH is calling for further measures including urging local authorities to make vacant properties publicly accessible for what is known as ""meanwhile use"" - pop-up art galleries or community centres. The London rankings showed that the borough of Haringey boasted both the most unhealthy street, West Green Road in Seven Sisters, and the healthiest one, in Muswell Hill.

"This video can not be played Theresa May met the leaders of France and Belgium for Armistice remembrance ceremonies. Theresa May has used the words of World One War poets to pay tribute to fallen soldiers in France and Belgium. Visiting the St Symphorien Military Cemetery in Mons with the Belgian prime minister, she laid wreaths at the graves of the first and last UK soldiers killed in the war. Using words from a 1914 poem, she thanked those who died for being ""staunch to the end"". Her visit comes ahead of the Armistice Centenary this Sunday. During her trip to France, she and French President Emmanuel Macron paid their respects at the Thiepval Memorial, which commemorates more than 72,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers. Mr Macron's British great-grandfather, Bristol-born butcher George William Robertson, fought at the Somme and was decorated for bravery. He stayed in France after the war. Long read:The forgotten female soldier on the forgotten frontline Video:War footage brought alive in colour Interactive:,externalWhat would you have done between 1914 and 1918? Living history:Why 'indecent' Armistice Day parties ended The prime minister visited a French cemetery on Friday afternoon In the ceremony at Mons on Friday morning, the prime minister - accompanied by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel - laid wreaths at the graves of Londoner John Parr, the first UK soldier to be killed in 1914, and the last, George Ellison. Mr Ellison, who was born in York and lived in Leeds, was killed on the Western Front at 09:30 GMT, before the Armistice came into effect at 11:00, 100 years ago this Sunday. The two men's graves are opposite each other at the cemetery. Messages on poppy wreaths were taken from poems, with the one on Mr Ellison's grave bearing lines from Laurence Binyon, reading: ""They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted. We will remember them."" Mrs May chose lines from Rupert Brooke's sonnet The Soldier for Mr Parr's grave, writing ""in that rich earth a richer dust concealed"". Mrs May quoted a 1914 poem by Laurence Binyon, in a card left at the grave of George Ellison Lines from a Rupert Brooke poem were written on the card left at Mr Parr's grave Theresa May bowed her head at the grave of Private Ellison, the last British soldier to be killed in the war On the way to the cemetery in Mons, a policeman on a motorbike was hurt when a vehicle tried to drive between Mrs May and Mr Michel's convoys - not realising there were two separate convoys. A spokesman for Mr Michel said the policeman and another officer, who was also on a motorbike, ""had to manoeuvre so as not to crash into that car"" and ""narrowly escaped crashing into the Belgian prime minister's vehicle"". The officer fell off his bike and was ""injured but not heavily so"", the spokesman said. Mr Michel got out of his car to make sure the policeman was OK and waited for an ambulance to arrive. Mrs May and her companions were in front so did not see what happened but were briefed afterwards. Mrs May stood alongside Belgium's Prime Minister Charles Michel at the ceremony at the St Symphorien Military Cemetery Mrs May and Mr Michel later attended a reception, where they met British and Belgian serving members of the armed forces. The prime minister then travelled to France to meet Mr Macron in Albert, a town in the heart of the Somme region of France which suffered heavy bombardment during World War One. Mrs May and the French president had a private meeting and working lunch before attending the war cemetery. The two leaders laid a wreath at the French-British memorial at Thiepval in northern France The pair were also shown graves at the cemetery The two leaders then attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the nearby Thiepval Memorial. A wreath combining the poppy and le bleuet (or cornflower) - the two national emblems of remembrance for Britain and France - was made for the occasion. On the wreath, Mrs May left a card with an extract from poem A Soldier's Cemetery by Sergeant John William Streets, reading: ""There lie the flower of youth, the men who scorn'd to live (so died) when languished liberty."" Mrs May said the visit was a chance to reflect on the time the countries spent fighting side by side in Europe, but also to look ahead to a ""shared future, built on peace, prosperity and friendship"". She said the ceremony at Mons was ""a fitting and poignant symbol"" for ""every member of the armed forces who gave their lives to protect what we hold so dear"".

"A follow-up to Vine has been announced, two years after the six-second video app was shut down by Twitter. Byte will be a similar app to Vine, which helped launch the careers of stars including Shawn Mendes and Logan Paul. After Vine ended, those stars moved to its rivals Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube. Dom Hofmann - who co-founded Vine along with Rus Yusupov and Colin Kroll - said his new app would launch next spring. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Singer Shawn Mendes was also discovered on the app aged 15 after his Vine of Justin Bieber's song As Long As You Love Me went viral.

"Satanic Temple co-founder Lucien Greaves says the group's imagery is being misused The Satanic Temple activist group is suing the makers of TV series The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina for $50 million (Â£38m) over a statue. Netflix and Warner Bros allegedly copied the group's statue of the goat deity Baphomet in the programme. Both production companies have declined to comment on the lawsuit. Satanic Temple does not believe in a supernatural Satan, but instead seeks ""to encourage benevolence and empathy among all people"". Their lawsuit, filed on Thursday in New York, claims an icon similar to their own appears in four episodes of the series. Lucien Greaves, co-founder of the Satanic Temple, posted a tweet comparing their statue with that in the show. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is a supernatural programme on Netflix following Sabrina Spellman, a half-mortal half-witch teenager. It is based on a comic book of the same name, which also inspired the show Sabrina the Teenage Witch, a series which ran from 1996-2003. Characters in the show who worship the ""Dark Lord"" or Satan practise cannibalism and forced worship, and the Satanic Temple argues its members are being associated with these ""evil antagonists"". Mr Greaves confirmed the group was going to take legal action,externalagainst the show's production companies for ""appropriating our copyright monument design to promote their asinine Satanic Panic fiction"". Netflix's new stars of Sabrina unveiled Does the Sabrina reboot live up to the hype? The Satanic Temple created a statue of the goat deity Baphomet as part ofits campaign to ""complement and contrast"" a Ten Commandments monument in Oklahoma City,externalon the grounds of religious freedom. Mr Greaves told US broadcaster CNBC that Baphomet has ""come to represent us as a people"",externaland that the statue in Sabrina ""dilutes and denigrates"" their group. Founded in 2012, the group works to ensure the separation of church and state and holds Satan as a symbol of ""opposition to arbitrary authority"". With fifteen official chapterhouses in the US, the group's membership soared off the back of the election of Donald Trump in 2016.

"The new chairwoman of the Parole Board has said it is a ""significant concern"" that none of its 240 members is black. Caroline Corby said just 13 members were from an ethnic minority. She said ""unconscious bias"" had affected recruitment for the board, which decides when serious offenders in England and Wales can leave jail. Mrs Corby replaced Nick Hardwick, who was forced to quit after the High Court overturned the board's decision to free serial sex offender John Worboys. In her first interview since her appointment, she said the Worboys case had caused a ""loss of confidence"" among board members. The High Court said in March that the three-person panel which approved Worboys' release had failed to explore a wider pattern of alleged offending that cast doubt on his credibility. Professor Hardwick stepped down as chairman after being told by the justice secretary that his position was untenable. John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women The Parole Board release rate stood at 49% before the Worboys case, but fell to 42% in the aftermath. It is now 46%. There has also been a rise in the number of hearings that are postponed because parole panel members are asking for more information before making decisions. ""It was obviously a very difficult period for the board,"" Mrs Corby said. ""We saw the departure of our previous chair in difficult circumstances, the board was subject to unprecedented amount of publicity, the like of which we haven't experienced before, and I think there was a loss of confidence amongst ourselves a little bit."" The second woman to chair the Parole Board in its 50 years has had a varied and unusual career. After obtaining a maths and statistics degree, she spent 13 years working in the City of London, specialising in private equity, before leaving to look after her three young daughters. She began writing, and had six novels for children published on historical figures including Cleopatra, Boudica and William the Conqueror. Mrs Corby has also served as a magistrate and in 2007 joined the Board of London Probation Trust. She became a member of the Parole Board's management committee three years ago, took over on a temporary basis in April and was confirmed in her post in November, on a three-year contract. She works two days per week, which allows her time for roles in other organisations, among them the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Asked whether she could be removed from her role in the way her predecessor had been, Mrs Corby said she didn't think the same circumstances would be ""repeated"" because independent checks and balances had been built into her contract. The Worboys case prompted a series of changes at the board, including new rules allowing victims of crime to read summaries of parole decisions - 500 have been issued so far. An in-house lawyer has been hired to bolster the quality of its legal expertise, a process for reviewing decisions is set to be introduced, and the government is considering wider reforms. Mrs Corby said she was also determined to make the board more representative of the population and the prisoners whose cases they deal with. The latest Ministry of Justice figures show there are 22,000 ethnic minority inmates in England and Wales, representing 26% of the jail population. More than 10,000 of them are black. However, only 13 - or 5% - of Parole Board members are from an ethnic minority, none of whom is black. ""At the moment we have no black Parole Board members and that's of significant concern to me,"" said Mrs Corby. A campaign to recruit 100 Parole Board members in 2016 and 2017 tried to address the shortfall, she said, but it had not attracted enough ethnic minority candidates and a disproportionate number of those who did apply failed to get through the selection procedures. A new recruitment drive is being launched next year. ""There must have been some kind of unconscious bias in those processes... we're not going to have those processes next time around,"" she said. Unconscious bias is when someone's own background or societal stereotypes lead them to make quick judgements about others without realising. These judgements may be based on characteristics including someone's age, gender, sexual orientation or ethnicity.

"The UK economy grew by 0.6% in the three months to September, with warm weather boosting consumer spending, the Office for National Statistics said. The figure for the third quarter,externalis in line with predictions from the Bank of England and other forecasters. However, buoyant growth in July was offset by a slowdown in August and September. It is the highest quarterly growth figure since the fourth quarter of 2016, when the economy grew 0.7%. Analysts warned the economy had ""little underlying momentum"" and growth would decline in the final three months. The ONS also issueda separate monthly figure for September,external, which, like the previous month, showed zero growth. Services, which make up three-quarters of the economy, only grew by 0.3% in the three months to September. After a slow start to the year, construction activity grew by 2.1% in the quarter. Manufacturing also picked up after a slow second quarter, thanks to strong car manufacturing numbers for the quarter. Household spending grew by 0.5% in the quarter, but business investment shrank by 1.2%, suggesting uncertainty among companies over the effects of Brexit. Business investment had been expected to rise by 0.2%, according to forecasts. It has now contracted for three quarters in a row. Simon Jack, business editor The overall picture is one of an economy still recovering from an exceptionally weak, weather-affected start to the year. Construction and energy production both had a strong quarter and the weather played its part again in July, as sunshine and the World Cup boosted consumer spending. It's the strongest quarter for nearly two years, but the economy didn't keep up the strong momentum of July, with August and September registering no additional growth at all. Worryingly but perhaps not surprisingly, business investment was down sharply, matching anecdotal evidence of firms' caution ahead of Brexit. Although car production was up compared with the second quarter of this year, it is down compared with the same period last year and domestic car sales were very weak - it's exports that are keeping the car industry ticking over. Plenty for the chancellor to be cheerful about today, but a third quarter of falling business investment - the first time that's happened since the financial crisis - shows that firms think the sun may be shining now, but big clouds are looming. Read more from Simon Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ""Today's positive growth of 0.6% is proof of the underlying strength in our economy. We are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade."" ONS head of national accounts Rob Kent-Smith said: ""The economy saw a strong summer, although longer-term economic growth remained subdued. There are some signs of weakness in September, with slowing retail sales and a fallback in domestic car purchases. ""However, car manufacture for export grew across the quarter, boosting factory output. Meanwhile, imports of cars dropped substantially, helping to improve Britain's trade balance."" Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""Two consecutive months of stagnation in GDP underline that the economy has little momentum and that the strong quarter-on-quarter growth rate simply reflects the weather-related rebound in the summer. ""The expenditure breakdown of GDP, meanwhile, shows that business investment fell by 1.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3, taking the total decline since the peak in Q4 2017 to 2.4%. The risk of a no-deal Brexit is the clear driver of the downturn."" Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""It remains likely that the stronger growth recorded in the third quarter is a one-off for the UK economy, with persistent Brexit uncertainty and the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses likely to weigh increasingly on economic activity in the coming quarters.""

"This video can not be played Operations manager Jake Rattenbury took the BBC behind the scenes at a Cardiff warehouse where food is being stockpiled A cold storage firm says it has run out of room because the food industry is stockpiling in the run-up to Brexit. Cardiff-based Wild Water has rented extra space in Newport, Bristol and Staffordshire, and bought another storage site in Merthyr Tydfil. It is also building a large facility in Aberbargoed in the Rhymney Valley to help cope with increased demand. Managing director Ken Rattenbury said customers were ""ultra-concerned"" about food being held up at ports. The UK government insisted the country's high level of food security would continue ""whether we leave the EU with or without a deal"". Reality Check: What would 'no deal' look like? Sainsbury's boss: Food can't be stockpiled Deal or no deal - how are EU countries preparing? Wild Water's Cardiff warehouse has capacity for 17,000 pallets. Across all its storage sites it is storing 40,000 pallets. The firm is run by Mr Rattenbury and his son Jake. Their customers include food production companies and smaller Welsh producers, as well as supermarkets and High Street stores. ""This is people just holding stock because they're concerned about next year, when we get to March, if there's no deal, they will not be able to get their products here,"" Ken Rattenbury said. The company stores imported raw ingredients from across the world through to finished food from Welsh producers that is ready to go into shops. ""It's completely out of sync to how we normally are... We're turning businesses away every day, every single day,"" Mr Rattenbury said. The Cardiff warehouse has been full to capacity for four months, he said.

"This video can not be played The attacker set a car on fire and stabbed three people A man who set a car on fire and stabbed three people - one fatally - in the Australian city of Melbourne has died in hospital after being shot by police. Authorities now say they are treating the attack as terror-related. The attacker, 31, was shot after confronting officers on a busy city street, authorities said. He was taken into custody in a critical condition. The two survivors are in hospital, neither are in a serious condition. The suspect has not been named. Police said they were ""not looking for anyone further at this early stage"". ""We don't believe there is an ongoing threat at this stage, but certainly we are treating it as a terrorism incident,"" said Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton. He said the suspect, who is of Somali origin, was ""someone that is known"" to both local police and federal intelligence, adding it was ""mainly in respect to relatives"" who are ""certainly persons of interest to us"". Footage from the scene showed police confronting the man The Islamic State (IS) group said on Friday that one of its ""fighters"" was behind the attack, its Amaq news agency reported. Officers were initially called to reports of a car fire near Bourke Street, a busy thoroughfare, at about 16:20 local time (05:20 GMT), just before the evening rush hour. Police later discovered that the vehicle was packed with ""barbecue-style"" gas cylinders. Footage circulating on social media shows the vehicle crashed into shop fronts, engulfed by flames. However, the cylinders did not explode, police said. ""As they got out of the car, they were confronted by a male brandishing a knife and threatening them,"" Supt David Clayton said at a news conference. The incident happened in the heart of Melbourne's business district A burnt out vehicle was later seen on the same street ""At the same time, passers-by were calling out that members of the public had been stabbed."" Other footage shared on Twitter shows at least two police officers confronting the man, who is brandishing a large knife. At one point, what appears to be a member of the public tries to help, using a shopping trolley to push the assailant back. None of the three men reportedly stabbed at the scene have been officially named. However Tasmanian Premier Will Hodgman said on Twitter that local businessman Rod Patterson was among those attacked. ""A nicer bloke you wouldn't meet,"" Mr Hodgman tweeted.,external""It's not surprising he would step in to help others. We all wish him well."" According to Victoria Police, a 26-year-old and 58-year-old were both taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries. A police officer was also treated at the scene No. This incident comes asa man is on trial for a 2017 attack on the same street which left six people dead and dozens wounded. James Gargasoulas is accused of deliberately driving his car into pedestrians on Bourke Street, hitting 33 people. His defence barrister has said he was in a drug-induced psychosis at the time.

"Children want adults to show each other more respect, with four out of 10 (41%) seeing grown-ups bullying each other in the past six months, a survey says. Research among 1,001 children aged 11 to 16 by the Anti-Bullying Alliance suggests worrying numbers of children see adults setting a bad example. Children in that age group highlighted adults who behaved poorly to each other face-to-face, online or in the media. Some 97% said they would like to see more respect shown between grown-ups. The survey is published ahead of the annual charity push against bullying,Anti-Bullying Week,external, which begins on Monday, November 12. It comes after many reports of a bullying culture in numerous high-profile workplaces in England, including the Palace of Westminster Martha Evans, director of the Anti-Bullying Alliance, said: ""Children look to parents and other grown-ups for a blueprint of acceptable behaviour. ""If a considerable number of children say they see adults bullying and being disrespectful to each other, we have to ask whether grown-ups could do more to act as role models to children. ""We hope that adults, as well as schoolchildren, will take the 'choose respect' message to heart during Anti-Bullying Week, and put it into practice even in situations where they disagree with someone else. ""Being bullied can turn a child's life upside down; we should always check our own behaviour, especially around children, to make sure it sends a positive message of respect."" The research also suggests a third of children had experienced being bullied in the last six months. But nearly all children - some 98% - said that showing respect to each other is important, and acknowledged that it was possible to be respectful even if you disagree. The research was carried out with 1,001 children in England aged 11 to 16, in October.

"This video can not be played Trump and the facts about the migrant caravan Migrants who cross the southern US border illegally will temporarily be denied asylum under a new rule, US President Donald Trump has said. Mr Trump has signed a proclamation barring migrants who enter illegally from asylum for up to 90 days. The president can stop migration in the ""national interest"", a statement said. Rights groups say it is illegal and have launched a legal challenge. Immigration was a major focus in Mr Trump's mid-term election campaign. The proclamation, which goes into effect on Saturday, triggers regulations adopted by immigration officials on Thursday. ""I just signed the proclamation on asylum - very important,"" the president told reporters on Friday before leaving for Paris. ""People can come in but they have to come in through the points of entry."" Before the mid-terms, President Trump frequently denounced a caravan of thousands of Central Americans making their way north through Mexico. He ordered troops to the borderand declared the migrants to be an ""invasion"". Without offering evidence, Mr Trump repeatedly suggested the caravan was politically motivated. What is the migrant caravan heading to US? Fake news follows migrant caravan Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen first announced the changes on Thursday. The joint statement said presidents have the power to ""suspend the entry of all aliens"",externaland to impose ""any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate on them"" if they are judged to be ""detrimental"" to US interests under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The US recently inaugurated the first section of President Trump's southern border wall ""Today, we are using the authority granted to us by Congress to bar aliens who violate a Presidential suspension of entry or other restriction from asylum eligibility,"" the statement said. The rule will not apply retroactively. The ban is expected to last 90 days or until the US reaches an agreement with Mexico to turn back asylum-seekers, according to the proclamation. Read the Interim Final Rule here,external It will not apply to unaccompanied minors, a justice department official told US media on Friday. Under US law, there is a legal obligation to hear asylum claims from migrants if they say they fear violence in their home countries. Under international law, those who do have a serious fear of persecution are considered refugees. Until now asylum seekers have been entitled to a hearing in the US regardless of how they arrived in the country. Mr Trump invoked the same executive power he used to justify his travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority nations last year. The plan is expected to be quickly challenged in court. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a group that defends individual rights, declared the move ""illegal"". Along with the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Center for Constitutional Rights, it filed a lawsuit to block the order in a federal courthouse in San Francisco on Friday. ""US law specifically allows individuals to apply for asylum whether or not they are at a port of entry,"" the ACLU said in a statement. Allow Twitter content?

Secretary General Kumi Naidoo issued a statement,externalattacking the president's ""dehumanising rhetoric"". ""Asylum is not a loophole, it is a lifeline,"" Mr Naidoo said. ""This policy needlessly places the lives of thousands of people in danger."" The migrant caravan stopped to regroup in Mexico City en route to the US border Earlier efforts by the Trump administration to limit migration prompted a political and legal backlash. The impact of Trump on illegal immigration In June,the president signed an executive order promising to ""keep families together""in migrant detentions, after undocumented parents and children were separated at the border. Days later,the Supreme Court upheld the president's controversial travel banagainst people from several Muslim majority countries. A number of lower courts had originally deemed the measure unconstitutional. According to a report by the rights group Washington Office on Latin America,requests for asylum from migrants from Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras increased by 25 percent in the fiscal year 2017,external. The United States has had a cap on refugee admissions since the Refugee Act - which set out an admissions system for asylum seekers - was passed by Congress in 1980. Since 2000,the cap has generally been set in the 70,000 to 80,000 range.,externalThe Trump administration lowered it to 50,000 in 2017.

"There are 127 millon outpatient appointments every year The way hospitals in the UK run outpatient clinic appointments is stuck ""in the 18th Century"", leading doctors say. Every year millions of people travel to hospitals, where doctors check up on their health and discuss their care. The Royal College of Physicians said many appointments were unnecessary - and outdated, inefficient systems meant large numbers were missed or cancelled. It said the situation was frustrating for patients, and wasting money. The RCP's report said the time had come to overhaul the system by embracing innovation: making more use of remote monitoring and telephone and video consultations. Getting other staff, such as senior nurses, to run clinics closer to people's homes could also help. It said a number of places had already started taking these steps, but much more needed to be done. Dr Toby Hillman, of the RCP, said: ""It's an 18th Century system. It should not be beyond us to tackle this.""  Outpatient departments are the busiest part of hospitals in terms of the numbers seen. Last year there were 127 million appointments in the UK - nearly five times more than the numbers who came to A&E. Patients come in to discuss their health as part of their ongoing care, or may see their doctor to discuss their recovery from surgery. or before they go under the knife. The report pointed out these appointments can require a significant amount of time, cost and planning for patients because of things like travel, missing work and arranging childcare. But in England one in five appointments is cancelled, or patients do not turn up. Some of the cancellations are unavoidable, because of sickness or emergencies requiring staff to be deployed elsewhere. But the RCP said the majority could be avoided if there were better systems in place. There are a number of reasons why the service does not work smoothly. Doctors surveyed - there were nearly 1,400 polled in compiling the report - said some appointments had to be cancelled because the results of tests were not yet available. or scans had not been booked in time. One consultant described his experience of outpatient departments as ""shocking"", complaining of missing notes and results. Tests are not always being done on time, doctors say In cases where patients did not turn up, the report said there was evidence that they had tried to alert the hospital but there was not an efficient system in place to record the information. The report said hospitals were also struggling to cope with demand - the number of appointments has doubled in the past decade. This combination of inefficiency and sheer volume contributed to large numbers of appointments - 57% - running late. Doctors were asked if they felt a significant minority of outpatient appointments - between 10% and 20% - could be avoided. One in four said this proportion of new patient appointments was simply not needed. A similar number said this proportion of follow-up appointments could be avoided by using alternative methods, such as video consultations. If the number of cancelled and missed appointments was reduced, this could also provide a significant saving. But the RCP warned the system of funding hospital care needed to change. Hospitals are paid per patient seen, so could find themselves penalised if they reformed the system. NHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis said doctors were just as frustrated as patients about the ""antiquated"" processes. He said the issue would be tackled as part of the NHS long-term plan that is currently being developed so the outpatient service could be brought into the ""21st century"". ""The time has come to grasp this nettle,"" he added.

"The new chairwoman of the Parole Board has said it is a ""significant concern"" that none of its 240 members is black. Caroline Corby said just 13 members were from an ethnic minority. She said ""unconscious bias"" had affected recruitment for the board, which decides when serious offenders in England and Wales can leave jail. Mrs Corby replaced Nick Hardwick, who was forced to quit after the High Court overturned the board's decision to free serial sex offender John Worboys. In her first interview since her appointment, she said the Worboys case had caused a ""loss of confidence"" among board members. The High Court said in March that the three-person panel which approved Worboys' release had failed to explore a wider pattern of alleged offending that cast doubt on his credibility. Professor Hardwick stepped down as chairman after being told by the justice secretary that his position was untenable. John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women The Parole Board release rate stood at 49% before the Worboys case, but fell to 42% in the aftermath. It is now 46%. There has also been a rise in the number of hearings that are postponed because parole panel members are asking for more information before making decisions. ""It was obviously a very difficult period for the board,"" Mrs Corby said. ""We saw the departure of our previous chair in difficult circumstances, the board was subject to unprecedented amount of publicity, the like of which we haven't experienced before, and I think there was a loss of confidence amongst ourselves a little bit."" The second woman to chair the Parole Board in its 50 years has had a varied and unusual career. After obtaining a maths and statistics degree, she spent 13 years working in the City of London, specialising in private equity, before leaving to look after her three young daughters. She began writing, and had six novels for children published on historical figures including Cleopatra, Boudica and William the Conqueror. Mrs Corby has also served as a magistrate and in 2007 joined the Board of London Probation Trust. She became a member of the Parole Board's management committee three years ago, took over on a temporary basis in April and was confirmed in her post in November, on a three-year contract. She works two days per week, which allows her time for roles in other organisations, among them the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Asked whether she could be removed from her role in the way her predecessor had been, Mrs Corby said she didn't think the same circumstances would be ""repeated"" because independent checks and balances had been built into her contract. The Worboys case prompted a series of changes at the board, including new rules allowing victims of crime to read summaries of parole decisions - 500 have been issued so far. An in-house lawyer has been hired to bolster the quality of its legal expertise, a process for reviewing decisions is set to be introduced, and the government is considering wider reforms. Mrs Corby said she was also determined to make the board more representative of the population and the prisoners whose cases they deal with. The latest Ministry of Justice figures show there are 22,000 ethnic minority inmates in England and Wales, representing 26% of the jail population. More than 10,000 of them are black. However, only 13 - or 5% - of Parole Board members are from an ethnic minority, none of whom is black. ""At the moment we have no black Parole Board members and that's of significant concern to me,"" said Mrs Corby. A campaign to recruit 100 Parole Board members in 2016 and 2017 tried to address the shortfall, she said, but it had not attracted enough ethnic minority candidates and a disproportionate number of those who did apply failed to get through the selection procedures. A new recruitment drive is being launched next year. ""There must have been some kind of unconscious bias in those processes... we're not going to have those processes next time around,"" she said. Unconscious bias is when someone's own background or societal stereotypes lead them to make quick judgements about others without realising. These judgements may be based on characteristics including someone's age, gender, sexual orientation or ethnicity.

"Fashion blogger Sarah Benziane wears New Look More than 120 New Look stores may close at it tries to revive its fortunes. The fashion retailer said in March it wouldshut 60 storesthrough a restructuring deal with its creditors, to cut costs and improve profitability. On Tuesday it said that had risen to 85, because landlords have been exercising their rights under the deal to take back stores and relet them. Talks with landlords on 13 stores continue, while the fate of 26 shops trading rent-free is unclear. Comparable sales at New Look, which will be left with about 500 UK stores following the closures, fell 3.7% for the 26 weeks to 22 September. That was an improvement on the 8.6% slump for the same period last year. Despite falling sales, underlying operating profits improved to Â£22.2m compared with a loss of Â£10.4m last year. Executive chairman Alistair McGeorge said retailers continued to face ""significant headwinds and uncertainties, including Brexit"". ""Clearly the wider retail environment remains challenging and we are not expecting that to change anytime soon. However, we are on the right track and continue to drive further efficiencies across the business,"" he said. New Look aimed to improve profitability with more full-price sales and an expanded online operation. Savings of Â£70m had been achieved, and a further Â£8m identified, it added. Of the 60 stores earmarked for closure, 24 have gone, the company has renegotiated rents on 10 and 26 remain open and are trading rent free, at least until after Christmas. The current plans will leave the retailer with 508 stores. Last month the chain said it was bailing out of China, with other international operations also under review. South African retail magnate Christo Wiese's investment vehicle Braitbought 90% of New Look in 2015for Â£780m from private equity firms Apax and Permira. The remaining stake was held by Tom Singh, who founded New Look in 1969, and senior managers. Apax and Permira abandoned plans to float the highly indebted chain on the London stock exchange in 2010 due to market volatility in the wake of the financial crisis. Mr Wiese also controls Steinhoff, whose shares crashed in December 2017 following the revelation of accounting irregularities. Steinhoff owns Poundland, Bensons for Beds and Harveys in the UK and 40 other local brands in about 30 countries.

"The new chairwoman of the Parole Board has said it is a ""significant concern"" that none of its 240 members is black. Caroline Corby said just 13 members were from an ethnic minority. She said ""unconscious bias"" had affected recruitment for the board, which decides when serious offenders in England and Wales can leave jail. Mrs Corby replaced Nick Hardwick, who was forced to quit after the High Court overturned the board's decision to free serial sex offender John Worboys. In her first interview since her appointment, she said the Worboys case had caused a ""loss of confidence"" among board members. The High Court said in March that the three-person panel which approved Worboys' release had failed to explore a wider pattern of alleged offending that cast doubt on his credibility. Professor Hardwick stepped down as chairman after being told by the justice secretary that his position was untenable. John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women The Parole Board release rate stood at 49% before the Worboys case, but fell to 42% in the aftermath. It is now 46%. There has also been a rise in the number of hearings that are postponed because parole panel members are asking for more information before making decisions. ""It was obviously a very difficult period for the board,"" Mrs Corby said. ""We saw the departure of our previous chair in difficult circumstances, the board was subject to unprecedented amount of publicity, the like of which we haven't experienced before, and I think there was a loss of confidence amongst ourselves a little bit."" The second woman to chair the Parole Board in its 50 years has had a varied and unusual career. After obtaining a maths and statistics degree, she spent 13 years working in the City of London, specialising in private equity, before leaving to look after her three young daughters. She began writing, and had six novels for children published on historical figures including Cleopatra, Boudica and William the Conqueror. Mrs Corby has also served as a magistrate and in 2007 joined the Board of London Probation Trust. She became a member of the Parole Board's management committee three years ago, took over on a temporary basis in April and was confirmed in her post in November, on a three-year contract. She works two days per week, which allows her time for roles in other organisations, among them the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Asked whether she could be removed from her role in the way her predecessor had been, Mrs Corby said she didn't think the same circumstances would be ""repeated"" because independent checks and balances had been built into her contract. The Worboys case prompted a series of changes at the board, including new rules allowing victims of crime to read summaries of parole decisions - 500 have been issued so far. An in-house lawyer has been hired to bolster the quality of its legal expertise, a process for reviewing decisions is set to be introduced, and the government is considering wider reforms. Mrs Corby said she was also determined to make the board more representative of the population and the prisoners whose cases they deal with. The latest Ministry of Justice figures show there are 22,000 ethnic minority inmates in England and Wales, representing 26% of the jail population. More than 10,000 of them are black. However, only 13 - or 5% - of Parole Board members are from an ethnic minority, none of whom is black. ""At the moment we have no black Parole Board members and that's of significant concern to me,"" said Mrs Corby. A campaign to recruit 100 Parole Board members in 2016 and 2017 tried to address the shortfall, she said, but it had not attracted enough ethnic minority candidates and a disproportionate number of those who did apply failed to get through the selection procedures. A new recruitment drive is being launched next year. ""There must have been some kind of unconscious bias in those processes... we're not going to have those processes next time around,"" she said. Unconscious bias is when someone's own background or societal stereotypes lead them to make quick judgements about others without realising. These judgements may be based on characteristics including someone's age, gender, sexual orientation or ethnicity.

"This video can not be played Jason Coffman: The last thing I said was 'Son, I love you."" A US Marine Corps veteran with suspected mental health issues killed 12 people in a busy bar in California, including a policeman, officials say. The shooting began at 23:20 local time on Wednesday in Thousand Oaks about 40 miles (65km) north-west of Los Angeles. At least 200 people were reportedly inside the Borderline Bar and Grill, which was hosting a student line-dancing night. Police named the suspect as 28-year-old Ian David Long. Earlier this year, police mental health professionals cleared him after he was found behaving ""irrationally"" at his home, said authorities. The suspect had served in the US Marines and fought in Afghanistan Police say the suspect was dressed in black, and forced his way into the bar after shooting the bouncer. A college country music night was under way when the suspect apparently threw a smoke grenade before opening fire, witnesses say. Police say he used a legally owned .45 calibre Glock semi-automatic handgun, which had an extended magazine that is illegal in the state of California. The extended magazine allowed the gun to carry more than its typical 11-bullet capacity. Police say they do not yet know how many shots were fired, or whether the gunman reloaded during the attack. Thousand Oaks: Who are the victims? Is there a link between mass shootings and mental illness? Why are US mass shootings getting more deadly? One witness, Teylor Whittler, who was celebrating a friend's 21st birthday, said: ""I was on the dance floor and I heard the gunshots, so I looked back and then all of a sudden everyone screamed: 'Get Down!' ""It was a huge panic, everyone got up, I was trampled, I was kind of left on the floor until some guy came behind me and grabbed me and dragged me out."" People escaped the bar by using chairs to break windows, while others reportedly sheltered inside the venue's toilets. The night is popular among the area's local university students At least 10 people are known to have been wounded and others are self-reporting with injuries at local hospitals. One survivor said he and his friends also escaped death last year in the deadliest US mass shooting of modern times, when a gunman killed 58 people at a Las Vegas country music concert. Nicholas Champion told CBS News: ""We're all a big family and unfortunately this family got hit twice."" Popular among students, the bar is close to California Lutheran University, Pepperdine University and Moorpark College. By James Cook,BBC News,Thousand Oaks For the United States, this is the nightmare that never ends. The names of countless schools, churches, colleges and even entire cities have become synonymous with mass murder. To the list of Las Vegas, Orlando, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, Sutherland Springs and Parkland we now add Thousand Oaks. At the Borderline Bar and Grill survivors huddled together in the darkness, shivering in the clothes they had been wearing in the warm, friendly bar. Many of the patrons were regulars who had come to enjoy country music and dance together. The mood among the little groups of friends was one of shock and despair - but what was absent was a sense of surprise. Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean described the scene inside the bar as ""horrific"" and said there was ""blood everywhere"". He said first responders arrived less than three minutes after the first emergency calls from the venue were made. Ventura Sheriff's Sergeant Ron Helus, who later died in hospital, tried to enter the active scene with a local highway patrolman when he was shot several times. Sgt Ron Helus was one of the first officers on the scene The husband and father-of-one had been a policeman for 29 years and was a professional firearms instructor. He was due to retire next year. ""It saddens us all and tears at our emotions,"" the sheriff said. ""He died a hero. He went in to save lives, to save other people."" America's gun culture in 10 charts Four key dates that shaped the US gun debate Sheriff Dean, who on Thursday completes his last day serving as Ventura County sheriff, warned: ""It doesn't matter how safe your community is, it doesn't matter how low your crime rate is - there are people who just don't think properly everywhere, I don't care where you are, and they commit horrific acts like this. This video can not be played Survivors of California shooting describe what they saw. ""There's no way to process. There's no way to make sense out of the senseless."" President Donald Trump issued a proclamation ordering flags to be lowered halfway at the White House and all public and military buildings to commemorate victims of the ""terrible"" attack.

Police say they have had several minor contacts with Long in recent years, including in April 2018 when they were called to his house after a report of a disturbance. During talks with police, he appeared ""somewhat irate, acting a little irrationally"", the sheriff said. A police crisis intervention team interviewed him, and determined that it was not necessary to hold him against his will in a mental health facility. Being caught up in a traumatic event that is overwhelming, frightening and life-threatening can lead to PTSD The symptoms usually start within a few weeks of the trauma, but they can start later After the traumatic event people can feel grief-stricken, depressed, anxious, guilty and angry People may have flashbacks and nightmares People may be 'on guard' - staying alert all the time Physical symptoms can be aches and pains, diarrhoea, irregular heartbeats, headaches, feelings of panic and fear, depression People may start drinking too much alcohol or using drugs (including painkillers). Source: Royal College of Psychiatrists Mental health professionals believed he suffered from PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), the sheriff said. In a statement, the US Marine Corp confirmed that he had served from 2008-13 as a machine gunner and rose to the rank of corporal. He served in Afghanistan from November 2010 to June 2011 and received the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. According to the website Gun Violence Archive,more than 12,000 people have been killed by firearms in the US so far this year,external, including about 3,000 people under 18. That number does not include an annual estimate of 22,000 suicides via firearm.

"The Irish border is the last outstanding issue in the Brexit withdrawal negotiations DUP leader Arlene Foster has said her party will ""not be able to support"" Theresa May's latest proposals aimed at resolving the Brexit deadlock. The party accused the PM of breaking promises over plans to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The plans were revealed in a letter from Theresa May to Mrs Foster,leaked to the Times.,external Downing Street reiterated the PM's commitment to avoiding a hard border. Mrs May relies on the support of the DUP's 10 MPs in key votes because she does not have a majority in the House of Commons. Agreeing a backstop - a contingency plan designed to keep an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland until the UK and European Union settle their future relationship - remains the main obstacle in the way of a wider deal between the two sides. Mrs May describes it in her letter to the DUP as ""an insurance policy that no-one in the UK or the EU wants or expects to use"". The DUP leader said the party could not back the deal if it came before Parliament and said the PM ""needs to reflect"" on that. Mrs Foster told the BBC that a response to a letter sent to the PM last week ""unfortunately does say that she's in a position where she's considering regulatory alignment"". ""We would not be able to support this if it came to parliament in the form that it is in the letter,"" said the DUP leader. ""Now there are stages to go through before it comes to parliament. She still has to have a cabinet meeting in relation to this matter and we believe that there is a chance for her to reflect on the fact that we will not be able to support it in its current form. Mrs Foster added: ""I believe that not only would we not be able to support what she has sent to us but that there are many others that wouldn't be able to support it in her own party as well."" Analysis: DUP and government not on same page Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: All you need to know UK must be able to end backstop, says Fox If sufficient progress is made on the issue in the next few days, it is thought a special cabinet meeting could be held early next week for ministers to approve the draft agreement on the terms of the UK's exit. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The government will not agree anything that brings about a hard border on the island of Ireland."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The UK and EU have failed, so far, to reach agreement on how to ensure there are no border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, if a free trade deal is not in place by the end of the post-Brexit ""transition period"" in December 2020. This is known as the ""backstop"". The EU's proposal, to keep Northern Ireland in its customs union and single market, is unacceptable to the UK because it would mean Northern Ireland having different regulations to the rest of the UK. But the UK's proposal, which would effectively keep the whole of the UK in the EU customs union for a limited period after Brexit, includes an ""expected"" end date of 2021 - something which is unacceptable to the EU, which says any ""backstop"" must apply ""unless and until"" it is no longer needed. It says its Northern Ireland-only proposal should remain in place, in case the issue of the Irish border was not sorted out by that end date. Theresa May relies on the votes of DUP MPs, such as Sammy Wilson and Nigel Dodds TheBBC's John Campbell saidwhat was upsetting the DUP in Mrs May's letter was the issue of single market regulations, not customs. He said the letter suggested the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland may require alignment with EU single market regulations ""in some scenarios"" adding that any such alignment would have to be ""carefully circumscribed to what is strictly necessary to avoid any hard border"". The DUP has interpreted the wording of her letter to mean that the EU's proposal will be in the Brexit divorce deal, despite Mrs May's insistence it will never come into effect. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the row came down to an issue of trust between Mrs May and her DUP allies, who were suspicious she might sign up to a deal with the EU they did not agree with. This video can not be played Philip Hammond: We won't put the United Kingdom at risk Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ""We have always said that we can't accept the [EU] commission proposal for a Northern Ireland-specific solution."" Irish PM Leo Varadkar told a press conference: ""The most important thing to me is the objective, and that is to give everyone in Northern Ireland the assurance that a hard border will not develop between north and south, no matter what else may happen in the years ahead. ""That is why we are seeking one that is legally operative and one that gives us that guarantee that is necessary."" UK must be able to end backstop, says Fox What are the Brexit backstop options?

"PC Keith Palmer was unarmed as he was attacked by Khalid Masood A memorial to the police officer murdered in last year's Westminster terror attack is to be erected at the Houses of Parliament later this year. Keith Palmer, 48, was stabbed by Khalid Masood while on dutyon the forecourt of the Palace of Westminsterand died despite an MP's attempts to save him. PC Palmer was one of five people killed in Masood's attack on 22 March 2017. The memorial would be a reminder of PC Palmer's sacrifice and heroism, the Police Memorial Trust said. The remembrance stone will be placed at the Carriage Gates, where PC Palmer was attacked, according to the trust. ""I am so very pleased to confirm that this fitting and lasting tribute to PC Palmer will be placed at this iconic site"", chairwoman Geraldine Winner said. ""We know it will bring some small comfort to his family and loved ones. ""For evermore the memorial will remind Londoners and those who visit this site from around the world of the service, sacrifice and heroism of this brave British police officer."" A single red rose was placed in front of PC Palmer's helmet in Westminster ahead of his funeral The announcement was welcomed by Scotland Yard Commissioner Cressida Dick and Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow. Mr Bercow said: ""PC Palmer died doing the job he loved - ensuring the safety of members of both houses, the staff who work here and members of the public on the estate at the time. ""We owe him a profound debt of gratitude for his bravery, which resulted in him paying the ultimate price. ""This memorial will serve as a lasting tribute to his dedication and his courage.""

"This video can not be played The BBC's Jonathan Blake on Dominic Raab's comments Dominic Raab has come under fire for saying he ""hadn't quite understood"" how reliant UK trade in goods is on the Dover-Calais crossing. The Brexit Secretary's remarks came at a technology conference as he discussed the ""bespoke arrangement"" the UK sought with the EU after it leaves the bloc. Shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman suggested Mr Raab ""doesn't even understand the very basics of Brexit"". Conservative pro-Remain MP Nicky Morgan tweeted: ""Gulp."" According to the Institute for Government,external, Dover is ""a key artery for UK trade heading to continental Europe"" with more than 2.5m heavy goods vehicles passing through the port every year. Its report says goods worth Â£119bn passed through the port in 2015, ""representing around 17% of the UK's entire trade in goods by value"". Davis: May will probably lose Brexit vote UK and France 'still friends' after Brexit Fox: UK must be able to end backstop Reality Check: How much of the UK's trade is with the EU? Mr Raab told a technology conference on Wednesday: ""We want a bespoke arrangement in goods which recognises the peculiar, frankly, geographic, economic entity that is the United Kingdom. ""We are, and I hadn't quite understood the full extent of this, but if you look at the UK and if you look at how we trade in goods, we are particularly reliant on the Dover-Calais crossing. ""And that's one of the reasons why, and there's been a lot of controversy about this, but one of the reasons why we wanted to make sure that we have a very specific and very proximate relationship with the EU to ensure frictionless trade at the border, particularly for just-in-time manufacturing goods whether it's pharmaceutical goods or perishable goods like food."" ""I don't think it's a question so much of the risk of major shortages but I think probably the average consumer might not be aware of the full extent to which the choice of goods that we have in the stores are dependent on one or two very specific trade routes."" Dover is indeed an important port for the UK. It is by far the biggest UK destination for roll-on roll-off ferries,handling 2.9 million lorries last year,external. Of the 120,000 cargo-carrying vessels that arrived in the UK in 2016, 13% of them came into Dover, writes Anthony Reuben. But that doesn't make Dover the biggest freight-handling port. In fact last year it was only the ninth biggest by tonnage, handling 26.2 million tonnes, which is about 6% of the total amount of freight handled at UK ports. Those specialising in containers and other forms of bulk freight such as Grimsby & Immingham, London, Southampton and Liverpool handled considerably greater tonnage. Dover is vital for trade with Europe though, particularly for time-critical items. Its freight also tends to be high value,handling 17% of the UK trade in goods,external. Among critics seizing on the remarks, Will Straw - who was executive director of the Britain Stronger In Europe campaign during the 2016 referendum -suggested,externalMr Raab should have ""done your homework before backing Leave"". The Freight Transport Association's Pauline Bastidon said the group was ""relieved to learn that the secretary of state for exiting the EU has finally recognised the importance of the Dover strait and frictionless trade for the UK economy"". She added: ""While looking at all potential contingencies is right, no other route provides the same frequency of crossing or is able to handle the same volumes as Dover-Calais, Dover-Dunkirk & Eurotunnel put together. The government now needs to make good on its pledge of frictionless trade.""
