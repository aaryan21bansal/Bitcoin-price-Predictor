The ballet company had been due to appear for three days from Monday. The Royal and Derngate in Northampton said it had cancelled Saturday's performances by the company. Members of the Ukrainian community in Wolverhampton had previously been calling for the visit to the city to be cancelled. ""We would have thought they would have shown some compassion to our community,"" Andrew Duda, branch chairman of the Association of Ukrainians said before the cancellation. The theatre said discussions between management, producers and agents had been taking place since Thursday. Why has Putin invaded Ukraine?

"A foreign exchange bureau in St Petersburg (file picture) The EU, US and their allies have agreed to cut off a number of Russian banks from the main international payment system, Swift. The assets of Russia's central bank will also be frozen, limiting Russia's ability to access its overseas reserves. The intention is to ""further isolate Russia from the international financial system"", a joint statement said. Russia is heavily reliant on the Swift system for its key oil and gas exports. The joint sanctions are the harshest measures imposed to date on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. What is Swift and why is banning Russia so important? Swift, or the ""Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication"", is a secure messaging system that makes fast, cross-border payments possible, enabling international trade. Based in Belgium, it facilitates transactions between more than 11,000 banks and financial institutions across the globe. It plays a pivotal role in supporting the global economy, but has no authority to make sanction decisions itself. The banks affected were not immediately named, but the German spokesman said they would include ""all those already sanctioned by the international community, as well as other institutions, if necessary"". Removal from Swift is deemed to be a severe curb because almost all banks use the system. The measures were agreed by the US, UK, Europe and Canada. Excluding certain Russian banks from the Swift system used for trillions of dollars-worth of transactions will hit the economy hard - and in the words of the White House, it will make the country rely on ""the telephone or a fax machine"" to make payments. This is only a slight exaggeration. There are workarounds to Swift but none which are as efficient. When Iran was cut out of the system in 2012, as part of sanctions over its nuclear programme, it lost 30% of its foreign trade. Picking certain Russian banks will ensure the sanctions have the maximum impact on Russia, while preventing too much impact on Europe. European businesses will be able to continue to collect money owed and buy Russian energy. Other measures are equally powerful. Curbs on Russia's central bank will stop it using its currency to limit the effect of sanctions. Russia has been building up a cushion of foreign currency to protect its banks, but this new measure will significantly decrease the reserves available. The impact of these measures may take a while to show - but they do express an immediate intent from Western nations. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said the decision to paralyse the assets of Russia's central bank would stop the Kremlin from ""using its war chest"". The EU and its partners agreed to freeze the bank's transactions and prevent it from liquidating its assets. She added there would be a crackdown on so-called ""golden passports"" that ""let wealthy Russians connected to the Russian government become citizens of our countries and gain access to our financial systems"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Britain had taken ""decisive action"", tweeting: ""We will keep working together to ensure Putin pays the price for his aggression."" Responding to the announcement, Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal tweeted his appreciation for the sanctions, calling them a ""real help during this dark time"". EU foreign ministers are set to meet on Sunday to co-ordinate member states' military aid to Ukraine, and discuss humanitarian assistance for the country and those fleeing the conflict.

"Ukraine has been handing out weapons to civilians to defend Kyiv The man tightly clutching a rifle at one roadblock could easily have been in his early 60s. We saw other men, in jeans and trainers, taking up position: the luxury of camouflage protection not possible in this moment of crisis. Makeshift roadblocks had been assembled. As we ventured out into the streets of Kyiv on Friday, we encountered these men and others who had answered the call to defend their nation. We found a tractor and a delivery truck parked at strategic angles to block the path of any incoming attacker. In other cities, steelworkers are reported to have welded new obstructions into place: forging their own defences. And workers in a sewing factory who normally stitch uniforms have been making sandbags. Across the country, patriotic Ukrainians are weaving their own narrative and hoping their collective effort will count for something in the face of Moscow's military might. The urgency of all this tells you many fear it is a question of when - not if - they'll be face-to-face with the advancing Russian forces. Today, in the heart of the capital, the streets are mostly deserted. There are few people to enjoy the church bells. One man who may have well heard the soothing chimes in this darkest hour is Ukraine's president. In the midst of what feels like an existential battle, Volodymyr Zelensky has been carrying out a personal mission of his own: touring the landmarks of this great city recording defiant video messages to the Ukrainian people, vowing to stay and fight. This video can not be played Zelensky's defiant response to invasion... in 100 seconds Across this vast country, families have been sending their own hastily made films to their loved ones, reassuring them they are safe. But there are no impressive architectural backdrops as in the president's videos. Instead you see the new subterranean existence many are being forced to endure: makeshift beds, piles of possessions, frightened pets. Car parks, basements, metro stations are all now home for so many. Daily life has been upended as they wait anxiously for the arrival of their would-be Russian occupiers. However, it was new life that gave hope in one makeshift underground basement: a baby, delivered overnight, entering a world which has changed beyond recognition in barely 36 hours. THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? IN MAPS:How Russia carried out the invasion SANCTIONS:Who is not on UK list? The sense this brutal conflict is a gruesome relic of a bygone age is shared by those enduring it first hand as well as those looking on in horror from afar. An assault on a sovereign nation - a grim theme of 20th Century history - is unfolding before our eyes. And a video has emerged seemingly showing a Tiananmen Square moment. In it, a solitary figure shuffles round a tank trying to halt its path. This is not 1989 and a Chinese tank. But a Russian instrument of war in 2022. Another video I've just seen is too brutal to describe. So I won't try. But let me tell you it shows the human cost - in sickening detail - of the aerial assault Vladimir Putin is inflicting on the military of his neighbour. There are considerable losses on the Russian side too: far greater than the Kremlin had anticipated or would acknowledge, is the latest assessment of the UK Ministry of Defence. Earlier in the week, when it looked like a strike would indeed finally come, we found cheerful defiance in Kyiv. In hindsight, most thought Putin may look to expand his control in the Donbas region, hundreds of miles to the east. As we know now, it was so much bigger than that. On Tuesday, we watched a group of history students gather on a bridge and sing their national song, some with the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag draped over their shoulders. There were broads smiles and a joyful unity. A group of students recited the national hymn That unity has not shattered but the ready smiles are much harder to find. But there is not despair. As well as the joy of new life arriving in one bunker, there are stories of basic human kindness beneath the city's streets. On Thursday morning, before the fog of disbelief at the size and scale of Moscow's offensive had lifted, I met Mark, a sales manager outside one metro station. He had been woken by the first round of explosions and then helped his neighbours evacuate their building. Mark is preparing for the long haul In my latest exchange of messages with him, he tells me he's now formed his own subterranean band of brothers and sisters. They've been encouraged by the Kyiv authorities to make petrol bombs to repel any Russian advance. But for now, Mark's makeshift army is not on the frontline, but the platform edge. He tells me they're helping each other in their new surroundings and in particular, have been searching for people who are alone. ""There are tears - lots of them,"" he writes. ""But I can say with joy in my heart that that everyone here has faith in Ukraine."" He says last night they sang hymns. ""There will be victory and everyone will contribute to this victory."" Kyiv is a city under strain and under fearsome attack. But it feels united in spirit and strength and an indominable determination to survive.

"The Baltic Leader ship is being held in Boulogne France has intercepted and impounded a Russian-flagged cargo ship suspected of breaching sanctions imposed because of the invasion of Ukraine. The ship, the Baltic Leader, was heading from the north-western French city of Rouen to St Petersburg in Russia with a cargo of new cars. It is being held at the Channel port of Boulogne. Russian state media say the vessel is owned by a subsidiary of a bank targeted in recent EU and US sanctions. A regional French official said such a measure was rare, but called it a sign of firmness. The US Treasury Department has issued blocking sanctions against the vessel, saying it is owned by a subsidiary of Promsvyazbank, one of the Russian financial institutions hit by sanctions. However, the bank has said it no longer owns the Baltic Leader. It told Reuters news agency that the ship was sold to another firm before the sanctions were imposed. French officials said they were checking whether the vessel was linked to Russian financial interests and that the crew were ""being co-operative"". The process could take up to 48 hours, they added. The Russian embassy in Paris said it would send a note of protest to the French foreign ministry over the seizure. THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine?

"Protests and demonstrations in support of Ukraine have been held around the UK as Russia continues its invasion. Thousands have joined various rallies, including outside the Russian embassy and Downing Street in London, and in Manchester and Edinburgh. Eggs were thrown at the embassy and messages written in chalk were scrawled over the outer walls. And the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have said they ""stand"" with the people of Ukraine as they ""bravely fight"". Ina tweet,external, Prince William and Catherine said they had met President Volodymyr Zelensky and his wife in 2020 and said: ""Today we stand with the president and all of Ukraine's people as they bravely fight for that future."" Prince Harry and Meghan also released a statement saying they stood with the people of Ukraine ""against this breach of international and humanitarian law"" and encouraged global leaders to do the same. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met Volodymyr Zelensky and his wife Olena Zelenska in 2020 Earlier Boris Johnson hailed plans to send extra military support and humanitarian aid to Ukraine as it remainsunder attack from Russia. He later tweeted that he had spoken to Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte to discuss defensive aid for Ukraine and the ""need for urgent action to exclude Russia"" from the Swift system of international banking payments. LIVE: Battles rage for key Ukrainian cities Town stages rally to show solidarity with Ukraine 'Daddy, I'm really scared, we can hear explosions' One of the demonstrations saw large crowds of people gathering outside the Russian embassy in London throughout the day. There were chants of ""Russia stop the war"", ""Putin stop the war"" and ""leave Ukraine alone"". Among them was Elena Shevchenko, who is half-Russian, half-Ukrainian, and said her father is currently in Kyiv, with his family. She said he had been sleeping in a shelter to escape the bombing. Elena Shevchenko, who is half-Russian and half-Ukrainian, said she has been unable to sleep since Russia invaded Ukraine ""I feel desperate and there's not a lot I can do,"" she said. ""But being here at least is something and I can show my position and show my support."" Asked her first reaction to the invasion earlier this week, she said: ""We didn't believe it would happen until the end. I cried a lot. I don't sleep at all. I feel so helpless."" One Russian woman, who gave her name as Alla, said she had been in tears all day after the invasion. ""I couldn't believe it was happening, the feeling of shame, guilt, horror. I felt helpless I didn't know what to do,"" she said. She added that it felt like ""fighting with yourself"" and said her generation did not support the invasion. Mick Antoniw, a minister in the Welsh government who had been in Kyiv just before the invasion, was also at the protest and called on the government to introduce ""sanctions which isolate Russia, economically, socially, politically and culturally"" - and said they must be ""so severe that the people around Putin want to remove Putin"". More than 100 people had already gathered outside the Russian embassy early on Saturday Chants of ""Putin stop the war"" could be heard at the rally outside the Russian embassy Ata protest in Caernarfon in WalesNataliia Roberts, originally from the Ukrainian city of Poltava, said she felt ""horrible"" and ""hopeless"".

At St Mary's Ukrainian School, in Holland Park, London,pupils held up placardsas they protested against the Russian invasion. Students at St Mary's Ukrainian school hold a protest against the invasion Supporters of Ukraine also gathered elsewhere in the UK on Saturday, including in Manchester's Piccadilly Gardens where around 1,000 people gathered. In Scotland, people gathered near the Scottish Parliament building in Edinburgh to urge politicians to do more to support Ukraine. Demonstrators passed a megaphone around, sharing personal stories about relatives hiding in basements in Kyiv to avoid shelling and gunfire. And people showed their support for Ukraine by laying flowers and writing messages on the pavement outside the Consulate General of Russia in Edinburgh. There were also demonstrations in smaller towns and cities, including in Middlesbrough and Gloucester. In Bristol protesters gathered by the cathedral to make their voices heard in support of Ukraine Fans held up Ukrainian flags at Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium during their match against Watford Ahead of their Premier League match against Watford,Manchester United players posed for a picture,externalalongside a poster saying ""peace"" in several languages, while fans displayed Ukrainian flags in Old Trafford.

"Moves to shut Russia out of the main global bank payments system have gained ground after Germany's government softened its stance. Countries including the UK have lobbied for Russia to be blocked from the Swift system, which makes it possible to move money across frontiers. Now Germany, which opposed the move, has said it favours ""targeted and functional"" restrictions. The economy and foreign ministers said they wanted to hit ""the right people"". The change of heart opens the way to further economic sanctions against Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. Until now, Germany had argued that simply ejecting Russia from Swift would damage Western economies massively and bring widespread suffering to ordinary Russian people, rather than the government. What is Swift and why are leaders divided on sanctions? So far, sanctions have included freezing the assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, as well as halting Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Swift is used by more than 11,000 banks and financial institutions worldwide to carry out transactions worth trillions of dollars. Excluding Russia from Swift would not stop its banks sending and receiving cross-border payments, but it would make the process much more difficult and expensive. Germany's new stance was signalled in a joint statement by Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and Economy Minister Robert Habeck. ""We are urgently working on how to limit the collateral damage of decoupling from Swift in such a way that it affects the right people,"" they said. ""What we need is a targeted and functional restriction of Swift."" THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? IN MAPS:How Russia carried out the invasion SANCTIONS:Who is not on UK list?

"Boris Johnson says Ukrainians are ""fighting heroically"" and with ""great success"" in some places. Following a call with the Ukrainian president, the prime minister said things ""are not going all the way of President [Vladimir] Putin"". But he said more had to be done to ""change the heavy odds that Ukraine faces"" from the Russian invasion. Tougher sanctions, including a move to shut Russia out of the global payments system Swift, were needed, he said. Shortly after Mr Johnson's comments on Saturday night the European Commission alongside the US, Canada and UK announced thatselected Russian banks would be removed from the Swift messaging system. On Sunday morning, local officials reportedRussian troops had entered Ukraine's second cityKharkiv, where they are battling Ukrainian forces in the streets. Residents have been urged to stay indoors. The advance came after missiles rained down across the city overnight. A nearby natural gas pipeline and an oil terminal outside Kyiv have also been hit by the Russians. A strict curfew is in place in capital Kyiv until Monday - only police, military and volunteers are currently on the streets. So far, the fighting across Ukraine has resulted in at least 240 civilian casualties, including 64 deaths, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Ireland and Finland are the most recent countries to announce they are closing their airspace to Russian planes. Ireland's foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney urged other EU partners to do the same, and called for ""new wide-ranging sanctions to be agreed"" on Sunday.

ZELENSKY:Comedian president rises to the moment DNIPRO:Terrified residents jolt into action PHOTOS:Ordinary lives turned upside down Speaking during a visit to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire on Saturday, Boris Johnson said the UK was sending humanitarian, military and financial supplies to Ukraine. He added that 1,000 troops were being sent to the region to help with the influx of refugees and he said the government would ""of course help people fleeing for their lives"". ""Things are not going all the way of President Putin. Very far from it, the Ukrainians are fighting heroically, and in some places with great success,"" Mr Johnson said. Mr Johnson said some ""terrible atrocities"" were being committed and there would be some ""very grim days ahead for Ukraine"". He added Europe had to face the ""hideous reality"" that previous attempts at diplomacy with Mr Putin were ""a charade"". People take cover as an air-raid siren sounds near an apartment building damaged by shelling in Kyiv on Saturday During a call with Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday evening, Mr Johnson paid tribute to the ""incredible heroism and bravery"" of the Ukrainian president and his people, Downing Street said. They expressed concern for the role Belarus was playing in the violence and agreed on the need for ""the international community to isolate Russia completely diplomatically and financially"". In a tweet Mr Zelensky said he was grateful to Mr Johnson and said they had agreed on further steps to ""counter the aggressor"". Day 3: Tracking Russia's invasion in maps What is Swift and why is banning Russia so significant? So far, sanctions have included freezing the assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, as well as halting Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Liz Truss announced that the Foreign Office is preparing a ""hit list"" of Russian oligarchs to be targeted by sanctions in the coming months, with new names added every few weeks. The foreign secretarytold the Sunday Times,external: ""We have to make it deeply painful for the oligarchs that support the Putin regime. There are over 100 Russian billionaires. ""Nothing is off the table in terms of who or what we are targeting. We are very clear about that - we are very prepared to do what it takes."" It comes days after Mr Johnsontargeted a handful of oligarchs and said major Russian banks will be excluded from the UK financial system. Ukrainian servicemen have a meal at the military airbase Vasylkiv in the Kyiv region Mr Johnson also said that ""of course"" the UK would take Ukrainian refugees, saying the country had a ""historic and proud role of taking refugees from all conflicts"". It comes after some criticism from opposition MPs that the government had continued to apply the existing rules for Ukrainians seeking to come to the country. Mr Johnson suggested that there was ""fake news"" on the internet about the government's willingness to help refugees. Immigration minister Kevin Foster was criticised on social media after writing, in a later deleted tweet, that there were a number of routes to the UK which Ukrainians could qualify for, ""not least our seasonal worker scheme"". The prime minister also said that it was ""inconceivable"" to imagine that normal sporting relations could continue with ""Putin's Russia"" after Poland and Swedenrefused to play world cup play-off fixtures with Russia. It comes after Chelsea owner Roman Abramovichhanded over ""stewardship"" of the football clubto the trustees of its charitable foundation.

"The German government has come under public pressure to get tough on Russia Germany's Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has announced that Germany will deliver weapons directly to Ukraine. He said Germany would be sending 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger missiles. Berlin has also dropped some restrictions on German-made weapons being sent to conflict zones, meaning that third countries will be able to send more arms to Ukraine. Mr Scholz said the Russian invasion marked a turning point. The move reverses Germany's long-standing policy of banning weapon exports to conflict zones. At the same time, German ministers have said they are working on restrictingRussia's access to the Swift global interbank payment systemin a ""targeted"" way that ""hits the right people"" and avoids collateral damage. Germany's three-party coalition government, made up of socialists, liberals and Greens, has faced challenges in formulating a coherent response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But there is a dawning realisation here that Germany may have to rely not just on trade and diplomacy for its security, but also on military might. And those public figures who in the past have expressed sympathy for Moscow have either fallen silent or said they were wrong. Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, herself a Green, tweeted: ""Our world is different after Putin's war of aggression. While we are stunned by this breach of international law, we are not powerless. ""That's why we will help the Ukrainian soldiers fighting for their country with anti-tank weapons and Stinger missiles."" Germans have been shocked by Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine and have been demanding that their government take tougher action against the Kremlin. Now it has.

"A long queue lies behind - and a long and uncertain wait to cross into the unknown Tens of thousands of Ukrainians are pouring towards neighbouring countries to flee the Russian invasion. In the three days since the invasion began, more than 115,000 have crossed into Poland alone - some travelling for more than two days, others joining queues 15km (10 miles) long at border points. Those fleeing are mostly women and children, as all Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 are being told to stay and fight - in some cases separated from their families. BBC correspondents met them at the borders. Ana had to leave her husband behind in Ukraine By Lucy Williamson, Palanca, Moldova Seen from the Moldovan border, Ukraine is a nation of women.  Mothers and grandmothers, wheeling suitcases to safety, leading their children into the unknown. Ana arrived at the Palanca crossing point after more than 24 hours waiting in a queue on the Ukrainian side of the border - her little yellow car stuffed with bags, her six-year-old granddaughter singing to herself in the backseat. Ana and her stepdaughter had driven straight from the southern city of Odesa - some 50km away and now a key target for Russia in the war. But Ana's calm smiling manner crumbled as soon as she began to speak.  Breaking down in tears, she described how she'd had to leave her husband behind to defend their country. ""I hope the West will help us get out of this terrible situation, because right now we're facing the Russian aggressor alone."" Around her, local volunteers from Moldova's towns and villages waited to offer lifts to Ukrainians arriving here on foot. But, like Ana, many who turn up here have thought only of escaping Ukraine, and have little idea of what happens now - for their country or themselves. Tea, coffee and guidance at makeshift stalls at the Ukraine-Moldova border By Mark Lowen, Przemysl, Poland The overnight train from Kyiv, via Lviv, pulled in carrying Europe's new refugees. They arrived at the 19th Century train station at Przemysl, which is now a modern-day reception centre. Kateryna Leontieva's journey was long - her return to Ukraine could be a lot longer ""It took us 52 hours to get here,"" said Kateryna Leontieva, who had travelled from Kharkiv with her teenage daughter. Clutching their Ukrainian passports, and carrying a rucksack of belongings, they stepped out into eastern Poland - and safety. When I asked how it felt to be here, Kateryna welled up with emotion. ""I don't know yet - the tears are just coming,"" she said. ""I didn't feel anything - but now I'm starting to realise. I hope it's just a short trip and we'll be back soon."" In the waiting room, we found Irene and her two young children. Her husband had remained in Lviv to defend their homeland. ""Only women and children are allowed to go,"" she said. ""The men want to stay, fight, and give blood. They are heroes."" How did she feel about her husband staying behind, I asked? ""I'm afraid,"" she replied, her voice beginning to break. ""We believe everything will be alright. And we're praying for them."" Women say they are afraid, but proud their men are staying behind to fight By Nick Thorpe, Beregsurany, Hungary Victoria came from Irshava, in western Ukraine. ""I came to Hungary with my two daughters. I'm leaving them with relatives who are waiting here at the border and returning to my husband,"" she says amidst nervous laughter. Are you afraid to go back? ""Honestly, I'm not afraid. I only worry about my daughters, that's all. I see that things are not good for Ukraine, but I cannot leave my country. We have to be patriotic."" And her defiance continues. ""My husband is ready if necessary to protect Ukraine for the future, for our children. I don't want it but we must save our country. ""He will go to the military office because he has received a letter."" By Rob Cameron, Vysne Slamence, Slovakia In the tiny village of Velke Slamence, the latest gaggle of refugees walked briskly down the road, eyes searching anxiously for a familiar face, followed by a shout of recognition, a hug, a kiss. For a fleeting moment the scene felt joyful - light-hearted almost. But then it was punctured by a sharp, piercing cry. A woman's face crumpled in anguish before she was led swiftly away. ""Uzhhorod,"" said a teenage girl, when I asked where she was from, a city of 100,000 just across the border. Before World War Two that city was part of Czechoslovakia. There are bonds of kinship and solidarity in these plains beneath the Carpathian Mountains that go back a century. That was almost all she would tell me. She clutched the hand of her little brother, a shy boy. Their parents had stayed behind. It was unclear who they were waiting for. The men are the ones waiting for the displaced Ukrainians to come Tanya left Kyiv 20 years ago, and now lives with her partner in Stuttgart. But here she was, standing by the roadside, waiting to rescue an old friend as their home city was engulfed by chaos. Surveying the scene was villager Jan Toth. ""They're not letting men leave, Putin or Zelensky,"" he told me. ""It's a catastrophe."" THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine?

"This video can not be played Video of the Kyiv apartment building struck earlier on Saturday Russian assaults on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, have been met with fierce resistance as the Ukrainian military says it fought off several attacks. The military said in a Facebook post early on Saturday that an army unit managed to repel Russian forces near its base on a major city street. President Volodymyr Zelensky said: ""The occupiers wanted to block the centre of our state... We broke their plan."" Meanwhile, fighting continues near several other Ukrainian cities. A total of 198 Ukrainians, including three children, have been killed since Russia invaded, said the country's Health Minister, Viktor Lyashko. Live updates from on the ground Where does Ukraine go from here? Weapons now part of daily life According to a report by the Interfax-Ukraine news agency, a curfew will start in Kyiv at 17:00 (15:00 GMT) on Saturday and last until 08:00 on Monday. In an address, Mr Zelensky said: ""We are defending the country, the land of our future children. Kyiv and key cities around the capital are controlled by our army. ""The occupiers wanted to block the centre of our state and put their puppets here, as in Donetsk. We broke their plan."" This video can not be played Zelensky's defiant response to invasion... in 100 seconds In a self-shot video, Mr Zelensky was earlier seen walking around Kyiv's government district in an apparent effort to dispel rumours he had called on the army to surrender to Russian troops. ""I'm here. We won't lay down our arms. We will defend our state,"" he said. Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, said a missile had hit a block of flats in the city, posting a picture on Facebook showing at least four apartments destroyed. He added on Telegram that 35 people, including two children, had been wounded as of 06:00 local time (04:00 GMT). ""There are no Russian troops in the city,"" he claimed, adding that people should stay in shelters as more air attacks were expected. Kyiv is a city bathed in sunlight and a suffocating layer of tension. The attack on the apartment building looks like a scene from a disaster movie - a chunk of it ripped away. It seems miraculous that there are no reports of deaths. ""It's no miracle,"" a local man called Yuri tells me. ""Most people were in the shelters or have left already."" In the wreckage, there are fragments of normal lives - a book, a child's photograph, a keyboard. One family with small children rushes past, struggling with bags and a stroller, then cramming into a van to get away. In this European capital city, there is a real sense that nowhere is safe. Earlier on Saturday, Ukraine's air force command also reported heavy fighting near the Vasylkiv air base, southwest of Kyiv, adding that it was under attack by Russian paratroopers. Separately it claimed one of its fighters had shot down a Russian transport plane. The BBC was unable to verify this. Mr Zelensky acknowledged Russian forces had inflicted casualties, he maintained ""the enemy has sustained very serious casualties"", too. The BBC cannot verify this claim. THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? IN MAPS:How Russia carried out the invasion SANCTIONS:Who is not on UK list? As Russian troops closed in on Kyiv, Ukraine urged the West to take faster and tougher sanctions to punish Moscow for its attack. Among the demands was an effort to cut off Russia from Swift -the system used for global business transactions. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also urged the West to block Russia from the payments system to ""inflict maximum pain on President Putin and his regime"". It comes after Ukraine's defence minister urged anyone able to hold a weapon to join the effort to repel Russia. Hanna Syva, a mother of two,told the BBC she wasprepared to run to the basement in the event of shelling - but was also making plans to defend Ukraine. As her husband prepares to fight, she lives with a rifle and pistol on a window ledge next to her children's toys. ""I'm scared for my life, for my kids, I'm scared for my country. But this is the fear that is transformed into anger that makes you do something to defend your country and protect yourself,"" she said. Are you in Ukraine?

"Moves to shut Russia out of the main global bank payments system have gained ground after Germany's government softened its stance. Countries including the UK have lobbied for Russia to be blocked from the Swift system, which makes it possible to move money across frontiers. Now Germany, which opposed the move, has said it favours ""targeted and functional"" restrictions. The economy and foreign ministers said they wanted to hit ""the right people"". The change of heart opens the way to further economic sanctions against Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. Until now, Germany had argued that simply ejecting Russia from Swift would damage Western economies massively and bring widespread suffering to ordinary Russian people, rather than the government. What is Swift and why are leaders divided on sanctions? So far, sanctions have included freezing the assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, as well as halting Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Swift is used by more than 11,000 banks and financial institutions worldwide to carry out transactions worth trillions of dollars. Excluding Russia from Swift would not stop its banks sending and receiving cross-border payments, but it would make the process much more difficult and expensive. Germany's new stance was signalled in a joint statement by Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and Economy Minister Robert Habeck. ""We are urgently working on how to limit the collateral damage of decoupling from Swift in such a way that it affects the right people,"" they said. ""What we need is a targeted and functional restriction of Swift."" THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? IN MAPS:How Russia carried out the invasion SANCTIONS:Who is not on UK list?

"The Baltic Leader ship is being held in Boulogne France has intercepted and impounded a Russian-flagged cargo ship suspected of breaching sanctions imposed because of the invasion of Ukraine. The ship, the Baltic Leader, was heading from the north-western French city of Rouen to St Petersburg in Russia with a cargo of new cars. It is being held at the Channel port of Boulogne. Russian state media say the vessel is owned by a subsidiary of a bank targeted in recent EU and US sanctions. A regional French official said such a measure was rare, but called it a sign of firmness. The US Treasury Department has issued blocking sanctions against the vessel, saying it is owned by a subsidiary of Promsvyazbank, one of the Russian financial institutions hit by sanctions. However, the bank has said it no longer owns the Baltic Leader. It told Reuters news agency that the ship was sold to another firm before the sanctions were imposed. French officials said they were checking whether the vessel was linked to Russian financial interests and that the crew were ""being co-operative"". The process could take up to 48 hours, they added. The Russian embassy in Paris said it would send a note of protest to the French foreign ministry over the seizure. THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine?

"This video can not be played WATCH: Marc Cieslak hands-on with the Steam Deck Valve's new handheld PC, the Steam Deck, has officially been released - but only to a select few people. The hardware was originally slated for release in December 2021, butwas pushed back due to supply chain issues.,external Despite the hardware having been released, many orders are only available ""after Q2 2022"". When asked if it would be able to fulfil these pre-orders, Valve president Gabe Newell pointed to unexpected high demand. ""The shortages are not due to supply shock, they're due to a demand shock,"" he said. ""It's just this huge uptake in silicon consumption that caught everybody more or less flat-footed."" On Friday, Valve started contacting people who pre-ordered Steam Decks on a first-come, first-served basis. Customers have three days from receipt of the email from Valve to complete their purchase or lose their spot in the queue. It is unclear when customers will receive their hardware, but Valve said it will begin shipping on 28 February. The base version of the Steam Deck costs Â£349 and comes with 64GB flash storage, while the top-end version costs Â£569 and has 512GB of faster internal storage. There are three variants of the handheld available, though the only hardware difference between them is the storage One of the clear selling points of the Steam Deck isits vast library of more than 62,000 games,external, with many titles playable in some form or another. Greg Coomer, a designer at Valve, said this library was at the heart of the product's inception. ""Our goal was to bring all the games on Steam to a handheld form factor, to be able to play even the triple A games in the library,"" he said. Unlike buying a new console, players who have accrued hundreds of PC games over their life will find many of them are immediately playable on the Steam Deck. One section on the home screen will show you just how many of the games you own are considered to be ""Great on Deck"", meaning the games fully support the hardware. But this is not foolproof, as we experienced severe stuttering and slowdown in one of the selected games, the 2011 title Sonic Generations. Meanwhile, many older titles are playable with issues. For example, Persona 4 Golden runs well on the handheld - as you would expect of a game originally released on PlayStation 2 and remastered for Sony's handheld PlayStation Vita. However, it currently does not play audio during cut scenes, and has extended black screen delays exiting battles. Despite having limited internal storage space, all versions of the Steam Deck are expandable by a MicroSD card. Mr Coomer said the hardware would not only support a 1TB MicroSD card, but he believed it would support any size that exists. A feature of the handheld is its battery life. Valve says it can hold charge for up to eight hours depending on use, although we were unable to find a game which ran for this length of time on default settings. The battery time varies from game to game, with hit title Grand Theft Auto V lasting just under five hours with default graphics settings. How a selection of games fared with battery life on default settings: Control (2019) - three hours Skyrim: Special Edition (2011, Special Edition released 2016) - four hours Sims 4 (2014) - four hours Persona 4: Golden (2012, PC version released 2020) - six hours Fallout: New Vegas (2010) - six hours According to Mr Coomer, parts of the Steam Deck - such as the battery - are ""technically upgradeable"", while other parts are replaceable if players have an issue. ""But there's a limit,"" he said. ""For example, it's really hard to get the battery out if you need to replace that. ""You can upgrade parts, you can swap parts. Some parts are easier to swap than others. Mostly we don't recommend that anyone do that themselves at home if they're not already a pro at doing those kinds of things."" Valvehas said in the past it is ""technically possible"",externalthe Steam Deck will support an external VR headset, but it is not optimised for it. And Mr Coomer would not elaborate on which VR games would run on the device. ""We have tried it out only just to vet whether some of the peripherals will light up,"" he said. ""We knew from the outset that we're not going to have a fantastic experience with VR games running on Deck today."" This video can not be played WATCH: Marc Cieslak puts Half-Life: Alyx through its paces Valve has released several products in the hardware realm in the past, such as its 2015 Steam Machines. The prebuilt gaming PCswere intended to compete with home consoles such as the Xbox and PlayStation,but were quietly removed from the Steam store in 2018, and are no longer available for sale. It also released the Steam Controller and Steam Link, which Mr Newell points out are still supported despite being discontinued. ""All of those things have continued to be the building blocks for what we're doing with Deck,"" he said. ""I think Deck is going to be an enormously popular product. ""We'd expect customers to be excited their Steam library is going to work on their desktop, even if they stop using their Deck. That's a big advantage."" He called the Steam Deck ""the first stage of the next generation"". ""I'm playing Final Fantasy XIV on my Deck,"" he said. ""That's something that traditionally would have been absurd. ""You're not going to play that on your phone, right? It would be impossible that you throw away everything that makes it a fun game in order to get it to run in that kind of environment."" And he said Valve isn't too concerned about big sales figures, comparing the hardware to its 2020 VR release Half-Life: Alyx. ""Was Alyx a huge financial success? No,"" he said. ""Because the number of devices where you can play it is a vast subset of the number of PC titles. ""Does that mean in any way, shape, or form that we're disappointed with Alyx? Not at all, because we're in this for the long haul. ""Our view is, narrowly viewing everything in terms of strict unit volumes precludes a lot of interesting choices."" The Steam Deck seems destined to be compared to the wildly popular Nintendo Switch, which has surpassed 100 million sales worldwide. But from a consumer's point of view, the handheld PC does offer something dramatically different - every single game that can be purchased on the Steam Deck remains in your Steam library to be played in the future long after the hardware no longer functions. So perhaps the most intriguing thing about the Steam Deck that separates it from other consoles is not just that it already has a vast library - it's that its library will live on.

"Sergei Lavrov and Vladimir Putin are ""responsible for the deaths of innocent people in Ukraine"", Germany says Western nations have ordered personal sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov over the invasion of Ukraine. The men's assets in the US, EU, UK and Canada will be frozen and, in the case of the US, a travel ban imposed. The announcement came on the second day of the Russian attack on its neighbour. Such punitive measures against leaders are rare. The EU has only ever imposed sanctions on the presidents of Syria and Belarus, for instance. The US, for its part, has previously announced measures against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, in addition to Syria's Bashar al-Assad. It is unclear how significant the assets of Mr Putin and Mr Lavrov are in the US, EU, UK and Canada, and what practical impact the sanctions will have. Russia said they showed the West's ""absolute impotence"" on foreign policy. Russia later vetoed a draft UN resolution to condemn the invasion of Ukraine after a debate at the UN Security Council. India, China and the UAE all abstained from voting, while 11 other members voted in favour. Speaking after the vote, the US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said, ""Russia has abused its power today to veto our strong resolution, but Russia cannot veto our words."" ""President Putin is the aggressor here, there is no middle ground."" The sanctions come as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Russia would try to ""storm"" Kyiv on Friday night. In a video statement, Mr Zelensky said ""this night will be hard, very hard, but morning will come. ""This night the enemy will be using all available means to break our resistance. This night they will launch an assault. ""This night we must persevere. The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now."" He added: ""Our main goal is to finish this bloodbath."" While Mr Zelensky acknowledged Russian forces had inflicted casualties, he maintained ""the enemy has sustained very serious casualties"", too. The BBC cannot verify this claim. His words came after a day which saw Russian tanks enter the capital for the first time with large blasts heard across the city. Russian troops also reportedly entered the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol, according to Russian news agency Tass. The BBC cannot independently verify this, but earlier Mr Zelensky said that there was heavy fighting in the city. Earlier on Friday evening a spokesperson for Mr Zelensky said the country was prepared to hold ceasefire and peace talks with Russia immediately and were discussing a place and time to hold talks. Analysts suggest Russia's advance has been slowed by fierce resistance. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the Russian president and his top diplomat were ""responsible for the deaths of innocent people in Ukraine, and for trampling on the international system"".

"Protests and demonstrations in support of Ukraine have been held around the UK as Russia continues its invasion. Thousands have joined various rallies, including outside the Russian embassy and Downing Street in London, and in Manchester and Edinburgh. Eggs were thrown at the embassy and messages written in chalk were scrawled over the outer walls. And the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have said they ""stand"" with the people of Ukraine as they ""bravely fight"". Ina tweet,external, Prince William and Catherine said they had met President Volodymyr Zelensky and his wife in 2020 and said: ""Today we stand with the president and all of Ukraine's people as they bravely fight for that future."" Prince Harry and Meghan also released a statement saying they stood with the people of Ukraine ""against this breach of international and humanitarian law"" and encouraged global leaders to do the same. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met Volodymyr Zelensky and his wife Olena Zelenska in 2020 Earlier Boris Johnson hailed plans to send extra military support and humanitarian aid to Ukraine as it remainsunder attack from Russia. He later tweeted that he had spoken to Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte to discuss defensive aid for Ukraine and the ""need for urgent action to exclude Russia"" from the Swift system of international banking payments. LIVE: Battles rage for key Ukrainian cities Town stages rally to show solidarity with Ukraine 'Daddy, I'm really scared, we can hear explosions' One of the demonstrations saw large crowds of people gathering outside the Russian embassy in London throughout the day. There were chants of ""Russia stop the war"", ""Putin stop the war"" and ""leave Ukraine alone"". Among them was Elena Shevchenko, who is half-Russian, half-Ukrainian, and said her father is currently in Kyiv, with his family. She said he had been sleeping in a shelter to escape the bombing. Elena Shevchenko, who is half-Russian and half-Ukrainian, said she has been unable to sleep since Russia invaded Ukraine ""I feel desperate and there's not a lot I can do,"" she said. ""But being here at least is something and I can show my position and show my support."" Asked her first reaction to the invasion earlier this week, she said: ""We didn't believe it would happen until the end. I cried a lot. I don't sleep at all. I feel so helpless."" One Russian woman, who gave her name as Alla, said she had been in tears all day after the invasion. ""I couldn't believe it was happening, the feeling of shame, guilt, horror. I felt helpless I didn't know what to do,"" she said. She added that it felt like ""fighting with yourself"" and said her generation did not support the invasion. Mick Antoniw, a minister in the Welsh government who had been in Kyiv just before the invasion, was also at the protest and called on the government to introduce ""sanctions which isolate Russia, economically, socially, politically and culturally"" - and said they must be ""so severe that the people around Putin want to remove Putin"". More than 100 people had already gathered outside the Russian embassy early on Saturday Chants of ""Putin stop the war"" could be heard at the rally outside the Russian embassy Ata protest in Caernarfon in WalesNataliia Roberts, originally from the Ukrainian city of Poltava, said she felt ""horrible"" and ""hopeless"".

At St Mary's Ukrainian School, in Holland Park, London,pupils held up placardsas they protested against the Russian invasion. Students at St Mary's Ukrainian school hold a protest against the invasion Supporters of Ukraine also gathered elsewhere in the UK on Saturday, including in Manchester's Piccadilly Gardens where around 1,000 people gathered. In Scotland, people gathered near the Scottish Parliament building in Edinburgh to urge politicians to do more to support Ukraine. Demonstrators passed a megaphone around, sharing personal stories about relatives hiding in basements in Kyiv to avoid shelling and gunfire. And people showed their support for Ukraine by laying flowers and writing messages on the pavement outside the Consulate General of Russia in Edinburgh. There were also demonstrations in smaller towns and cities, including in Middlesbrough and Gloucester.

Protesters have written messages in chalk outside the Russian embassy There was also a rally outside Downing Street Britain is among more than 25 countries to pledge to continue to supply arms, as capital Kyiv remains under attack. Russian assaults on the capital have been met with fierce resistanceon the third day of the invasion, and there is also fighting in or near several other cities.

"Zmiinyi (Snake) Island is located 48km (30 miles) south of Ukraine's mainland in the Black Sea Ukraine has honoured 13 soldiers who were killed defending a tiny island after reportedly swearing at a Russian ship that ordered them to surrender. In unverified audio clips, the borders guards defending Zmiinyi Island in the Black Sea are told to ""lay down your weapons"" or ""be bombed"". ""Russian warship, go to hell,"" they respond. Ukraine says they were then killed by air and sea strikes. Russia denies the account, saying they all surrendered. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has awarded each of the guards the posthumous title of ""Hero of Ukraine"". ""On our Zmiinyi Island, defending it to the last, all the border guards died heroically,"" Mr Zelensky said. In the audio recordings, shared by a Ukrainian government official, the soldiers can be heard exchanging barbed comments with the Russian vessel. ""This is a Russian warship,"" one voice says in the clip. ""I propose you lay down your weapons and surrender to avoid bloodshed and unnecessary victims. Otherwise you will be bombed"" According to the audio, the Ukrainian soldiers can then be heard speaking amongst themselves, agreeing ""this is it"", before their final ""go to hell"". According to Ukrainian officials, those were the last words heard from the island before Russia began strikes and Kyiv lost contact with the island. The official Russian account of the incident differs dramatically. Moscow said the 82 Ukrainian soldiers on the island surrendered it to them voluntarily and made no mention of carrying out strikes or inflicting casualties. Snake Island is a roughly 16-hectare (40-acre) rocky island owned by Ukraine that lies about 300km (186 miles) west of Crimea. Ukraine says 137 of its civilians and military personnel were killed during Russia's invasion on Thursday. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine?

"This video can not be played Video of the Kyiv apartment building struck earlier on Saturday Russian assaults on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, have been met with fierce resistance as the Ukrainian military says it fought off several attacks. The military said in a Facebook post early on Saturday that an army unit managed to repel Russian forces near its base on a major city street. President Volodymyr Zelensky said: ""The occupiers wanted to block the centre of our state... We broke their plan."" Meanwhile, fighting continues near several other Ukrainian cities. A total of 198 Ukrainians, including three children, have been killed since Russia invaded, said the country's Health Minister, Viktor Lyashko. Live updates from on the ground Where does Ukraine go from here? Weapons now part of daily life According to a report by the Interfax-Ukraine news agency, a curfew will start in Kyiv at 17:00 (15:00 GMT) on Saturday and last until 08:00 on Monday. In an address, Mr Zelensky said: ""We are defending the country, the land of our future children. Kyiv and key cities around the capital are controlled by our army. ""The occupiers wanted to block the centre of our state and put their puppets here, as in Donetsk. We broke their plan."" This video can not be played Zelensky's defiant response to invasion... in 100 seconds In a self-shot video, Mr Zelensky was earlier seen walking around Kyiv's government district in an apparent effort to dispel rumours he had called on the army to surrender to Russian troops. ""I'm here. We won't lay down our arms. We will defend our state,"" he said. Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, said a missile had hit a block of flats in the city, posting a picture on Facebook showing at least four apartments destroyed. He added on Telegram that 35 people, including two children, had been wounded as of 06:00 local time (04:00 GMT). ""There are no Russian troops in the city,"" he claimed, adding that people should stay in shelters as more air attacks were expected. Kyiv is a city bathed in sunlight and a suffocating layer of tension. The attack on the apartment building looks like a scene from a disaster movie - a chunk of it ripped away. It seems miraculous that there are no reports of deaths. ""It's no miracle,"" a local man called Yuri tells me. ""Most people were in the shelters or have left already."" In the wreckage, there are fragments of normal lives - a book, a child's photograph, a keyboard. One family with small children rushes past, struggling with bags and a stroller, then cramming into a van to get away. In this European capital city, there is a real sense that nowhere is safe. Earlier on Saturday, Ukraine's air force command also reported heavy fighting near the Vasylkiv air base, southwest of Kyiv, adding that it was under attack by Russian paratroopers. Separately it claimed one of its fighters had shot down a Russian transport plane. The BBC was unable to verify this. Mr Zelensky acknowledged Russian forces had inflicted casualties, he maintained ""the enemy has sustained very serious casualties"", too. The BBC cannot verify this claim. THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? IN MAPS:How Russia carried out the invasion SANCTIONS:Who is not on UK list? As Russian troops closed in on Kyiv, Ukraine urged the West to take faster and tougher sanctions to punish Moscow for its attack. Among the demands was an effort to cut off Russia from Swift -the system used for global business transactions. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also urged the West to block Russia from the payments system to ""inflict maximum pain on President Putin and his regime"". It comes after Ukraine's defence minister urged anyone able to hold a weapon to join the effort to repel Russia. Hanna Syva, a mother of two,told the BBC she wasprepared to run to the basement in the event of shelling - but was also making plans to defend Ukraine. As her husband prepares to fight, she lives with a rifle and pistol on a window ledge next to her children's toys. ""I'm scared for my life, for my kids, I'm scared for my country. But this is the fear that is transformed into anger that makes you do something to defend your country and protect yourself,"" she said. Are you in Ukraine?

"Some videos, such as this clip of an aerial attack, are from previous conflicts The second day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been accompanied by further false or misleading imagery on social media claiming to be from the conflict. Some show military action taken from older conflicts, while other viral videos have proved difficult to verify. One video clip seen by the BBC and proven to be several years old has been viewed more than 27 million times in one day, while another showed video game footage. Misleading posts have come from ""official"" sources as well as from ""ordinary"" social media users. One example was a tweet posted by the verified account of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence. This dogfight footage comes from a video game Footage of an aerial dogfight is accompanied by the caption ""MiG-29 of the Air Force of the Armed Forces destroys the 'unparalleled' Su-35 of the Russian occupiers"". However, it's video game footage from the game Digital Combat Simulator World. This isn't the first time that game footagehas been used to illustrate military action. One clip of old and incorrectly labelled footage has been viewed over 18 million times on video-sharing platform TikTok. Russian and Ukrainian troops did face off against each other, but this happened in 2014 It claims to show Ukrainian troops ""facing off"" with Russian soldiers at an airbase. While it does show a confrontation between Ukrainian and Russian forces, fact-checkers Logically have ascertained that the footage was shot in 2014 during the annexation of Crimea, and was shot at the Belbek airbase near Sevastopol. The same footagewas aired by BBC Turkish at the time,external, after it was broadcast by Turkish television. This is footage from the Syrian conflict One video, which was posted on both Facebook and Twitter from an unofficial account supporting Ukraine's armed forces, claims to show the destruction of Russian personnel and equipment in Ukraine, as seen through a drone aircraft's gunsight. However, it's footage from Syria shot in 2020. The new version sees the image flipped, perhaps in an attempt to prevent verification through reverse-image search tools. The Twitter post was subsequently deleted. Another incorrectly labelled clip on Twitter claims to be of a Russian airstrike on Ukraine ""that caused a chain reaction at the Luhansk power plant"". This post incorrectly passes off the deadly Tianjin explosions as warfare in Ukraine Various uploads of the clip have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. The video actually shows footage of the 12 August 2015 Tianjin blasts in China, which killed around 173 people when a container containing chemicals exploded at a port. A BBC report on the Chinese incidentcan be viewed here. One TikTok video has been viewed 27.5m times and shared by thousands of users who assumed that it was from Ukraine. The clip shows some men in military fatigues shouting and laughing in Russian as they parachute over farmland. Many social media users think this clip shows Russian forces landing in Ukraine Although the caption just says ""Original sound - Roman"", users have assumed that the video is of Russian troops taking part in the invasion. In fact, it's footage shot by a man who appears to be a member of the Russian armed forces, and uploaded to his Instagram channel in 2015. He uploaded the old footage to his TikTok channel on 24 February, the day of the Russian invasion of the Ukraine, leading to viewers thinking it was footage from the conflict. This rocket barrage probably took place during military drills in 2018 More old footage on Twitter includes video of a rocket barrage, implying it is part of the Ukraine war. In fact it's from 2018, and shows a barrage launched from Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS). A tweet from 2018 shows the same footage, although there is some doubt about the accuracy of the caption. In some cases it has been impossible to verify the truth behind a viral post. One example is that of a video clip of a missile being fired toward a residential area in Kyiv by a low-flying jet. The footage has been viewed more than two million times on Twitter. However, the aircraft is travelling too fast and the video is of too poor a quality to verify which country's air force the plane belongs to. There is also debate as to whether the residential area was deliberately targeted, or if the missile was fired in error. There have also been conflicting claims over the identity and intention of the aircraft. Fast-moving events such as war mean that misleading imagery will inevitably appear on social media. Misinformation is easily shared, often by those who believe the images to be genuine. Misleading images shared online on first day of Ukraine conflict Social media users can limit the spread of bad information by taking a few seconds before sharing, to consider whether what they're seeing seems genuine and is from a source that they trust. Checking with multiple trusted sources can help to prevent these images from being widely shared.
