In a statement, her family said she was a talented dancer with a sense of adventure ""who lit up every room she walked in to, and made people smile just by being there"". They added: ""She was always so kind and supportive to her family and friends, which resulted in her having a very special connection with a wide network of people from all walks of her life, who we know will miss her dearly. ""She was particularly excited to be embarking on the next stage of her education, on an internship in Madagascar complementing her studies in Natural Sciences."" Alana Cutland was on an internship in Madagascar when she died Madagascar is an island off thesouth-east coast of Africa, famed for its unique wildlife. Dr David Woodman, from Robinson College, said they were ""deeply shocked by the news of Alana's death"".

"Khadijah Mellah has been training since April Peckham teenager Khadijah Mellah will ride out at Glorious Goodwood on Thursday and make a little bit of history in front of 25,000 people. The 18-year-old student is believed to be the first person in the UK to appear in a competitive horse race while wearing a hijab. She will ride in the all-female Magnolia Cup - an amateur jockey's charity race - alongside former Olympian turned jockey Victoria Pendleton, BBC presenter Alexis Green and TV personality Vogue Williams. ""From a young age, I have wanted to be the person that people look up to,"" Khadijah told BBC Sport. ""I have already started receiving other messages from Muslim girls and it makes me really happy to hear from all these people that I'm affecting positively."" Khadijah got into horse riding seven years go, but had not sat on a racehorse before April this year. She has been training at Newmarket in the build-up to the Goodwood Festival. ""People have been very welcoming to the prospect of having a new face in the jockey industry,"" she said. ""I enjoy having conversations about people who are genuinely curious. ""Sometimes it's hard explaining my background over and over again to lots of different people, but generally I like explaining where I've come from and how I've got to where I have."" According to the Muslim Women's Sport Foundation, the number of female British Muslim Jockeys - past and present - is in ""single digits"". But in the horse racing world, Khadijah views her identity as a conversation starter. ""When I ride out in Newmarket I do try to spot any other women of colour and there was only one in over 200 riders,"" she said. ""But it doesn't faze me; it means that I end up talking to loads of people and making great connections, so I'm happy. ""It makes me feel sort of blessed because not many people get the opportunity to represent. It adds a little meaning to life."" A documentary called Riding A Dream is being made about Khadijah, in which she says: ""There's quite a stereotype around Muslim girls and them not being able to follow their sporting passions and dreams."" Khadijah first joined Brixton's Ebony Horse Club, when her mum came across a leaflet in a local mosque. While training to be a jockey, Khadijah has balanced studying for her A-levels and a part-time job, as well as continuing to volunteer and mentor younger riders at Ebony Horse Club every week. She has been training extensively for the five-furlong and 110 yards (1,110m) flat race being staged on the third day of the fixture to raise funds for the Wellbeing of Women healthcare charity. ""My introduction to race horses started off a bit rocky,"" she said. ""They were quite scary at first. I was a nervous wreck before my first gallop. It was quite a shock how fast you go. When you're on a racehorse you feel absolutely everything."" Khadijah says she is feeling ""confident"" about the race, mixed with ""nervousness"" about the scale of the event. ""I'm very competitive so it would mean the world if I did come first, and I feel like a lot of people would be celebrating if I did - the support behind me would be great,"" she said. ""I never thought I'd have a future in racing at all. But now that I've been introduced to it and I've been riding racehorses for the past couple of weeks, I've fallen in love with it and I'm definitely going to keep at it. ""And maybe one day get into big races and become an amateur or an apprentice.""

"James McArdle (left) and James McAvoy have been less than impressed by Quentin Letts' review of Peter Gynt Actor James McArdle has called theatre reviewer Quentin Letts ""pathetic"" after he made remarks about the ""whining"" accents of Scottish actors. The critic was writing about the play Peter Gynt at London's National Theatre, in which Glasgow-born McArdle stars, when he made the comment. He said ""the fruity purr"" of Oliver Ford Davies was "" a welcome calm... from the whining Scottish accents"". ""To go for our accents is something else,"" said McArdle. The play is a modernised version of the Ibsen classic Peer Gynt. Ibsen's original 19th Century work is set in Norway and tells the story of the adventures of the titular character from the Norwegian mountains to the North African desert. David Hare's updated version sees McArdle's hero as a 21st Century Scottish soldier, in a work with singing and milkmaids described by Letts as ""dancing Dolly Partons"". Letts saidin the Sunday Times,externalCulture column: ""After so much frenzied movement and whizz-bang theatrics, the fruity purr of veteran thesp Oliver Ford Davies as the button moulder brings a welcome calm to proceedings, and relief at last from the whining Scottish accents."" Speaking to Scottish broadcaster STV, McArdle (who appeared in the TV series Love & Marriage) said he didn't want to give Letts credit as a ""real reviewer"", following the write-up.

That critic is infamous for saying things like that and I think it's a bit pathetic and I don't want to give him credit as a real reviewer to be honest."" He added: ""This whining Scottish accent is currently playing one of the biggest parts ever written in one of the most famous theatres in the world. I don't really have time for Quentin Letts to be perfectly honest with you."" McArdle's criticism of Letts follows comments made by fellow Scottish actor James McAvoy, who hit out at Letts over his ""derogatory"" comments when the review was first published on 14 July. McArdle (pictured) recently starred in Mary Queen of Scots McAvoy - soon to be seen in the BBC's adaptation of His Dark Materials - filmed a reply to Letts, which he shared on social media. ""Quentin, I would love to have a conversation with you. I'll be doing a play soon in the West End, at the end of the year,"" said McAvoy. ""Maybe we could have a post-show discussion about why you think it's okay to label the sound of an entire nation in such a derogatory fashion? ""Where the person with an English accent gets referred to by his name as an individual with fruity superlatives, whereas the people who are whining just get referred to as Scottish. Not as individuals, not as actors, just an entire nation."" Letts is known for being controversial in his reviews and last year incited a backlash after he asked inhis Daily Mail review,externalwhether actor Leo Wringer was cast in a Royal Shakespeare Company production ""because he is black"", leading the RSC to accuse him of having a ""blatantly racist attitude"".

"The government has announced an extra Â£2.1bn of funding to prepare for a no-deal Brexit - doubling the amount of money it has set aside this year. The plans include more border force officers and upgrades to transport infrastructure at ports. There will also be more money to ease traffic congestion in Kent and tackle queues created by delays at the border. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell described the plans as ""an appalling waste of taxpayers' cash"". The package also includes money for stockpiling medicines to ensure continued supplies and a national programme to help businesses. ""With 92 days until the UK leaves the European Union it's vital that we intensify our planning to ensure we are ready,"" said Chancellor Sajid Javid, announcing the move. ""We want to get a good deal that abolishes the anti-democratic backstop. But if we can't get a good deal, we'll have to leave without one. ""This additional Â£2.1bn will ensure we are ready to leave on 31 October - deal or no-deal."" Brexit: What is the Irish border backstop? No-deal Brexit: Are we ready? No-deal Brexit: 10 ways it could affect you The shadow chancellor said the extra money was ""all for the sake of Boris Johnson's drive towards a totally avoidable no-deal"". He added: ""This government could have ruled out no-deal and spent these billions on our schools, hospitals, and people. ""Labour is a party for the whole of the UK, so we'll do all we can to block a no-deal, crash-out Brexit."" ""Turbo-charging"" no-deal preparation is the energetic promise of the new Treasury, which under previous management had been accused by the now prime minister and his Brexiteer allies of dragging its feet on funding for such measures. Some of this boost, however, is a repeat prescription for vital medicine supply - spending tens of millions again on reserving cross-Channel ferry capacity and for specialist warehousing and stockpiling that was not, in the end, required after the last Brexit deadline. All this is designed to mitigate the anticipated freight gridlock around Dover and Calais. But that is not entirely in the government's hands. Much depends on whether the French authorities choose to enforce full customs and health checks on freight from the UK. The flow across the Channel also depends on the preparedness of many smaller traders, more than half of whom have not signed up to the most basic customs registration that will become mandatory for European trade under no-deal. An advertising campaign will target this vital group. It will have to persuade them that no-deal is highly likely, even as the prime minister himself suggests the chances are vanishingly small. Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman Chuka Umunna said the money was a ""drop in the ocean"". ""They promised us an extra Â£350m each week for the NHS, now they are making more money available just to ensure access to medicine."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously said he is willing to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October - whether a Brexit deal has been agreed or not. Former Border Force director-general Tony Smith said the extra money was a ""step in the right direction"" but more should have been done earlier. ""I don't understand why this wasn't implemented three years ago when the government knew we were leaving the European Union,"" he said. Chancellor Sajid Javid said the UK had to ""intensify"" its planning There could be a row over the pledge to spend such a vast sum on preparing for no-deal, given Boris Johnson's previous comment that the chances of this happening were a ""million to one"", said the BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith. Another contentious area will be the government's plan to spend around Â£130m on a huge public information campaign on advice and help for the event of no-deal, he said. In comparison, David Cameron's decision to send leaflets to every household in the run-up to the 2016 Brexit referendum had a total cost of Â£9m. Conservative peer Baroness Altmann, a former pensions minister, said: ""This is huge amounts of taxpayers' money that is being spent on something the government itself has said will be hugely damaging to the British economy and to the British way of life."" But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak insisted the latest funding was not a waste, even if the UK ended up leaving with a deal. ""A lot of the money we are spending is going to go on things that we would need to spend anyway because we're leaving the European Union,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'No room' for excess meat in no-deal Brexit ""Investment in things like our ports, our border infrastructure... all of that is money we should be spending anyway for those new arrangements."" The new money consists of Â£1.1bn which will be provided to departments and devolved administrations immediately, while a further Â£1bn will be made available if needed. This comes on top of Â£4.2bn, which has been allocated since 2016 for Brexit preparations by the previous chancellor, Philip Hammond. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell described the plans as ""an appalling waste"" But not all of that money would have been spent on getting ready for a no-deal scenario. The measures announced by Mr Javid include Â£344m to be spent on new border and customs operations. This includes recruiting an extra 500 border force officers, in addition to 500 already announced, while there will also be more money for training customs agents and processing UK passport applications. Another Â£434m will be spent on ensuring continuity of vital medicines and medical products, including freight transport, warehousing and stockpiling. Of the rest, Â£108m will go on promoting and supporting businesses ""to ensure they are ready for Brexit"", including a national programme of business readiness and ""helping exporters to prepare for, and capitalise on, new opportunities"". There will also be a public information campaign and an increase in consular support for Britons living abroad, at a cost of Â£138m. Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said she was ""sceptical about how much can be spent with the time available"". She said her committee had been told the UK was now past ""the point of no return"" for effective spending to mitigate the effects of no deal, adding: ""My biggest question is how on earth can you spend that amount of money in time, how can you recruit and train border guards in the time available, 91 days, it's just not feasible.""

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to leave the EU ""do or die"" by the 31 October - the date the UK must depart if no deal has been reached. But a government document outlining ""reasonable worst case assumptions"" in the event of such a no-deal Brexit has warned of rising food and fuel prices, disruption to medicine supplies and public disorder. An extra Â£2.1bn of funding has been announced to help deal with the consequences of no deal. How could you be affected if the UK does leave the EU without an agreement? What you find on the supermarket shelves could well be where you see the first effects. Almost 30% of our food currently comes from the EU, and it is likely that some foods, such as fresh vegetables and fruit, will become more scarce and more expensive in the event of no deal. Thefive-page document spelling out the government's worst-case assumptions under Operation Yellowhammer,external- the government's no-deal contingency plan - warns: Some fresh food supplies will decrease Key ingredients for food made in the UK may be in shorter supply There won't be a shortage of food overall, but there could be reduced availability and choice Prices may also increase ""which could impact vulnerable groups"" Supermarkets themselves have warned thatthere could be empty shelves and higher prices. In preparation, supermarkets say they have been stockpiling some foods - but they are unable to do that for some fresh fruit and veg. Stockpiling is more of a challenge at this time of year too, businesses say, aswarehouse capacity is already strained by the seasonal stock build-up ahead of Black Friday and Christmas,external. The government has said it will continue to recognise EU standards for imported food, to minimise disruption. It has alsopublished a ""tariff schedule"",,externalwhich has removed most tariffs on imports in the event of no deal. Shoppers planning to buy from companies based in the EU, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland after a no-deal Brexit have also been warnedcredit and debit card charges may be higher and payments may take longer,external. Government advice for the food and drink sector,external Government advice on buying things from Europe after Brexit,external What does Yellowhammer say about no-deal impact? Although there is not expected to be an immediate disruption to electricity or gas supplies, there arelikely to be significant price rises,externalfor businesses and households, the government's Yellowhammer report warns. The market price for electricity could climb because of a fall in the value of the pound against the euro, but also as a result of cutting ties with EU energy markets. Yellowhammer warned this could mean that some energy firms ""exit"" the energy market, ""exacerbating"" the economic and political impact of Brexit. The warnings echo the findings of a 2017 House of Lords report, which saidthe UK could be ""more vulnerable to supply shortages,externalin the event of extreme weather or unplanned generation outages"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  46%UK domestic production 45%Imported via European pipelines, inc from Russia and Norway 8%Liquefied natural gas imports The risk would arise as a result of the UK's exit from the EU's Internal Energy Market, it said. The bulk of the UK's natural gas imports come via Norway, which is part of the Internal Energy Market, although it is not an EU member. But the government says trade in gas between the UK and Norway will continue in its current form regardless. Brexit 'could leave UK short of energy' Millions of people from the UK travel abroad each year - the vast majority of journeys made to Europe. If you are planning to make a journey to an EU member state after Brexit, the government is advising you to check you have the right paperwork. Travel to Ireland will not change, even if there's no deal. You'll continue to be able to travel and work there in the same way as before. Passports The government isadvising you to make sure your passport is valid for at least six months,externalif you are travelling to most countries in Europe - thefull list is here,external. Until recently, UK citizens who renewed their passport before it expired could have up to nine months of the remaining validity added to their new travel document. But the government has now warned that this time carried over may not count towards the six-month requirement after a no-deal Brexit. You can check if your passport has enough time leftwith this government tool.,external You'll need torenew your passport before travelling,externalif you do not have enough validity left. It usually takes three weeks. Visas You won't need a visa for stays of up to 90 days out of any 180-day period in the EU or Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland (the European Economic Area). However, you may need a visa or permit to stay for longer, or to work or study. When new rules are confirmed, information about visa requirements will be oneach country's travel advice page.,external Border control The government has also advised that at EU borders you may need to: show a return or onward ticket show you have enough money for your stay use separate queueing lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens The government's Yellowhammer report also warns there may also be increased immigration checks at EU borders causing delays at airports and ports. European health cover In addition, if there is no deal, thenin theory the cover provided by your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) would cease to exist. The government is advising travellers ""whether there's a deal or not"" to ""get appropriate travel insurance with healthcare cover"". Ministers say it is ""particularly important"" to get travel insurance with the right cover if you have a pre-existing medical condition.,externalThis is because the EHIC scheme covers pre-existing conditions, while many travel insurance policies do not. Travel However you intend to travel, in the event of no-deal Brexit, the government says, you should check before you leave for any delays or disruption. If you intend to drive in the EU, you'll need some extra documents: a ""green card"", which proves your insurance provides the minimum required cover (obtained from your vehicle insurance company) a GB sticker an International Driving Permit for some countries (you cancheck if you need one,externalon the Post Office website) The government says flights, ferries and cruises, the Eurostar and Eurotunnel and bus and coach services between the UK and the EU will continue to run as normal. An earlier government assessment hadwarned of long queues at London's St Pancras International, the main Eurostar terminal in the UK,external, but Eurostar bosses have said they are working to ensuretheir services run as smoothly as possible. However, the government does warn some bus and coach services to non-EU countries, such as Switzerland or Andorra, may not be able to run. Pets After Brexit you will not be able to use the existing pet passport scheme and will instead need to follow adifferent process, involving a number of vet's tests,external.

While there are regular fluctuations in medicine supplies, there areconcerns a no-deal Brexit could make shortages worse. The government's Yellowhammer document warns supplies of medicines and medical products are ""particularly vulnerable"" to disruption at Channel ports. While some products can be stockpiled, others can't because of their short shelf life, it says. More than 12,000 medicines are used by the NHS, andabout 7,000 come from or via the EU. Ministers and NHS leaders say every effort is being made to ensure there will be enough medicines and clinical equipment available in the event of delays to imports from the EU.

In event of no deal, this would ensure they would have continued access to employment, healthcare, education, benefits and other services. However, the government's Yellowhammer document warns that as UK nationals will lose their EU citizenship, they can ""expect to lose associated rights and access to services over time"".

Its Yellowhammer report warns that whileEU countries should treat people with urgent needs, they may be required to pay. This could mean some people facing ""substantial costs"".,external Information on how to access healthcare abroad,externalcan be found on the NHS website. Pensions The UK government will continue to pay state pension, child benefits, and disability benefits to eligible UK nationals in the EU. Tax The UK's exit from the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements, which apply to EU countries.

As a member of the EU, UK firms don't have to pay extra duties, taxes or have customs checks on goods travelling to or from the EU. But after a no-deal Brexit, new rules will apply. UK businesses will need to apply the same processes to EU trade that apply when trading with the rest of the world. Individuals may also have to pay VAT, duty and fees if they receive parcels worth more than Â£135. In March,the government published a 1,477-page documentoutlining its plans for tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In October it published anupdate,externalto the plans which trade minister Conor Burns said are designed to support the UK economy. A tariff is a tax applied to goods that are traded on international markets. Mostly, they are applied to imported goods by the country importing them. But there can also be tariffs on exported goods. Under the temporary scheme, 88% of imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access. At the moment, 80% of imports are tariff free. Tariffs would be maintained to protect some industries, including agriculture. Beef, lamb, poultry and some dairy products would receive protection. How will the new tariff system work? Government guide to no-deal tariffs,external Most commentators and industry experts agree uncertainty created by the Brexit process is causing buyers and sellers to sit tight, causing a slowdown in the housing market. UK house pricesrose at a slower rate in the year to July than at any time since September 2012,according to the Office of National Statistics. Brexit uncertainty meant key aspects of the housing market were""pretty much flatlining"", the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has said. The Bank of England says theimpact of the UK leaving the EU on the housing market could be significant. It has said house prices could fall by up to 30% from pre-Brexit levels if there was no deal, or a ""disorderly Brexit"". In July, the Office for Budget responsibility estimated a possible 10%fall in house prices,externalby 2021 in the event of no-deal.

Up to85% of lorries using the main channel crossings ""may not be ready"" for French customs and could face queues of two-and-a-half days,,externalthe government's Yellowhammer report warns. These queues at Channel ports could reduce the flow of trucks to 40-60% of current levels within a day, it says, with the worst disruption lasting up to three months. Even after that time, traffic flows may only reach 50-70% of current levels and delays could lead to queues in Kent and other routes to France for significantly longer, the report said. A simple guide to the UK leaving the EU A jargon-busting guide to the key terms In the event of bottlenecks, a traffic management system known as Operation Brock would come into force on a section of the M20. Traffic would be allowed to flow in both directions on the same carriageway, while lorries would be left queuing on the other side. If that proved to be insufficient, a disused airfield near Ramsgate would be used as a lorry park, and if further capacity was still required, the M26 could also be used. Kent County Council says it hasemployed extra staff and stockpiled supplies in preparation for six months of disruption in the event of no deal. To ensure more lorries are ready for customs, the government announced last month that88,000 companies would be automatically enrolled in a new customs system.

"This video can not be played What does the interest rate cut really mean? The US central bank has cut interest rates for the first time since 2008 but not won over President Donald Trump. Mr Trump, who had demanded a big rate cut, was unimpressed with the Federal Reserve's 0.25 percentage point cut that took the federal funds target range to 2-2.25%. In a tweet, the president scorned Fed chair Jerome Powell, saying: ""As usual, Powell let us down."" The main stock market indexes on Wall Street all closed more than 1% lower. Analysts cited uncertainty over how many rate cuts the market should expect. ""What the market wanted to hear from Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve was that this was the beginning of a lengthy and aggressive rate-cutting cycle which would keep pace with China,"" tweeted Mr Trump. At a news conference following the announcement, Mr Powell said the rate cut had been ""well telegraphed"", but he was not committing to ""just one"" cut. Cutting rates makes borrowing money cheaper for businesses and consumers alike. But support for the measure was not unanimous. The cut was opposed by two members of the Fed's Open Markets Committee, the body responsible for setting rates. There were eight votes in favour, including Mr Powell and vice-chair John Williams. Mr Powell said the US economy had grown ""at a healthy pace"" over the first six months of the year. However, there had been ""both positive and negative developments"". ""Manufacturing output has declined for two consecutive quarters,"" he said. Mr Powell said weak global growth had also played a part in the Fed's decision. He said it was not the Fed's job to criticise US trade policy, which has been dominated by a trade battle with China as the two nations have imposed tit-for-tat tariff increases on each other's products. He added that trade policy tensions had ""nearly boiled over"" during May and June, ""but now they appear to have returned to a simmer"". Mr Powell denied that the Fed was giving in to pressure from President Trump for a rate cut, saying that there was ""no place"" in the central bank's discussions for political concerns. The Fed statement said the labour market remained strong and economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate. ""Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low,"" it added. ""Although growth of household spending has picked up from earlier in the year, growth of business fixed investment has been soft. ""On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2%."" Inflation is lower than US policymakers would like, which was one of the reasons for the rate cut. At present, the US economy is creating plenty of jobs. Unemployment hit a 49-year low in May and was at 3.7% last month. But many of those jobs are in the service sector and are low-paying with low hours, economists say.

"Survivors of the regime at Beechwood have described an environment in which sexual abuse was rife For decades, young people at a Nottinghamshire children's home were subjected to a regime of sexual and physical abuse. Boys and girls were watched while washing, groomed and assaulted in their beds. Laura was one of those children. One of the witnesses at theIndependent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA),external, she has been speaking to the BBC about her time at the notorious Beechwood Community Home. Laura came home from school one day to find her suitcases packed and a social worker waiting for her. Feeling ""totally abandoned"" and ""absolutely heartbroken"", she was taken into Enderleigh, one of the four units comprising the Beechwood children's home in Mapperley, just outside Nottingham city centre. Even though she was only there for a matter of weeks, Laura - not her real name - became one of the many residents who were sexually abused. Now in her 50s, she is telling her story in the hope it helps other victims of abuse in the care system, and highlights their fight for justice. Former Beechwood residents told the inquiry of run-down conditions in the children's home Laura, who grew up in Nottinghamshire feeling ""unloved"" by her family, vividly remembers arriving at Beechwood shortly before her 15th birthday. ""I was taken by a social worker, and from the outside I thought it looked like a lovely house,"" she said. ""It was a big place, it had like a balustrade balcony that ran around the upstairs - it looked so pretty, almost a little colonial, with trees and flowers outside. ""As soon as you went in, the atmosphere changed. It was a horrible place. The doors that would have opened to the balustrade were all boarded, the beds were just metal and horrible, there was nothing in there that was soft or homely. ""It was almost like an army barracks - just bare walls."" Laura said she initially thought Beechwood's Enderleigh block ""looked like a lovely house"" Beechwood first opened in November 1967, and by 1976 it incorporated four units, with an administration building augmented by the Enderleigh, Lindens and Redcot sections. Its original reputation as a home for criminal children endured - as did Enderleigh's notorious padded cell - and reports from staff repeatedly referred to the ""appalling and squalid"" state of the buildings. The state of them was so bad, it led to one visiting psychologist asking: ""How is it we can place young people in such atrocious conditions?"" How the child sexual abuse inquiry works If you are affected by any of the issues in this article,click here for advice. The standard of ""care"" on offer at Beechwood was similarly appalling: children were dragged by their hair across rooms, stripped naked to stop them leaving and made to fight each other. One resident said he was forced into masturbation competitions by staff, while another said she was visited and raped at the home by the same man who had abused her before she was taken into care. Some also described being raped by staff - and being punished for speaking out about the abuse. When Beechwood closed for good nearly 40 years later, hundreds of children had passed through its doors, with many left permanently damaged. Children at Beechwood - seen here in a 1981 BBC documentary - said violence was a regular part of life at the home The daily routine was dull, Laura said, with residents largely left to their own devices. ""Even though there was school, there was no education going on there,"" she said. ""After school you'd get frogmarched back down the road - you'd only do half a day, because you'd get back for lunch at 'home'. ""Lunch was in a big room; we'd just sit there and have whatever was put in front of us, which was never very appetising, just your usual stodgy, plain stuff. After lunch you then just found something to do. ""I tried to do a bit of calligraphy, just for something to do, because there was nothing in the activity room, there was nothing really there. A record player with about a dozen singles, a table tennis thing, but that was basically it in the whole place. Horrible. ""It was dead old-fashioned - we had those cast-iron baths which were either freezing or boiling, and there were no doors on the bathrooms, so anyone walking by could see whatever you were doing in there. ""It seems strange, but it even smelled old; just damp and fusty."" 'Hundreds sexually abused in care system' Abused children 'had nowhere to turn' Reports of child sex abuse 'not believed' Laura said her early encounters with John Dent, a resident social worker, were initially positive, which she now knows was part of the grooming process. The first time Dent sexually assaulted her was the day of the FA Cup final. ""He told me if I wanted to ring my boyfriend, I could use the phone in the office, and he went and he bought some stout and cigarettes and, you know, I was allowed to have a drink, and he was being very friendly,"" she said. John Dent was convicted in 2001 of sex offences involving several children ""That same evening he came up to the dormitory in the middle of the night, and this was the first occasion that I woke up with him on top of me. He got his mouth over my mouth, and he says, 'I'm not going to hurt you. Please be quiet, I'm not going to hurt you.' ""I was just rigidâ¦ I said 'no', and when I realised I could feel his erect penis rubbing against me, I was really, really scared."" Laura said she ""couldn't believe what had happened"" with Dent, but did not know how to report it. ""I had nobody to tell, I had nobody to talk to. I just felt that people would just think I was a rebellious teenager and making excuses, that I was in a care home and I wanted to get out."" Away from her family, Laura was in a very vulnerable position - one that Dent readily exploited. After her roommate was moved, she was on her own every night. ""At every available opportunity he was coming again into the dormitory,"" Laura said during the inquiry. Despite fighting off Dent during the abuse, Laura feared challenging his authority and reporting what he was doing in case he kept her at Beechwood. ""He always used to say: 'It's my say-so whether you go home at the end of this term.' He made that really, really clear on lots of occasions."" The inquiry heard how Beechwood staff members targeted children in their care Laura left Beechwood weeks later, but the scars of her short stay have endured. She took an overdose soon after leaving the home, and felt ""awful"" for years after. After two decades of keeping the abuse secret, when her daughter reached the same age she had been when admitted to Beechwood, it became too much to bear. ""I had the chat with my daughter, and I tried to explain everything that happened in a balanced kind of way,"" Laura said. ""I thought I had done quite a good job with it, I thought I was so grown-up and could handle it, but when I explained to her that past, seeing her come down the stairs brought it all back - it made me feel like I had to do something about it. ""It had such an adverse effect on her - she felt that if she hadn't been born then she wouldn't have reminded me of that awful time."" Rapist 'visited victim at children's home' Abused child was jailed for sex with men Abuse home children dubbed promiscuous Years later, Laura learned how her daughter drew inspiration from how she handled her ordeal. ""I found out there was an essay thing she had to do in school,"" she said. ""People were writing about who they admired, so they talked about celebrities - Princess Diana, people like that - and she wrote about me. She wrote all about what I had been through, and she said she was really proud of me. ""She wanted to be there to support me every step of the way in court - to the point that Dent clocked her one time, and he looked quite taken aback because she looked quite like me when I was that age. ""It was only in the last five years or something like that [that I found out about the essay]. It made me cry."" Beechwood was eventually closed in 2006 Laura said she was treated sympathetically by the police when she came forward, and eventually an investigation was launched into Dent's activities. A trial followed, but in a case that was in essence Laura's word against Dent's, he was acquitted of the charges relating to her - a common experience for those alleging abuse against figures of authority. However, after she came forward to report his abuse - the first person to do so - others did too, and at a second trial he was convicted of child sex crimes, including those committed at Beechwood. Dent received a prison sentence of seven years, although for Laura he ""got away very lightly"". Nearly two decades after he was jailed, she said she still suffered from the ordeal of the court case. ""I'm still in fear. It's a real fear to me that he will one day blow up at me, because if it wasn't for me he wouldn't have been in prison, and now it's all kicked off again [with the inquiry]."" Announced in 2014 by then Home Secretary Theresa May, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse followed years of abuse cases coming to light. The care system in Nottingham and Nottinghamshire is one of 14 investigations to be conducted by the panel, with 343 people getting in touch to describe abuse in the care system there dating back to the 1960s. Over 15 days of hearings in Nottingham and London, evidence from 115 witnesses was heard, with 2,299 documents totalling 39,464 pages disclosed to the inquiry's core participants. Of those 343 people - a number that Nottinghamshire Police admits represents ""the small tip of a very large iceberg"" - 136 allege abuse at Beechwood, and the home is a central part of one of three strands of the IICSA's investigations into the care system in the county, the others focusing on abuse in foster care and child-on-child sexual abuse. The inquiry has been looking at children's homes and foster care in Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Former foster care and children's home residents who submitted statements and gave verbal evidence related a string of harrowing experiences to the inquiry. Many also spoke about the lasting effects of the abuse - of addiction problems, mental trauma and a lack of trust in the authorities. As well as Beechwood, children's homes across Nottingham and Nottinghamshire's care system were also mentioned, with the likes of Amberdale, Bracken House, Greencroft, Skegby Hall and Wollaton House all listed as locations where abuse took place. Myriam Bamkin,Dean GathercoleandBarrie Pickare among those to have been sentenced for crimes committed at Beechwood and other Nottinghamshire institutions. In 2016, when Andris Logins was jailed for 20 years for offences stemming from his time working at Beechwood, the judge was damning,describing it as ""a home from hell"". A crucial support system for Laura has been the Nottingham Child Sexual Abuse Survivors Group. With its help she found the strength to talk to other victims, and she was the first person to give oral evidence to the IICSA's Nottinghamshire investigation. ""It's been an absolute lifeline for me,"" she said. ""To be with people that have been in and around the same group of homes in Nottinghamshire - you can learn from each other. People talk candidly about what's happened to them, how they cope or how it affected their families. ""The fact that there's so many of us makes you feel like you're not going round the twist, and when I hear about what happened to some of the other ones I feel I got away very, very luckily."" Prof Alexis Jay was named chair of the inquiry panel in 2016 - the fourth person to hold the post The evidence sessions for the Nottinghamshire element of the inquiry have ended, and the IICSA panel will now write a report on the care system's failings. With tens of thousands of pages documenting decades of abuse at Beechwood, the report is not expected until later in the summer. The wider inquiry is set to run until at least 2020. Despite this, before the inquiry had heard any evidence, the flood of apologies had begun. Nottinghamshire County Council made its mea culpain January 2018, with Colin Pettigrew, its director of children's services, later telling the inquiry he had ""sobbed in the aisles of Asda"" when talking to his wife about one of the abuse survivors. Nottingham City Council, which the inquiry heard had discussed apologising ""when there is something to apologise for"" at a meeting last year, offered some words of contritiontwo weeks before the hearings opened.,externalDuring the inquiry, its then portfolio holder for children's services David Mellen - now city council leader - repeatedthe council's words of regret, adding: ""We should have apologised earlier."" For many, though, these apologies were not enough. Victim criticises Nottingham City Council in inquiry Council 'failed to spot abuse patterns' Abuse home worker 'could have lost job' for reporting incidents Laura, who was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 2004, said: ""My education was ruined, and I've spent the whole of my life suffering with depression. ""I see myself back in the room. I can just see it so clearly, the room with the metal bed frames and the bars on the windows. And it happens when I have had a reminder - a song on the radio, or a film that was popular at the time. The FA Cup final every year does for me."" Feeling angry that the abuse she and so many others were subjected to could have been stopped earlier had children been listened to, Laura - like other survivors - has called for mandatory training for police in dealing with abuse victims, and for an independent body to deal with social services records to ensure they are not destroyed. She has also called for accountability at the councils responsible for Beechwood and all the other children's homes and foster families where abuse took place. ""It's such an enormous scale of abuse,"" Laura said. ""I can't believe the evil that happened in those places. I really can't.""

""Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low,"" it added. ""Although growth of household spending has picked up from earlier in the year, growth of business fixed investment has been soft. ""On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2%."" Inflation is lower than US policymakers would like, which was one of the reasons for the rate cut. At present, the US economy is creating plenty of jobs. Unemployment hit a 49-year low in May and was at 3.7% last month. But many of those jobs are in the service sector and are low-paying with low hours, economists say.

"Khadijah Mellah has been training since April Peckham teenager Khadijah Mellah will ride out at Glorious Goodwood on Thursday and make a little bit of history in front of 25,000 people. The 18-year-old student is believed to be the first person in the UK to appear in a competitive horse race while wearing a hijab. She will ride in the all-female Magnolia Cup - an amateur jockey's charity race - alongside former Olympian turned jockey Victoria Pendleton, BBC presenter Alexis Green and TV personality Vogue Williams. ""From a young age, I have wanted to be the person that people look up to,"" Khadijah told BBC Sport. ""I have already started receiving other messages from Muslim girls and it makes me really happy to hear from all these people that I'm affecting positively."" Khadijah got into horse riding seven years go, but had not sat on a racehorse before April this year. She has been training at Newmarket in the build-up to the Goodwood Festival. ""People have been very welcoming to the prospect of having a new face in the jockey industry,"" she said. ""I enjoy having conversations about people who are genuinely curious. ""Sometimes it's hard explaining my background over and over again to lots of different people, but generally I like explaining where I've come from and how I've got to where I have."" According to the Muslim Women's Sport Foundation, the number of female British Muslim Jockeys - past and present - is in ""single digits"". But in the horse racing world, Khadijah views her identity as a conversation starter. ""When I ride out in Newmarket I do try to spot any other women of colour and there was only one in over 200 riders,"" she said. ""But it doesn't faze me; it means that I end up talking to loads of people and making great connections, so I'm happy. ""It makes me feel sort of blessed because not many people get the opportunity to represent. It adds a little meaning to life."" A documentary called Riding A Dream is being made about Khadijah, in which she says: ""There's quite a stereotype around Muslim girls and them not being able to follow their sporting passions and dreams."" Khadijah first joined Brixton's Ebony Horse Club, when her mum came across a leaflet in a local mosque. While training to be a jockey, Khadijah has balanced studying for her A-levels and a part-time job, as well as continuing to volunteer and mentor younger riders at Ebony Horse Club every week. She has been training extensively for the five-furlong and 110 yards (1,110m) flat race being staged on the third day of the fixture to raise funds for the Wellbeing of Women healthcare charity. ""My introduction to race horses started off a bit rocky,"" she said. ""They were quite scary at first. I was a nervous wreck before my first gallop. It was quite a shock how fast you go. When you're on a racehorse you feel absolutely everything."" Khadijah says she is feeling ""confident"" about the race, mixed with ""nervousness"" about the scale of the event. ""I'm very competitive so it would mean the world if I did come first, and I feel like a lot of people would be celebrating if I did - the support behind me would be great,"" she said. ""I never thought I'd have a future in racing at all. But now that I've been introduced to it and I've been riding racehorses for the past couple of weeks, I've fallen in love with it and I'm definitely going to keep at it. ""And maybe one day get into big races and become an amateur or an apprentice.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I am committed to Good Friday Agreement"" Boris Johnson has urged political parties in Northern Ireland to step up their efforts to restore devolved government, during talks in Belfast. The PM held a series of meetings with the five main Stormont parties, in which Brexit was also discussed. NI has been without a government since January 2017, when the power-sharing DUP/Sinn FÃ©in coalition collapsed. On Tuesday,Mr Johnson held a private meetingwith senior DUP figures, whose support he relies on in Parliament. What is direct rule? Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Q&A: What is happening at Stormont? Who's calling the shots on NI policy? The prime minister left Northern Ireland on Wednesday afternoon and a Downing Street spokesperson said Mr Johnson told the parties while there had been constructive progress in the talks at Stormont, ""there now needed to be serious and intense engagement to get this done"". The spokesperson added that Mr Johnson had told the parties the UK would be leaving the EU on 31 October ""come what may"" and his intention was to do so with a deal. In all scenarios, the government was committed to the Good Friday Agreement and in no circumstances would there be physical checks or infrastructure on the border, they said. Following her meetings with Mr Johnson, DUP leader Arlene Foster said ""talk of a border poll"" was not something Boris Johnson was ""entertaining"". She met the prime minister along with DUP MPs Nigel Dodds, Emma Little-Pengelly and Gavin Robinson. Sinn FÃ©in said if a no-deal Brexit happens, the government must call a referendum on Irish unity ""immediately"". But Mrs Foster said the Conservative government would ""never be neutral on the union"". She said discussions regarding the confidence and supply pact the two parties share was for ""another day"" but defended the Â£1bn in spending for NI the DUP had secured in the past. NI Secretary Julian Smith with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he arrived at Stormont The issue over what will happen at the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit - and the proposed Irish backstop - has caused deep divisions between the parties at Stormont. The backstop is the insurance policy negotiated as part of the UK-EU withdrawal agreement, which aims to keep the border as seamless as it is now and avoid land border checks. But Mr Johnson has referred to it as a ""monstrosity"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Mr Johnson met Sinn FÃ©in first on Wednesday before talks with the smaller parties and further discussions with the DUP. After the meeting, Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald said she told the prime minister he must not be ""the DUP's gopher"". Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald gave a press conference after her meeting with the prime minister Ms McDonald said she did not believe the PM's claim he would act with ""total impartiality"" towards all parties in NI. ""It's not our business who dines with whom, but the politics of this is the DUP have used this to ensure... the continuing denial of rights and trample on the views of the majority of people who live here,"" added Mrs McDonald. As the talks were taking place, a number of protestors gathered outside, including a group of Harland and Wolff shipyard workers who are lobbying the government to renationalise their workplace. The Belfast firm's Norwegian parent company Dolphin Drilling is havingserious financial problems and put Harland and Wolff up for sale late last year. This video can not be played Harland and Wolff workers in bi-lingual Stormont protest They were joined at Stormont by Irish language campaigners, anti-Brexit protestors andthe families of those killed in Ballymurphy in 1971with others calling for government action on legacy issues. Northern Ireland has not been ruled directly from Westminster for more than a decade, but it has been without a government since 2017. Several attempts tokick-start devolution have already failed. The DUP is due to renew the confidence-and-supply agreement on which Mr Johnson's Conservative Party depends for a working majority in the House of Commons. Boris Johnson attended the DUP party conference in Belfast in 2018 The NI secretary met with the leaders of the five main parties on Wednesday afternoon and has asked the five independent working groups to hold further meetings and report back to him in the coming days. He said he would then discuss further steps with the Irish government.

"Only six of this year's 36 Love Island contestants applied to be on the show. A parliamentary inquiry found that 24 were head-hunted by ITV's casting team, and another six were put forward by professional talent agents. ITV told Radio 1 Newsbeat: ""Everyone who is seen for the show goes through exactly the same process."" MPs on the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee have been looking into reality shows, also including The Jeremy Kyle Show and The Undateables. The programme will return next year with two series ITV chief executive Dame Carolyn McCall said: ""The production team continuously looks for people who would be right for Love Island in terms of being able to be in the villa and the personality that they are required to have."" She says they receive around 98,000 applications each year and there is a ""very, very rigorous"" casting process. Tommy Fury and Molly Mae came second in this year's final When asked if contestants are often selected from a small pool of people who know each other, Dame Carolyn said: ""I do not think they just look in that pond. I think they keep it quite open. ""There are some people who go on Love Island who have never achieved any type of contract or agent or anything like that."" The committee decided to investigate Love Island after the deaths of former contestants Sophie Gradon and Mike Thalassitis. The show has faced scrutiny over its aftercare. ITV assured viewers it had improved care for contestants, including better psychological support and bespoke training on social media and financial management. The Jeremy Kyle Show was axedearlier this year after the death of a participant who had failed a lie detector test on the show.

"James McArdle (left) and James McAvoy have been less than impressed by Quentin Letts' review of Peter Gynt Actor James McArdle has called theatre reviewer Quentin Letts ""pathetic"" after he made remarks about the ""whining"" accents of Scottish actors. The critic was writing about the play Peter Gynt at London's National Theatre, in which Glasgow-born McArdle stars, when he made the comment. He said ""the fruity purr"" of Oliver Ford Davies was "" a welcome calm... from the whining Scottish accents"". ""To go for our accents is something else,"" said McArdle. The play is a modernised version of the Ibsen classic Peer Gynt. Ibsen's original 19th Century work is set in Norway and tells the story of the adventures of the titular character from the Norwegian mountains to the North African desert. David Hare's updated version sees McArdle's hero as a 21st Century Scottish soldier, in a work with singing and milkmaids described by Letts as ""dancing Dolly Partons"". Letts saidin the Sunday Times,externalCulture column: ""After so much frenzied movement and whizz-bang theatrics, the fruity purr of veteran thesp Oliver Ford Davies as the button moulder brings a welcome calm to proceedings, and relief at last from the whining Scottish accents."" Speaking to Scottish broadcaster STV, McArdle (who appeared in the TV series Love & Marriage) said he didn't want to give Letts credit as a ""real reviewer"", following the write-up.

That critic is infamous for saying things like that and I think it's a bit pathetic and I don't want to give him credit as a real reviewer to be honest."" He added: ""This whining Scottish accent is currently playing one of the biggest parts ever written in one of the most famous theatres in the world. I don't really have time for Quentin Letts to be perfectly honest with you."" McArdle's criticism of Letts follows comments made by fellow Scottish actor James McAvoy, who hit out at Letts over his ""derogatory"" comments when the review was first published on 14 July. McArdle (pictured) recently starred in Mary Queen of Scots McAvoy - soon to be seen in the BBC's adaptation of His Dark Materials - filmed a reply to Letts, which he shared on social media. ""Quentin, I would love to have a conversation with you. I'll be doing a play soon in the West End, at the end of the year,"" said McAvoy. ""Maybe we could have a post-show discussion about why you think it's okay to label the sound of an entire nation in such a derogatory fashion? ""Where the person with an English accent gets referred to by his name as an individual with fruity superlatives, whereas the people who are whining just get referred to as Scottish. Not as individuals, not as actors, just an entire nation."" Letts is known for being controversial in his reviews and last year incited a backlash after he asked inhis Daily Mail review,externalwhether actor Leo Wringer was cast in a Royal Shakespeare Company production ""because he is black"", leading the RSC to accuse him of having a ""blatantly racist attitude"".

"Police remain at a block of flats on Canvey Island, Essex A sixth suspected drug-related death since the weekend has been identified by police investigating the sale of Class A drugs in Essex. A woman in her 30s found dead in Southend on Sunday is now part of the investigation, Essex Police said. It follows the deaths on Monday and Tuesday of two other women and three men, all within a six-mile (10km) radius. One has been named as Cian Daly, 20, from Leigh-on-Sea. Cian Daly, 20, from Leigh-on-Sea, ran a marketing company Mr Daly's relatives said they did not want to comment until they had more information about the police investigation. A friend, who did not want to be named, described Mr Daly, who was found dead on Monday, as a ""great friend who didn't have a bad bone in his body"". More than Â£2,000 has been raised by friends towards a memorial bench in a local nature reserve, and to support the family. MP Rebecca Harris said she was impressed at the police's response so far On Tuesday, a man and woman in their 40s on Canvey Island, and a man in his 20s in Benfleet, were found dead. A woman in her 30s was found on Monday in Westcliff-on-Sea. Tests are being carried out to identify the substance or substances involved in the deaths. Ch Supt Kevin Baldwin said it was too soon to say if drugs were smoked, injected or taken as pills. ""All of the deaths occurred in their own homes, which is an unusual element because your own home is normally a safe environment and the circumstances suggest that they weren't able to call for assistance,"" he said. Two of the deaths happened on Canvey Island Rebecca Harris, MP for Castle Point, which covers Benfleet and Canvey Island, said police were taking the deaths ""incredibly seriously"". ""We hope this is an isolated incident and it's not a wider problem,"" she said. ""We don't want any more families to lose loved ones, because this must be devastating for [those] families in south Essex.""

"Schools in areas with a higher risk of youth violence should be given dedicated police officers, say MPs. The Home Affairs Committee criticised the government's current violence reduction strategy as ""completely inadequate"". It called on the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, to take ""personal responsibility"" for tackling knife and gun crime among young people. But the Home Office said the MPs failed to fully recognise its action on crime. Ten charts on the rise of knife crime Police in schools increase after knife crime NHS to have legal duty to prevent knife crime In its report,external, the committee called for more investment into neighbourhood policing - including a commitment to get a dedicated police officer into ""all schools in areas with an above-average risk of serious youth violence"" by April 2020. It said by committing the money for the officers in the government's autumn spending review, it would become part of a drive to ""rebuild vital links"" with the communities affected. The report has been published as part of the committee's inquiry into youth violence for which MPs have heard evidence from campaigners, victims' families, doctors, senior police officers, children's charities and criminologists. It also recommended that: Named individuals in English and Welsh regions report directly to Downing Street on action to bring down violence The government increases funding for youth outreach workers and community youth projects Action is taken to reduce the number of pupils excluded from school, and to offer more support to those in alternative schools The report criticised the government'sstrategy to cut violent crimein England and Wales for containing ""no targets or milestones"" and ""few new actions"". Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the committee, said the Home Office had ""taken a hands-off approach"" to the ""national emergency"" of youth violence. ""To publish a weak strategy and convene a few roundtable discussions just isn't enough when faced with youth violence on this scale,"" she said. ""Serious violence has got worse after a perfect storm of youth service cuts, police cuts, more children being excluded from school and a failure of statutory agencies to keep them safe."" This video can not be played School exclusions and knife crime are both on the rise in England, but are the two actually linked? New policing minister Kit Malthouse said greater interaction between police and schools could help build ""very helpful"" relationships as pupils enter their teenage years. He said increased police powers could have a short-term impact, but the solutions to knife crime in particular were ""complex and wide-ranging"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""This will take many years to do - and it's something we've been investing in, and need to invest more. ""It's definitely the case we need to turbo-charge what we're doing."" The government's Serious Violence Strategy, launched last April, committed Â£11m for an ""early intervention youth fund"" to help young people at risk of getting involved in violence. The plan also committed funds for a national coordination centre to tackle ""county-lines"" drug routes to target links between the illegal drugs market and violent crime. The Home Affairs Committee has compiled arguably the most comprehensive study into the causes of and possible solutions to youth violence since the problems began to escalate in 2015. Unlike the Home Office Serious Violence Strategy - which barely mentioned public sector budget cuts when it was published in 2018 - the committee identifies resources as a key factor, while emphasising that other issues, such as county lines drug gangs, have also played a part. But there is no silver bullet, no one easy answer. Indeed, the MPs caution against slogans that sound good, but which may lack substance, such as ""public health approach"". Instead, the tenor of the report suggests violence will only come down through sustained hard work over many years by government, agencies and communities together. Every school and further education college in London has been offered a ""named officer"", said Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick, in herevidence to the committee,external. The officers carried out ""high visibility patrols"" and delivered sessions and bespoke workshops to pupils, she said. She told the committee there were currentlyabout 280 ""safer schools"" officers in the capital,external- including 40 in the Police Cadets - and that she hoped there would be more than 500 based in the capital by the autumn. Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick told the committee she wanted more ""safer schools"" officers in London But the committee said the picture was quite different in other parts of the country. Ten of 33 forces in England told MPs they did not currently have one, including West Midlands Police - the largest force outside of London. Children's services 'at breaking point' Under-fire council 'failing to keep children safe' 'Poverty link' to youth violence - London mayor The Home Office said the committee's assessment had failed to recognise the full range of urgent action the government was taking to keep our communities safe, and pointed to the new prime minister's pledge to recruitan extra 20,000 police officers, and the new national policing board. ""We have made it simpler for officers to use stop and search, and our Offensive Weapons Act will stop knives making their way onto our streets in the first place,"" a Home Office spokesman said. The Children's Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, said the government must treat youth violence as a ""top priority"" with a ""large-scale and long-term plan"" to help protect vulnerable children. The Children's Society charity called for extra funding for ""professional training, prevention, early intervention and youth services"". More people have been admitted to hospital with knife wounds in the four years since 2014, with a sharper increase in admissions involving people under-18 than adults,NHS data,externalshows. For under-18s, admissions increased from 303 to 566 - an 87% rise Admissions of adults increased from 3,273 to 4,354 - a 33% rise Thelatest figures,externalfrom the Home Office - published in July - showed violent crime recorded by police in England and Wales had risen by 20% in the 12 months to March compared with the previous year. In the year to March 2018, there were 693 homicides in England and Wales - including murder and manslaughter. Of these, 152 of them were aged between 16 and 24 years old,Home Office figures show.,external Police in schools increase after knife crime Los Angeles mayor to give update on wildfires as more residents told to evacuate What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Jason Lawrance was accused of nine charges A serial rapist who met his victims through a dating website has been found guilty of attacking five more women. Jason Lawrance, 54, met the women on Match.com and Dating Direct between 2009 and 2014, raping them at their home, in his car or back of his van. It can now be revealed he isalready serving a life sentence for attacking seven other womenduring the same period. A jury at Nottingham Crown Court found him guilty of seven charges. During the trial, one victim described how she had only agreed to have sex with him because he told her he had had a vasectomy. He texted her the next day to say ""I'm still fertile. Sorry."" She became pregnant and had to have an abortion. The jury decided this counted as rape - the first time, the prosecution believe, a person has been prosecuted for the offence because of lying over a vasectomy. This video can not be played Convicted rapist Lawrance was a keen amateur boxer The jury unanimously found him guilty on five charges of rape, one charge of sexual assault and a further charge of assault by penetration. His middle-aged victims, from Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, and Suffolk, came forward after nationwide coverage of his previous trial. One woman told the court how while having sex in his car he had tied a belt around her neck and started tightening it because it would 'help him finish', and did not stop when she asked until she was in tears. In another, he came to a woman's house saying he needed to use the toilet - but then forced himself on her in her own front room, telling her to ""shut up... it's going to happen anyway"". Clive Stockwell, prosecuting, finished his case by saying either all the women who had come forward were ""wicked liars"" willing to deceive the court, police and in some cases their partners with no clear motive, or Lawrance - already a convicted rapist - was guilty. He also suggested Lawrance, who had offered no defence, refused to give evidence because he wanted to stay ""in control"". Lawrance used Match.com with profile names such as KeepItStraightToday and StraightManâLooking Lawrance's lawyer David Emanuel had argued that perhaps the women had ""reinterpreted"" what happened to them after seeing he was a rapist because they had regretted what might have been ""awful"" sex with a ""large sweaty man"". He pointed to inconsistencies in their accounts and asked the jury if they could be sure of what happened, given pieces of evidence, such as text messages, had gone missing over the years. ""He might, just might, be not guilty,"" Mr Emanuel had said. In the end the jury found him not guilty of two charges of rape. The father-of-three, previously of Hinckley, Leicestershire and Hampshire, is due to be sentenced on 3 October. Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

"Police remain at a block of flats on Canvey Island, Essex A sixth suspected drug-related death since the weekend has been identified by police investigating the sale of Class A drugs in Essex. A woman in her 30s found dead in Southend on Sunday is now part of the investigation, Essex Police said. It follows the deaths on Monday and Tuesday of two other women and three men, all within a six-mile (10km) radius. One has been named as Cian Daly, 20, from Leigh-on-Sea. Cian Daly, 20, from Leigh-on-Sea, ran a marketing company Mr Daly's relatives said they did not want to comment until they had more information about the police investigation. A friend, who did not want to be named, described Mr Daly, who was found dead on Monday, as a ""great friend who didn't have a bad bone in his body"". More than Â£2,000 has been raised by friends towards a memorial bench in a local nature reserve, and to support the family. MP Rebecca Harris said she was impressed at the police's response so far On Tuesday, a man and woman in their 40s on Canvey Island, and a man in his 20s in Benfleet, were found dead. A woman in her 30s was found on Monday in Westcliff-on-Sea. Tests are being carried out to identify the substance or substances involved in the deaths. Ch Supt Kevin Baldwin said it was too soon to say if drugs were smoked, injected or taken as pills. ""All of the deaths occurred in their own homes, which is an unusual element because your own home is normally a safe environment and the circumstances suggest that they weren't able to call for assistance,"" he said. Two of the deaths happened on Canvey Island Rebecca Harris, MP for Castle Point, which covers Benfleet and Canvey Island, said police were taking the deaths ""incredibly seriously"". ""We hope this is an isolated incident and it's not a wider problem,"" she said. ""We don't want any more families to lose loved ones, because this must be devastating for [those] families in south Essex.""

"This video can not be played Harland and Wolff: 'The shipyard is my life' The UK government has said that the crisis at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast is ""ultimately a commercial issue"". Unions say the yard is at imminent risk of closure and have called for it to be nationalised. A government spokesperson said there was ""every sympathy for the workers"". They added that the government will ""do all it can"" to offer support. It is understood administrators are now expected to arrive on Monday. 'Unacceptable' losses at Harland and Wolff Concern over Belfast shipyard future The firm's Norwegian parent company Dolphin Drilling is having serious financial problems and put Harland and Wolff up for sale late last year. There were exclusive negotiations with a potential buyer but they cooled in the last two weeks. A rally in support of the shipyard workers took place in east Belfast on Tuesday On Monday, workers said they had taken control of the site and established a rota to ensure their protest continues around the clock. The yard employs about 130 people, specialising in energy and marine engineering projects. They said they would continue the protest until a solution is found. More than 100 workers attended a rally in east Belfast on Tuesday in support of the shipyard workers. On Tuesday, a UK government spokesperson said that the government has ""every sympathy for the Harland and Wolff workers at a time of great personal uncertainty"". They added: ""We will work with partners in Northern Ireland and in Westminster to understand the situation and do all we can to support, but it is ultimately a commercial issue. ""The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith, has had conversations with Invest NI and ministers across government as a matter of urgency."" Trade unions have called on the government to renationalise the shipyard The Unite union said workers decided to take the action ahead of the expected arrival of administrators. Trade unions have been hoping that the yard could benefit from plans to build moreRoyal Navy ships in the UK. But now there is a risk it will not survive for long enough to benefit. They have demanded Boris Johnson's government renationalise the yard and save their jobs. BBC News NI Business Reporter Richard Morgan Staff have been here since Monday afternoon, they took control of the shipyard in protest at its imminent collapse. They remain here on Tuesday, they stayed throughout the night and they plan to do the same again tonight. They want the government to intervene to renationalise the shipyard to prevent it from collapse. More than 100 people attended a rally in support of the shipyard workers on Tuesday. Bombardier staff also attended. Dr Esmond Birnie, senior economist at Ulster University, believes the government will be reluctant to renationalise the yard. ""The shipyard was nationalised in the 1970s, and remained in public ownership until 1989 when the Norwegian firm purchased it,"" he said. ""That was a period when a very substantial amount of public subsidy was put into it, so I think they will be reluctant, they will be cautious about going back down that route."" Workers closed the shipyard's gates on Monday Harland and Wolff is one of Northern Ireland's best known businesses and its two huge cranes dominate the east Belfast skyline. It was founded in 1861 and at the height of production during World War Two employed around 35,000 people. Its best known vessel is the Titanic, which was built at the yard between 1909 and 1911. Paul Beattie, who has worked for Harland and Wolff for more than 30 years, was on the picket line on Tuesday morning. He told BBC Radio Ulster that workers ""are here for the long haul"". He added: ""We sat back for too long and left it in the hands of the politicians and management within the company and now we are two days from closure. ""So we have decided to take action and try to force our politicians into a position where they are no longer hiding behind the fact that Stormont is not running."" Gavin Robinson was at the shipyard on Tuesday morning DUP MP Gavin Robinson told BBC News NI that he ""understands and shares the concerns"" and he is trying to work towards a solution. He said: ""The next number of days are critical for the shipyard and we are working towards a solution so I understand entirely their frustrations."" Mr Robinson added: ""There have been talks with intended bidders- the people have a vision for this shipyard, the people want to see a renaissance in shipbuilding in Belfast.""

"An initial design for the new bridge over the Clyde Three international engineering teams are competing to build the first opening road bridge over the River Clyde. The crossing, connecting Renfrew to Clydebank and Yoker, is the centrepiece of a major infrastructure project to transform the Clyde waterfront. Renfrewshire Council has invited three bidders to participate in the tendering stage of the procurement process. The 184m swing bridge will accommodate vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians. It will also open horizontally for passing ships. The contenders are: ARC, a joint venture of Roadbridge and American Bridge supported by COWI as design partner. Its previous projects include the the iconic Queensferry Crossing and the Tappan Zee Bridge over New York's Hudson River. A Balfour Beatty team, comprising Cleveland Bridge, Qualter Hall and consultants Atkins. They have delivered the Media City Swing Bridge in Salford and are currently replacing the Surf City Swing Bridge in North Carolina. Construction and civil engineering company GRAHAM, working with Hollandia and Ramboll. GRAHAM and Hollandia were both involved in the construction of the Samuel Beckett Bridge in Dublin while Ramboll led the design joint venture of the Queensferry Crossing. Renfrewshire Council leader Iain Nicolson said: ""This project will transform the Clyde waterfront and connect communities on both sides of the river, improving access to jobs, education, hospitals and leisure pursuits. ""I am very pleased to see this project progressing well and it is no surprise that it has attracted such high-calibre teams bidding to secure the design and construction contract."" An artists' impression of the 184m (604ft) bridge over the Clyde Mr Nicolson said more than 470 people would be involved in the initial construction. A further 2,300 jobs are expected to be created over the next decade through the development and the business growth it is expected to generate. The Â£90.7m Clyde Waterfront and Renfrew Riverside project is jointly funded by the UK and Scottish governments through the Glasgow City Region City Deal. Plans for the bridge wereinitially approvedin November. Scottish Infrastructure Secretary Michael Matheson said: ""It's particularly pleasing that this project will open up access to new opportunities around the River Clyde and help further spread the benefits of our investment made in other key infrastructure locally, such as the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and the upcoming National Manufacturing Institute Scotland."" Renfrewshire Council leader Iain Nicolson has hailed the significance of the project Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said: ""The funding is already delivering real benefits for people who live and work in the region and this particular crossing will make a huge difference to the Clyde waterfront."" Engineering firm Sweco worked with Kettle Collective - the architects behind the Falkirk Wheel - to draw up initial designs for the bridge which draws inspiration from the area's rich shipbuilding heritage. Also included in the project are more than 2km of new and improved roads and shared cycle and pedestrian routes, including connections into the Advanced Manufacturing Innovation District Scotland being developed next to Glasgow Airport. It is anticipated the successful team will be appointed in early 2020. Construction is scheduled to start next year and is expected to be completed in 2022.

"The owner of Ladbrokes Coral has been fined Â£5.9m for not protecting vulnerable customers and for failings in its anti-money laundering measures. The Gambling Commission says that over a three-year period, Ladbrokes and Coral failed to put effective safeguards in place to ""prevent consumers suffering gambling harm"". One customer lost Â£98,000 and had asked the company to stop sending promotions. But the firm failed to carry out ""social responsibility interactions"". The Gambling Commission said,externalthe problems occurred between November 2014 and October 2017, after which GVC Holdings bought Ladbrokes Coral in March 2018. GVC Holdings will pay Â£4.8m and divest Â£1.1m ""gained from customers as a result of its failings"". Gambling: Why is it so addictive? Our son took his own life after gambling addiction Gambling firms pledge Â£60m to help addicts after criticism In one instance, a Ladbrokes customer had 460 attempted deposits into their gambling account declined. However, they were still able to lose Â£98,000 over two and a half years. The commission also highlighted a Coral customer who spent Â£1.5m over nearly three years, during which time they logged onto their account an average 10 times a day for one month and lost Â£64,000 in one four week period. It said Coral ""did not ask the customer to evidence their source of funds and could not provide evidence of any social responsibility interactions being carried out"". Richard Watson, executive director of the Gambling Commission, said: ""These were systemic failings at a large operator which resulted in consumers being harmed and stolen money flowing though the business and this is unacceptable."" GVC  said it ""acknowledges and regrets"" that certain legacy systems and processes in place at Ladbrokes and Coral ""did not adequately meet the regulatory requirements"". ""These historical failings were unacceptable and since the acquisition, I have overseen a systematic review of the enlarged group's player protection procedures and the individuals responsible for these problems have exited the business,"" added GVC chief executive Kenneth Alexander. ""I am confident that we now have in place a robust and industry-leading approach to player protection."" Shares in GVC Holdings rose 0.59% to 611.37p. As well as the Ladbrokes and Coral brands GVC also owns gambling outlets bwin, Crystalbet, Eurobet, Neds and Sportingbet. Its games brands include CasinoClub, Foxy Bingo, Gala, Gioco Digitale, partypoker and PartyCasino. The penalty for Ladbrokes Coral Group is one of the biggest imposed by the gambling watchdog. UK gambling firm 888 had to pay a record Â£7.8m in August 2017 as a result of serious failings in its handling of vulnerable customers. Online gambling business Daub Alderney received a Â£7.1m penalty in November 2018 for failing to follow rules aimed at preventing money laundering and protecting vulnerable consumers.

"Jason Lawrance was accused of nine charges A serial rapist who met his victims through a dating website has been found guilty of attacking five more women. Jason Lawrance, 54, met the women on Match.com and Dating Direct between 2009 and 2014, raping them at their home, in his car or back of his van. It can now be revealed he isalready serving a life sentence for attacking seven other womenduring the same period. A jury at Nottingham Crown Court found him guilty of seven charges. During the trial, one victim described how she had only agreed to have sex with him because he told her he had had a vasectomy. He texted her the next day to say ""I'm still fertile. Sorry."" She became pregnant and had to have an abortion. The jury decided this counted as rape - the first time, the prosecution believe, a person has been prosecuted for the offence because of lying over a vasectomy. This video can not be played Convicted rapist Lawrance was a keen amateur boxer The jury unanimously found him guilty on five charges of rape, one charge of sexual assault and a further charge of assault by penetration. His middle-aged victims, from Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, and Suffolk, came forward after nationwide coverage of his previous trial. One woman told the court how while having sex in his car he had tied a belt around her neck and started tightening it because it would 'help him finish', and did not stop when she asked until she was in tears. In another, he came to a woman's house saying he needed to use the toilet - but then forced himself on her in her own front room, telling her to ""shut up... it's going to happen anyway"". Clive Stockwell, prosecuting, finished his case by saying either all the women who had come forward were ""wicked liars"" willing to deceive the court, police and in some cases their partners with no clear motive, or Lawrance - already a convicted rapist - was guilty. He also suggested Lawrance, who had offered no defence, refused to give evidence because he wanted to stay ""in control"". Lawrance used Match.com with profile names such as KeepItStraightToday and StraightManâLooking Lawrance's lawyer David Emanuel had argued that perhaps the women had ""reinterpreted"" what happened to them after seeing he was a rapist because they had regretted what might have been ""awful"" sex with a ""large sweaty man"". He pointed to inconsistencies in their accounts and asked the jury if they could be sure of what happened, given pieces of evidence, such as text messages, had gone missing over the years. ""He might, just might, be not guilty,"" Mr Emanuel had said. In the end the jury found him not guilty of two charges of rape. The father-of-three, previously of Hinckley, Leicestershire and Hampshire, is due to be sentenced on 3 October. Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

"Lewis Morrison, 29, had worked at Albion Academy, Salford for nearly four years A teacher got drunk at a school's end of year prom, told male pupils the girls were ""gagging for it"" and threatened to ""knock out"" the school principal, a panel heard. Music and drama teacher Lewis Morrison, 29, had earlier handed in his notice at Albion Academy, Salford. He had drunk ""six or seven pints"" and a video of him shouting and swearing was later shared on social media. The professional conduct panel ruled,externalit was a ""one-off"". Mr Morrison, who had worked at the school since 2014, was asked to leave the Year 11 prom, held at Hotel Football, Old Trafford on 29 June 2018. Witness A told the hearing Mr Morrison had been seen ""sloshing around his pint and swaggering"". Witness B said pupils had commented that Mr Morrison was drunk, to which he responded that he did not care as he was ""leaving in a couple of weeks"". He told the panel he heard him say: ""Lads, you need to go where this lot are for the after party, they are gagging for it"", referring to the female pupils. In a written statement, Mr Morrison said: ""I was not falling over, fighting or being sick... admittedly I had a few too many drinks."" He said this meant he had made ""some bad decisions"", however he denied encouraging sexual activity amongst students and claimed his comments had been ""twisted and taken out of context."" A video was shown to the panel showing Mr Morrison making a head-butt action and saying he would knock out the school principal, adding: ""Put that on Snapchat"". Mr Morrison responded to this: ""The violent content is an isolated incident amongst a range of silly jokes that I have taken too far."" The panel concluded that ""Mr Morrison's actions were those of crass stupidity, which represented a considerable misjudgement as to what was an appropriate amount to drink, and language to use, at an end of year prom."" However, it said it was ""a one-off incident"" and decided a prohibition order was ""not appropriate"".

"David Allan's medication wore off while at Heathrow Airport A man with Parkinson's says he was left ""totally fatigued"" when he ran out of medication because his flight was delayed. Parkinson's UK trustee David Allan was told his British Airways (BA) flight from Gatwick to Edinburgh on Friday would fly from Heathrow the next day. The change meant his requirement for assistance was not transferred and the 57-year-old, who takes 27 tablets a day, was left short on his medication. BA and the airports have apologised. Mr Allan, who is the Scotland trustee on the board of the charity, had been due to depart Gatwick at 21:25 BST but could not fly until 22:00 from Heathrow on Saturday. He contacted NHS 111, Crawley Hospital and a chemist but there were no supplies of his medication available. When he arrived at Heathrow, he was told the special assistance facility was fully booked and the airline had not transferred his requirements, so could not help him. Mr Allan said his medication starting to wear off and his mobility failed. ""I was struggling to put one foot in front of the other,"" he said. ""I wasn't quite on my hands and knees but I was very near it. ""It seems ridiculous that in this modern, connected world there was no way I could access medication and that the airline and airports were so ill-equipped to help. ""I'll be taking extra supplies with me every time I travel in future."" BA said transportation and accommodation were provided to Mr Allan during the disruption and he was rebooked on to the next flight. The airline also said assistance is provided by an airport-appointed third-party company and recommended customers carry enough medication to allow for any travel disruption. Parkinson's UK said the treatment of Mr Allan, of Alloa, Clackmannanshire, was ""shocking and unacceptable"". Update Wednesday 31 July 2019: An earlier version of this story stated Mr Allan was ""left to crawl"" through the airport. In a subsequent interview Mr Allan told the BBC: ""I wasn't quite on my hands and knees but I was very near it"". The story has been amended to reflect this.

"Schools in areas with a higher risk of youth violence should be given dedicated police officers, say MPs. The Home Affairs Committee criticised the government's current violence reduction strategy as ""completely inadequate"". It called on the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, to take ""personal responsibility"" for tackling knife and gun crime among young people. But the Home Office said the MPs failed to fully recognise its action on crime. Ten charts on the rise of knife crime Police in schools increase after knife crime NHS to have legal duty to prevent knife crime In its report,external, the committee called for more investment into neighbourhood policing - including a commitment to get a dedicated police officer into ""all schools in areas with an above-average risk of serious youth violence"" by April 2020. It said by committing the money for the officers in the government's autumn spending review, it would become part of a drive to ""rebuild vital links"" with the communities affected. The report has been published as part of the committee's inquiry into youth violence for which MPs have heard evidence from campaigners, victims' families, doctors, senior police officers, children's charities and criminologists. It also recommended that: Named individuals in English and Welsh regions report directly to Downing Street on action to bring down violence The government increases funding for youth outreach workers and community youth projects Action is taken to reduce the number of pupils excluded from school, and to offer more support to those in alternative schools The report criticised the government'sstrategy to cut violent crimein England and Wales for containing ""no targets or milestones"" and ""few new actions"". Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the committee, said the Home Office had ""taken a hands-off approach"" to the ""national emergency"" of youth violence. ""To publish a weak strategy and convene a few roundtable discussions just isn't enough when faced with youth violence on this scale,"" she said. ""Serious violence has got worse after a perfect storm of youth service cuts, police cuts, more children being excluded from school and a failure of statutory agencies to keep them safe."" This video can not be played School exclusions and knife crime are both on the rise in England, but are the two actually linked? New policing minister Kit Malthouse said greater interaction between police and schools could help build ""very helpful"" relationships as pupils enter their teenage years. He said increased police powers could have a short-term impact, but the solutions to knife crime in particular were ""complex and wide-ranging"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""This will take many years to do - and it's something we've been investing in, and need to invest more. ""It's definitely the case we need to turbo-charge what we're doing."" The government's Serious Violence Strategy, launched last April, committed Â£11m for an ""early intervention youth fund"" to help young people at risk of getting involved in violence. The plan also committed funds for a national coordination centre to tackle ""county-lines"" drug routes to target links between the illegal drugs market and violent crime. The Home Affairs Committee has compiled arguably the most comprehensive study into the causes of and possible solutions to youth violence since the problems began to escalate in 2015. Unlike the Home Office Serious Violence Strategy - which barely mentioned public sector budget cuts when it was published in 2018 - the committee identifies resources as a key factor, while emphasising that other issues, such as county lines drug gangs, have also played a part. But there is no silver bullet, no one easy answer. Indeed, the MPs caution against slogans that sound good, but which may lack substance, such as ""public health approach"". Instead, the tenor of the report suggests violence will only come down through sustained hard work over many years by government, agencies and communities together. Every school and further education college in London has been offered a ""named officer"", said Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick, in herevidence to the committee,external. The officers carried out ""high visibility patrols"" and delivered sessions and bespoke workshops to pupils, she said. She told the committee there were currentlyabout 280 ""safer schools"" officers in the capital,external- including 40 in the Police Cadets - and that she hoped there would be more than 500 based in the capital by the autumn. Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick told the committee she wanted more ""safer schools"" officers in London But the committee said the picture was quite different in other parts of the country. Ten of 33 forces in England told MPs they did not currently have one, including West Midlands Police - the largest force outside of London. Children's services 'at breaking point' Under-fire council 'failing to keep children safe' 'Poverty link' to youth violence - London mayor The Home Office said the committee's assessment had failed to recognise the full range of urgent action the government was taking to keep our communities safe, and pointed to the new prime minister's pledge to recruitan extra 20,000 police officers, and the new national policing board. ""We have made it simpler for officers to use stop and search, and our Offensive Weapons Act will stop knives making their way onto our streets in the first place,"" a Home Office spokesman said. The Children's Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, said the government must treat youth violence as a ""top priority"" with a ""large-scale and long-term plan"" to help protect vulnerable children. The Children's Society charity called for extra funding for ""professional training, prevention, early intervention and youth services"". More people have been admitted to hospital with knife wounds in the four years since 2014, with a sharper increase in admissions involving people under-18 than adults,NHS data,externalshows. For under-18s, admissions increased from 303 to 566 - an 87% rise Admissions of adults increased from 3,273 to 4,354 - a 33% rise Thelatest figures,externalfrom the Home Office - published in July - showed violent crime recorded by police in England and Wales had risen by 20% in the 12 months to March compared with the previous year.

"This video can not be played Watch Elizabeth Warren's big applause line from Tuesday night's debate The Democrats competing for the right to take on Donald Trump in 2020 are squaring off at two debates in Detroit. Who were the winners and losers from round one? During a two-hour event dominated by detailed policy discussions, there were sharp exchanges over immigration, healthcare and what makes a candidate electable. It felt a little bit like a gang fight, with the candidates breaking into two distinct groups - the moderates and the progressives. Given that the two that are farthest to the left, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, also happen to be two of the candidates near the top of the polls, this dynamic ended up helping elevate some of the moderate candidates. Up until now, they've effectively been crowded out by Joe Biden, the king of the moderates. He won't take the stage until Wednesday night, so it was up to candidates like Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan, Montana Governor Steve Bullock and former Maryland Congressman John Delaney to hold up their end of the fight. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg was among candidates in the background on Tuesday Candidates clash over immigration and healthcare The presidential hopeful winning Reddit's vote The key issues for 2020 Democrats That can only be good news for those candidates, who got plenty of airtime to defend and expound upon their views. Will it help any of them rise in the polls? Perhaps if Biden falters again on Wednesday. If not, then the former vice-president may be the ultimate beneficiary of Tuesday evening's proceedings. Sanders and Warren will also be pleased with their performance. Both held up under fire - and had a chance to demonstrate they could give as well as they get. Of the two, Warren probably will be happiest, because she's pulling ahead of Sanders in recent polls and nothing on Tuesday seemed to shake up that dynamic. Others, like Amy Klobuchar, Beto O'Rourke, John Hickenlooper, Marianne Williamson and even Pete Buttigieg, frequently disappeared into the background. As is frequently the case with debates like these, the quieter voices tend to get lost in the din. Those struggling in the polls knew they could very well be left out of the next debate when the field is cut to 10 in September. With that in mind, the moderates came out of the gate swinging. Governor Bullock said Americans ""can't wait for revolution"" - clearly a reference to Sanders's revolutionary rhetoric - saying that their problems are ""here and now"". Not to be outdone, Mr Delaney called out Sanders and Warren by name, accusing them of making ""impossible promises"" that will turn off voters. Even the mild-mannered former Colorado Governor Hickenlooper got in on the action, noting that the 40 Democrats who won seats in the House of Representatives didn't share the views of Warren and Sanders. While much has been made of possible friction between Sanders and Warren, who are both competing for progressive votes, on Tuesday night they face a common threat the centre of their party. Senator Warren delivered what will probably be remembered as the line of the night, about three-quarters of the way through the debate. During a segment on ""electability"" and how best to beat Donald Trump - something polls indicate Democratic voters care deeply about - the moderates once again began bedevilling the progressive senators. ""I don't think that is an agenda we can move forward on and win,"" Ryan said, referencing the plans to do away with private insurance and decriminalise undocumented immigration. Moments later, Warren had her response ready to fire. This video can not be played Bernie Sanders: 'I wrote the damn bill' ""I don't understand why anybody goes through all the trouble running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can't do and shouldn't fight for,"" she said. Sanders followed it up by saying the way to win elections was to give voters bold ideas that energise them to head to the polls. The audience erupted with cheers after both candidates spoke. Senator Klobuchar, who makes her ability to win elections in moderate mid-western Minnesota a key part of her campaign pitch, voiced the counterpoint to the ""big ideas"" strategy. Call it the big-tent strategy: ""The way we win an election is by bringing everyone with us"". Energising Democratic voters can definitely be a good way to win a Democratic presidential nomination. It's an open question whether it's also a good way to win the presidency. As it was during the debates held in Miami in June, healthcare took centre stage in Detroit. It's the issue Americans tell pollsters they care about the most, and it's one of the issues that most starkly divides the progressives and the moderates in the presidential field. Those divisions were on full display, as Warren and Sanders were pressed by others on the stage - particularly Delaney - about the details of their plans and the costs involved. Both Warren and Sanders highlighted the flaws in the current system, not just for those who don't have insurance but also those who do but whose coverage is insufficient. Sanders spoke of the Americans with insurance who can't afford to go to the doctor or, if they end up in the hospital, end up going bankrupt because of bills. ""Nobody can defend the dysfunctionality of the system,"" he said. Can Bernie Sanders overhaul US healthcare? The curse of being a Democratic front-runner Warren noted the $23bn in profits made by the private insurance industry and that healthcare paperwork is just a way for insurance companies to say ""no"". What the moderates and others who may not embrace such a label, such as Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke, counter is that replacing private insurance entirely is not only unrealistic, it's too expensive. Instead, they've been pushing some form of a public insurance option that would compete with private insurers. ""Medicare for all who want it,"" is the way Buttigieg describes it. It would be, they contend, an incremental change that could eventually end up with all Americans on publicly provided health insurance, but it would bring less disruption to the system. ""It used to be just Republicans wanted to do repeal and replace,"" Bullock quipped, ""now many Democrats do as well."" If healthcare was a big battle for between the two wings of the Democratic Party, the discussion of immigration reform was a skirmish - albeit a significant one. The debate centred around whether migrants should be prosecuted as criminals when they enter the US without proper documentation. That wasn't what the debate was really about, though. This video can not be played Five numbers that explain US border crisis Instead, the fundamental disagreement is over whether the the laws, as they are, need to be changed or if it's simply a matter of removing Donald Trump from the White House. After O'Rourke said he wanted to keep the current criminal statutes on the books, Warren countered that those statutes are what gives Trump the ability ""to take children away from their parents"". ""You don't have to decriminalise everything,"" Bullock said a few moments later, ""you have to have a president who does the right thing."" Read more from Anthony on Mueller, Boris Johnson and Trump Democrats tend to agree on the big things on immigration - ending efforts to build a border wall, giving undocumented migrants who entered the country as children normalised immigration status and ending the Trump administration's aggressive enforcement of immigration law in the interior of the US. The question for Democrats, then, is how much else has to be changed to stop someone like Donald Trump from using the existing laws in a way they don't like sometime in the future.

"Police remain at a block of flats on Canvey Island, Essex A sixth suspected drug-related death since the weekend has been identified by police investigating the sale of Class A drugs in Essex. A woman in her 30s found dead in Southend on Sunday is now part of the investigation, Essex Police said. It follows the deaths on Monday and Tuesday of two other women and three men, all within a six-mile (10km) radius. One has been named as Cian Daly, 20, from Leigh-on-Sea. Cian Daly, 20, from Leigh-on-Sea, ran a marketing company Mr Daly's relatives said they did not want to comment until they had more information about the police investigation. A friend, who did not want to be named, described Mr Daly, who was found dead on Monday, as a ""great friend who didn't have a bad bone in his body"". More than Â£2,000 has been raised by friends towards a memorial bench in a local nature reserve, and to support the family. MP Rebecca Harris said she was impressed at the police's response so far On Tuesday, a man and woman in their 40s on Canvey Island, and a man in his 20s in Benfleet, were found dead. A woman in her 30s was found on Monday in Westcliff-on-Sea. Tests are being carried out to identify the substance or substances involved in the deaths. Ch Supt Kevin Baldwin said it was too soon to say if drugs were smoked, injected or taken as pills. ""All of the deaths occurred in their own homes, which is an unusual element because your own home is normally a safe environment and the circumstances suggest that they weren't able to call for assistance,"" he said. Two of the deaths happened on Canvey Island Rebecca Harris, MP for Castle Point, which covers Benfleet and Canvey Island, said police were taking the deaths ""incredibly seriously"". ""We hope this is an isolated incident and it's not a wider problem,"" she said.

"Cafe Coffee Day is India's largest coffee shop franchise chain The body of the founder and owner of India's largest coffee chain, Cafe Coffee Day, has been found near a river on the outskirts of the southern city of Mangalore, police say. VG Siddhartha went missing on Mondayafter apparently walking away from his car and driver. On Tuesday, police said a body had been found by fishermen on the river. The identity was confirmed by members of Mr Siddhartha's family after the body was taken to hospital. Mr Siddhartha's company, Coffee Day Enterprises Limited, held an emergency board meeting on Monday to discuss his absence. In a statement, it appealed for ""the support and strength of all our stakeholders"". In a note to the stock exchange it said the company was ""professionally managed and led by a competent business team"" which would ensure the ""continuity"" of business. The 59-year-old coffee tycoon, who has been described in local media as ""soft spoken"" and ""self-effacing"", was not  fond of the limelight. He was born to a family of coffee plantation owners, but his first company was an investment firm.He used the profits from it to enter the coffee business,external, according to PTI news agency. His decision to open a chain of cafes was inspired by a chat with the owners of Tchibo, a German coffee chain. Cafe Coffee Day opened its first outlet in the southern city of Bangalore in 1996. It wooed customers by offering them free internet with a cappuccino. Mr Siddhartha saw the chain become one of the biggest brands in the country. It remained competitive even against global rivals such as Starbucks. ""He is singularly responsible for increasing domestic coffee consumption in India. There can be no doubt about it. In those days, we were completely dependent upon the export market and the heavy regulations on its sale,"" Dr SM Kaverappa, former vice chairman of the Indian Coffee Board, told BBC Hindi. Mr Siddhartha is the son-in-law of former Karnataka chief minister SM Krishna and his wife is on the board of Cafe Coffee Day. The couple have two children. Mr Siddhartha was travelling to Mangalore on Sunday evening when he asked his driver to stop the car on a bridge over the Netravati river on the outskirts of the city. His driver told police that Mr Siddhartha then got out of the car and told him he wanted to take a walk. He also instructed him to park the car further ahead. When Mr Siddhartha did not return after half an hour, the driver called his mobile phone - only to find the number switched off. Alarmed, he informed the police who assembled two teams and searched the river on Sunday and Monday. A fisherman found his body on Tuesday morning. In the letter, Mr Siddhartha says he was in debt and had ""failed to create the right profitable business model despite my best efforts"". It was signed by him and was also shared by his company with the stock exchange. It has since been widely circulated. Mr Siddhartha's family verified he wrote the letter, police told BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi. ""I am solely responsible for all mistakes. Every financial transaction is my responsibility,"" it said. ""My intention was never to cheat or mislead anybody. I have failed as an entrepreneur."" However, Mr Siddhartha also accuses a former director general of the income tax department of harassing him, which he says, led to a ""serious liquidity crunch"". This has caused a political outcry, with opposition MPs calling it targeted harassment. They are expected to raise the issue in parliament on Wednesday. The income tax department has denied the allegation and questioned the letter's authenticity, saying that the signature did not appear to match Mr Siddhartha's signature on his company's annual financial reports. The company board, too, has questioned the letter's authenticity in a statement, adding that it would ""thoroughly investigate the matter"". Cafe Coffee Day is India's largest coffee franchise chain. It has about 1,750 cafes across the country and some international outlets including in Malaysia, Nepal and Egypt. However, local media reports have said its rate of expansion had slowed significantly over the last two years in the face of increased competition. Mr Siddhartha owned a 33% stake in the company, but through his family and holding companies controlled closer to 50%. The local Economic Times newspaper reported that he had been in talks with Coca-Cola to sell the company for $1.45bn (Â£1.19bn) although this was not officially confirmed by either side. Mr Siddhartha's letter said the chain was struggling with financial problems due to debt, taxes and share buy backs. Shares of the company have fallen by around 20% since his disappearance was reported.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I am committed to Good Friday Agreement"" Boris Johnson has urged political parties in Northern Ireland to step up their efforts to restore devolved government, during talks in Belfast. The PM held a series of meetings with the five main Stormont parties, in which Brexit was also discussed. NI has been without a government since January 2017, when the power-sharing DUP/Sinn FÃ©in coalition collapsed. On Tuesday,Mr Johnson held a private meetingwith senior DUP figures, whose support he relies on in Parliament. What is direct rule? Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Q&A: What is happening at Stormont? Who's calling the shots on NI policy? The prime minister left Northern Ireland on Wednesday afternoon and a Downing Street spokesperson said Mr Johnson told the parties while there had been constructive progress in the talks at Stormont, ""there now needed to be serious and intense engagement to get this done"". The spokesperson added that Mr Johnson had told the parties the UK would be leaving the EU on 31 October ""come what may"" and his intention was to do so with a deal. In all scenarios, the government was committed to the Good Friday Agreement and in no circumstances would there be physical checks or infrastructure on the border, they said. Following her meetings with Mr Johnson, DUP leader Arlene Foster said ""talk of a border poll"" was not something Boris Johnson was ""entertaining"". She met the prime minister along with DUP MPs Nigel Dodds, Emma Little-Pengelly and Gavin Robinson. Sinn FÃ©in said if a no-deal Brexit happens, the government must call a referendum on Irish unity ""immediately"". But Mrs Foster said the Conservative government would ""never be neutral on the union"". She said discussions regarding the confidence and supply pact the two parties share was for ""another day"" but defended the Â£1bn in spending for NI the DUP had secured in the past. NI Secretary Julian Smith with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he arrived at Stormont The issue over what will happen at the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit - and the proposed Irish backstop - has caused deep divisions between the parties at Stormont. The backstop is the insurance policy negotiated as part of the UK-EU withdrawal agreement, which aims to keep the border as seamless as it is now and avoid land border checks. But Mr Johnson has referred to it as a ""monstrosity"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Mr Johnson met Sinn FÃ©in first on Wednesday before talks with the smaller parties and further discussions with the DUP. After the meeting, Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald said she told the prime minister he must not be ""the DUP's gopher"". Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald gave a press conference after her meeting with the prime minister Ms McDonald said she did not believe the PM's claim he would act with ""total impartiality"" towards all parties in NI. ""It's not our business who dines with whom, but the politics of this is the DUP have used this to ensure... the continuing denial of rights and trample on the views of the majority of people who live here,"" added Mrs McDonald. As the talks were taking place, a number of protestors gathered outside, including a group of Harland and Wolff shipyard workers who are lobbying the government to renationalise their workplace.

"An anti-Brexit protest in Belfast A no-deal Brexit could mean politicians in London taking charge of Northern Ireland, it has been suggested. Northern Ireland hasn't been ruled directly from Westminster for more than a decade, so how would it happen and why is it being considered? The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, says the UK must leave the EU by 31 October, with or without a deal in place about the ""divorce"" process. There've been warnings thata no-deal Brexitcould have major consequences for Northern Ireland, which has had no government in place since 2017. Earlier this year, former Prime Minister Theresa May saidit would not be able to prepare properly for no-dealas it doesn't have ministers to make decisions. This week, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab was asked whether that might mean direct rule was needed. He told the BBC that the government would make sure that all arrangements are in place ""so that we don't have a vacuum"" in Northern Ireland. It can only be implemented if the UK government passes a new law through Parliament. It would see all the powers that had been handed over to Northern Ireland's government taken back by ministers in London. DUP leader Arlene Foster They would make decisions on issues including health, justice and policing, education and transport. Any new laws relating to Northern Ireland would have to be approved by members of Boris Johnson's cabinet and pass through the UK Parliament as well. The last period of direct rule in Northern Ireland ended in 2007, and reinstating it would be a controversial move. Direct rule is not favoured by some because it takes power out of local hands. The unionist parties, which want Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK, have called for direct rule to happen. Sinn FÃ©in leaders Mary Lou McDonald (left) and Michelle O'Neill (right) But other parties on the nationalist side would prefer so-called ""joint authority"". They argue that the Republic of Ireland government should have greater input into any decision making. Northern Ireland has been able to exercise its own powers since 1998. It followed a peace deal ending decades of violence. Nationalists wanted more rights, and were against British rule, while unionists wanted to remain part of the United Kingdom. The 1998 peace deal involved the UK and Irish governments as well as local parties Under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, the two communities agreed to share power. When the government is up and running the main parties nominate ministers. Certain powers - including international relations and defence - remain reserved for the government in London. It collapsed in January 2017 when the two biggest parties - the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in - had a bitter row around the DUP's handling of a green energy scandal. Since then, the Northern Ireland Assembly and government have been suspended and attempts to restore these institutions have failed. The countries that get by without a government What would a no-deal Brexit mean for Ireland? What is no-deal Brexit? It's been left tocivil servants take the necessary stepsto keep public services running. But civil servants' powers are limited as they are only meant to advise politicians, not decide on policy or make important decisions. For example, Northern Ireland was unable to move in line with the rest of the UKto reduce the maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminalsto Â£2 last year. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK which has a land border with another EU country, the Republic of Ireland. If the UK leaves without a deal, it will be outside the EU's single market and customs union, making cross-border trade much more complicated. Under Boris Johnson, the UK government wants to get rid of theIrish border backstop- an insurance policy to maintain an open border unless and until another solution is found. Manybusiness and farming groups have warnedabout the economic impact of reintroducing border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic. And concern has been expressed by a former Northern Ireland police chiefthat additional law enforcement activity needed on the border might encourage some dissident groups which are still active to regroup. All of this would prove a huge task for civil servants to try to deal with. A lot depends on what happens in the months ahead, but a no-deal Brexit makes the return of direct rule for Northern Ireland more likely.

"Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness, before it all went wrong A guide to what is behind the current crisis in Northern Ireland's political institutions. Northern Ireland has a power-sharing government, in which Irish nationalists and unionists must work together. The system was set up to provide a political settlement after years of conflict. A first minister and a deputy first minister are appointed to lead an Executive Committee of Ministers. In the current Stormont Executive, the Democratic Unionist Party has six ministers and Sinn FÃ©in has five. An independent unionist holds the justice ministry. Westminster has delegated powers to Stormont which cover most areas of government. The executive has responsibility for healthcare, education, transport, policing, justice, agriculture, economic matters and many other issues. The first and deputy first ministers lead the executive. Although they have different titles, they basically have equal authority and cannot work in isolation from each other. Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister following a row between Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP over a green energy scheme. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, was the minister in charge of the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) when it was set up in 2012. The scheme was designed to encourage businesses to switch from fossil fuels to more environmentally friendly energy sources. But subsidies were overly generous and initially there was no cap on the payments. The scheme is projected to run Â£490m over budget, although the DUP say they have a plan to eliminate the overspend. Mr McGuinness quit after Mrs Foster rejected his calls for her to temporarily stand aside as first ministerwhile an investigation was carried out. The RHI scandal has caused the most public rift between the parties in recent weeks. But Martin McGuinness referred to other issues in his resignation letter. There are many disagreements between the parties. On Brexit, the DUP wanted the UK to leave the EU - Sinn FÃ©in took the opposite position. Sinn FÃ©in wants to legalise same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland, but the DUP does not. Just before Christmas, a DUP ministerwithdrew funding for an Irish language bursary scheme, in a move which angered nationalist parties. There are also differences on the issue of how new agencies to investigate killings from the Troubles should operate. James Brokenshire is obliged to call a fresh election if there is no resolution by Monday evening The rules on how Northern Ireland is run were drawn up in previous political agreements. Martin McGuinness's resignation as deputy first minister automatically put Arlene Foster out of her job as first minister, because they hold a joint office. After the positions have been vacant for seven days, the administration is effectively dead and the law says the Northern Ireland secretary must call a new election after a ""reasonable"" time period. Sinn FÃ©in has made it clear it will not re-nominate anyone to become deputy first minister. Elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly use a form of proportional representation called the Single Transferable Vote (STV). Voters rank candidates in numerical preference. But the next assembly election will see one significant change from previous ones. There will be a reduction in assembly members from 108 to 90. Northern Ireland's 18 constituencies will return five MLAs each, not six as was the case beforehand. The number of MLAs has been cut in order to reduce the cost of politics. This video can not be played MLAs walked out of the Assembly in December in protest just as Arlene Foster started to speak, leaving just the DUP in the chamber. Although the first and deputy first ministers are out of their office, other ministers remain in place. However, they cannot take any major decisions, as they require the approval of the executive, which will not meet. It is just eight months since the last NI Assembly election. In the May 2016 poll, the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in were well ahead of their rivals. After the new election, negotiations will take place between the parties to see if power-sharing can be restored. If the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in are again returned as the largest parties (as most observers expect), the disagreement between them is so deep that long and complex negotiations are likely to be needed before they are prepared to go into government with each other again. After an election, the parties have three weeks to form an executive. If that deadline runs out - then technically, there should be another election - though few expect that would happen, in reality. The British and Irish governments have said they are ready to help in any process which could restore stability. A wide range of unresolved issues could be on the table - the workings of the Stormont Assembly and Executive, the operation of new agencies to investigate Troubles' killings, budgets, the Irish language, a Bill of Rights, the status of Northern Ireland after Brexit, minority rights and lots more. Arlene Foster has repeatedly refused to resign over her role in the RHI scandal If a power-sharing government cannot be re-established, then some other way of governing Northern Ireland will have to be found. The last time devolution was suspended, there was direct rule from Westminster - ministers from the British government took over Stormont departments. Nationalists are calling for a form of ""joint authority"", where the British and Irish governments share responsibility for running Northern Ireland. But unionists will be hostile to that idea. The Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire has said he is not contemplating any alternatives to devolved government. The political crisis is affecting many areas of life. A Stormont plan to tackle hospital waiting lists cannot go ahead without an Executive. The uncertainty over who will be making government decisions in a few weeks' time is causing concern among public sector workers. And business leaders are worried the instability could affect overseas investment. There is a question mark over who will speak for Northern Ireland as the UK begins the process of leaving the EU. While there has been a degree of public indifference to previous crisis situations at Stormont - the impending collapse of the executive is generating lots of talk - and unease.

"The recent very hot spell led to speed restrictions on Britain's railways The top 10 warmest years on record in the UK have all occurred since 2002, a new analysis from the Met Office says. Its State of the UK Climate report shows that 2014 remains the warmest year in a temperature sequence now dating back to 1884. Despite last summer's blistering heat, 2018 only places as the seventh warmest year on record - as the statistic is based on temperatures all year round. When it comes to the coldest years, the most recent in the top 10 was in 1963. The patterns of warm and cold years in Britain are a clear signal of climate change, say scientists. It comes after the Met Office confirmed this week thatthe UK's hottest temperature ever - 38.7C (101.7F) - was recorded on Thursday in Cambridge. The UK's record-breaking heat in maps Tree planting rise 'needs to happen quickly' Global warming 'unparalleled' in 2,000 years The Met Office scientist who compiled the new analysis says that the clustering of all the warmest years in the first two decades of the 21st Century is what would be expected in a changing climate. ""It's certainly what we'd expect to see. Our climate in the UK has warmed at a very similar amount to the global temperature rise, so just under 1C for the UK,"" said Dr Mark McCarthy. ""Under that warming climate, we would expect that the hot extremes would tend to cluster in more recent times and the colder extremes are further back in time. ""Although we do still experience colder extremes like 'the beast from the east' last spring, generally speaking the story we have is that overall it's the warmer events and these higher temperatures that are dominating."" This is the fifth such report published by the Met Office and, thanks to a project to digitise historic weather records, it has now been extended to cover the years back to 1884. Previous versions only stretched back to 1910. This has not made any difference to the record of the UK's warmest years, but it has significantly changed the record of the coldest years, with five of the 10 chilliest occurring in the 1880s or 1890s. There is a significant difference between the coldest year in the sequence and the hottest - with the average temperature for 1892 just over 7C, while the average for the warmest saw an average approaching 10C. Colder years have been in short supply since the turn of the millennium, with 2010 being the chilliest, and that only ranks at 22nd on the cold list. Again it is not a measure of the most severe winters but of the lowest average temperature, based on levels measured all year round. ""We expect that extremely cold years nowadays like 2010 aren't as extreme as the cold years in the past, but the warm years are more extreme than the equivalent from 50-100 years ago,"" Dr McCarthy told BBC News. There's no huge surprise here. For years the Met Office has been saying that its data shows unmistakeable evidence of rising temperatures, both in the UK and worldwide, driven by the gases given off by human activity. This latest analysis is another way of highlighting what our warming climate means. It won't be the end of deep freeze winters or of chilly summers - our island weather is too variable for that. But the report suggests that the records over the past century or more reveal a very clear pattern of change. An obvious question is: Don't we know this all already? And you'd be right. But each passing year offers another chance for climate scientists to search for trends and to share their findings. I'm old enough to remember the last of Britain's top 10 cold winters - back in 1963 - and everyone's becoming more familiar with the warmer conditions of recent years. This video can not be played BBC colleagues from hot countries give their tips for staying cool 2018 was the third sunniest year on record in a series dating back to 1929. Despite this, and the very hot summer weather that tied the record for the warmest three-month period, the overall temperature for the year only placed it in seventh place in the list of the top 10 hottest. One big factor dragging the year down was the so-called beast from the east, when a record low temperature was recorded on 1 March. Another may have been the snow, with the UK recording the most significant snowfall since 2010. Government 'like Dad's Army' on climate change UK commits to 'net zero' emissions by 2050 Same time, same place, whatever the weather When it comes to rain, six of the 10 wettest years in the UK have occurred since 1998. Over the last decade, our hot and cold seasons have been getting wetter than the long-term average with the summers seeing 13% more rain while the winters going up by 12%. ""It is also interesting that a high number of the wettest years in the UK occurred recently, showing that climate change starts to show up even in highly variable aspects of weather such as rainfall,"" said Prof Gabi Hegerl from the University of Edinburgh who wasn't involved with the study. ""Climate change already matters to the UK and makes a difference."" Despite the UK breaking the record forits warmest day last week, the Met Office researchers are reluctant to speculate on where 2019 might end up in the hottest years list. ""It's been something of a mixed bag so far this year. On balance, it's too early to say where we will end up in 2019 because just a few extreme months can make a significant difference,"" said Dr McCarthy. Follow Matt on Twitter@MattMcGrathBBC,external.

"This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) Prime Minister Boris Johnson insists ""there is a way"" to avoid checks along the Irish border after Brexit. But why has the Irish border remained a major sticking point in the Brexit negotiations? If Brexit happens, the 310-mile Irish border will represent the only land border between the UK and the EU. As well as no longer being in the EU, Northern Ireland is likely to end up with different rules and standards to its neighbour, the Republic of Ireland. That's because the UK intends to leave the customs union and single market - arrangements designed to make trade easier between EU countries. Lorries travelling to the EU from Northern Ireland would be required to stop at the border for document checks and some product inspections. This would be to ensure their goods meet EU standards. Following incidents likefoot-and-mouth disease,externaland thehorse meat scandal, the EU is very strict about these requirements. In theory, such checks would mean things like cameras and security posts, creating a so-called ""hard border"". Concerns have been raised that the return of a hard border couldjeopardise the Good Friday Agreement. This helped bring the period of violence in Northern Irelandknown as ""The Troubles""to an end. Boris Johnson says there are ""abundant"" technological solutions UK and EU Brexit negotiators came up with a solution - known as the Irish backstop - to avoid border checks. If used, the backstop would keep the UK in a very close relationship with the EU until a trade deal permanently avoiding the need for checks is agreed. However, the backstop proved unacceptable to many Conservative MPs, who feared the UK would be trapped in it indefinitely. Their opposition eventually led toTheresa May's resignation as prime minister. Boris Johnson, the new prime minister, said a revised Brexit deal must include ""the abolition of the backstop"". He says the current solution would mean ""signing away"" the UK's ""economic independence"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. A ""wealth of solutions"" including technology could replace the the backstop and avoid the need for a hard border, Boris Johnson said during the Tory leadership campaign. Supporters say custom checks could be done at warehouses before lorries set off. Mobile phone technology or microchips on lorries, would track goods and avoid the need for border posts. However, the EU does not currently share a single border with a non-EU country where checks have been completely eliminated. That includes Norway (not in the EU) and Sweden (an EU member) - which share one of the most technologically advanced borders in the world. Their main crossing point processes about 1,300 lorries a day, with each waiting 20 minutes on average. The EU has said it will consider other solutions to the Irish border problem, but only once the current Brexit deal has been signed off. It has also expressed doubts about a technological solution. The problem with just relying on technology, is that EU law also require some products to be physically checked - chemicals and food are among them. Single UK-Irish food zone suggested by report Border technology 'could take 10 years' Why are vets being recruited in Ireland? Alongside technology, Mr Johnson has also talked about a trusted trader scheme. Businesses would be allowed to by-pass checks once they've proven to be trustworthy and have met certain standards. For it to work, the UK would need to persuade the EU to recognise it. But setting up such a scheme would a take a lot of time and cost a lot of money. The UK would also need to come up with an effective way of enforcing it and prevent smuggling. Another solution that has been proposed is to allow agriculture checks to take place in""mobile units away from the border"".,external However, existing EU law states that animal checks must take place at designated Border Inspections Posts (BIPs)""in the immediate vicinity of the point of entry"",external- which would include the Irish border. The EU says ""geographic constraints"" are the only exception (eg mountains, cliffs, valleys, rivers). In these cases, ""a certain distance from the point of introduction may be tolerated."" So getting the EU to allow checks to take place away from the border, for non-geographic reasons, would require a change in the rules. DUP leader Arlene Foster also believes technology and other solutions can prevent a hard border after Brexit Mr Johnson has also suggested the idea ofan all-Ireland food standards zone. In other words, Northern Ireland would keep the same food and animal standards as the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. However, it's unclear how food and animal products would be separated from other trade in order to prevent smuggling. If smuggling was to occur, it could threaten the integrity of the single market. But some say the UK could go further and agree a Northern Ireland-only backstop. This would see Northern Ireland remain in the customs union and parts of the single market - eliminating the need for any cross-border checks. But the DUP, which supports the Conservatives in government, has previously rejected the idea of a Northern Ireland backstop on the basis it would create checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. No-one has started building border posts and the UK and Irish governments say they do not want a hard border. So there is a very real question, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, about who would actually install the border posts if the EU insist they're necessary.

"BMW's mini factory in Oxford was closed during April to prepare for a Brexit which didn't happen New investment in the UK car industry has suffered a ""precipitous"" decline. It comes at a time when businesses in the sector have been spending heavily on preparations for a no-deal Brexit, according to the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The government says it is liaising with companies to help them prepare. The SMMT says investment fell to just Â£90m in the first six months of the year from Â£347m last year. By contrast, firms' spending on contingency plans for a possible no-deal Brexit has now reached a minimum of Â£330m. Meanwhile, production in the first half of the year fell by a fifth. During that time, 666,521 new cars rolled off production lines, compared to 834,573 during the same period in 2018. Although that figure was affected by some manufacturers bringing forward their annual summer shutdowns, the SMMT says output has now been falling for 13 consecutive months, and the underlying trend remains sharply downward. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes told the BBC the fall in investment was the most disturbing trend, and he links it directly to fears about the UK potentially leaving the EU without a deal that would protect cross-border trade. ""Over the last seven years the UK automotive industry was a real success story. We were averaging something like Â£2.5bn per annum"", he says. ""In the first six months of this year, it's not been half of that Â£2.5bn. It's Â£90m. It's been a massive drop off, because we have that fear of no-deal. ""The fear of no-deal is causing investors to hold back and wait and see what's going to happen"", he says. Not all investors are holding back however. In early July, for example, Jaguar Land Rover announced plans to build the first of a new range of electric and hybrid models at its factory in Castle Bromwich. The project, which will help to keep thousands of jobs, is likely to cost close to Â£1bn. It was announced too late to be included in the six-monthly figures. But while Mr Hawes enthusiastically welcomes JLR's plan, he insists the company is an ""outlier"", and that the broader picture is very different, where investment is effectively stalled. The SMMT has also warned that companies in the UK have had to spend large amounts of money or tie up working capital preparing contingency plans for a no deal Brexit, at a time when the industry as a whole is investing heavily in developing electric and autonomous vehicles. Such spending, it says, has included stockpiling materials and components, securing warehousing capacity and investing in new logistics systems. Several major manufacturers brought forward their annual production shutdowns, to mitigate disruption around the original 31 March Brexit date - a measure which it says cannot be repeated in October. Not all the sector's woes can be blamed on Brexit, however. Eight out of every 10 cars built here are exported, and sales in a number of major markets have declined sharply in recent months. As a result, shipments to China fell 53.1% in the first half of the year, while those to the US fell nearly 13%. More than half of the UK's exports go to the European Union - and demand there fell by 15.6%. Meanwhile outside factors have also been blamed for Honda's recent announcement that it will close its plant in Swindon in 2021, Nissan's decision to build its new X-trail in Japan rather than in the UK and Ford's plan to shut its factory in Bridgend. But the SMMT is worried that Brexit fears are preventing new investment from coming in to replace the jobs and work being lost. Last week, Mr Hawes wrote to the new Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, urging him to reach a deal with the EU that allows parts and finished cars to cross borders freely, without being subject to tariffs or onerous customs controls. A no-deal Brexit, he warned, would be an ""existential threat"" to the industry, and simply should not be an option. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""The UK automotive industry remains one of our great success stories. ""We are at the forefront of designing and manufacturing cutting-edge vehicles, and we continue to talk to industry, including the automotive sector, in the run-up to exit day to ensure they are prepared and can maximise the opportunities of our exit from the EU.""

"William Hill's decision to close 700 shops could just be the beginning of a wave of High Street betting shop closures, an analyst has warned. Between 2,000 and 3,000 bookies could close out of the UK's 8,400 shops, analyst Gavin Kelleher told the BBC. William Hill blamed the closures on the UK government's decision to reduce the maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals from Â£100 to Â£2. The stakes were reduced to help vulnerable people and problem gamblers. ""I think we will definitely see more closures. GVC, which owns the Ladbrokes and Coral brand, have said they will close up to 1,000 stores,"" Mr Kelleher, who is an equity analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers, told the Today programme. ""You are also likely to see stores close elsewhere in the market from independents and potentially from Betfred so I think all told we'll probably see over 2,000 to 3,000 shops close in the UK, which is a significant chunk of the 8,400 shops that currently reside in the UK."" Mr Kelleher said revenue growth had been flat at High Street betting shops for the past five or six years, so the stake reduction had been a ""tipping point"". ""The Â£2 stake is the main issue behind those closures to be honest,"" he said. Although gambling machines are a controversial issue, he adds that ""there is an economic impact here"" with more than 50,000 people employed in retail betting in the UK. He said that the sector pays a ""significant amount of tax and duty"", and added that the sector also pays duty to horse racing. ""You could say that retail betting is a key support for the UK horse-racing industry, which accounts for [the employment of] about 100,000 people in the UK,"" Mr Kelleher said. Business Minister Jake Berry told the Today programme that he was ""sorry for all the people who work in William Hill who'll be worried about their jobs"", but he said fixed odds betting terminals ""have been described as the crack cocaine of gambling"". ""I think we've done the right thing,"" he said. ""Those fixed odds betting terminals were causing enormous problems for some of the poorest and most vulnerable in our society."" He added that fewer betting shops would make for a more diverse High Street. ""They can't all be hot food takeaways, charity shops, and bookmakers. We want to see a diverse and vibrant High Street.""

"Hundreds of mothers-to-be have lost access to their midwives after a community service was forced to close. Women across the north-west of England and in Essex have been affected after One to One announced it was withdrawing the services it provided for the NHS. The company said the contracts it had did not pay enough to make the service financially viable. One to One specialises in home births, which means some women may have to give birth in hospital against their wishes. One of the women who is immediately affected by One to One's closure is Gemma Davies, who is 41 weeks pregnant and could go into labour at any time. The 35-year-old mother of two, from Warrington in Cheshire, said she had been left ""heartbroken"" by the announcement. ""I got no notice. My midwife rang on Monday to tell me what was happening. ""It now looks like I will have to give birth in hospital. ""But that is the last thing I wanted to do - I've had such a bad experience in hospital. ""I was induced for my first child and it was horrible and then last year I had a miscarriage and again the care I received was not good enough. ""I was delighted when I was able to choose to get my midwife care from One to One. ""I have really got to know my midwife over the past few months - and now she has been snatched away at the last minute."" It is thought around 150 women due to give birth in the coming weeks are in a similar position although there are thought to be another 1,000 women who were on the company's books and receiving either ante-natal or post-natal support. Local NHS services will now be trying during the day to make alternative arrangements for them, with the firm due to cease providing care from 17:00 BST. A spokeswoman for One to One said it was ""extremely proud"" of the care it has provided over the last nine years. But it said the ""challenging NHS landscape"" had left it with little choice. The service provided care to women across Cheshire and Merseyside as well as Colchester and Clacton in Essex. A spokesman for the NHS said emergency protocols had been put in place and women affected would be contacted by a dedicated team. He said the ""priority"" was ensuring those affected were provided with support, but he said he could not guarantee that they would be able to have a home birth. The collapse of One to One is the second community midwifery service to go under this year. Neighbourhood Midwives, which provided services to women in the south east,closed in January. In both cases the amount the NHS was prepared to pay for these services has been questioned by the providers. Both services offered women dedicated care from a named midwife. It raises questions about the viability of this form of one-to-one care that has been used by the health service to offer women more choice beyond traditional NHS-run services. While not solely focussed on home births, many women who opt for care from these services do want a home birth. There has been a drive to increase the number of home births. But despite one in 10 pregnant women saying they would prefer one just over 2% of birth are at home.

"The owner of Ladbrokes Coral has been fined Â£5.9m for not protecting vulnerable customers and for failings in its anti-money laundering measures. The Gambling Commission says that over a three-year period, Ladbrokes and Coral failed to put effective safeguards in place to ""prevent consumers suffering gambling harm"". One customer lost Â£98,000 and had asked the company to stop sending promotions. But the firm failed to carry out ""social responsibility interactions"". The Gambling Commission said,externalthe problems occurred between November 2014 and October 2017, after which GVC Holdings bought Ladbrokes Coral in March 2018.

The commission also highlighted a Coral customer who spent Â£1.5m over nearly three years, during which time they logged onto their account an average 10 times a day for one month and lost Â£64,000 in one four week period. It said Coral ""did not ask the customer to evidence their source of funds and could not provide evidence of any social responsibility interactions being carried out"".

GVC  said it ""acknowledges and regrets"" that certain legacy systems and processes in place at Ladbrokes and Coral ""did not adequately meet the regulatory requirements"". ""These historical failings were unacceptable and since the acquisition, I have overseen a systematic review of the enlarged group's player protection procedures and the individuals responsible for these problems have exited the business,"" added GVC chief executive Kenneth Alexander.

"Do you remember the good old days when we had ""12 years to save the planet""? Now it seems, there's a growing consensus that the next 18 months will be critical in dealing with the global heating crisis, among other environmental challenges. Last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that to keep the rise inglobal temperatures below 1.5C this century, emissions of carbon dioxide would have to be cut by 45% by 2030. But today, observers recognise that the decisive, political steps to enable the cuts in carbon to take place will have to happen before the end of next year. The idea that 2020 is a firm deadline was eloquently addressed by one of the world's top climate scientists, speaking back in 2017. This video can not be played Why is it so hot and is climate change to blame? ""The climate math is brutally clear: While the world can't be healed within the next few years, it may be fatally wounded by negligence until 2020,"" said Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, founder and now director emeritus of the Potsdam Climate Institute. The sense that the end of next year is the last chance saloon for climate change is becoming clearer all the time. ""I am firmly of the view that the next 18 months will decide our ability to keep climate change to survivable levels and to restore nature to the equilibrium we need for our survival,"" said Prince Charles, speaking at a reception for Commonwealth foreign ministers recently. UK heatwave 'set to break records' Records tumble as Europe swelters in heatwave 'No brainer' fuel change to cut transport CO2 Used cooking oil imports may boost deforestation Government 'like Dad's Army' on climate change The Prince was looking ahead to a series of critical UN meetings that are due to take place between now and the end of 2020. Ever since a global climate agreement was signed in Paris in December 2015, negotiators have been consumed with arguing about the rulebook for the pact. But under the terms of the deal, countries have also promised to improve their carbon-cutting plans by the end of next year. Prince Charles has stressed how important the next 12 months are in tackling climate change One of the understated headlines in last year'sIPCC report,externalwas that global emissions of carbon dioxide must peak by 2020 to keep the planet below 1.5C. Current plans are nowhere near strong enough to keep temperatures below the so-called safe limit. Right now, we are heading towards 3C of heating by 2100 not 1.5. As countries usually scope out their plans over five and 10 year timeframes, if the 45% carbon cut target by 2030 is to be met then the plans really need to be on the table by the end of 2020. The first major hurdle will be thespecial climate summit,externalcalled by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, which will be held in New York on 23 September. Mr Guterres has been clear that he only wants countries to come to the UN if they can make significant offers to improve their national carbon cutting plans. This will be followed by COP25 in Santiago, Chile, where the most important achievement will likely be keeping the process moving forward. But the really big momentwill most likely be in the UKat COP26, which takes place at the end of 2020. The UK government believes it can use the opportunity of COP26, in a post-Brexit world, to show that Britain can build the political will for progress, in the same way the French used their diplomatic muscle to make the Paris deal happen. ""If we succeed in our bid (to host COP26) then we will ensure we build on the Paris agreement and reflect the scientific evidence accumulating now that we need to go further and faster,"" said Environment Secretary Michael Gove, in what may have been his last major speech in the job. ""And we need at COP26 to ensure other countries are serious about their obligations and that means leading by example. Together we must take all the steps necessary to restrict global warming to at least 1.5C."" Whether it's the evidence of heatwaves, or the influence of Swedish school striker Greta Thunberg, or the rise of Extinction Rebellion, there has been a marked change in public interest in stories about climate change and a hunger for solutions that people can put in place in their own lives. People are demanding significant action, and politicians in many countries have woken up to these changes. The rise of school strikers like Greta Thunberg has reflected growing interest in the climate question Ideas like thegreen new deal in the US, which might have seemed unfeasible a few years ago have gained real traction. Some countries like the UK have gone even further andlegislated for net zero emissions by 2050, the long-term goal that will keep temperatures down. Prince Charles' sense that the next 18 months are critical is shared by some climate negotiators. ""Our group of small island developing states share Prince Charles's sense of the profound urgency for ambitious climate action,"" said ambassador Janine Felson from Belize who is the chief strategist for the Alliance of Small Island States group in the UN. ""All at once we are witness to a collective convergence of public mobilisation, worsening climatic impacts and dire scientific warnings that compel decisive climate leadership."" ""Without question, 2020 is a hard deadline for that leadership to finally manifest itself."" With exquisite timing, the likely UK COP in 2020 could also be the moment the US finally pulls out of the Paris agreement. But if Donald Trump doesn't prevail in the presidential election that position could change, with a democrat victor likely to reverse the decision. Either step could have huge consequences for the climate fight. Right now a number of countries seem keen to slow down progress. Last December the US, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia blocked the IPCC special report on 1.5C from UN talks. Just a few weeks ago in Bonn, furtherobjections from Saudi Arabiameant it was again dropped from the UN negotiations, much to annoyance of small island states and developing nations. The US and Saudi Arabia have joined forces to restrict the use of IPCC science reports in climate talks There will be significant pressure on the host country to ensure substantial progress. But if there's ongoing political turmoil around Brexit then the government may not have the bandwidth to unpick the multiple global challenges that climate change presents. ""If we cannot use that moment to accelerate ambition we will have no chance of getting to a 1.5 or 2C limit,"" said Prof Michael Jacobs, from the University of Sheffield, a former climate adviser to Prime Minister Gordon Brown. ""Right now there's nothing like enough understanding of, or commitment to, this among leading countries. That's why the UN Secretary General is holding a summit in September. ""It's great that the COP might be in UK because we have a big civil society ecosystem and much higher climate awareness than in most other countries. But the movement here has barely started to think about how to apply sufficient pressure."" There's also been a strong warning shot from the UK's Committee on Climate Change (CCC). At the launch of their review ofprogress made by the UK government,externalon tackling climate change, the country was found not to be on track despite legislating for net zero emissions by 2050. ""The government must show it is serious about its legal obligationsâ¦[its] credibility really is at stake here,"" said CCC chief executive Chris Stark. ""There is a window over the next 12-18 months to do something about this. If we don't see that, I fear the government will be embarrassed at COP26."" And it's not all about climate change While the decisions taken on climate change in the next year or so will be critical, there are a number of other key gatherings on the environment that will shape the nature on preserving species and protecting our oceans in the coming decades. Earlier this year a major study on the losses being felt across the natural world as result of broader human impacts caused a huge stir among governments. TheIPBES reportshowed that up to one million species could be lost in coming decades. To address this, governments will meet in China next year to try to agree a deal that will protect creatures of all types. TheConvention on Biological Diversity,externalis the UN body tasked with putting together a plan to protect nature up to 2030. Next year's meeting could be a ""Paris agreement"" moment for the natural world.  If agreement is found it's likely there will be an emphasis on sustainable farming and fishing. It will urge greater protection for species and a limit on deforestation. Next year, theUN Convention on the Laws of the Seawill also meet to negotiate a new global oceans treaty. This has the potential to make a real difference, according to UK Environment Secretary Michael Gove. ""We have been convinced by the evidence of environmental degradation which occurs without adequate protection,"" he said in a speech last week. ""And that is why the United Kingdom has taken the lead in ensuring at least 30% of the ocean we are responsible for is protected by 2030 - a trebling of the present target. We will be asking all nations to sign up to that goal."" If all this comes to pass, the world might have a fighting chance of preserving our natural environment.

"Schools in areas with a higher risk of youth violence should be given dedicated police officers, say MPs. The Home Affairs Committee criticised the government's current violence reduction strategy as ""completely inadequate"". It called on the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, to take ""personal responsibility"" for tackling knife and gun crime among young people. But the Home Office said the MPs failed to fully recognise its action on crime. Ten charts on the rise of knife crime Police in schools increase after knife crime NHS to have legal duty to prevent knife crime In its report,external, the committee called for more investment into neighbourhood policing - including a commitment to get a dedicated police officer into ""all schools in areas with an above-average risk of serious youth violence"" by April 2020. It said by committing the money for the officers in the government's autumn spending review, it would become part of a drive to ""rebuild vital links"" with the communities affected. The report has been published as part of the committee's inquiry into youth violence for which MPs have heard evidence from campaigners, victims' families, doctors, senior police officers, children's charities and criminologists. It also recommended that: Named individuals in English and Welsh regions report directly to Downing Street on action to bring down violence The government increases funding for youth outreach workers and community youth projects Action is taken to reduce the number of pupils excluded from school, and to offer more support to those in alternative schools The report criticised the government'sstrategy to cut violent crimein England and Wales for containing ""no targets or milestones"" and ""few new actions"". Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the committee, said the Home Office had ""taken a hands-off approach"" to the ""national emergency"" of youth violence. ""To publish a weak strategy and convene a few roundtable discussions just isn't enough when faced with youth violence on this scale,"" she said. ""Serious violence has got worse after a perfect storm of youth service cuts, police cuts, more children being excluded from school and a failure of statutory agencies to keep them safe."" This video can not be played School exclusions and knife crime are both on the rise in England, but are the two actually linked? New policing minister Kit Malthouse said greater interaction between police and schools could help build ""very helpful"" relationships as pupils enter their teenage years. He said increased police powers could have a short-term impact, but the solutions to knife crime in particular were ""complex and wide-ranging"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""This will take many years to do - and it's something we've been investing in, and need to invest more. ""It's definitely the case we need to turbo-charge what we're doing."" The government's Serious Violence Strategy, launched last April, committed Â£11m for an ""early intervention youth fund"" to help young people at risk of getting involved in violence. The plan also committed funds for a national coordination centre to tackle ""county-lines"" drug routes to target links between the illegal drugs market and violent crime. The Home Affairs Committee has compiled arguably the most comprehensive study into the causes of and possible solutions to youth violence since the problems began to escalate in 2015. Unlike the Home Office Serious Violence Strategy - which barely mentioned public sector budget cuts when it was published in 2018 - the committee identifies resources as a key factor, while emphasising that other issues, such as county lines drug gangs, have also played a part. But there is no silver bullet, no one easy answer. Indeed, the MPs caution against slogans that sound good, but which may lack substance, such as ""public health approach"". Instead, the tenor of the report suggests violence will only come down through sustained hard work over many years by government, agencies and communities together. Every school and further education college in London has been offered a ""named officer"", said Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick, in herevidence to the committee,external. The officers carried out ""high visibility patrols"" and delivered sessions and bespoke workshops to pupils, she said. She told the committee there were currentlyabout 280 ""safer schools"" officers in the capital,external- including 40 in the Police Cadets - and that she hoped there would be more than 500 based in the capital by the autumn. Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick told the committee she wanted more ""safer schools"" officers in London But the committee said the picture was quite different in other parts of the country. Ten of 33 forces in England told MPs they did not currently have one, including West Midlands Police - the largest force outside of London. Children's services 'at breaking point' Under-fire council 'failing to keep children safe' 'Poverty link' to youth violence - London mayor The Home Office said the committee's assessment had failed to recognise the full range of urgent action the government was taking to keep our communities safe, and pointed to the new prime minister's pledge to recruitan extra 20,000 police officers, and the new national policing board. ""We have made it simpler for officers to use stop and search, and our Offensive Weapons Act will stop knives making their way onto our streets in the first place,"" a Home Office spokesman said. The Children's Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, said the government must treat youth violence as a ""top priority"" with a ""large-scale and long-term plan"" to help protect vulnerable children. The Children's Society charity called for extra funding for ""professional training, prevention, early intervention and youth services"". More people have been admitted to hospital with knife wounds in the four years since 2014, with a sharper increase in admissions involving people under-18 than adults,NHS data,externalshows.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I am committed to Good Friday Agreement"" Boris Johnson has urged political parties in Northern Ireland to step up their efforts to restore devolved government, during talks in Belfast. The PM held a series of meetings with the five main Stormont parties, in which Brexit was also discussed. NI has been without a government since January 2017, when the power-sharing DUP/Sinn FÃ©in coalition collapsed. On Tuesday,Mr Johnson held a private meetingwith senior DUP figures, whose support he relies on in Parliament. What is direct rule? Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Q&A: What is happening at Stormont? Who's calling the shots on NI policy? The prime minister left Northern Ireland on Wednesday afternoon and a Downing Street spokesperson said Mr Johnson told the parties while there had been constructive progress in the talks at Stormont, ""there now needed to be serious and intense engagement to get this done"". The spokesperson added that Mr Johnson had told the parties the UK would be leaving the EU on 31 October ""come what may"" and his intention was to do so with a deal. In all scenarios, the government was committed to the Good Friday Agreement and in no circumstances would there be physical checks or infrastructure on the border, they said. Following her meetings with Mr Johnson, DUP leader Arlene Foster said ""talk of a border poll"" was not something Boris Johnson was ""entertaining"". She met the prime minister along with DUP MPs Nigel Dodds, Emma Little-Pengelly and Gavin Robinson. Sinn FÃ©in said if a no-deal Brexit happens, the government must call a referendum on Irish unity ""immediately"". But Mrs Foster said the Conservative government would ""never be neutral on the union"". She said discussions regarding the confidence and supply pact the two parties share was for ""another day"" but defended the Â£1bn in spending for NI the DUP had secured in the past. NI Secretary Julian Smith with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he arrived at Stormont The issue over what will happen at the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit - and the proposed Irish backstop - has caused deep divisions between the parties at Stormont. The backstop is the insurance policy negotiated as part of the UK-EU withdrawal agreement, which aims to keep the border as seamless as it is now and avoid land border checks. But Mr Johnson has referred to it as a ""monstrosity"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Mr Johnson met Sinn FÃ©in first on Wednesday before talks with the smaller parties and further discussions with the DUP. After the meeting, Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald said she told the prime minister he must not be ""the DUP's gopher"". Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald gave a press conference after her meeting with the prime minister Ms McDonald said she did not believe the PM's claim he would act with ""total impartiality"" towards all parties in NI. ""It's not our business who dines with whom, but the politics of this is the DUP have used this to ensure... the continuing denial of rights and trample on the views of the majority of people who live here,"" added Mrs McDonald. As the talks were taking place, a number of protestors gathered outside, including a group of Harland and Wolff shipyard workers who are lobbying the government to renationalise their workplace. The Belfast firm's Norwegian parent company Dolphin Drilling is havingserious financial problems and put Harland and Wolff up for sale late last year. This video can not be played Harland and Wolff workers in bi-lingual Stormont protest They were joined at Stormont by Irish language campaigners, anti-Brexit protestors andthe families of those killed in Ballymurphy in 1971with others calling for government action on legacy issues. Northern Ireland has not been ruled directly from Westminster for more than a decade, but it has been without a government since 2017. Several attempts tokick-start devolution have already failed. The DUP is due to renew the confidence-and-supply agreement on which Mr Johnson's Conservative Party depends for a working majority in the House of Commons. Boris Johnson attended the DUP party conference in Belfast in 2018 The NI secretary met with the leaders of the five main parties on Wednesday afternoon and has asked the five independent working groups to hold further meetings and report back to him in the coming days. He said he would then discuss further steps with the Irish government.

"BMW's mini factory in Oxford was closed during April to prepare for a Brexit which didn't happen New investment in the UK car industry has suffered a ""precipitous"" decline. It comes at a time when businesses in the sector have been spending heavily on preparations for a no-deal Brexit, according to the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The government says it is liaising with companies to help them prepare. The SMMT says investment fell to just Â£90m in the first six months of the year from Â£347m last year. By contrast, firms' spending on contingency plans for a possible no-deal Brexit has now reached a minimum of Â£330m. Meanwhile, production in the first half of the year fell by a fifth. During that time, 666,521 new cars rolled off production lines, compared to 834,573 during the same period in 2018. Although that figure was affected by some manufacturers bringing forward their annual summer shutdowns, the SMMT says output has now been falling for 13 consecutive months, and the underlying trend remains sharply downward. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes told the BBC the fall in investment was the most disturbing trend, and he links it directly to fears about the UK potentially leaving the EU without a deal that would protect cross-border trade. ""Over the last seven years the UK automotive industry was a real success story. We were averaging something like Â£2.5bn per annum"", he says. ""In the first six months of this year, it's not been half of that Â£2.5bn. It's Â£90m. It's been a massive drop off, because we have that fear of no-deal. ""The fear of no-deal is causing investors to hold back and wait and see what's going to happen"", he says. Not all investors are holding back however. In early July, for example, Jaguar Land Rover announced plans to build the first of a new range of electric and hybrid models at its factory in Castle Bromwich. The project, which will help to keep thousands of jobs, is likely to cost close to Â£1bn. It was announced too late to be included in the six-monthly figures. But while Mr Hawes enthusiastically welcomes JLR's plan, he insists the company is an ""outlier"", and that the broader picture is very different, where investment is effectively stalled. The SMMT has also warned that companies in the UK have had to spend large amounts of money or tie up working capital preparing contingency plans for a no deal Brexit, at a time when the industry as a whole is investing heavily in developing electric and autonomous vehicles. Such spending, it says, has included stockpiling materials and components, securing warehousing capacity and investing in new logistics systems. Several major manufacturers brought forward their annual production shutdowns, to mitigate disruption around the original 31 March Brexit date - a measure which it says cannot be repeated in October. Not all the sector's woes can be blamed on Brexit, however. Eight out of every 10 cars built here are exported, and sales in a number of major markets have declined sharply in recent months. As a result, shipments to China fell 53.1% in the first half of the year, while those to the US fell nearly 13%. More than half of the UK's exports go to the European Union - and demand there fell by 15.6%. Meanwhile outside factors have also been blamed for Honda's recent announcement that it will close its plant in Swindon in 2021, Nissan's decision to build its new X-trail in Japan rather than in the UK and Ford's plan to shut its factory in Bridgend. But the SMMT is worried that Brexit fears are preventing new investment from coming in to replace the jobs and work being lost. Last week, Mr Hawes wrote to the new Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, urging him to reach a deal with the EU that allows parts and finished cars to cross borders freely, without being subject to tariffs or onerous customs controls. A no-deal Brexit, he warned, would be an ""existential threat"" to the industry, and simply should not be an option. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""The UK automotive industry remains one of our great success stories. ""We are at the forefront of designing and manufacturing cutting-edge vehicles, and we continue to talk to industry, including the automotive sector, in the run-up to exit day to ensure they are prepared and can maximise the opportunities of our exit from the EU.""

"Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hinted earlier this month that rates could be cut The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, is expected on Wednesday to cut rates for the first time since 2008. Traders expect a 0.25 percentage point cut, taking the federal funds target range to 2-2.25%. Supporters say it will spur a US economy showing signs of needing help. Critics argue that a rate cut will not help and that the Fed will be pandering to President Donald Trump, who is demanding a big cut. Inflation is lower than policymakers would like in the US, languishing at about 1.6% in June. The Fed targets 2%. Concerns about the US and global economy will also weigh on rate-setters' minds. The Fed have been raising rates since 2016 Last week, the IMF cut its growth forecasts for the global economy for this year and next. US growth registered at an anaemic annual rate of 2.1% between April and June. US manufacturing, about a tenth of the economy, is the main sector under pressure. It slowed to a low of almost three years last month. Unemployment hit a 49-year low in May and was at 3.7% last month. But many of those jobs are in the service sector and are low-paying with low hours, says Megan Greene, an economist and senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School. Often, low unemployment pushes wages up, and with more wages chasing the same products comes the inflation the Fed is looking for. But because the wages of the people being hired are low, that isn't happening. There is also the matter of the trade war with China,which threatens the world's economy. ""None of this will be fixed"" by a small rate cut, Megan Greene says. The US reported this month that permits for home construction dropped to a two-year low in June ""I think they will cut rates,"" said former vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve, Donald Kohn, ""and I think there are good reasons for doing that."" While the economy ""looks pretty good"" and unemployment is low, ""I think there are some downside risks to growth, and inflation is running low so it's a good time to take out some insurance,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Cutting rates makes borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers, and can lead to asset price inflation, or bubbles as that's known. Mr Kohn says the banking system is much stronger since the last crisis in 2007-9, which should lessen the risk of a similar crash. One area to watch is corporate debt, which has been growing, he says. US corporate debt, excluding lenders', stands at about $10tn (Â£8.23tn), up about a half from the crisis. However, when rates were at close to zero for the seven years after the crisis, it didn't spur much growth, said Ms Greene, leaving one to wonder what a 0.25 percentage point dent will do this time. Finally, what if it doesn't work? When another true crisis arrives, the central bank will want to cut rates again to stimulate growth and bolster business confidence. ""If it doesn't do much - and I don't think it will - there's a risk of people not thinking it will work again."" No. On Tuesday President Trump called on the Federal Reserve to make a large interest rate cut, interpreted as larger than the expected 0.25. ""I'm very disappointed in the Fed. I think they acted too quickly by far, and I think I've been proven right,"" Mr Trump said. ""The Fed is often wrong,"" US economic growth slows below Trump target US labour market booms in June US-China trade war in 300 words Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Los Angeles mayor to give update on wildfires as more residents told to evacuate What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Apple posted a small gain in sales for the third quarter of the year. While iPhone sales dipped, the company made up the difference in higher revenues in services such as its software store and music service. Sales rose 1% to $53.8bn (Â£44.3bn), while net profit dropped 13% to $10bn. The company stemmed some of its drop in sales to China. The results beat Wall Street estimates and shares gained 3.5% to $216.10 in after-hours trading. For first time since 2012, iPhone sales represent less than half of company's overall sales. Sales of the device are down by $741m on this period last year. In China, sales fell 4% to $9.16bn, after a drop of 22% in the second quarter. Exchange rates have made the iPhone expensive for Chinese customers. Apple forecast sales of between $61bn and $64bn for the final three months of its financial year. You'll hear critics often say that Apple has failed too come up with anything interesting since the iPhone. And that Tim Cook, the man who took over from Steve jobs, is yet to come up with anything interesting at all. But that criticism is increasingly untrue, at least when it comes to Apple inventing new areas of business. This quarter underlines that: despite iPhone sales continuing to shrink, the firm's revenues are up, thanks to booming success with its Wearables, Home and Accessories category (so: Apple Watch, mostly, and AirPods) and continued growth of it Services (App Store, Apple Pay, Apple TV, Apple Music etc). The number of people paying Apple for some kind of subscription has risen by 55% in the past year to 420m. Apple expects that number to go up fairly dramatically over the next year thanks to the launch of its big-budget subscription TV service, Apple TV+. Even China brought somewhat good news for Apple this quarter. Sales were down 4% in the country, which the company is seeing as being much better as it could have been given the extreme turbulence created by the US-China trade war. If you remove the iPhone from the China figures, Apple's revenues there grew by 17%. That suggests a slowing upgrade cycle, but users still keen to use the iPhones they have and access Apple services. In short, Apple is in good health. The iPhone is a product in decline, and as a result, the company's profits have taken a hit. Investors understand that this is a firm in a transition, and so far it is going well.

"Shana Grice was murdered by her ex-boyfriend who stalked her An ex-PC committed misconduct by failing to investigate a teenager's claims she was being harassed by a former boyfriend who later killed her. Trevor Godfrey told a disciplinary panel he believed Shana Grice's accusations against Michael Lane were a ""smokescreen"" to hide their affair. The 19-year-old reported Lane to Sussex Police five times in the months before she was murdered in Brighton in 2016. The panel found Mr Godfrey had not committed gross misconduct. The former officer, who retired in 2017, issued the teenager with a warning for wasting police time and decided to take no further action against Lane. He was told he would not have been sacked if he was still serving. Ms Grice's parents said the misconduct charge was ""a joke and the hearing a sham"". The panel found Mr Godfrey failed to adequately investigate allegations of harassment and stalking, and that he failed to treat Ms Grice as a victim, in a breach of police rules. Chairwoman Victoria Goodfellow said: ""While clearly serious matters, they are not enough to mean gross misconduct."" She added: ""We do not attribute any blame on Shana."" The hearing in Lewes had been told Miss Grice had initiallyfailed to disclose she and Lane had been in a relationship. But Sarah Green, of the Independent Office for Police Conduct, said Mr Godfrey had failed in his ""duties and responsibilities to Shana,"" adding: ""Those close to Shana have testified that his actions affected her confidence in the police and may have prevented her from reporting Lane's continued harassment."" A report commissioned after Miss Grice's death foundstalking and harassment offences were not being properly investigated by Sussex Police. The panel was told she had an affair with Lane while seeing someone else and Mr Godfrey said there had been no sign of harassment, despite her making accusations to the contrary. Michael Lane was convicted of murdering Ms Grice in 2017 The ex-officer said she had admitted that on one occasion, Lane was outside her house at the time of an alleged assault because she had arranged the meeting behind her then-boyfriend's back. He said: ""She would be signing her texts [to Lane] with five kisses. This is not harassment. It was a smokescreen to disguise her affair."" There was therefore ""no reason"" to supply Ms Grice with safety advice because ""there was nothing there to suggest she was in any form of danger whatsoever,"" he added. Mark Aldred, representing Mr Godfrey, said his client was right to consider Ms Grice's misleading statement when deciding to recommend no further action be taken against Lane after he allegedly grabbed her phone and pulled her hair. In a statement, Ms Grice's parents, Sharon Grice and Richard Green, said: ""We can barely believe what we have witnessed these past two days. The panel allowed a wholesale character assassination of our daughter, who is obviously not here to defend herself."" They said Mr Godfrey's testimony ""proved his discriminatory attitude, even accusing Shana of coercing Lane"". Lane, 27, was jailed for a minimum of 25 years in 2017 for murdering Ms Grice. Assistant Chief Constable Jon Savell apologised for the ""failures that have been highlighted in this and other misconduct hearings"" and said the force was learning lessons about how it deals with stalking, harassment and domestic abuse. Correction Wednesday 21 July 2019: An earlier version of this story stated Mr Godfrey would have been sacked due to his misconduct. This has been amended.
