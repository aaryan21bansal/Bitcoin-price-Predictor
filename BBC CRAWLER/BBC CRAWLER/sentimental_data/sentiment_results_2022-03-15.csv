"The Slovenian, Polish and Czech prime ministers, together with Poland's ruling party leader, took the long journey from Warsaw On day 20 of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, residents in the capital Kyiv were placed under a 35-hour curfew - but that didn't stop the prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic from travelling there by train. The trip was a Polish idea, after the EU warned of potential security risks. The leaders decided to go by trainbecause flying by Polish military jet could have been viewed by Russia as dangerously provocative, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler reported. It was not immediately clear when their train would make the return trip to Warsaw. Poland's Mateusz Morawiecki said history was being made in Ukraine's capital. ""It is here, that freedom fights against the world of tyranny. It is here that the future of us all hangs in the balance,"" he tweeted. Mr Morawiecki added that Ukraine could count on the help of its friends. The prime ministers sat down for a briefing with their Ukrainian counterpart Denis Shmyhal, and President Volodymyr Zelensky, who thanked them for the ""powerful"" gesture of support. They were accompanied to Ukraine by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Poland's ruling Law and Justice party. Russian artillery and warplanes are continuing to pound cities and towns across Ukraine. In Mariupol, a key port city in the south-east,hundreds of people crammed into the basement of a large public buildingare running out of food, with many also in need of urgent medical help, the BBC's Hugo Bachega was told. ""Some have developed sepsis from shrapnel in the body,"" said Anastasiya Ponomareva, a 39-year-old teacher who fled the city at the start of the war but is in contact with friends there. ""Things are very serious."" Her friends are with other families who spend most of their day in the basement. From time to time they go upstairs for sunlight, but rarely outside. They have all left homes that are no longer safe or no longer standing. A satellite image shows fires burning following Russian strikes in residential area of eastern Mariupol, Ukraine At an intensive care hospital on the western outskirts of the city, staff described being treated like hostages by Russian forces. One employee was quoted as saying that Russian troops had ""forced 400 people from neighbouring houses to come to our hospital,"" adding: ""We can't leave."" The regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said the facility had been all but destroyed by shelling in recent days, but that staff had continued to treat patients in the basement. Separately, about 2,000 cars were able to leave Mariupol along a humanitarian evacuation route, according to city authorities. Before the war around 400,000 people lived in the city, which has endured intense bombardment by Russian forces. The city council says well over 2,000 civilians have died. A cameraman and a journalist working for Fox News were killed when their vehicle was struck by incoming fire on the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, staff at the US network said. Cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski (left) and journalist Oleksandra Kuvshinova (seen here wearing a helmet and protective vest) Fox News chief executive Suzanne Scott describedthe deaths of Pierre Zakrzewski, 55, and Oleksandra Kuvshinova, 24,as ""heart-breaking"". Their colleague, 39-year-old Benjamin Hall, was also wounded in the incident and taken to hospital. The attack followed the death on Sunday of 50-year-old US journalist Brent Renaud, who was shot and killed in the Ukrainian town of Irpin. The Russian journalist who protested against the war in Ukraine on a live TV news programme and shared a video describing the invasion as a crime was fined 30,000 roubles (Â£214; $280) and released. Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at state-controlled Channel One, was detainedon Monday after she ran onto the set holding a sign saying ""no war"". But concerns were later raised over her safety after reports that she could not be contacted. On Tuesday, however, she appeared at a court hearing. Marina Ovsyannikova appeared in court on Tuesday with lawyer Anton Gashinsky Ms Ovsyannikova told reporters afterwards that she had gone two days with no sleep, had been questioned for over 14 hours, and was not given access to legal help. Fears that US astronaut Mark Vande Hei - who has been in space for 355 days - might lose his lift back to Earth on board a Russian capsule were thankfully put to bed whenit was confirmed he would indeed be making the trip home. Astronaut Mark Vande Hei has spent 355 days in space - a new US record The American, and two other Russian cosmonauts, will be brought back, landing in Kazakhstan. Joel Montalbano, Nasa's ISS programme manager, said: ""I can tell you for sure Mark is coming home... We are in communication with our Russian colleagues. There's no fuzz on that."" Meanwhile, as Western nations impose further sanctions on Russia,Moscow retaliated on Tuesday by slapping sanctions on US President Joe Bidenand 12 other US officials. The list includes Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, press secretary Jen Psaki and other members of the administration. But there were also a couple of surprises on the list: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Mr Biden's son, Hunter. The measures block their entry into Russia and freeze any assets held in the country.

"Oleksandr Kamyshin, 37, says Ukraine's railway staff have helped an estimated 2.5 million people to reach safety There is a last-minute change of plan. He won't be leaving from the main station after all. The bodyguards move fast and we follow, racing along the quiet streets behind the convoy, and into the suburbs. The Russians would like to kill him. Oleksandr Kamyshin is sure of this. So the 37-year-old chairman of Ukraine's railway network constantly changes his travel plans. Never stay in one place too long. Never have a routine that the Russians can discover. ""We have to be faster than those people who try to track us,"" he tells me. The railway is the country's biggest employer with 231,000 staff across 233,000 square miles (603,470 sq km) of territory - Ukraine is the second-largest country in Europe. So far Mr Kamyshin estimates his staff have helped to move 2.5 million people to safety. But the vast operation has come at a cost. Schedules have to be constantly updated because of Russian attacks. Since Vladimir Putin's invasion began, 33 railway staff have been killed. ""They hit our track daily. They hit the stations. Our people risk their lives. They go under shelling. They keep saving people,"" says Mr Kamyshin. When we first meet, he is sitting at a long table with his close advisors, studying a map of the national rail network. Police guard the entrance to the room. Mr Kamyshin keeps his guards and advisors close There are constant phone calls. ""Thank you for your support. But I also have a request,"" he says to one caller. ""Please help us build trade between Ukraine and Poland."" He hangs up and smiles. ""That was the Polish minister for infrastructure,"" he says. Mr Kamyshin wants to set up a joint venture with Poland to send Ukrainian exports west. Before joining the railways Mr Kamyshin was a financier but he is now one of the most important men in the country. In a few weeks he has gone from reforming the rail sector to a wartime director of operations. ""All people in Ukraine were businesspeople, farmers and all other professions before the war started. Now all people in Ukraine are at war. All of us have started doing war,"" he says. His own life is a blur of rail journeys, stopping at one place to talk to local staff, at another to meet government officials, and constantly in contact with the senior leadership in Kyiv. Mr Kamyshin is convinced he is a target for Russian forces He hasn't seen his wife and two young sons since the war started nearly three weeks ago. Not only do the railways keep refugees moving, they also deliver tonnes of aid to the embattled areas of the country, transport troops to frontline cities, and continue to export whatever Ukraine can produce in these wartime conditions. A Russian blockade has closed the key ports in the south. Mr Kamyshin comes across as a man who is planning for a long campaign. ""Instead of seaports we go west,"" he explains. ""We have launched a programme to relocate production from east to west. So we can move people, ideas, plans, maybe machinery to launch new production in the west."" It is an ambitious project and could be essential to the country's economic survival. However, Mr Kamyshin believes the West needs to do more than supply weapons and humanitarian aid. Since Russia's invasion began, thousands of people have been packing train platforms daily to travel to safer locations He wants the Nato military alliance to enforce a no-fly zone. It is a mantra repeated by government officials at nearly every opportunity - however unlikely the prospect of it happening. ""This war will be won by Ukraine anyway. Now the only thing that needs to happen is the closing of the sky by the West."" My last sight of Mr Kamyshin is close to midnight at a suburban rail depot. He is walking along the side of the tracks in darkness until the spotlight of the approaching train briefly illuminates his small group. The train pulls alongside and a stewardess welcomes him on board. I cannot say where his train is heading, but the night ahead will be filled with calls and discussions. There will be a few hours of sleep, perhaps, and constant checking of where the Russians have recently attacked. ""We will keep repairing the tracks once the firing stops,"" he says before leaving. ""We will keep the trains running as long as we can. There is no other option for us.""

"Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton in 2016 Russia's foreign ministry says it has imposed sanctions on US President Joe Biden and 12 other US officials. The list includes Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, press secretary Jen Psaki and other members of the administration. But it also includes two surprises: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Mr Biden's son Hunter. The measures block their entry into Russia and freeze any assets held in the country. However, the ministry has said the sanctions will not impede necessary high-level contacts for the affected individuals. Other names on the list are: Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan Deputy National Security Adviser Daleep Singh US Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator Samantha Power Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo President of the Export-Import Bank of the US Reta Jo Lewis The ministry has said it is applying sanctions ""on the basis of reciprocity"". Russia is now the most sanctioned country in the world. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Russia's ex-president targeted in new UK sanctions How sanctions have changed everyday life in Russia Western countries have already sanctioned top Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov. On Tuesday, the US announced sanctions on 11 Russian defence leaders and signalled that it could levy sanctions against Alexander Lukashenko, the President of Moscow-allied Belarus. Earlier, the UK slapped sanctions on another 370 Russian individuals, including former Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev. President Biden is due to travel to Europe next week to attend an emergency Nato summit in Brussels where he will assert Washington's ""iron-clad"" backing to its allies, the White House said on Tuesday. Hillary Clinton can abandon dreams she may have had of buying a vacation dacha in Sochi. Any Joe Biden post-presidency plans for starting a business in Moscow will have to be shelved. Jokes aside, the Russian ""stop"" order placed on the US President, senior White House staff and - interestingly - a former secretary of state who has not held public office in nine years is a symbolic but not particularly consequential reprisal for the staggering sanctions the US and allies have imposed on Russia. It's not like any of the listed Americans had significant financial interests in Russia. The move is a reflection, however, of the growing chasm between the US and Russia in the wake of the latter's invasion of Ukraine. Prohibiting the top American diplomat, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, from even setting foot on Russian soil suggests relations between the two nations are at a post-Cold War nadir. That has very real consequences outside of the Ukrainian conflict, as the US and Russia had hoped to co-operate on Iranian nuclear negotiations, counterterrorism, global warming and other pressing international issues. Chances of that happening now are increasingly dim. What are the sanctions on Russia and are they working?

"There were protests from the Manchester United players that the referee went to blow his whistle but then didn't in the build-up to the Atletico Madrid goal Manchester United's Champions League campaign ended in the disappointment of defeat by Atletico Madrid at Old Trafford to leave them with only a Premier League top-four place to fight for this season. Ralf Rangnick's side were not short on endeavour but lacked the guile to break down Atletico's trademark resilience as Renan Lodi's far-post header four minutes before half-time sent the Spanish champions into the last eight. United dominated possession for large portions of the second half but, as they have done so often, Atletico built a wall of defensive resistance - and when they did threaten, goalkeeper Jan Oblak provided the final barrier. He saved brilliantly from Raphael Varane's header in front of the Stretford End as United were left to fight for a place in next season's Champions League in the final weeks of the domestic season. Follow all the reaction from Old Trafford here This video can not be played Rangnick questions 'some curious refereeing decisions' after Champions League exit Manchester United went the same way as so many teams before them who have suffered at the hands of this remarkably durable Atletico machine assembled by Diego Simeone. United showed plenty of effort and had Old Trafford rocking with a high-intensity start but they simply ran out of ideas and inspiration the longer the game went on - Atletico digging in and defending with the sort of relish they have shown many times over the years. Cristiano Ronaldo produced a couple of classic early touches but he was a peripheral figure long before the end, with Rangnick and United's desperation illustrated when struggling captain Harry Maguire was replaced by veteran Juan Mata. United were also infuriated by the erratic refereeing of Slovenian official Slavko Vincic, particularly when they felt Anthony Elanga had been fouled moments before Lodi arrived unmarked to head home Antoine Griezmann's cross at the far post. Over the two legs, however, United have simply not been good enough to progress and now face an uphill task to reach the Premier League's top four, as they lie fifth behind Arsenal having played three games more. At the final whistle, Atletico coach Simeone showed a neat turn of pace to turn left and sprint off towards an infuriated Stretford End, straight down the tunnel without a backwards glance, pelted with objects and drinks as he disappeared from view. Behind him, Manchester United players and fans were left with a familiar feeling of having the rug pulled out from under them by Simeone - and by the Atletico side he has drilled so fiercely and with such discipline. Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp felt exactly the same after Atletico won at Anfield at this same stage two years ago and while La Liga's champions may not be among the Champions League favourites, no-one will particularly relish being paired with them. They have players who can provide class in attack and in Oblak they possess one of the world's great goalkeepers.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Marina Ovsyannikova speaks to reporters about the reasons for her live TV protest A Russian journalist has been fined and released after she protested against the war in Ukraine on a live TV news programme and made an anti-war video. Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at state-controlled Channel 1, was detained after she ran on to the set on Monday holding a sign saying ""no war"". She said she had been questioned for 14 hours and not slept for two days, and was not given access to legal help. The 30,000 rouble (Â£214; $280) fine relates to her video message. She had pleaded not guilty to the charge of organising an unauthorised public event. In the video, she called on the Russian people to protest against the war, saying only they have the power to ""stop all this madness"". ""Don't be afraid of anything. They can't imprison us all,"" she said. It is not clear if she will face separate charges relating to her protest on live TV, and there had been fears she would be prosecuted under a more serious, new criminal law that bans calling Russia's military action in Ukraine an ""invasion"" or spreading ""fake news"" about the conflict. After the court hearing Ms Ovsyannikova told reporters that she needed to rest after two days without sleep. ""The interrogation lasted for more than 14 hours, I wasn't allowed to get in touch with my family or friends, I was denied access to a lawyer,"" she said. She also stressed that she came up with the idea of the protest alone. ""It was my anti-war decision. I made this decision by myself because I don't like Russia starting this invasion. It was really terrible,"" she said in English as she left the courthouse. Lawyers were unable to locate Ms Ovsyannikova for several hours after she was detained on Monday evening. Her whereabouts were unknown until an image circulated on Russian media which showed her in court with lawyer Anton Gashinsky. Marina Ovsyannikova appeared in court on Tuesday with lawyer Anton Gashinsky Images of Ms Ovsyannikova's protest were quickly shared across the world after she ran on to the set of one of Russia's most-watched news programmes, Vremya, holding a sign reading ""No war, stop the war, don't believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here."" She could also be heard repeating the words ""no war, stop the war"". The placard was clearly visible for a few seconds before the programme cut away from the live broadcast to a pre-recorded report. Before the incident she recorded a video in which she said she was ashamed to work for what she called Kremlin propaganda. ""I'm ashamed that I allowed myself to tell lies from the television screen. Ashamed that I allowed Russians to be turned into zombies,"" she explained. ""We just silently watched this inhumane regime."" This video can not be played Watch: Anti-war demonstrator disrupts Russia's state TV news Ms Ovsyannikova, who said her father was Ukrainian, said the whole world had turned against Russia. ""The next 10 generations won't be able to clean themselves from the shame of this fratricidal war."" Her colleagues at Channel 1 were reportedly surprised by her actions. Onetold the Faridaily blog,external- run by former BBC Russian Service journalist Farida Rustamova - that Ms Ovsyannikova, who has two children, had never discussed politics, but spoke ""mostly about children, dogs and the house"". From the moment her identity became known, Ms Ovsyannikova received dozens of comments on her Facebook page in Ukrainian, Russian and English, thanking her for her actions. Ukraine's President Zelensky also praised her for ""telling the truth"". French President Emmanuel Macron said France would launch an effort to offer her protection, either at the embassy or through asylum, and said he would discuss it in his next conversation with President Putin. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called her actions an act of ""hooliganism"".

It is also unusual for employees of state-controlled news organisations to express an opinion that differs from the official Kremlin position. But since the war in Ukraine began, at least three journalists have resigned from top Russian TV channels: Zhanna Agalakova from Channel 1, and Lilia Gildeyeva and Vadim Glusker from NTV. State-controlled Russian media refer to the war as a ""special military operation"" and paint Ukraine as the aggressor, describing Ukraine's elected government as neo-Nazis. Several of the remaining independent media outlets in Russia have stopped broadcasting or publishing after pressure from the authorities, including the radio station Echo of Moscow, and TV Rain - an online TV channel.

"The Slovenian, Polish and Czech prime ministers, together with Poland's ruling party leader, took the long journey from Warsaw Ukraine has praised the courage of three European leaders who made a long, hazardous journey by rail from Poland to Kyiv in a show of support as the city came under further Russian attack. The prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday evening as a curfew began in Kyiv. Afterwards, the Czech leader told Ukrainians that they were ""not alone"". They are the first Western leaders to visit Ukraine since Russia invaded. ""We admire your brave fight,"" Petr Fialawrote in a tweet,external. ""We know that you're also fighting for our lives. You're not alone, our countries stand by your side."" ""Your visit is a powerful expression of support for Ukraine,"" Mr Zelensky is quoted as telling the group. The European leaders held a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv On Wednesday, Poland's Mateusz Morawieckitweeted,externalthat Ukraine was reminding Europe what courage was. It was time for ""sluggish and decayed"" Europe to reawaken and ""break through her wall of indifference and give Ukraine hope"", he said. The leaders had arrived back in Poland on Wednesday morning, a Polish government spokesperson said. Also on the trip was Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of Poland's ruling party, and he called for the creation of a Nato or international peacekeeping mission that ""will also be able to defend itself and operate in Ukraine"". However, one of his advisers later clarified that Mr Kaczynski had not been calling for Nato to get involved militarily. ""Here the position is unchanged. Neither Poland nor Nato are taking, or will take part, in the war,"" Michal Dworczyk told Polish Radio. Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal wrote on Twitter that ""devastating"" sanctions against Russia had been discussed during the meeting in Kyiv, including the ""recognition of Russia as a sponsor of terrorism"". As the talks took place on Tuesday evening, loud explosions could be heard from fighting on the western edge of the capital city. The European Union said the politicians were not carrying any particular mandate, but that leaders in Brussels were aware of the trip, as it was mentioned during an informal EU summit in Versailles, France, last week. Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz admitted the trip was risky, but said it was ""worth taking for the sake of values"". He said they had told the Russians the visit was taking place. All three leaders on the trip to Kyiv have been vocal supporters of Ukraine in recent weeks. Slovenia's prime minister said last week that the EU should send a strong message that Ukraine will eventually be granted membership. Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said the visit was a strong and important gesture to show solidarity with Ukraine. ""Ukraine's security is European security; therefore we need to do everything possible to help them survive this sickening barbaric Russian attack,"" he told the BBC. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met the European leaders in Kyiv The leaders decided to travel by train because flying by Polish military jet could have been viewed by Russia as dangerously provocative, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler reports. Ukraine's president has repeatedly called on Nato to impose a no-fly zone over his country's airspace, but Nato has refused. Mr Zelensky said Ukrainians now understood they could not join Nato: ""We have heard for years that the doors were open, but we also heard that we could not join. It's a truth and it must be recognised. I am glad that our people are beginning to understand this and rely on themselves and our partners who help us.""

"Over 1.7m Ukrainian refugees have fled to Poland since Russia's invasion began With Russia's war in Ukraine raging on its doorstep, Poland is holding its breath. It feels vulnerable on two fronts as the number of refugees coming into the country swells and a military base near its border with Ukraine was attacked. As a first responder in one of Europe's biggest refugee crises since World War Two, over 1.7m Ukrainians have chosen to flee to Poland, according to theUN's latest figures,external. Some move on, but most choose to stay because of cultural, linguistic or family ties. As a result, population figures have swollen by 15% in the Polish capital Warsaw over the past two weeks. In terms of security, alarm bells are also ringing. Over the weekend, Russia bombed a Ukrainian military base in Yavoriv, just 16 km (10 miles) from the Polish border. Poland warned the West for years that Russia planned to redress the balance of power in Europe in its favour. Polish leaders were dismissed as alarmists at the time. But no longer. ON THE GROUND:Poland feels the strain of Ukraine's refugees NEAR THE BORDER:'Sky turned red' as missiles hit Lviv military base ANALYSIS:How many refugees have fled Ukraine and where are they going? On Monday, the Polish Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said Ukrainian soldiers needed and deserved Western support. They were fighting not only for their own freedom, he insisted, but also the freedom of their Eastern European neighbours. He also described Russian President Vladimir Putin's onslaught in Ukraine as a calculated part of his geopolitical plan. Once side-lined by some in Nato as a post-communist Russophobe, Poland has now become a linchpin in the eastern flank of the alliance. The strongest part of the chain now linking the West with Ukraine. Most of the weapons convoys sent by the West to help the Ukrainian military travel through Poland. On Saturday, Moscow declared those convoys ""legitimate military targets"" inside Ukraine. But do Poles believe the Kremlin would attack their country - a member of the European Union - and, more significantly in this case, Nato? The Western defence alliance's charter says an attack against one of its nations will be viewed as an attack against all. That would mean a face-off between two global nuclear powers - Russia and the US - something the West is keen to avoid. Moscow too, it hopes. Warsaw's mayor Rafal Trzaskowski has called for more international assistance (file photo) Warsaw's mayor and high profile political figure, Rafal Trzaskowski, told me his country wasn't panicking, but that people were beginning to ask questions - especially after Russia's missile strike so close to the Polish border, and Nato's talk of Russia possibly planning chemical attacks. Something urgent needs to be done about the refugee crisis too, the mayor insisted. He said one of President Putin's goals was to divide, and therefore weaken, the West. ""Putin is happy to use fake news, disinformation campaigns or a refugee crisis,"" Mr Trzaskowski argued, warning that, ""if refugee numbers keep rising, the system in Poland will crash."" He's called for more international assistance - from the European Union and United Nations - in terms of practical help, financial aid and housing refugees in other countries. Brussels says Ukrainians are welcome across the bloc. It has pledged funds to Poland too. But the authorities here say it's not enough. The European Commission is coy about mentioning exact figures. Mayor Trzaskowski has also appealed to the UK to ""get rid of its red tape"" and allow Ukrainian refugees more easily into Britain. Arguably, Poland's painful past makes it a lot more anxious about the future. The arrival of Ukrainian refugees here has evoked national memories of war, followed by decades of Soviet occupation. This week in Warsaw, I met Polish pensioner Kristina and her friends, busy making Ukrainian flag solidarity ribbons. ""I'm too poor to give money and too old to hold a gun,"" Kristina explained, ""so I do what I can for the refugees. Partly, because I fear for my own tomorrow.""

"Scotland's rules on face coverings in shops and on public transport will remain in place until April due to a rise in cases of Covid-19. All other restrictions on businesses and services are to move from legal requirement to guidance from 21 March. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it would be ""prudent"" to keep mask rules in place due to a spike in cases. These will be reviewed again in two weeks, and are likely to be converted to guidance by 4 April. Ms Sturgeon said a sharp rise in infections was putting ""significant pressure on hospital capacity"", but that vaccines were still giving people good protection. She also told MSPs that mass testing will be wound down in April, with routine testing and contact tracing to end by May. Omicron sub-variant driving Covid rise in Scotland What are the UK's Living with Covid plans? When will free Covid tests end? The average number of new cases reported each day in Scotland is more than 12,000, up from an average of 6,900 per day three weeks ago. There has also been a rise in the number of people in hospital with Covid-19, from 1,060 three weeks ago to 1,996 today. Ms Sturgeon said the BA.2 sub-variant of Omicron was now the dominant strain of the virus in Scotland, accounting for more than 80% of cases - adding that while it spreads much more quickly, there is no evidence it causes more severe illness than previous variants. This video can not be played The laws on wearing face coverings will not be lifted Under thegovernment's strategic framework for managing the virus,external, remaining legal restrictions - including mask-wearing and the need for businesses to record customer contact details and follow other guidance - were to be lifted on 21 March. The rules for businesses will be dropped as planned, but Ms Sturgeon said she needed to ""ask everyone to be patient for a little while longer on face coverings"". She said: ""I know this will be disappointing for businesses and service providers such as day care services. ""However, ensuring continued widespread use of face coverings will provide some additional protection - particularly for the most vulnerable - at a time when the risk of infection is very high, and it may help us get over this spike more quickly."" The first minister stressed that the lifting of other measures marked ""steady progress back to normal life and a more sustainable way of managing this virus"". Testing in England is being wound down by the end of March, but Ms Sturgeon said there would be no change in Scotland until Easter. Asymptomatic people will still be advised to test regularly until 18 April - with tests free of charge - and people with symptoms should continue to get a PCR test until the end of that month. However, the population-wide testing and contact tracing system will come close at the end of April, with people with symptoms advised to stay at home. From May onwards, testing will be used on a targeted basis to monitor levels of the virus in society and to look out for new variants. The Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland said changes were slower than many would like, adding that ""the impression that Scotland has a first-in, last-out approach to Covid restrictions frustrates many"". The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the announcement about face coverings was a ""bitter disappointment"". Chief executive Dr Liz Cameron said: ""Businesses cannot continue to operate with the start-stop lever being pulled just weeks apart."" And the Scottish Licensed Trade Association said the move will confuse visitors from England, where face coverings are no longer required by law. It has become almost second nature - grab your mask alongside your keys as you dash out the front door. And in Scotland, unlike any other part of the UK, you will be doing it for a while longer. Many in public health think this is not a big ask, a sensible move at a time when community transmission is so high. It is a very visible reminder that Covid has not gone away, and they point to a growing body of research that suggests community mask wearing can offer some protection against infection spread. However, others argue the evidence is not compelling and the reality is people don't wear masks in the places where they would make the most difference, at home with family and friends. After all, Scotland is experiencing a surge in cases despite such measures being in place. The Scottish Conservatives said the retention of the mask rules was ""a blow for households and businesses"". Leader Douglas Ross urged Ms Sturgeon to trust people to manage their own risks, adding: ""We can't get complacent with Covid, but we need to move forward - we can't stay stuck with Covid rules forever."" Labour's deputy leader Jackie Baillie said hospitals were ""overwhelmed"" with staff absences rising, and called for more information about testing for health workers. Ms Sturgeon said health and care staff would continue to test twice weekly after the wider programme ends, and that the system would focus on high-risk settings like hospitals and care homes. Meanwhile Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said it was disheartening that ""despite the extra sacrifices that have been made in Scotland, our infection rates are still so stubbornly high"". Health Secretary Humza Yousaf later told BBC Radio Scotland'sDrivetimehe expects Covid hospital occupancy levels to reach record levels in the next few days. He also defended the extension of the face covering rules and described the evidence for their effectiveness as ""indisputable"". Asked if he was concerned about another wave of infections given the current case numbers, Mr Yousaf said he has been reassured by the success of the vaccination programme. He told the programme: ""If you have not had your first, second or indeed your booster dose then please get it because that is clearly and significantly been the difference in terms of severity of illness. ""If we had these case numbers that we are seeing today, and we have seen over the last number of weeks, without a vaccine we would be frankly in lockdown. ""Vaccines are the game changer.""

"Oleksandr Kamyshin, 37, says Ukraine's railway staff have helped an estimated 2.5 million people to reach safety There is a last-minute change of plan. He won't be leaving from the main station after all. The bodyguards move fast and we follow, racing along the quiet streets behind the convoy, and into the suburbs. The Russians would like to kill him. Oleksandr Kamyshin is sure of this. So the 37-year-old chairman of Ukraine's railway network constantly changes his travel plans. Never stay in one place too long. Never have a routine that the Russians can discover. ""We have to be faster than those people who try to track us,"" he tells me. The railway is the country's biggest employer with 231,000 staff across 233,000 square miles (603,470 sq km) of territory - Ukraine is the second-largest country in Europe. So far Mr Kamyshin estimates his staff have helped to move 2.5 million people to safety. But the vast operation has come at a cost. Schedules have to be constantly updated because of Russian attacks. Since Vladimir Putin's invasion began, 33 railway staff have been killed. ""They hit our track daily. They hit the stations. Our people risk their lives. They go under shelling. They keep saving people,"" says Mr Kamyshin. When we first meet, he is sitting at a long table with his close advisors, studying a map of the national rail network. Police guard the entrance to the room. Mr Kamyshin keeps his guards and advisors close There are constant phone calls. ""Thank you for your support. But I also have a request,"" he says to one caller. ""Please help us build trade between Ukraine and Poland."" He hangs up and smiles. ""That was the Polish minister for infrastructure,"" he says. Mr Kamyshin wants to set up a joint venture with Poland to send Ukrainian exports west. Before joining the railways Mr Kamyshin was a financier but he is now one of the most important men in the country. In a few weeks he has gone from reforming the rail sector to a wartime director of operations. ""All people in Ukraine were businesspeople, farmers and all other professions before the war started. Now all people in Ukraine are at war. All of us have started doing war,"" he says. His own life is a blur of rail journeys, stopping at one place to talk to local staff, at another to meet government officials, and constantly in contact with the senior leadership in Kyiv. Mr Kamyshin is convinced he is a target for Russian forces He hasn't seen his wife and two young sons since the war started nearly three weeks ago. Not only do the railways keep refugees moving, they also deliver tonnes of aid to the embattled areas of the country, transport troops to frontline cities, and continue to export whatever Ukraine can produce in these wartime conditions. A Russian blockade has closed the key ports in the south. Mr Kamyshin comes across as a man who is planning for a long campaign. ""Instead of seaports we go west,"" he explains. ""We have launched a programme to relocate production from east to west. So we can move people, ideas, plans, maybe machinery to launch new production in the west."" It is an ambitious project and could be essential to the country's economic survival. However, Mr Kamyshin believes the West needs to do more than supply weapons and humanitarian aid. Since Russia's invasion began, thousands of people have been packing train platforms daily to travel to safer locations He wants the Nato military alliance to enforce a no-fly zone. It is a mantra repeated by government officials at nearly every opportunity - however unlikely the prospect of it happening. ""This war will be won by Ukraine anyway. Now the only thing that needs to happen is the closing of the sky by the West."" My last sight of Mr Kamyshin is close to midnight at a suburban rail depot. He is walking along the side of the tracks in darkness until the spotlight of the approaching train briefly illuminates his small group. The train pulls alongside and a stewardess welcomes him on board. I cannot say where his train is heading, but the night ahead will be filled with calls and discussions. There will be a few hours of sleep, perhaps, and constant checking of where the Russians have recently attacked. ""We will keep repairing the tracks once the firing stops,"" he says before leaving. ""We will keep the trains running as long as we can. There is no other option for us.""

"Videos of actors from a Ukrainian film shot in 2020 have gone viral on Facebook and TikTok - with people falsely claiming that attacks in the country are being 'staged' Russia's invasion of Ukraine has triggered a wave of falsehoods on social media and the airwaves. In a new Radio 4 podcast series, War on Truth, our specialist reporter follows the stories of people caught up by misinformation - and gives some tips about how to avoid it. Since the war began, my inbox has been flooded with messages from people telling me about misleading videos on their social media feeds and troll accounts promoting conspiracy theories. And it's not just on social media - it's also state-sponsored propaganda pushing false claims on air and beyond. In anew podcast series, I'll be reporting on the information battle being waged over Ukraine - and hearing from the ordinary people sucked into it. How can you spot bad information - and stop its spread? There are very real, distressing videos being shared of what's happening on the ground in Ukraine. But there is also footage from old conflicts going viral. Often people share it because they're shocked - or even trying to help. But it's just adding to the chaos for those in the country. This footage was portrayed as being from the conflict in Ukraine - but was actually shot in Syria The best way to figure out if a video is real or not is to look for clues - like the weather, the road signs, the languages people are speaking. Videos of Russia's invasion of Crimea and from the blast in Beirut in 2020 have been shared widely, pretending to be from the current conflict. Using Google Maps, you can figure out if the video is really from where it claims to be. And by using reverse image searches - available from a number of websites - you can see if that same video or image has been shared online before. That's a tell tale sign that it's been recycled from a previous event. Newsround: How to tell what's fake and what's real False claims the war is a hoax go viral It's important to examine who shared a post in the first place. Can you verify who they are - and are they a trusted source? Those who have posted misleading videos are sometimes looking for likes and shares. It's a distressing time - and posts about what's happening in Ukraine are likely to catch on. Others are sharing false claims to push certain narratives - to boost their political agendas or to sow doubt and confusion. Several young people in the country have told me about pro-Russia accounts which argue with Ukrainians, suggesting without any proof that the war is ""staged"" or Ukraine is bombing its own territory. Ukraine invasion: Misleading claims continue to go viral How you can stop bad information from going viral How to verify videos One man I interviewed explained to me that even pictures of his home near Kyiv totally destroyed by bombs couldn't convince these trolls. Many of them have few or no followers, have taken their profile image from other places online and use generic usernames. They also only started to post after the invasion began. It's hard to tell who ultimately is running these accounts. Other accounts that have promoted false claims about the Covid pandemic have turned their attention to sharing false conspiracy theories about the war. The same false tropes - for instance that those injured by bombing are ""actors"" - have come up again and again, and have even beenpushed by Russian diplomats. LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby SANCTIONS:Impact on everyday lives in Russia EXIT:Russia faces brain drain as thousands flee abroad RECRUITS:Ukraine's teenage soldiers IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict A lot of what's on social media about the war is frightening. It triggers a reaction - and that means people sometimes share posts before checking if they're real. Disinformation spreads because it plays on our emotions and our biases. Steven Seagal is not fighting in the war - this is fake tweet made to look like it was sent out by CNN It's not just about negative emotions - sometimes hopeful stories can also go viral. While they may boost morale, they contribute to the chaos online and make it harder to figure out what's actually happening. The information war is about more than social media. It's a battle fought by governments in both Ukraine and Russia, which are pushing out propaganda. Question why a particular source might be saying something - and whether it's backed up by evidence.

"Roman Abramovich was pictured at a VIP lounge in Ben Gurion international airport in Lod near Tel Aviv A private jet linked to sanctioned billionaire Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich has landed in Moscow. The jet arrived in Moscow on Tuesday morning after taking off from Israel and stopping in Istanbul, flight tracking website FlightRadar24 said. Mr Abramovich was seen in a VIP lounge at the airport in Israel, though it is not known if he boarded the flight. The Russian was amongseven oligarchs sanctioned by the UK governmentlast week in response to the Ukraine war. Mr Abramovich, 55, is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he has denied. Secret paper highlights corrupt Abramovich deals Roman Abramovich sanctioned by UK Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions? Reuters news agency said it had obtained a photograph showing Mr Abramovich in a VIP lounge in Ben Gurion Airport in Lod near Tel Aviv on Monday. It is not known whether he boarded the jet at any stage on its journey from Israel to Istanbul and subsequently from Istanbul to Moscow. Mr Abramovich has Israeli and Portuguese citizenship. A rabbi who helped him gain citizenship in Portugal was detained on Thursday as part of aninvestigation into how that citizenship was granted. Meanwhile, sources have told the BBC that the European Union is set to include Mr Abramovich on its expanded list of oligarchs who are subject to EU asset freezes. Roman Abramovich and Vladimir Putin pictured together at an event in Russia in 2016 Under UK sanctions, Mr Abramovich and the other six oligarchs - including billionaires Igor Sechin and Oleg Deripaska - have been banned from entering or remaining in the UK. Some of his assets were frozen, including Chelsea FC, though the club has been allowed to continue operating under a special licence granted by the UK government. Mr Abramovich announced he was selling the club earlier this month, before the sanctions against him were introduced. He is also believed to own a number of properties in the UK, including a 15-bedroom mansion at Kensington Palace Gardens in west London, reportedly valued at more than Â£150m. His purchase of Chelsea FC in 2003 transformed the club's fortunes, turning them into a side that won every major trophy in club football. It also raised the bar for the level of investment required to compete at the top of the Premier League. Mr Abramovich made his money in the 1990s during Boris Yeltsin's presidency of Russia. This week aBBC Panorama investigationsaid it had uncovered new evidence about the ""corrupt"" deals that made his fortune. The Chelsea owner made billions after buying an oil company from the Russian government in what BBC Panorama said was a rigged auction in 1995. Mr Abramovich paid around $250m (Â£190m) for Sibneft, before later selling it back to the Russian government for $13bn in 2005. His lawyers say there is no basis for alleging he has amassed very substantial wealth through criminality.

"Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev are among the latest people to be sanctioned by the UK over the war in Ukraine The UK has announced 370 more sanctions, with Russia's former president one of those targeted, in its latest response to the war in Ukraine. Dmitry Medvedev and President Vladimir Putin's spokesman are among those to be hit with asset freezes and travel bans. Earlier, the UK hit Russia with trade restrictions, including an additional 35% tariff on vodka. The move comes after the passage of new legislation to speed up and harden UK sanctions. The government fast-tracked the Economic Crime Act through Parliament after criticism that UK had been too slow to target Russians with links to President Putin. The legislation allows the UK to sanction those who have had their assets frozen by the EU, US or Canada, and take action to stop wealthy Russians using London for money laundering. Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee of MPs, which oversees the UK's intelligence community, said it hoped the new legislation was ""at least the first step"" in helping authorities ensure the UK is ""no longer a safe haven for the oligarchy and their enablers"". But a statement from the committee said it had made it clear two years agoin its report on Russian interference in British politicsthat the UK had been ""welcoming Russian money for many years with few questions - if any - being asked about the provenance of this considerable wealth"", and urgent action had been needed then. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions? How sanctions have changed everyday life in Russia Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu were among the other high-profile allies of President Putin to be sanctioned by the UK. Others include Mr Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov and Russian Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, who the UK government called ""Russian propagandists"". Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the UK was ""going further and faster than ever in hitting those closest to Putin"". ""We are holding them to account for their complicity in Russia's crimes in Ukraine,"" she said. ""Working closely with our allies, we will keep increasing the pressure on Putin and cut off funding for the Russian war machine."" Dmitry Medvedev (L) and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu (R) are two of President Putin's closest allies A growing number of Russians have been sanctioned by the UK and its western allies since President Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been issuing increasingly frank pleas for stronger sanctions and western military intervention as Russian shelling of Ukrainian cities exact an ever-higher death toll. In a video call with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Mr Zelensky said ""we can still stop the Russian war machine"" and it was vital to do so because otherwise ""they will come for you"". Last week, the UK imposed asset freezes and travel bans onChelsea FC owner Roman Abramovichand386 Russian MPswho voted to recognise two rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine as independent. A further wave of sanctions was announced on Tuesday morning,externalin co-ordination with the European Union. They related to trade with Russia and included a 35% import tariff hike on Russian vodka and hundreds of other goods worth Â£900m. The latest package of UK sanctions was targeted at individuals and organisations with links to President Putin's administration. Some of them had already been sanctioned by western allies, among them Mr Mishustin and Mr Peskov, described by the US as ""a top purveyor of Putin's propaganda"". The UK was quicker to sanction others such as Mr Abramovich,who was blacklisted by the EU on Tuesday,externaland accused of ""benefitting from Russian decision-makers"" responsible for destabilising Ukraine. The UK government called President Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, a ""propagandist"" A prominent name on the UK's latest list of sanctioned individuals was Mr Medvedev. Currently deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia since 2020, Mr Medvedev served as president from 2008 to 2012 and as prime minister from 2012 to 2020. Once regarded as more liberal than President Putin, Mr Medvedev warned western nations against sanctionsin a tweet,externalearlier this month. Do not forget, he wrote, ""that in human history, economic wars quite often turned into real ones"". The UK government has been accused of moving too slowly on sanctions against Russians with links to President Putin. Opposition parties were worried a delay in imposing them meant some could move many of their assets out of the UK before they were frozen. The Economic Crime Act received royal assent in the early hours of Tuesday morning. It has given ministers the power to go further, and quickly sanction those who had been targeted already by the EU and the US. Ministers had expressed frustration about the process for sanctioning individuals under previous legislation. The Economic Crime Act should remove some of the difficulties around building legal cases to justify sanctions under UK law. The UK government also said Russian oligarchs with a combined estimated worth of more than Â£100bn were added to its sanctions list. On the list was billionaireMikhail Fridman, founder of Alfa Bank, the largest private bank in Russia. He lives in London and has business interests in the UK. At a London press conference on 1 March, he said while the Ukraine war was a ""huge tragedy"", sanctioning oligarchs would not sway President Putin. Some of the other oligarchs sanctioned by the UK included: German Khan, a business partner of Mr Fridman in Alfa Bank, with an estimated net worth of Â£7.8bn Petr Aven, a former president of Alfa Bank, with an estimated net worth of Â£4bn Alexey Mordaschov, a majority shareholder in steel company Severstal, with an estimated net worth of Â£22.4bn Andrey Melnichenko, the founder of EuroChem Group, with an estimated net worth of Â£13.7bn For Labour, shadow international trade secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""Urgent sanctions have been needed so that Putin and his inner circle cannot live a Mayfair lifestyle in Moscow while committing atrocities in Ukraine.

"Motoring groups have called for fuel prices to fall as the cost of crude oil fell to its lowest level for two weeks. The price of Brent crude - the global benchmark for prices - dropped below $100 a barrel for the first time since the start of March. The RAC has said it is ""vital"" that fuel retailers start passing on falling wholesale prices to consumers. Petrol prices hit another record high on Monday, meaning it costs more than Â£90 to fill a family car, the RAC said. The average price of a litre of petrol rose to 163.71p on Monday, and diesel also hit a fresh record of 173.68p. Oil prices soared after Russia invaded Ukraine, with the price of Brent crude oil hitting a near 14-year high at one point. But in the past few days, the price of oil has dropped due to a number of factors, including hopes of progress in ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine, and also expectations that demand from China will ease as Covid cases there surge. Brent crude fell to about $98 a barrel on Tuesday before recovering some ground. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said that although petrol prices were at record highs, drivers ""should be encouraged"" by the fall in oil and wholesale prices. ""It's now vital that the biggest retailers who buy fuel most often start to reflect these reductions at the pumps to give drivers a much-needed break from the pain of constantly rising prices,"" he added. How has Ukraine conflict affected petrol prices? Petrol prices set to ease after hitting fresh highs Fuel price jump will hit food bills, industry says The AA said that the wholesale price of petrol has plummeted by 12.8p a litre since Wednesday. Luke Bosdet from the AA said: ""We should be seeing these record prices level off and start to fall away later this week. If not, MPs who are being deluged by complaints from angry constituents, need to be asking questions in Parliament. ""The government is under intense pressure from the cost of living crisis. They don't need the fuel trade to 'feather' a potential drop in pump prices."" Andrew Opie from the British Retail Consortium said supermarket retailers ""understand the cost pressures"" facing motorists, and will do ""everything they can to offer the best value-for-money across petrol forecourts, particularly if the price of oil falls"". The Petrol Retailers Association, which represents independent forecourts, said it would expect prices to fall when fresh stock is delivered. Gordon Balmer, the PRA's Executive Director, said forecourts bought from suppliers based on a price with one or two days' lag, or in some cases a week's lag.  This means it can take a few days for wholesale prices to filter through to the pumps. Oil prices are mainly determined by the price of crude oil and the dollar exchange rate, as agreements are made in dollars. Russia is the third largest oil exporter and some Western countries, for example the US and Canada, decided to halt imports from the country in response to Russia's actions. It means demand for oil from other producers has increased, leading to increased prices. The UK only imports about 6% of oil from Russia, so is not as dependent on Russia for the commodity supply as other European countries are and has said it plans to phase it out. It is, however, affected by the global shifts in price. On Monday, some analysts toldMPs on the Treasury Committeethat they expected the recent fall in the oil price to be temporary. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at financial services company Investec, said further restrictions on Russian oil exports would mean consumers ""need to get ready for what could be continued increases in fuel prices."" Dr Amrita Sen, director of research at Energy Aspects, told the committee that petrol prices could rise to around Â£2.40 a litre. And that diesel prices of ""Â£2.50 - even closer to Â£3"" were ""definitely in the realms of possibility"".

"Mandi Arnold with her two youngest children, Presley and Phoenix Two days before Russia invaded Ukraine, Mandi and John Arnold were curled up on the sofa of their home in Shropshire, streaming a film about the Chernobyl nuclear disaster on Netflix. It struck a nerve with the mum-of-four - she and John were both born in 1986, the same year as the disaster. So later that week when Mandi saw news of millions of Ukrainians fleeing their homes to escape Russian attacks, including in the Chernobyl area, she jumped at the chance to help. ""From the moment this all started to evolve, my heart just went straight out to them and I thought if I could help anyone I would do so without any reservations,"" she says. On Monday evening Mandi, 35, was among the almost 90,000 peopleto register their interest in a new visa schemeallowing people in the UK to host Ukrainian refugees in their own homes. Many of those who have signed up to help are doing so because their children have all grown up, left home and they've got some extra space. But Mandi's house is a pretty hectic place to be. She and John live with their sons, one-year-old Presley and four-year-old Phoenix, and Mandi's nine-year-old daughter, Amalia - not to mention pet cat Nala and Oakley the Labrador. Mandi's 19-year-old daughter, who's studying in Scotland, is also ""in and out"" of the house. ""It's quite a busy household anyway, it's constantly on the go,"" Mandi says. ""Adding more would just be more love, more memories."" How to sponsor Ukrainian refugees in UK homes How can Ukrainian refugees come to the UK? 89,000 sign up to UK's refugee site The family will free up one of the bedrooms for refugees to live in. They'll bring in an old single bed from the garage and have space for a child as well as an adult, if needed. Mandi and John's sons aren't quite old enough to understand that they'll be sharing their home with strangers in the near future, but Mandi has explained it to her daughter, Amalia. She's excited about meeting new people and will ""welcome anyone with open arms"", Mandi says. Under the newly-launched Homes for Ukraine scheme, UK households can offer a space for a refugee to live for at least six months. Each host household will be offered Â£350 a month, tax-free, as a ""thank you"" payment. They won't be expected to provide food and living expenses, but can choose to offer this. Mandi says her daughter Amalia (left) is excited to meet any refugees. Her younger brothers Presley (centre) and Phoenix will share a room to make more space Mandi fled an abusive relationship when she was younger, leaving her network of friends and family behind to start a new life. To begin with she had nowhere to call home, so lived in hotels for months. She and John scraped the money together from what he'd saved up from his business selling private number plates. Mandi says she knows fleeing a warzone is ""completely different"" to what she went through, but she can relate to the feeling of disconnect many Ukrainian refugees might have as they step foot on UK soil for the first time. ""I know the feeling of removing yourself from somewhere that you once called home, or once felt secure and safe,"" she says. ""I've been in times of struggle, I've been in situations where I really needed someone to help. To know that I've overcome that and got to where I am now, I know it's something that can be achieved and all it takes is time and love. And these people deserve that."" By moving Presley in with Phoenix, this room in the Arnold's home can be freed up for refugees Mandi says she thinks the whole family will benefit from taking in Ukrainian refugees. ""My kids, they've got all the love to give and we don't have much family. I'm not saying I'm going to grab [the refugees] and say 'you're my family now,' but they will be welcomed as a family member,"" she says. ""I've got a lot of love to give and it's the perfect opportunity to give it to someone who's in need."" ...from people across the UK who have hosted refugees or asylum seekers in their own homes in the past: 1. Be prepared for the mental impact.Lucy Stevens, near Colchester:It is likely people will be very traumatised. Our foster son was highly traumatised and required a lot of input with regards to mental health [which] also has an impact on your own family. 2. Find people who match your stage of life.Ruth Elphinston, Birmingham:If you've got young kids, bring in families with young kids. Or if your kids have left home, think about hosting a young adult. It makes things easier as they'll fit in with the way you're living your life already. 3.Lean on your community. Ruth:Ask neighbours and friends to help you out. They could maybe show your refugees around the area, offer them work, or have you all over for a meal. 4. Think about ground rules.Alison Baxter, Oxford.Sharing the sitting room, smoking and if you will cook for them are all points to consider. It's better to set down clear guidance because your guest is going to be anxious if you just say ""make yourself at home"". 5.Give them space.Robert and Margaret Spooner, Sheffield:Don't force your guests to speak about their experiences. Instead focus on finding common bonds, as well as giving them the chance to do small jobs or make food to take their mind off things. 6. Get the GP sorted early.Karina Litvack, London:I've never found access to the NHS to be a problem for the refugees I've helped, but you sometimes have to book an interpreter which takes longer. 7. Don't feel bad about saying no.Justyna Bell, Belfast:Have a conversation with your entire household before you decide for sure about taking someone in. Really open up and don't think it's not very humanitarian if you have some objections. How many Ukrainian refugees now have UK visas?

"The Cuadrilla fracking site is not currently producing gas Talks over whether the UK's only fracking wells should be permanently abandoned in three months' time have hit a deadlock. The two wells, in Lancashire, are due to be concreted over by 30 June on the orders of the Oil and Gas Authority. The company behind the wells, Cuadrilla, wants the government to restart fracking at the site to reduce the UK's reliance on Russian gas. The government says it can not overrule the regulator. But ministers have also said it ""doesn't necessarily make any sense to concrete over the wells"" at Little Plumpton, near Preston, which are currently not producing gas. They are urging the company to apply to the regulator for an extension to the 30 June deadline for sealing them up. Cuadrilla boss calls for fracking revival PM promises energy plan as Russia gas fears grow It is understood the Oil and Gas Authority wrote to Cuadrilla after meeting with ministers on Tuesday to ask them to confirm if they wanted an extension. In a statement, the regulator said it had told the company it would consider a request to extend for one year, and all parties were now considering the implications. But the BBC understands Cuadrilla is reluctant to apply for it because of the financial risk of extending their licence - without certainty about whether they will be decommissioned again in future. Fracking was banned in 2019 over concerns about earth tremors, and the Conservatives promised at that year's general election that they would not support it ""unless the science shows categorically that it can be done safely"". What is fracking and why is it controversial? That remains the government's official position. But, in light of soaring oil and gas prices - and the UK saying it wants to become more ""energy independent"" following Russia's invasion of Ukraine - agrowing number of Tory MPshave called on the government to reconsider whether the UK could use fracking to produce its own gas. No 10 suggested the prime minister had agreed to look at it again to ""see if it has a role to play"". There were huge protests at Preston New Road site before fracking was halted in 2019 Downing Street sources told the BBC that with oil prices so high, there were things ""we would have dismissed before that we can't dismiss now"". The government's goal is still to shift to renewable sources of energy, they added, but ""in the transition period we need to pump more oil and gas of our own"" and it was ""in that context we should look at fracking"". Cuadrilla's chief executive Francis Egan said that ministers recent ""rhetoric"" on fracking did not match their actions. ""On Wednesday morning, I read in the newspapers that the prime minister had decided that concreting up Britain's only two shale gas wells, in the midst of an energy crisis and given his own assessment that Europe is 'addicted' to Russian gas, would be a terrible idea,"" he said. ""Later on Wednesday, in the House of Commons, the business secretary said that 'it did not necessarily make any sense' to concrete over the wells."" He urged the government and the Oil and Gas Authority to ""formally withdraw their instruction to plug the wells"". ""If we are serious about energy security, as a very basic, first step we must not concrete up these wells, and then we need urgently to lift the shale gas moratorium and use these and additional wells to produce domestic shale gas,"" he added. The government says that while ministers can express a view on fracking they cannot tell an independent regulator like the Oil and Gas Authority what to do. Speaking in the House of Commons, Labour's shadow energy secretary, Ed Miliband, accused the government of being ""completely all over the place"" on its energy policy. But Energy Minister Greg Hands replied: ""He says we're confused, but the government's policy hasn't changed.""

"Retail chain Wilko has apologised for ""some miscommunication"" in which it told staff they could continue to work if they tested positive for Covid. In a memo,reported by The Mirror,external, the company said staff with the virus could continue to work in stores if they felt well enough to. Wilko confirmed the memo was sent out and the firm has since made a U-turn. ""When we get something wrong, we hold our hands up, admit it, and work to correct the situation,"" the firm said. Jerome Saint-Marc, Wilko chief executive, said he wanted to ""reassure all our customers and team members"" that the company's advice to staff with Covid symptoms or those who test positive was to stay at home and avoid contact with others. ""As throughout our 92 years on the High Street, the safety and wellbeing of our shoppers and teams is at the heart of our business and we're truly sorry for any understandable concerns our communications may have raised,"" he added. People with Covid in England are no longer legally required to self-isolate with all restrictions now removed, but it is still recommended. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, people are still asked to self-isolate after a positive test. What are the new self-isolation rules? Covid: 'I will still ask my staff to isolate' In Wilko's initial memo to staff, the company, which has 414 stores in the UK, said: ""If you test positive for Covid-19 and feel well you can continue to come to work, if you feel too unwell you can follow the absence policy."" The removal of all legal Covid rules has made the decision over whether to self-isolate or not an individual one. It has led to concern that lower-paid staff face the toughest choice when deciding to isolate or not, with up to two million workers not qualifying for sick pay due to the amount they earn. The Trades Union Congress has said people should not be forced into making a ""terrible choice"" over going into work with Covid or risking losing income by self-isolating at home.

"Nicola Sturgeon has announced that the laws on wearing face coverings in Scotland will not be lifted next week as had been planned The first minister said people will be required to continue wearing face masks on public transport and in shops until at least early April But social distancing rules in shops and other indoor public settings will be lifted next Monday, as will the requirement for venues to collect contact details for customers The first minister confirmed that contact tracing will finish at the end of April, as will free Covid testing - with test sites also to close The announcement comes against the backdrop of a surge in Covid cases in recent weeks A total of 1,996 people were in hospital with Covid yesterday - an increase of 191 on the previous day and not far from the peak seen in January of last year Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the country ""can't stay stuck with Covid rules forever"" BBC Scotland News  Andrew
McRae, the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotlandâs policy chair,
says the timeline to lift the remaining restrictions is slower than many would like. He adds the impression that Scotland has a ""first-in, last-out"" approach to Covid
restrictions frustrates many in business. At a time when debt-laden firms are facing dramatic fuel and utility hikes, operators are looking for ministers to inject confidence, not seed doubt. Andrew McRae, Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland Dr Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, says the decision to delay lifting all remaining
Covid restrictions will come as a ""bitter disappointment"" to her members. She adds: ""Further delay will put Scotlandâs recovery into reverse
gear again, create confusion, dent business confidence, putting the buffers on
economic growth. âBusinesses cannot continue to operate with the start-stop
lever being pulled just weeks apart, with no clear confirmation as to what the
triggers driving decision making are."" Dr Cameron also says businesses have invested millions to keep their customers and staff safe throughout the pandemic. The Scottish government must commit to the removal of all remaining restrictions as soon as possible whilst providing greater detail on what triggers sit behind the decision-making process to protect consumer and business confidence in the meantime. Dr Liz Cameron, Scottish Chambers of Commerce Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent High
rates of Covid in the community are translating into
high numbers in hospital with Covid. Medics
say the good news is that high vaccination rates and better treatments mean the
vast majority do not become critically ill - yet the pressure on our
hospitals is greater than ever. In
the first instance, Covid patients need to be separated from others, which can
limit bed capacity in some wards. Then
you have to make sure there are enough staff to safely look after patients. That can mean moving nurses or other
key staff from places like outpatients or day surgery to cover gaps caused by
Covid absence. It
all leads to less capacity to treat less urgent cases, which in turn, will
become more serious. And for
those who arrive at emergency departments, the result is people waiting hours
longer than they should for a bed. The SNP's John Mason says he is concerned about the rising number of hospital patients. He puts it to the first minister that some of those undergoing treatment at the moment might think restrictions should be increased rather than eased. Ms Sturgeon says she doesn't take that view. She adds: ""I think we are on a justified journey thanks to normality."" The first minister adds this is down to the success of the vaccination programme and natural immunity, which has weakened the link between the virus and serious illness. So far the number of patients requiring intensive care treatment has remained relatively steady - but hospitals are seeing near record numbers of Covid patients in other wards. On Tuesday there were 1,996 Covid-positive patients, far more than during the Omicron surge in January this year and not far short of the record figure of 2,085 in January 2021. NHS Lothian and NHS Grampian have both said they have more Covid patients than at any time in the pandemic. NHS Lanarkshire says its three major hospitals are operating beyond capacity and is warning of very long A&E waiting times. Glasgow says its hospitals are almost full while NHS Highland says some elective surgery is having to be cancelled. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Scottish Conservative leader concedes that case rates are higher than anyone would like, but he stresses ""we have to move forward"". ""We can't stay stuck with Covid rules forever."" Mr Ross says it will be a blow for households and businesses that face mask rules will remain until April. Why won't the first minister trust the Scottish public to take the steps required to keep their families safe, asks the Scottish Tory leader. He also asks how much the extension of free testing in Scotland will cost. The first minister ends by asking everyone to be patient for a ""little while longer"" on face coverings and to continue following all advice on hygiene, ventilation, testing and vaccination. Today marks steady progress back to normal life and a more sustainable way of managing this virus. However, while cases are spiking, there is still pressure on the NHS and concern amongst the most vulnerable. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister Scotland's island communities have been particularly badly hit in recent weeks but case rates are very high across the whole country. Public Health Scotland figures for the seven days to 8 March show Orkney was seeing 2,321 case per 100,000 population, followed by the Western Isles with 2,193 cases /100k East and North Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire, Clackmannanshire, Falkirk, Highland and East Renfrewshire all had case rates above 1,500 /100k population Every area of Scotland was seeing more than 1,000 cases per 100K To put that into context, back in the spring of 2021, the threshold for an area being under the top ""level four"" lockdown restrictions was a case rate of 150 per 100,000 population. These case rates are based on positive tests. The ONS weekly sampling which includes asymptomatic people suggests as many as one in 18 Scots had Covid that week. The first minister confirms contact tracing will wind up at the end of April. Physical
test sites will also close at the end of next month, although mobile testing units and
lab capacity will be retained for our longer term testing purposes. Our intention is that from end April all routine population-wide testing will end, including for those who have symptoms. Contact tracing will end at this point too - although people with symptoms of respiratory illness will be advised to stay at home Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister The first minister turns to testing and tells MSPs she is âseverely limitedâ by
the fact funding is determined by the decisions the UK government takes for
England. Testing
for people without symptoms In England ended in mid-February, and will do so at
the end of this month for those with symptoms.  Ms Sturgeon says she intends the transition in Scotland to last until the end of April. She adds: âThis is as far as we can go within funding constraints, but it allows us to take account of current case numbers, and better support the shift in our management of the virus.â Ms
Sturgeon says she considers the face covering guidance to be prudent given the
current spike in case numbers. She
acknowledges it will be disappointing for businesses and service providers, such
as day care services. The
first minister adds the guidance will be reviewed in two weeks and says she expects the regulation to be converted to guidance in early April. Ensuring continued widespread use of face coverings will provide some additional protection - particularly for the most vulnerable - at a time when the risk of infection is very high, and it may help us get over this spike more quickly. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister The first minister confirms from Monday, with âone temporary, precautionary exceptionâ - the remaining
domestic legal measures will be lifted and replaced with appropriate guidance. She
adds on Monday:  The
exception relates to the requirement to wear face coverings on public
transport, and in certain indoor settings. Ms Sturgeon says the virus continues to present a medium threat. ""However
we remain optimistic that it will move from medium to low over spring."" The FM says: ""We
should - and will - continue the transition away from legal requirements, to
advice and guidance instead.""  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

increase in cases over the past three weeks has been driven by the BA.2 sub
lineage of the Omicron variant. This has been estimated to be significantly more
transmissible - with a growth rate since mid-February perhaps 80% greater than
original Omicron. BA.2
is now in Scotland the most dominant strain, accounting for more than 80% of all reported cases. The first minister says there is no evidence that BA.2 causes more severe illness than the original form of Omicron BA.1, or that it
is more effective at evading natural or vaccine immunity. She again stresses the importance of the vaccination programme. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,4.4363747e-05
"Roman Abramovich was pictured at a VIP lounge in Ben Gurion international airport in Lod near Tel Aviv A private jet linked to sanctioned billionaire Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich has landed in Moscow. The jet arrived in Moscow on Tuesday morning after taking off from Israel and stopping in Istanbul, flight tracking website FlightRadar24 said. Mr Abramovich was seen in a VIP lounge at the airport in Israel, though it is not known if he boarded the flight. The Russian was amongseven oligarchs sanctioned by the UK governmentlast week in response to the Ukraine war. Mr Abramovich, 55, is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he has denied. Secret paper highlights corrupt Abramovich deals Roman Abramovich sanctioned by UK Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions? Reuters news agency said it had obtained a photograph showing Mr Abramovich in a VIP lounge in Ben Gurion Airport in Lod near Tel Aviv on Monday. It is not known whether he boarded the jet at any stage on its journey from Israel to Istanbul and subsequently from Istanbul to Moscow. Mr Abramovich has Israeli and Portuguese citizenship. A rabbi who helped him gain citizenship in Portugal was detained on Thursday as part of aninvestigation into how that citizenship was granted. Meanwhile, sources have told the BBC that the European Union is set to include Mr Abramovich on its expanded list of oligarchs who are subject to EU asset freezes. Roman Abramovich and Vladimir Putin pictured together at an event in Russia in 2016 Under UK sanctions, Mr Abramovich and the other six oligarchs - including billionaires Igor Sechin and Oleg Deripaska - have been banned from entering or remaining in the UK. Some of his assets were frozen, including Chelsea FC, though the club has been allowed to continue operating under a special licence granted by the UK government. Mr Abramovich announced he was selling the club earlier this month, before the sanctions against him were introduced. He is also believed to own a number of properties in the UK, including a 15-bedroom mansion at Kensington Palace Gardens in west London, reportedly valued at more than Â£150m. His purchase of Chelsea FC in 2003 transformed the club's fortunes, turning them into a side that won every major trophy in club football. It also raised the bar for the level of investment required to compete at the top of the Premier League. Mr Abramovich made his money in the 1990s during Boris Yeltsin's presidency of Russia. This week aBBC Panorama investigationsaid it had uncovered new evidence about the ""corrupt"" deals that made his fortune. The Chelsea owner made billions after buying an oil company from the Russian government in what BBC Panorama said was a rigged auction in 1995. Mr Abramovich paid around $250m (Â£190m) for Sibneft, before later selling it back to the Russian government for $13bn in 2005. His lawyers say there is no basis for alleging he has amassed very substantial wealth through criminality.

"Scotland's rules on face coverings in shops and on public transport will remain in place until April due to a rise in cases of Covid-19. All other restrictions on businesses and services are to move from legal requirement to guidance from 21 March. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it would be ""prudent"" to keep mask rules in place due to a spike in cases. These will be reviewed again in two weeks, and are likely to be converted to guidance by 4 April. Ms Sturgeon said a sharp rise in infections was putting ""significant pressure on hospital capacity"", but that vaccines were still giving people good protection. She also told MSPs that mass testing will be wound down in April, with routine testing and contact tracing to end by May. Omicron sub-variant driving Covid rise in Scotland What are the UK's Living with Covid plans? When will free Covid tests end? The average number of new cases reported each day in Scotland is more than 12,000, up from an average of 6,900 per day three weeks ago. There has also been a rise in the number of people in hospital with Covid-19, from 1,060 three weeks ago to 1,996 today. Ms Sturgeon said the BA.2 sub-variant of Omicron was now the dominant strain of the virus in Scotland, accounting for more than 80% of cases - adding that while it spreads much more quickly, there is no evidence it causes more severe illness than previous variants. This video can not be played The laws on wearing face coverings will not be lifted Under thegovernment's strategic framework for managing the virus,external, remaining legal restrictions - including mask-wearing and the need for businesses to record customer contact details and follow other guidance - were to be lifted on 21 March. The rules for businesses will be dropped as planned, but Ms Sturgeon said she needed to ""ask everyone to be patient for a little while longer on face coverings"". She said: ""I know this will be disappointing for businesses and service providers such as day care services. ""However, ensuring continued widespread use of face coverings will provide some additional protection - particularly for the most vulnerable - at a time when the risk of infection is very high, and it may help us get over this spike more quickly."" The first minister stressed that the lifting of other measures marked ""steady progress back to normal life and a more sustainable way of managing this virus"". Testing in England is being wound down by the end of March, but Ms Sturgeon said there would be no change in Scotland until Easter. Asymptomatic people will still be advised to test regularly until 18 April - with tests free of charge - and people with symptoms should continue to get a PCR test until the end of that month. However, the population-wide testing and contact tracing system will come close at the end of April, with people with symptoms advised to stay at home. From May onwards, testing will be used on a targeted basis to monitor levels of the virus in society and to look out for new variants. The Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland said changes were slower than many would like, adding that ""the impression that Scotland has a first-in, last-out approach to Covid restrictions frustrates many"". The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the announcement about face coverings was a ""bitter disappointment"". Chief executive Dr Liz Cameron said: ""Businesses cannot continue to operate with the start-stop lever being pulled just weeks apart."" And the Scottish Licensed Trade Association said the move will confuse visitors from England, where face coverings are no longer required by law. It has become almost second nature - grab your mask alongside your keys as you dash out the front door. And in Scotland, unlike any other part of the UK, you will be doing it for a while longer. Many in public health think this is not a big ask, a sensible move at a time when community transmission is so high. It is a very visible reminder that Covid has not gone away, and they point to a growing body of research that suggests community mask wearing can offer some protection against infection spread. However, others argue the evidence is not compelling and the reality is people don't wear masks in the places where they would make the most difference, at home with family and friends. After all, Scotland is experiencing a surge in cases despite such measures being in place. The Scottish Conservatives said the retention of the mask rules was ""a blow for households and businesses"". Leader Douglas Ross urged Ms Sturgeon to trust people to manage their own risks, adding: ""We can't get complacent with Covid, but we need to move forward - we can't stay stuck with Covid rules forever."" Labour's deputy leader Jackie Baillie said hospitals were ""overwhelmed"" with staff absences rising, and called for more information about testing for health workers. Ms Sturgeon said health and care staff would continue to test twice weekly after the wider programme ends, and that the system would focus on high-risk settings like hospitals and care homes. Meanwhile Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said it was disheartening that ""despite the extra sacrifices that have been made in Scotland, our infection rates are still so stubbornly high"". Health Secretary Humza Yousaf later told BBC Radio Scotland'sDrivetimehe expects Covid hospital occupancy levels to reach record levels in the next few days. He also defended the extension of the face covering rules and described the evidence for their effectiveness as ""indisputable"". Asked if he was concerned about another wave of infections given the current case numbers, Mr Yousaf said he has been reassured by the success of the vaccination programme. He told the programme: ""If you have not had your first, second or indeed your booster dose then please get it because that is clearly and significantly been the difference in terms of severity of illness. ""If we had these case numbers that we are seeing today, and we have seen over the last number of weeks, without a vaccine we would be frankly in lockdown. ""Vaccines are the game changer.""

"Team GB Olympic athletes, like Adam Peaty, have benefited from National Lottery funding The company that has run the National Lottery since it was launched, Camelot, has lost out on the next licence. The Gambling Commission has announced Allwyn Entertainment Ltd as its preferred applicant for the lottery's next licence, which starts in 2024. It said it had received the highest number of applications to run the National lottery since the first licence was awarded in 1994. Camelot has been named as the ""reserve applicant"" after four firms applied. The National Lottery is one of the world's largest lotteries and has raised more than Â£45bn for 660,000 causes across the UK. It has also played a part in funding training and facilities over the past three decades for Great Britain's Olympic and Paralympic athletes. Coming for Camelot: The battle to land the lottery Allwyn is a UK-based subsidiary of Europe's largest lottery operator Sazka, which is owned by Czech oil and gas tycoon Karel Komarek. It signalled its intent to run the National Lottery by launching in early 2021. Its board includes former members of the London 2012 Olympics organising committee, Lord Coe and entrepreneur Sir Keith Mills, who sit on its advisory board. In a statement, Allwyn said its proposal was ""judged to be the best way of growing returns to good causes by revitalising the National Lottery in a safe and sustainable way"". ""The appointment of Allwyn will breathe fresh life into the National Lottery,"" it added. Camelot chief executive Nigel Railton said: ""I'm incredibly disappointed by today's announcement, but we still have a critical job to do - as our current licence runs until February 2024. ""We're now carefully reviewing the Gambling Commission's evaluation before deciding on our next steps."" The Gambling Commission said it was ""satisfied"" that no application had been impacted by sanctions imposed by Western nations in relation to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""Our priority was to run a competition that would attract a strong field of candidates. Having received the most applications since 1994, it is clear that we've achieved just that,"" said Andrew Rhodes, the Gambling Commission's chief executive. ""I am confident that the success of the competition will lead to a highly successful fourth licence - one that maximises returns to good causes, promotes innovation, delivers against our statutory duties, and which ultimately protects the unique status of the National Lottery.""

McRae, the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotlandâs policy chair,
says the timeline to lift the remaining restrictions is slower than many would like. He adds the impression that Scotland has a ""first-in, last-out"" approach to Covid
restrictions frustrates many in business. At a time when debt-laden firms are facing dramatic fuel and utility hikes, operators are looking for ministers to inject confidence, not seed doubt. Andrew McRae, Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland Dr Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, says the decision to delay lifting all remaining
Covid restrictions will come as a ""bitter disappointment"" to her members. She adds: ""Further delay will put Scotlandâs recovery into reverse
gear again, create confusion, dent business confidence, putting the buffers on
economic growth. âBusinesses cannot continue to operate with the start-stop
lever being pulled just weeks apart, with no clear confirmation as to what the
triggers driving decision making are."" Dr Cameron also says businesses have invested millions to keep their customers and staff safe throughout the pandemic. The Scottish government must commit to the removal of all remaining restrictions as soon as possible whilst providing greater detail on what triggers sit behind the decision-making process to protect consumer and business confidence in the meantime. Dr Liz Cameron, Scottish Chambers of Commerce Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent High
rates of Covid in the community are translating into
high numbers in hospital with Covid. Medics
say the good news is that high vaccination rates and better treatments mean the
vast majority do not become critically ill - yet the pressure on our
hospitals is greater than ever. In
the first instance, Covid patients need to be separated from others, which can
limit bed capacity in some wards. Then
you have to make sure there are enough staff to safely look after patients. That can mean moving nurses or other
key staff from places like outpatients or day surgery to cover gaps caused by
Covid absence. It
all leads to less capacity to treat less urgent cases, which in turn, will
become more serious. And for
those who arrive at emergency departments, the result is people waiting hours
longer than they should for a bed. The SNP's John Mason says he is concerned about the rising number of hospital patients. He puts it to the first minister that some of those undergoing treatment at the moment might think restrictions should be increased rather than eased. Ms Sturgeon says she doesn't take that view. She adds: ""I think we are on a justified journey thanks to normality."" The first minister adds this is down to the success of the vaccination programme and natural immunity, which has weakened the link between the virus and serious illness. So far the number of patients requiring intensive care treatment has remained relatively steady - but hospitals are seeing near record numbers of Covid patients in other wards.

acknowledges it will be disappointing for businesses and service providers, such
as day care services. The
first minister adds the guidance will be reviewed in two weeks and says she expects the regulation to be converted to guidance in early April. Ensuring continued widespread use of face coverings will provide some additional protection - particularly for the most vulnerable - at a time when the risk of infection is very high, and it may help us get over this spike more quickly. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister The first minister confirms from Monday, with âone temporary, precautionary exceptionâ - the remaining
domestic legal measures will be lifted and replaced with appropriate guidance. She
adds on Monday:  The
exception relates to the requirement to wear face coverings on public
transport, and in certain indoor settings. Ms Sturgeon says the virus continues to present a medium threat. ""However
we remain optimistic that it will move from medium to low over spring."" The FM says: ""We
should - and will - continue the transition away from legal requirements, to
advice and guidance instead.""  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Motoring groups have called for fuel prices to fall as the cost of crude oil fell to its lowest level for two weeks. The price of Brent crude - the global benchmark for prices - dropped below $100 a barrel for the first time since the start of March. The RAC has said it is ""vital"" that fuel retailers start passing on falling wholesale prices to consumers. Petrol prices hit another record high on Monday, meaning it costs more than Â£90 to fill a family car, the RAC said. The average price of a litre of petrol rose to 163.71p on Monday, and diesel also hit a fresh record of 173.68p. Oil prices soared after Russia invaded Ukraine, with the price of Brent crude oil hitting a near 14-year high at one point. But in the past few days, the price of oil has dropped due to a number of factors, including hopes of progress in ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine, and also expectations that demand from China will ease as Covid cases there surge. Brent crude fell to about $98 a barrel on Tuesday before recovering some ground. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said that although petrol prices were at record highs, drivers ""should be encouraged"" by the fall in oil and wholesale prices. ""It's now vital that the biggest retailers who buy fuel most often start to reflect these reductions at the pumps to give drivers a much-needed break from the pain of constantly rising prices,"" he added. How has Ukraine conflict affected petrol prices? Petrol prices set to ease after hitting fresh highs Fuel price jump will hit food bills, industry says The AA said that the wholesale price of petrol has plummeted by 12.8p a litre since Wednesday. Luke Bosdet from the AA said: ""We should be seeing these record prices level off and start to fall away later this week. If not, MPs who are being deluged by complaints from angry constituents, need to be asking questions in Parliament. ""The government is under intense pressure from the cost of living crisis. They don't need the fuel trade to 'feather' a potential drop in pump prices."" Andrew Opie from the British Retail Consortium said supermarket retailers ""understand the cost pressures"" facing motorists, and will do ""everything they can to offer the best value-for-money across petrol forecourts, particularly if the price of oil falls"". The Petrol Retailers Association, which represents independent forecourts, said it would expect prices to fall when fresh stock is delivered. Gordon Balmer, the PRA's Executive Director, said forecourts bought from suppliers based on a price with one or two days' lag, or in some cases a week's lag.  This means it can take a few days for wholesale prices to filter through to the pumps. Oil prices are mainly determined by the price of crude oil and the dollar exchange rate, as agreements are made in dollars. Russia is the third largest oil exporter and some Western countries, for example the US and Canada, decided to halt imports from the country in response to Russia's actions. It means demand for oil from other producers has increased, leading to increased prices. The UK only imports about 6% of oil from Russia, so is not as dependent on Russia for the commodity supply as other European countries are and has said it plans to phase it out. It is, however, affected by the global shifts in price. On Monday, some analysts toldMPs on the Treasury Committeethat they expected the recent fall in the oil price to be temporary. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at financial services company Investec, said further restrictions on Russian oil exports would mean consumers ""need to get ready for what could be continued increases in fuel prices."" Dr Amrita Sen, director of research at Energy Aspects, told the committee that petrol prices could rise to around Â£2.40 a litre. And that diesel prices of ""Â£2.50 - even closer to Â£3"" were ""definitely in the realms of possibility"". Energy Minister Greg Hands has said the UK's transition to cleaner forms of energy production is now ""an issue of national security"" and not just of decarbonisation.

"Nicola Sturgeon has announced that the laws on wearing face coverings in Scotland will not be lifted next week as had been planned The first minister said people will be required to continue wearing face masks on public transport and in shops until at least early April But social distancing rules in shops and other indoor public settings will be lifted next Monday, as will the requirement for venues to collect contact details for customers The first minister confirmed that contact tracing will finish at the end of April, as will free Covid testing - with test sites also to close The announcement comes against the backdrop of a surge in Covid cases in recent weeks A total of 1,996 people were in hospital with Covid yesterday - an increase of 191 on the previous day and not far from the peak seen in January of last year Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the country ""can't stay stuck with Covid rules forever"" BBC Scotland News  Andrew
McRae, the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotlandâs policy chair,
says the timeline to lift the remaining restrictions is slower than many would like. He adds the impression that Scotland has a ""first-in, last-out"" approach to Covid
restrictions frustrates many in business. At a time when debt-laden firms are facing dramatic fuel and utility hikes, operators are looking for ministers to inject confidence, not seed doubt. Andrew McRae, Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland Dr Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, says the decision to delay lifting all remaining
Covid restrictions will come as a ""bitter disappointment"" to her members. She adds: ""Further delay will put Scotlandâs recovery into reverse
gear again, create confusion, dent business confidence, putting the buffers on
economic growth. âBusinesses cannot continue to operate with the start-stop
lever being pulled just weeks apart, with no clear confirmation as to what the
triggers driving decision making are."" Dr Cameron also says businesses have invested millions to keep their customers and staff safe throughout the pandemic. The Scottish government must commit to the removal of all remaining restrictions as soon as possible whilst providing greater detail on what triggers sit behind the decision-making process to protect consumer and business confidence in the meantime. Dr Liz Cameron, Scottish Chambers of Commerce Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent High
rates of Covid in the community are translating into
high numbers in hospital with Covid. Medics
say the good news is that high vaccination rates and better treatments mean the
vast majority do not become critically ill - yet the pressure on our
hospitals is greater than ever. In
the first instance, Covid patients need to be separated from others, which can
limit bed capacity in some wards. Then
you have to make sure there are enough staff to safely look after patients. That can mean moving nurses or other
key staff from places like outpatients or day surgery to cover gaps caused by
Covid absence. It
all leads to less capacity to treat less urgent cases, which in turn, will
become more serious. And for
those who arrive at emergency departments, the result is people waiting hours
longer than they should for a bed. The SNP's John Mason says he is concerned about the rising number of hospital patients. He puts it to the first minister that some of those undergoing treatment at the moment might think restrictions should be increased rather than eased. Ms Sturgeon says she doesn't take that view. She adds: ""I think we are on a justified journey thanks to normality."" The first minister adds this is down to the success of the vaccination programme and natural immunity, which has weakened the link between the virus and serious illness. So far the number of patients requiring intensive care treatment has remained relatively steady - but hospitals are seeing near record numbers of Covid patients in other wards. On Tuesday there were 1,996 Covid-positive patients, far more than during the Omicron surge in January this year and not far short of the record figure of 2,085 in January 2021. NHS Lothian and NHS Grampian have both said they have more Covid patients than at any time in the pandemic. NHS Lanarkshire says its three major hospitals are operating beyond capacity and is warning of very long A&E waiting times. Glasgow says its hospitals are almost full while NHS Highland says some elective surgery is having to be cancelled. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Scottish Conservative leader concedes that case rates are higher than anyone would like, but he stresses ""we have to move forward"". ""We can't stay stuck with Covid rules forever."" Mr Ross says it will be a blow for households and businesses that face mask rules will remain until April. Why won't the first minister trust the Scottish public to take the steps required to keep their families safe, asks the Scottish Tory leader.

These case rates are based on positive tests. The ONS weekly sampling which includes asymptomatic people suggests as many as one in 18 Scots had Covid that week. The first minister confirms contact tracing will wind up at the end of April. Physical
test sites will also close at the end of next month, although mobile testing units and
lab capacity will be retained for our longer term testing purposes. Our intention is that from end April all routine population-wide testing will end, including for those who have symptoms.

"Team GB Olympic athletes, like Adam Peaty, have benefited from National Lottery funding The company that has run the National Lottery since it was launched, Camelot, has lost out on the next licence. The Gambling Commission has announced Allwyn Entertainment Ltd as its preferred applicant for the lottery's next licence, which starts in 2024. It said it had received the highest number of applications to run the National lottery since the first licence was awarded in 1994. Camelot has been named as the ""reserve applicant"" after four firms applied. The National Lottery is one of the world's largest lotteries and has raised more than Â£45bn for 660,000 causes across the UK. It has also played a part in funding training and facilities over the past three decades for Great Britain's Olympic and Paralympic athletes. Coming for Camelot: The battle to land the lottery Allwyn is a UK-based subsidiary of Europe's largest lottery operator Sazka, which is owned by Czech oil and gas tycoon Karel Komarek. It signalled its intent to run the National Lottery by launching in early 2021. Its board includes former members of the London 2012 Olympics organising committee, Lord Coe and entrepreneur Sir Keith Mills, who sit on its advisory board. In a statement, Allwyn said its proposal was ""judged to be the best way of growing returns to good causes by revitalising the National Lottery in a safe and sustainable way"". ""The appointment of Allwyn will breathe fresh life into the National Lottery,"" it added. Camelot chief executive Nigel Railton said: ""I'm incredibly disappointed by today's announcement, but we still have a critical job to do - as our current licence runs until February 2024. ""We're now carefully reviewing the Gambling Commission's evaluation before deciding on our next steps."" The Gambling Commission said it was ""satisfied"" that no application had been impacted by sanctions imposed by Western nations in relation to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""Our priority was to run a competition that would attract a strong field of candidates.

"Chelsea FC owner and Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the UK government The UK sanctions against Roman Abramovich have restricted rent payments to the Crown Estate, which manages properties owned by the Queen. The UK government froze Mr Abramovich's assets last week as part of its sanctions response to the Ukraine war. He and other wealthy Russians have been targeted to put pressure on President Vladimir Putin. The sanctions prevent them from making transactions related to their properties and businesses in the UK. Mr Abramovich's frozen assets include Chelsea FC, which was allowed to continue operating under a special licence granted by the UK government. The 55-year-old Russian billionaire, who has denied close ties to President Putin, has also been linked to the ownership of properties in the UK. They include a 15-bedroom mansion on Kensington Palace Gardens, an exclusive street known as ""billionaires' row"" in west London. Land records show companies that manage assets for Mr Abramovich are registered as the lease owners of the property. This means the companies own the home, but the land it was built on belongs to the Crown Estate - a business created by Parliament to oversee a portfolio of the British monarch's properties. The Queen is not involved in management decisions by the Crown Estate, which is tasked with generating profit for the government. The terms of the lease require the companies to pay the Crown Estate ""Â£10,000 rising to Â£160,000"" over a 125-year term, a Land Registry document shows. RAbramovich sanctioned by UK Chelsea owner disqualified as club director Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions? When asked about the impact of sanctions on Mr Abramovich, a spokesperson for the Crown Estate said they would not comment on the details of individual leases. But condemning the invasion of Ukraine, the spokesperson said: ""We are doing all we can to comply swiftly with the introduction of sanctions."" The BBC has requested comment from a spokesperson for Mr Abramovich. The restrictions on rent payments werefirst reported by the Wall Street Journal newspaper,external, which said Mr Abramovich bought the house for $140m (Â£107m) in 2011. Built in the mid-1800s, the Grade II listed building hosted a Soviet diplomatic mission in 1972 and is across the road from Kensington Palace. Last weekthe UK government imposed travel bans and full asset freezes,externalon ""seven of Russia's wealthiest and most influential oligarchs"", including Mr Abramovich. These measures prohibit anyone in the UK from dealing with frozen assets owned, held or controlled by a sanctioned person. Legal experts said Mr Abramovich would have to apply for licences to make any transactions related to his properties - from security services and utility bills, to maintenance and gardeners. A licence is a written permission from the Treasury allowing an act that would otherwise breach financial sanctions. The special licence granted to Chelsea FC is one example. A Treasury spokesperson said the department cannot comment on specific properties. In general, though, a sanctioned person who is subject to an asset freeze can still live in their house but cannot rent or sell it, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson said they can ""apply for a licence on the grounds of 'basic needs', which can cover things like payment of insurance, property management, rent or mortgage payments, utility charges"". ""The licence would enable their bank to release those specific payments without contravening the freeze."" This video can not be played Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries says the sanctions are designed to ensure Abramovich cannot benefit from Chelsea's revenues Joshua Ray, a lawyer for Rahman Ravelli, told the BBC that licence applications ""can often take at least several weeks if not longer"". ""With respect to licences related to Chelsea, the government has signalled a willingness to put applications on a fast track, but that doesn't appear to apply to his other UK assets,"" said Mr Ray, who advises international companies on sanctions. Treasury guidance says lawyers advising a sanctioned person ""cannot receive any payment"" for that service without a licence. Mr Ray said Mr Abramovich ""would likely need to engage a lawyer located in a jurisdiction where he is not yet sanctioned"". On Sunday, Housing Secretary Michael Gove told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme the government was looking at using the properties of Russian oligarchs sanctioned by the UK for ""humanitarian purposes"". But he said there was ""quite a high legal bar to cross and we're not talking about permanent confiscation, adding ""if we can use it in order to help others let's do that"".

"Boris Johnson arrives at a meeting of northern European leaders in London Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the West made a ""terrible mistake"" and let President Vladimir Putin ""get away"" with annexing Crimea in 2014. Writing in the Telegraph, Mr Johnson said ending the West's dependence on Russian oil and gas was vital to end Kremlin ""bullying"". It comes as the UK banned exports of luxury goods to Russia among other sanctions. About 100 more people are also expected to be sanctioned under a new law. The legislation allows the UK to target individuals alongside the US and the European Union, which hassigned off its fourth package of sanctions against Russia,external. In addition, Mr Johnson said the only way to halt President Putin's ""continuous blackmail"" was by ending western reliance on Russian fossil fuels - a process that would be ""painful"". The prime minister is preparing to head to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf for talks about increasing production of oil and gas to compensate for reduced Russian supplies. Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions? How sanctions have changed everyday life in Russia He also said hispromised Energy Security Strategy for the UKwould step up wind energy, exploit solar power and make a ""series of big new bets"" on nuclear energy. Further drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea was one suggestion he made. The UK is to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022. A decision by the government to talk to Saudi Arabia about measures to bring down the cost of energy has been criticised by many MPs after the country executed 81 people at the weekend. Downing Street says the UK ""will continue to raise human rights abuses"" with Saudi Arabia. The prime minister chaired cabinet meeting this morning before hosting a summit of northern European leaders in London. The leaders of those countries, which form a security alliance called the Joint Expeditionary Force, will consider what steps they can take to help Ukraine and shore up their own resilience against Russia. In a video call to those leaders, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Nato alliance had been ""hypnotised by Russian aggression"" and repeated his plea for western military intervention. While he welcomed the latest western sanctions, Mr Zelensky said they ""are not enough"" to end the war and called for a full trade embargo on Russia. Boris Johnson is talking about taking back control again, but this time of the country's energy supply and, along the way, increasing efforts to make the UK a ""net zero"" carbon emitter. ""Green electricity isn't just better for the environment, it's better for your bank balance,"" says the prime minister in his article in the Daily Telegraph. ""There's nothing [Putin] can do to stop the North Sea wind."" Mr Johnson has been talking about making the UK ""the Saudi Arabia of wind"" for some time now so this is not a new policy, but it would represent a significant acceleration of the move towards low carbon power. Yes, he is backing new drilling in the North Sea, but there's also the promise of ""big new bets"" on nuclear power and - a surprise for many - no mention of the return of fracking, a controversial method of shale gas mining. In his article in the Telegraph,external, Mr Johnson said: ""When Putin invaded Ukraine the first time round, in 2014, the West made a terrible mistake. The Russian leader had committed an act of violent aggression and taken a huge chunk out of a sovereign country - and we let him get away with it."" Mr Putin ordered the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 after months of protests against its pro-Russian president culminated in his ousting. He then backed an eastern rebellion by pro-Russian separatists, who have fought Ukrainian forces in an eight-year war that has claimed 14,000 lives. Despite years of western sanctions, Russia remains firmly in control of Crimea, which it absorbed following a referendum vote discredited by much of the international community. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine last month, a growing number of Russians have been sanctioned by the UK. Most recently,386 Russian MPs who voted to recognise two rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine as independent have been hitby asset freezes and UK travel bans. Russia has maintained its grip on Crimea despite years of western sanctions In its latest sanctions, the EU has agreed bans on any transactions with certain Russian state-owned enterprises and the export of luxury goods to ""directly hit Russian elites"". Sources have told the BBC that the EU's measures will target Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich,who has already been sanctioned by the UK. Co-ordinated with western allies, the sanctions ""will further contribute to ramping up economic pressure on the Kremlin and cripple its ability to finance its invasion of Ukraine"", the European Commission said. BBC Brussels correspondent Jessica Parker says the EU has gone farther and faster than many expected, although there is a growing rift between cautious countries and those like Poland and the Baltic states, who want even stronger measures. On Tuesday,the UK announced new sanctions,externalthat mirrored the EU's in several areas, including the export ban on luxury goods such as high-end fashion and works of art. As part of these measures, Russian vodka and hundreds of other goods worth Â£900m were hit with an additional 35% import tariff. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the new tariffs ""will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade"". On top of this, the UK's fast-tracked Economic Crime Bill, which passed through Parliament the early hours of Tuesday, will now allow the UK to automatically sanction those who have had their assets already frozen by the EU, US or Canada. This will potentially open the door to hundreds more individual sanctions. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is likely to announce new measures on Tuesday on more than 100 individuals with links to President Putin's regime, the BBC understands. Speaking to BBC's Hardtalk, senior Conservative and chair of the Defence Select Committee Tobias Ellwood said sanctions on Russia would lead members of the Russian elite and generals to ""recognise there is no future for Russia"" and Mr Putin would ""eventually go"". However, Mr Ellwood warned that ""until then, he will cause absolute carnage in Ukraine and beyond unless we stand up to him"".

"Jilin province has been one of the worst affected by the latest Covid outbreak in China Multinational companies have halted some operations as China widens its Covid lockdowns - among its biggest since the start of the pandemic. Tens of millions of people across the country face restrictions, including the entire Jilin province and technology hub Shenzhen, as authorities report record numbers of cases. Toyota, Volkswagen and Apple supplier Foxconn are among the firms affected. The lockdowns have raised concerns that crucial supply chains may be disrupted. China on Tuesday reported a record high of more than 5,000 cases, most of it in Jilin. All 24 million residents of the north-eastern province were placed under quarantine orders on Monday. It is the first time China has restricted an entire province since the Wuhan and Hebei lockdown at the beginning of the pandemic. Jilin residents have been banned from moving around, and anyone wanting to leave the province must apply for police permission. It came a day after a five-day lockdown was placed on the 12.5 million residents of the southern city of Shenzhen, with all buses and subway services suspended. On Tuesday authorities in Langfang city which borders the capital Beijing, as well as Dongguan in the southern province of Guangdong, also imposed immediate lockdowns. The messy cost of China's harsh lockdown playbook Why China is still trying to achieve zero Covid Businesses in many of the affected regions have been told to close or have their employees work from home, unless they supplied essential services like food, utilities or other necessities. Foxconn, which manufactures iPhones for Apple, stopped its operations in Shenzhen on Monday, saying the date of resumption would ""be advised by the local government"". But it has several production sites in China and told the BBC it had ""adjusted the production line to minimise the potential impact"". Its plant in Zhengzhou - the world's largest iPhone factory - remains open, as the city was not hit by the restrictions. Toyota, which shut its factory in Changchun city in Jilin province, did not give a timeline for when business would resume. The Japanese carmaker told the BBC that the move was made to consider the ""impact of supplier operation"", and the ""safety and security of employees and related parties"". German carmaker Volkswagen also shuttered operations in Changchun, saying production of Volkswagen and Audi cars and their components was ""affected"", but that it hoped to reopen its factory on Thursday. On Tuesday the Shanghai Composite lost 5% and the Hang Seng index, where several Chinese technology giants are listed, fell more than 6%. Analysts believe that firms would be able to manage the disruptions. ""Such lockdowns have happened before, and [cities] have re-opened within a short period of time once the number of Covid cases were within control,"" Yeang Cheng Ling, senior investment strategist at Singapore's DBS Bank, told the BBC. UBS analyst Grace Chen said Shenzhen was not a ""major"" production site for suppliers, but it would be worrying if the lockdowns extended to Shanghai and surrounding areas as the region is a key manufacturing hub for notebooks, servers and smart devices. It feels like China has gone backwards. Two years backwards. To the early days of the outbreak that first emerged here. Drastic measures are being imposed - again - on a large scale, to try to contain the virus. An entire province has been sealed off. The lockdown of Jilin is similar in so many ways to Hubei in early 2020; the area of China where it all began. Shenzhen, the globally important tech hub (where your iPad was most likely made) is also a city in lockdown. Shanghai - where I am writing this - home to 24 million people, is a nervous place. All schools are closed, children are learning online, increasingly people are working from home. Some compounds where people live are enforcing strict rules on who can come in. Deliveries are being sprayed with disinfectant again at the gates. It's all part of the ongoing effort to maintain/retain/regain China's ""dynamic zero-Covid"" strategy - a goal that has been boosted by the mass roll-out of China's homemade vaccines, and that has been helped hugely by effectively shutting China's borders. But now that goal is being significantly undermined by the Omicron variant. China has seen relatively fewer cases of Covid due to its strict zero-Covid policy, where it resorts to rapid lockdowns, mass testing and travel restrictions whenever clusters have emerged. However the rapid transmissibility of the Omicron variant has made sticking to that approach increasingly challenging. Since the start of the year, China has reported more domestically transmitted cases than in the entire 2021. Top Chinese infectious disease expert Zhang Wenhong has called the recent outbreaks ""the most difficult period in the last two years of battling Covid"" and that they were still in ""the early stage of an exponential rise"", in an online post widely circulated on social media. But he added that while it was necessary for China to maintain its zero Covid strategy to control the outbreaks for now, ""this does not necessarily mean we will continue implementing the strategy of lockdowns and mass testing forever"".

"UK wage growth failed to keep up with the rising cost of living between November and January, new figures show. Wages rose, but when taking rising prices into account, regular pay showed a 1% fall from a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said. Gamu Nyasoro, a senior registered nurse, told the BBC that despite a recent pay rise, she has barely noticed a difference in her income after bills. There is concern the Ukraine war will further push up energy and food bills. The new employment figures also show that the number of jobless people in the UK has dropped below pre-pandemic levels. The ONS said there were 1.34 million unemployed in the three months to January, below the 1.36 million recorded in December to February 2020. The unemployment rate fell to 3.9% in the most recent quarter, while job vacancies hit another record high. But according to the ONS,external, employees' regular pay, excluding bonuses, grew by 3.8% between November and January from a year earlier. However, the rising cost of food, energy and household goods has pushed inflation, which measures how the cost of living changes over time, to a 30-year high.Prices surged by 5.5% in the 12 months to January, up from 5.4% in December, increasing pressure on household budgets. The Resolution Foundation think tank has warned that the squeeze on workers will get worse, with those on the lowest incomes most likely to be affected by surging bills. Why are prices rising so quickly? Borrow billions or see incomes hit, Sunak told Fury after Bank boss says don't ask for big pay rise The ONS said its latest figures showed the number of unemployed people fell below pre-pandemic levels for the first time, while there was another strong rise in the number of pay-rolled employees in February. Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, added: ""However, the number of people out of work and not looking for a job rose again, meaning total employment remained well below its pre-pandemic level. ""We have seen yet another record number of job vacancies, and with the redundancy rate falling to a new record low, demand for workers remains strong."" The ONS said early estimates for February 2022 indicated that median monthly pay was Â£2,041, an increase of 5.1% compared with the same period last year. ""The issue is not that pay growth is weak, it's that prices are running even higher,"" Mr Fitzner told the BBC's Today programme. Recent research by the Institute for Fiscal Studiessuggested that public sector workers in particular are facing pay cuts once rising prices are taken into account. Gamu Nyasoro is a medical educator with the NHS Gamu Nyasoro, says her pay rise is barely noticeable once increasing council tax, energy and food bills are taken into account. As a single mother to three children, a lot of her outgoings are spent on childcare. ""I look at my pay cheque and you literally want to cry because you know that by day two, the things that you need to pay have gone out and you are literally left with no money."" She says finances are now a constant worry. Her forecast energy bill for the next year has nearly doubled. She was recently also forced to use a foodbank for the first time. ""It was one of the most scariest thing that I've done and something that I didn't do lightly."" You can't sugar-coat this. It's been widely predicted that living standards would fall as a result of rising inflation. Before inflation, the average pay rise was 3.8% excluding bonuses - substantially more than most workers have been used to over the past decade. However, because prices are now rising faster than that, the average wage (now Â£555 per week) can buy fewer goods and services than a year ago. After allowing for inflation, it amounts to a real terms pay cut of 1% across the board. That average hides a growing gap between the private sector, where bonuses have lifted total pay by 5.3% including bonuses, enough to keep up with the rising cost of living, and the public sector, where total pay rose by only 2.4% and living standards are falling more sharply. We've only just got over the worst decade for improvements in living standards in 200 years. Now, once again, living standards for most workers are falling. And that's before what's anticipated in the coming weeks - a rise in interest rates, rising energy bills and higher taxes. Ben Harrison, director of the Work Foundation, said: ""Rising prices and the energy cap increase in April will affect all households across the UK, but it will acutely impact those in low paying and insecure employment."" He called on the chancellor to use the Spring Statement on 23 March to support those most at risk by, for example, increasing Universal Credit payments. The British Chamber of Commerce suggested that Rishi Sunak should use the Spring Statement to delay a planned rise in National Insurance contributions by one year, to give firms a bit of financial headroom in the face of rising costs. Responding to the new figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""I am confident that our labour market is in a good position to deal with the current global challenges. ""We know people are concerned about the rising cost of living so alongside continuing to help people find great jobs - we're providing direct support worth more than Â£20bn this financial year and next."" This video can not be played Bank of England boss: 'Donât ask for a big pay rise' Other experts also suggested that action was needed to help older people in particular. Separate research published by the ONS shows that a significant number of older workers have dropped out of the workforce for a mix of reasons, such as long-term sickness or those taking early retirement. However, some analysts said the strength in the labour market overall meant the Bank of England was likely to increase interest rates on Thursday. Martin Beck of the EY Item Club said the Bank might be worried that a tight jobs market could see workers asking for higher wages to off-set budget pressures. Earlier this year, the Bank's governor came under fire for suggesting that workers should not ask for big pay rises, to try to stop prices rising out of control.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Marina Ovsyannikova speaks to reporters about the reasons for her live TV protest A Russian journalist has been fined and released after she protested against the war in Ukraine on a live TV news programme and made an anti-war video. Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at state-controlled Channel 1, was detained after she ran on to the set on Monday holding a sign saying ""no war"". She said she had been questioned for 14 hours and not slept for two days, and was not given access to legal help. The 30,000 rouble (Â£214; $280) fine relates to her video message. She had pleaded not guilty to the charge of organising an unauthorised public event. In the video, she called on the Russian people to protest against the war, saying only they have the power to ""stop all this madness"". ""Don't be afraid of anything. They can't imprison us all,"" she said. It is not clear if she will face separate charges relating to her protest on live TV, and there had been fears she would be prosecuted under a more serious, new criminal law that bans calling Russia's military action in Ukraine an ""invasion"" or spreading ""fake news"" about the conflict. After the court hearing Ms Ovsyannikova told reporters that she needed to rest after two days without sleep. ""The interrogation lasted for more than 14 hours, I wasn't allowed to get in touch with my family or friends, I was denied access to a lawyer,"" she said. She also stressed that she came up with the idea of the protest alone. ""It was my anti-war decision. I made this decision by myself because I don't like Russia starting this invasion. It was really terrible,"" she said in English as she left the courthouse. Lawyers were unable to locate Ms Ovsyannikova for several hours after she was detained on Monday evening. Her whereabouts were unknown until an image circulated on Russian media which showed her in court with lawyer Anton Gashinsky. Marina Ovsyannikova appeared in court on Tuesday with lawyer Anton Gashinsky Images of Ms Ovsyannikova's protest were quickly shared across the world after she ran on to the set of one of Russia's most-watched news programmes, Vremya, holding a sign reading ""No war, stop the war, don't believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here."" She could also be heard repeating the words ""no war, stop the war"". The placard was clearly visible for a few seconds before the programme cut away from the live broadcast to a pre-recorded report. Before the incident she recorded a video in which she said she was ashamed to work for what she called Kremlin propaganda. ""I'm ashamed that I allowed myself to tell lies from the television screen. Ashamed that I allowed Russians to be turned into zombies,"" she explained. ""We just silently watched this inhumane regime."" This video can not be played Watch: Anti-war demonstrator disrupts Russia's state TV news Ms Ovsyannikova, who said her father was Ukrainian, said the whole world had turned against Russia.

Onetold the Faridaily blog,external- run by former BBC Russian Service journalist Farida Rustamova - that Ms Ovsyannikova, who has two children, had never discussed politics, but spoke ""mostly about children, dogs and the house"". From the moment her identity became known, Ms Ovsyannikova received dozens of comments on her Facebook page in Ukrainian, Russian and English, thanking her for her actions. Ukraine's President Zelensky also praised her for ""telling the truth"". French President Emmanuel Macron said France would launch an effort to offer her protection, either at the embassy or through asylum, and said he would discuss it in his next conversation with President Putin.

It is also unusual for employees of state-controlled news organisations to express an opinion that differs from the official Kremlin position. But since the war in Ukraine began, at least three journalists have resigned from top Russian TV channels: Zhanna Agalakova from Channel 1, and Lilia Gildeyeva and Vadim Glusker from NTV. State-controlled Russian media refer to the war as a ""special military operation"" and paint Ukraine as the aggressor, describing Ukraine's elected government as neo-Nazis. Several of the remaining independent media outlets in Russia have stopped broadcasting or publishing after pressure from the authorities, including the radio station Echo of Moscow, and TV Rain - an online TV channel. Others, like newspaper Novaya Gazeta, are attempting to report on the situation without falling foul of the new censorship laws. Access to the BBC has also been restricted inside Russia, leading the corporation to issueguidance over how to continue using its services,external.

"UK wage growth failed to keep up with the rising cost of living between November and January, new figures show. Wages rose, but when taking rising prices into account, regular pay showed a 1% fall from a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said. Gamu Nyasoro, a senior registered nurse, told the BBC that despite a recent pay rise, she has barely noticed a difference in her income after bills. There is concern the Ukraine war will further push up energy and food bills. The new employment figures also show that the number of jobless people in the UK has dropped below pre-pandemic levels. The ONS said there were 1.34 million unemployed in the three months to January, below the 1.36 million recorded in December to February 2020. The unemployment rate fell to 3.9% in the most recent quarter, while job vacancies hit another record high. But according to the ONS,external, employees' regular pay, excluding bonuses, grew by 3.8% between November and January from a year earlier. However, the rising cost of food, energy and household goods has pushed inflation, which measures how the cost of living changes over time, to a 30-year high.Prices surged by 5.5% in the 12 months to January, up from 5.4% in December, increasing pressure on household budgets. The Resolution Foundation think tank has warned that the squeeze on workers will get worse, with those on the lowest incomes most likely to be affected by surging bills. Why are prices rising so quickly? Borrow billions or see incomes hit, Sunak told Fury after Bank boss says don't ask for big pay rise The ONS said its latest figures showed the number of unemployed people fell below pre-pandemic levels for the first time, while there was another strong rise in the number of pay-rolled employees in February. Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, added: ""However, the number of people out of work and not looking for a job rose again, meaning total employment remained well below its pre-pandemic level. ""We have seen yet another record number of job vacancies, and with the redundancy rate falling to a new record low, demand for workers remains strong."" The ONS said early estimates for February 2022 indicated that median monthly pay was Â£2,041, an increase of 5.1% compared with the same period last year. ""The issue is not that pay growth is weak, it's that prices are running even higher,"" Mr Fitzner told the BBC's Today programme. Recent research by the Institute for Fiscal Studiessuggested that public sector workers in particular are facing pay cuts once rising prices are taken into account. Gamu Nyasoro is a medical educator with the NHS Gamu Nyasoro, says her pay rise is barely noticeable once increasing council tax, energy and food bills are taken into account. As a single mother to three children, a lot of her outgoings are spent on childcare. ""I look at my pay cheque and you literally want to cry because you know that by day two, the things that you need to pay have gone out and you are literally left with no money."" She says finances are now a constant worry. Her forecast energy bill for the next year has nearly doubled. She was recently also forced to use a foodbank for the first time. ""It was one of the most scariest thing that I've done and something that I didn't do lightly."" You can't sugar-coat this. It's been widely predicted that living standards would fall as a result of rising inflation. Before inflation, the average pay rise was 3.8% excluding bonuses - substantially more than most workers have been used to over the past decade. However, because prices are now rising faster than that, the average wage (now Â£555 per week) can buy fewer goods and services than a year ago. After allowing for inflation, it amounts to a real terms pay cut of 1% across the board. That average hides a growing gap between the private sector, where bonuses have lifted total pay by 5.3% including bonuses, enough to keep up with the rising cost of living, and the public sector, where total pay rose by only 2.4% and living standards are falling more sharply. We've only just got over the worst decade for improvements in living standards in 200 years. Now, once again, living standards for most workers are falling. And that's before what's anticipated in the coming weeks - a rise in interest rates, rising energy bills and higher taxes. Ben Harrison, director of the Work Foundation, said: ""Rising prices and the energy cap increase in April will affect all households across the UK, but it will acutely impact those in low paying and insecure employment."" He called on the chancellor to use the Spring Statement on 23 March to support those most at risk by, for example, increasing Universal Credit payments. The British Chamber of Commerce suggested that Rishi Sunak should use the Spring Statement to delay a planned rise in National Insurance contributions by one year, to give firms a bit of financial headroom in the face of rising costs. Responding to the new figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""I am confident that our labour market is in a good position to deal with the current global challenges. ""We know people are concerned about the rising cost of living so alongside continuing to help people find great jobs - we're providing direct support worth more than Â£20bn this financial year and next."" This video can not be played Bank of England boss: 'Donât ask for a big pay rise' Other experts also suggested that action was needed to help older people in particular. Separate research published by the ONS shows that a significant number of older workers have dropped out of the workforce for a mix of reasons, such as long-term sickness or those taking early retirement. However, some analysts said the strength in the labour market overall meant the Bank of England was likely to increase interest rates on Thursday. Martin Beck of the EY Item Club said the Bank might be worried that a tight jobs market could see workers asking for higher wages to off-set budget pressures. Earlier this year, the Bank's governor came under fire for suggesting that workers should not ask for big pay rises, to try to stop prices rising out of control.

"Jilin province has been one of the worst affected by the latest Covid outbreak in China Multinational companies have halted some operations as China widens its Covid lockdowns - among its biggest since the start of the pandemic. Tens of millions of people across the country face restrictions, including the entire Jilin province and technology hub Shenzhen, as authorities report record numbers of cases. Toyota, Volkswagen and Apple supplier Foxconn are among the firms affected. The lockdowns have raised concerns that crucial supply chains may be disrupted. China on Tuesday reported a record high of more than 5,000 cases, most of it in Jilin. All 24 million residents of the north-eastern province were placed under quarantine orders on Monday. It is the first time China has restricted an entire province since the Wuhan and Hebei lockdown at the beginning of the pandemic. Jilin residents have been banned from moving around, and anyone wanting to leave the province must apply for police permission. It came a day after a five-day lockdown was placed on the 12.5 million residents of the southern city of Shenzhen, with all buses and subway services suspended. On Tuesday authorities in Langfang city which borders the capital Beijing, as well as Dongguan in the southern province of Guangdong, also imposed immediate lockdowns. The messy cost of China's harsh lockdown playbook Why China is still trying to achieve zero Covid Businesses in many of the affected regions have been told to close or have their employees work from home, unless they supplied essential services like food, utilities or other necessities. Foxconn, which manufactures iPhones for Apple, stopped its operations in Shenzhen on Monday, saying the date of resumption would ""be advised by the local government"". But it has several production sites in China and told the BBC it had ""adjusted the production line to minimise the potential impact"". Its plant in Zhengzhou - the world's largest iPhone factory - remains open, as the city was not hit by the restrictions. Toyota, which shut its factory in Changchun city in Jilin province, did not give a timeline for when business would resume. The Japanese carmaker told the BBC that the move was made to consider the ""impact of supplier operation"", and the ""safety and security of employees and related parties"". German carmaker Volkswagen also shuttered operations in Changchun, saying production of Volkswagen and Audi cars and their components was ""affected"", but that it hoped to reopen its factory on Thursday. On Tuesday the Shanghai Composite lost 5% and the Hang Seng index, where several Chinese technology giants are listed, fell more than 6%. Analysts believe that firms would be able to manage the disruptions. ""Such lockdowns have happened before, and [cities] have re-opened within a short period of time once the number of Covid cases were within control,"" Yeang Cheng Ling, senior investment strategist at Singapore's DBS Bank, told the BBC. UBS analyst Grace Chen said Shenzhen was not a ""major"" production site for suppliers, but it would be worrying if the lockdowns extended to Shanghai and surrounding areas as the region is a key manufacturing hub for notebooks, servers and smart devices. It feels like China has gone backwards. Two years backwards. To the early days of the outbreak that first emerged here. Drastic measures are being imposed - again - on a large scale, to try to contain the virus. An entire province has been sealed off. The lockdown of Jilin is similar in so many ways to Hubei in early 2020; the area of China where it all began. Shenzhen, the globally important tech hub (where your iPad was most likely made) is also a city in lockdown. Shanghai - where I am writing this - home to 24 million people, is a nervous place. All schools are closed, children are learning online, increasingly people are working from home. Some compounds where people live are enforcing strict rules on who can come in. Deliveries are being sprayed with disinfectant again at the gates. It's all part of the ongoing effort to maintain/retain/regain China's ""dynamic zero-Covid"" strategy - a goal that has been boosted by the mass roll-out of China's homemade vaccines, and that has been helped hugely by effectively shutting China's borders. But now that goal is being significantly undermined by the Omicron variant. China has seen relatively fewer cases of Covid due to its strict zero-Covid policy, where it resorts to rapid lockdowns, mass testing and travel restrictions whenever clusters have emerged. However the rapid transmissibility of the Omicron variant has made sticking to that approach increasingly challenging. Since the start of the year, China has reported more domestically transmitted cases than in the entire 2021. Top Chinese infectious disease expert Zhang Wenhong has called the recent outbreaks ""the most difficult period in the last two years of battling Covid"" and that they were still in ""the early stage of an exponential rise"", in an online post widely circulated on social media. But he added that while it was necessary for China to maintain its zero Covid strategy to control the outbreaks for now, ""this does not necessarily mean we will continue implementing the strategy of lockdowns and mass testing forever"".

"The previous two years had each seen about 3.8 million referrals The number of referrals for specialist NHS mental health care reached a record high in England by the end of 2021, an analysis suggests. The Royal College of Psychiatrists says the pandemic has led to unprecedented demand and backlogs and services are struggling to keep up. There were 4.3 million referrals, for conditions such as anxiety and depression, in 2021,NHS Digital,externalsays. Just under a quarter - 1.025 million - were for children or adolescents. Child mental health: Huge rise in severe cases, BBC analysis reveals The previous two years had each seen about 3.8 million referrals. The college said the NHS had delivered 1.8 million mental health consultations in December 2021, as the Omicron variant of Covid-19, first identified in South Africa, spread across the UK. But an estimated1.4 million people were still waiting,externalfor treatment. And hundreds of adults were being sent far from home for treatment because of a lack of beds in their area. President Dr Adrian James said: ""As the pressure on services continues to ratchet up, the silence from government continues to be of grave concern for the college, the wider mental health workforce and, most importantly, our patients. ""The warning of the long tail of mental ill health caused by the pandemic has not been heeded. ""Many thousands of people will be left waiting far too long for the treatment they need unless the government wakes up to the crisis that is engulfing the country. ""Staff are working flat out to give their patients the support they need but the lack of resources and lack of staff mean it's becoming an impossible situation to manage. ""We don't need warm words or empty commitments. ""We need a fully funded plan for mental-health services, backed by a long-term workforce plan, as the country comes to terms with the biggest hit to its mental health in generations."" Marjorie Wallace from the mental health charity SANE said: ""We need urgent action or our failures to act now may leave us with a lost generation. The huge rise in the number of referrals last year, including more than one million children, suggests that we are sleepwalking into a crisis. ""Mental health staff are so depleted and on their knees that we know of patients and families told they have to wait until something terrible happens before action is taken."" A government spokesperson said: ""We are committed to ensuring everyone is able to access the help and advice they need, which is why we are investing an additional Â£2.3 billion a year into mental health services by 2023/24, on top of the Â£500 million we have made available to address the impact of the pandemic.

"The first refugees from Ukraine are expected to be matched with people in Northern Ireland offering shelter on Friday A Northern Ireland couple who have opened their home to refugees fleeing from Ukraine say they could not stand by in the face of such suffering. ""I would like to think if I was in need, somebody would open their arms and help me,"" said Mandy Durrell. TheHomes for Ukraine schemeis now taking applications from people in Northern Ireland who want to offer shelter. The first refugees are expected to be matched with home-owners on Friday. Mandy and Mark Durrell are among those from NI offering shelter to refugees Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said: ""People can register from today and we'll start matching people from Friday, if they're able to offer accommodation, whether it's people who've got spare accommodation, businesses and individuals who can do that. ""It's that generosity of spirit here in the UK we want to tap into and give people the chance to do whatever they can to support."" Husband and wife team Mandy and Mark Durrell were among the first to register and offer a room. Both Methodist ministers covering four churches in Bangor, they said watching the news from Ukraine had been heart-breaking. ""We want to offer space, companionship, comfort and safety,"" said Mark. ""We have this home. There's two of us and the dog and there's space here to give someone refuge and sanctuary."" Mandy said Methodist manses - ministers' Church-owned homes - were always big enough to house travelling preachers, as well as anyone who might be in need. ""We are only doing what Methodist people are meant to do,"" she said. ""Yes, it puts us out of our comfort zone - certainly me - I like my own space. But when you see what people are going through, you have to challenge yourself. ""You can't not. You really can't. ""People are fleeing for their lives and you see wee old people and children who are losing their parents and women having to leave their husbands behind not knowing if they are ever going to see them again. The couple are offering a room that is carpeted and fully furnished. They are waiting now to hear from the government what they need to do next. ""Some of the times we're praying and asking God to answer our prayer, when you could be the very answer to that prayer,"" said Mark. ""If we have got the space it's selfish for it to sit there when somebody has been put out of their home."" Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's Executive said it was working ""at pace"" to get the scheme up and running. More than 1.5m refugees have fled to Poland, amid brutal shelling of cities across Ukraine Hosts will be offered Â£350 a month as a ""thank you"" from the government. A spokesperson for the Executive Office said: ""Safeguarding is a central priority in our preparations to accommodate Ukrainian refugees here. ""All hosts and beneficiaries will undergo criminal records (DBS) checks. In addition, we intend to work with partners locally to help ensure refugees are safe and connected to the services and support they need. ""We are working at pace, making preparations so we stand ready to provide sanctuary to Ukrainian refugees. ""Mindful of the pressure on social housing stock, officials are also engaging with councils and the voluntary and community sector to find creative ways of bringing suitable accommodation into use and identifying all available capacity."" How to sponsor Ukrainian refugees How many people have fled Ukraine? Why I want to share my home with a Ukrainian refugee The spokesman said the department was in close contact with the Home Office and the Department for Levelling Up, Communities and Housing as well as with colleagues in other jurisdictions. ""We will participate fully in this humanitarian effort. Partnership across sectors and wider society will be key to ensuring we can support as many Ukrainian people seeking sanctuary here as possible."" Justyna Bell is originally from Poland but lived in Belfast for a number of years - she now lives with her husband, a Belfast native, in Norway, where some families have begun to welcome refugees into their homes. She told BBC News NI that they have been housing three sisters from Ukraine since Saturday evening. ""The youngest of our guests is going to be able to go to school, and the adult sister will get a right to work pretty much straight away so this is very important,"" she said. ""They're from a family with seven children and only the three sisters managed to get across (the border) because their older brother was stopped, he's over the age of 18 and he's not allowed to leave the country. ""So then their mum and dad decided to stay as well. Justyna says they have been adjusting to having three more people in their house ""The biggest emotions were when we heard they boarded the airplane. ""It's really hard to unleash all the emotions when they have been through so much so I think for them, they describe it as being 'flat'. ""We've been hugging a lot but apart from that it's not an outburst of emotions."" Justyna said they had previously looked at housing refugees from other conflicts so a lot of the groundwork had already been prepared and she had this advice for anyone considering doing the same. ""It's really good to think about it first and have a conversation in the household and really open up and not think it's not very humanitarian if you have some objections,"" she said. The debate about offering sanctuary and the best way to support people fleeing Ukraine has divided opinion. More than 2.5 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the invasion, the UN estimates Journalist and commentator AndrÃ© Walker, who has just returned from the region, said the situation for fleeing Ukrainians was chaotic. ""Every man from age of 18 to 60 has been conscripted,"" he told Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show. ""If it were me and my husband or wife was trapped in the country, I would not be wanting to go to Northern Ireland, I would want to be just over the border in Poland."" Many refugees were reluctant to travel a long way, he added. ""They want to be near their husbands. I don't think we should be dragging them away just because it makes us feel virtuous."" ""How many people during the Troubles decided to move to Liverpool and Dublin and how many moved to Kiev?"" However commentator Mairia Cahill told the Nolan Show that this situation was unprecedented. ""Ireland has taken 3,000 people in two weeks... when there are people who are prepared and able to travel and those restrictions are not put in their way, they are quite happy to come to Ireland."" She said the UK had put in place ""every amount of bureaucracy they can to stop taking people in"". Concern had been expressed over Northern Ireland's contribution to the Ukraine response in the absence of a first and deputy first minister in office to lead the effort. Paul Givan resigned as first minister earlier this year as part of the DUP's protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol. Patrick Corrigan, of Amnesty International, said: ""I am concerned that the absence of a first minister and deputy first minister, who have lead responsibility for refugee matters, has led to Northern Ireland being left behind when it comes to playing our part in offering a welcome to refugees from Ukraine."" Irish premier Micheal Martin said at the weekend that Ireland has accepted 5,500 Ukrainian refugees so far, and may take in more than 100,000. Details of the Homes for Ukraine scheme were announced on Sunday and the project will be overseen by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.

"Ukrainians have been arriving in neighbouring countries with only the possessions that they can carry Northern Ireland can play a full role in housing Ukrainian refugees in spite of the absence of an executive at Stormont, MPs have been told. Michael Gove, Secretary of State for Communities, said on Monday night that all parts of the UK would be involved in the Homes for Ukraine scheme. People who take in refugees will be known as sponsors. Sponsors in Northern Ireland will be entitled to claim Â£350 a month like the rest of the UK. TheHomes for Ukraine schemeis now taking applications from people in Northern Ireland who want to offer shelter. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has said people would be matched from Friday, ""if they're able to offer accommodation, whether it's people who've got spare accommodation, businesses and individuals"". However, Stormont is currently without a functioning devolved government, known as the Northern Ireland Executive. It collapsed on 4 February whenthe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) pulled its first minister out of office, which meant other executive ministers cannot take any significant decisions oragree a budget. Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Gove acknowledged the complications at Stormont. ""We know the political situation in Northern Ireland, but we did have the opportunity to talk to Jayne Brady [the head] of the Northern Ireland Civil Service in order to make sure that Northern Ireland was fully looped into this approach, and both the secretary of state and the minister of state in the Northern Ireland Office are committed to doing everything to help,"" he told MPs.

How to sponsor Ukrainian refugees in UK homes NI opens doors to refugees from Ukraine NI homes offered Â£350 to host Ukrainian refugees It is not clear exactly how extra funding required for school places and health services would be managed in the absence of an executive. Anonline portal for people to register their interest,externalin providing accommodation for families fleeing the war in Ukraine has opened on the UK government website. A spokesperson for the Executive Office at Stormont said the sponsorship scheme would operate in Northern Ireland and expressions of interest in providing accommodation from both individuals and groups was strongly encouraged. ""While the details will be announced by Westminster, we are working at pace, making preparations so we stand ready to provide sanctuary to Ukrainian refugees,"" the spokesperson added. ""Mindful of the pressure on social housing stock, officials are also engaging with councils and the voluntary and community sector to find creative ways of bringing suitable accommodation into use and identifying all available capacity."" The spokesperson added they were also in contact with the Home Office and the Department for Levelling Up, Communities and Housing. ""We will participate fully in this humanitarian effort,"" the Executive Office said. ""Partnership across sectors and wider society will be key to ensuring we can support as many Ukrainian people seeking sanctuary here as possible."" Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he had space within his home and ""would be pleased to receive some of those fleeing from Ukraine"". It is understood Alliance leader Naomi Long is considering doing the same, but would not seek payment. In the Republic of Ireland, the cabinet is set to hold an urgent video conference on Tuesday to discuss the war in Ukraine, broadcaster RTÃ reports. The taoiseach (Irish prime minister) is currently in the US ahead of events to mark St Patrick's Day, but will chair the meeting. Accommodation is expected to be a key focus for the meeting, with Ukrainian ambassador to Ireland Larysa Gerasko saying almost 6,000 refugees have arrived in Ireland over the last two weeks. ""It's very difficult for them, some of them don't have friends or relatives here,"" she said. ""They don't understand how the system in the country works."" Ms Gerasko thanked the Irish government and people for the warm welcome Ukrainians had received. She added that while it was difficult to predict the number of refugees who would seek help in Ireland, she estimated it could be about 80,000 people. The Irish government announced the lifting of visa requirements between Ukraine and Ireland last month, but Ms Gerasko said many people did not know that. Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said he expected further sanctions against Russia to be announced in the near future.

"US President Joe Biden and Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin held a virtual meeting on St Patrick's Day last year Two Stormont ministers will fly to the US this week ahead of the St Patrick's Day celebrations in Washington. Finance Minister Conor Murphy and Economy Minister Gordon Lyons are due to take part in a series of trade and investment events before attending the annual ceremony at the White House. Civil service head Jayne Brady and Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill will join them. Washington's St Patrick's Day events have been cancelled for the past two years because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Some restrictions, including face coverings, remain in place for White House events. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis, Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood and Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin will also be in Washington. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) said it regretted that its leader Doug Beattie was ""too unwell to travel to Washington"" on this occasion. ""We wish those attending this week`s events a happy St Patrick`s Day and we look forward to taking up future invitations and opportunities to engage directly with the US administration,"" a UUP spokesperson added. After a two-year absence, the Irish political exodus on St Patrick's Day has returned with 33 Dublin ministers flying around the world. But there will be no first or deputy first minister from Northern Ireland. Their absence will be noted and used by some to talk up the the crisis at Stormont. But any debate will be completely overshadowed by the war in Ukraine and it will be Putin and notthe protocolwhich will dominate discussions. The programme in Washington will include the traditional Northern Ireland Bureau breakfast on St Patrick's Day. At the same time, US Vice President Kamala Harris will host a breakfast gathering before the annual speakers' luncheon with Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives. The traditional shamrock handover between the taoiseach and US President Joe Biden will take place in the oval office. On Tuesday, politicians will gather at the Irish Embassy for the unveiling of a bust celebrating the life of former SDLP leader John Hume,who died in 2020. A bust will be unveiled in tribute to the late John Hume (left), pictured with President Clinton on St Patrick's Day in 2000 Before arriving in Washington, Mr Lyons will meet investors in New York along with representatives from the US travel industry. He will also travel to Maryland to meet officials from the US Department of Commerce to talk about a shared project on cyber security. The water in the White House north lawn fountain was turned green to mark St Patrick's Day in 2021 Although she is no longer deputy first minister, Michelle O'Neill will also be in the US with her Sinn FÃ©in party leader Mary Lou McDonald. They will attend an Irish unity event in New York before Ms McDonald addresses the US Council on Foreign Relations. It is not yet clear if other party leaders, including the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, plan to travel to Washington this week.

"UK wage growth failed to keep up with the rising cost of living between November and January, new figures show. Wages rose, but when taking rising prices into account, regular pay showed a 1% fall from a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said. Gamu Nyasoro, a senior registered nurse, told the BBC that despite a recent pay rise, she has barely noticed a difference in her income after bills. There is concern the Ukraine war will further push up energy and food bills. The new employment figures also show that the number of jobless people in the UK has dropped below pre-pandemic levels. The ONS said there were 1.34 million unemployed in the three months to January, below the 1.36 million recorded in December to February 2020. The unemployment rate fell to 3.9% in the most recent quarter, while job vacancies hit another record high. But according to the ONS,external, employees' regular pay, excluding bonuses, grew by 3.8% between November and January from a year earlier. However, the rising cost of food, energy and household goods has pushed inflation, which measures how the cost of living changes over time, to a 30-year high.Prices surged by 5.5% in the 12 months to January, up from 5.4% in December, increasing pressure on household budgets. The Resolution Foundation think tank has warned that the squeeze on workers will get worse, with those on the lowest incomes most likely to be affected by surging bills. Why are prices rising so quickly? Borrow billions or see incomes hit, Sunak told Fury after Bank boss says don't ask for big pay rise The ONS said its latest figures showed the number of unemployed people fell below pre-pandemic levels for the first time, while there was another strong rise in the number of pay-rolled employees in February. Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, added: ""However, the number of people out of work and not looking for a job rose again, meaning total employment remained well below its pre-pandemic level. ""We have seen yet another record number of job vacancies, and with the redundancy rate falling to a new record low, demand for workers remains strong."" The ONS said early estimates for February 2022 indicated that median monthly pay was Â£2,041, an increase of 5.1% compared with the same period last year. ""The issue is not that pay growth is weak, it's that prices are running even higher,"" Mr Fitzner told the BBC's Today programme. Recent research by the Institute for Fiscal Studiessuggested that public sector workers in particular are facing pay cuts once rising prices are taken into account. Gamu Nyasoro is a medical educator with the NHS Gamu Nyasoro, says her pay rise is barely noticeable once increasing council tax, energy and food bills are taken into account. As a single mother to three children, a lot of her outgoings are spent on childcare. ""I look at my pay cheque and you literally want to cry because you know that by day two, the things that you need to pay have gone out and you are literally left with no money."" She says finances are now a constant worry. Her forecast energy bill for the next year has nearly doubled. She was recently also forced to use a foodbank for the first time. ""It was one of the most scariest thing that I've done and something that I didn't do lightly."" You can't sugar-coat this. It's been widely predicted that living standards would fall as a result of rising inflation. Before inflation, the average pay rise was 3.8% excluding bonuses - substantially more than most workers have been used to over the past decade. However, because prices are now rising faster than that, the average wage (now Â£555 per week) can buy fewer goods and services than a year ago. After allowing for inflation, it amounts to a real terms pay cut of 1% across the board. That average hides a growing gap between the private sector, where bonuses have lifted total pay by 5.3% including bonuses, enough to keep up with the rising cost of living, and the public sector, where total pay rose by only 2.4% and living standards are falling more sharply. We've only just got over the worst decade for improvements in living standards in 200 years. Now, once again, living standards for most workers are falling. And that's before what's anticipated in the coming weeks - a rise in interest rates, rising energy bills and higher taxes. Ben Harrison, director of the Work Foundation, said: ""Rising prices and the energy cap increase in April will affect all households across the UK, but it will acutely impact those in low paying and insecure employment."" He called on the chancellor to use the Spring Statement on 23 March to support those most at risk by, for example, increasing Universal Credit payments. The British Chamber of Commerce suggested that Rishi Sunak should use the Spring Statement to delay a planned rise in National Insurance contributions by one year, to give firms a bit of financial headroom in the face of rising costs. Responding to the new figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""I am confident that our labour market is in a good position to deal with the current global challenges. ""We know people are concerned about the rising cost of living so alongside continuing to help people find great jobs - we're providing direct support worth more than Â£20bn this financial year and next."" This video can not be played Bank of England boss: 'Donât ask for a big pay rise' Other experts also suggested that action was needed to help older people in particular. Separate research published by the ONS shows that a significant number of older workers have dropped out of the workforce for a mix of reasons, such as long-term sickness or those taking early retirement. However, some analysts said the strength in the labour market overall meant the Bank of England was likely to increase interest rates on Thursday. Martin Beck of the EY Item Club said the Bank might be worried that a tight jobs market could see workers asking for higher wages to off-set budget pressures. Earlier this year, the Bank's governor came under fire for suggesting that workers should not ask for big pay rises, to try to stop prices rising out of control.

"Ukraine is facing a severe economic contraction The Ukrainian economy could shrink by more than a third this year if the war with Russia continues, the International Monetary Fund said. The global lending body said the country is already facing a downturn of 10% due to the invasion, which has hit major cities, destroyed airports and precipitated a refugee crisis. The IMF recently sent $1.4bn in emergency funds to Ukraine - the maximum allowed under its rules. Billions more will be needed, it said. The dire economic outlook for Ukraine was included in a report prepared before the emergency loan was approved last week. The estimates were calculated by looking at wartime economies in countries such as Lebanon, Iraq and Syria. ""With the war ongoing, the situation remains extremely fluid, and any forecast is at this stage subject to massive uncertainty,""  the report said, predicting the economy could contract by between 25% to 35%. It said the estimates in the report should be ""seen as a bare minimum"". In 2014 and 2015, Ukraine also suffered economic shock, with output falling 6.6% and 10% respectively, following Russia's annexation of Crimea. But Ukraine's economy, which is heavily dependent on exports, expanded 3% last year, lifted by a record grain harvest. Output had been expected to grow another 3.6% in 2022. Now, the IMF said: ""A deep recession and large reconstruction costs are to be expected, on the backdrop of a humanitarian crisis."" For now, the government has prioritised defence and social spending and remained current on its foreign debt obligations, according to the 7 March report. Companies are still paying taxes and money is still flowing through its financial system, though many bank branches have shut and authorities have had to take emergency measures. The country is likely to struggle even more, the report warned. The IMF plans to set up tools to help its members send money to help Ukraine, which has already spent the equivalent of $1.4bn to service and repay the government's foreign debt since the start of the war, IMF officials said. In an interview with the BBC, the head of Ukraine's central bank Kyrylo Shevchenko said Russian assets frozen in foreign countries, as a result of sanctions, should be used to help rebuild the country. ""The need for money will be huge,"" he told the BBC. ""It could be fulfilled through loans and grants from multinational organisations and direct help from other countries. However, a large share of financing is needed to be obtained as a reparation from the aggressor, including funds that are currently frozen in our allied countries.""

"Boris Johnson arrives at a meeting of northern European leaders in London Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the West made a ""terrible mistake"" and let President Vladimir Putin ""get away"" with annexing Crimea in 2014. Writing in the Telegraph, Mr Johnson said ending the West's dependence on Russian oil and gas was vital to end Kremlin ""bullying"". It comes as the UK banned exports of luxury goods to Russia among other sanctions. About 100 more people are also expected to be sanctioned under a new law. The legislation allows the UK to target individuals alongside the US and the European Union, which hassigned off its fourth package of sanctions against Russia,external. In addition, Mr Johnson said the only way to halt President Putin's ""continuous blackmail"" was by ending western reliance on Russian fossil fuels - a process that would be ""painful"". The prime minister is preparing to head to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf for talks about increasing production of oil and gas to compensate for reduced Russian supplies. Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions? How sanctions have changed everyday life in Russia He also said hispromised Energy Security Strategy for the UKwould step up wind energy, exploit solar power and make a ""series of big new bets"" on nuclear energy. Further drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea was one suggestion he made. The UK is to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022. A decision by the government to talk to Saudi Arabia about measures to bring down the cost of energy has been criticised by many MPs after the country executed 81 people at the weekend. Downing Street says the UK ""will continue to raise human rights abuses"" with Saudi Arabia. The prime minister chaired cabinet meeting this morning before hosting a summit of northern European leaders in London. The leaders of those countries, which form a security alliance called the Joint Expeditionary Force, will consider what steps they can take to help Ukraine and shore up their own resilience against Russia. In a video call to those leaders, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Nato alliance had been ""hypnotised by Russian aggression"" and repeated his plea for western military intervention. While he welcomed the latest western sanctions, Mr Zelensky said they ""are not enough"" to end the war and called for a full trade embargo on Russia. Boris Johnson is talking about taking back control again, but this time of the country's energy supply and, along the way, increasing efforts to make the UK a ""net zero"" carbon emitter. ""Green electricity isn't just better for the environment, it's better for your bank balance,"" says the prime minister in his article in the Daily Telegraph. ""There's nothing [Putin] can do to stop the North Sea wind."" Mr Johnson has been talking about making the UK ""the Saudi Arabia of wind"" for some time now so this is not a new policy, but it would represent a significant acceleration of the move towards low carbon power. Yes, he is backing new drilling in the North Sea, but there's also the promise of ""big new bets"" on nuclear power and - a surprise for many - no mention of the return of fracking, a controversial method of shale gas mining. In his article in the Telegraph,external, Mr Johnson said: ""When Putin invaded Ukraine the first time round, in 2014, the West made a terrible mistake. The Russian leader had committed an act of violent aggression and taken a huge chunk out of a sovereign country - and we let him get away with it."" Mr Putin ordered the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 after months of protests against its pro-Russian president culminated in his ousting. He then backed an eastern rebellion by pro-Russian separatists, who have fought Ukrainian forces in an eight-year war that has claimed 14,000 lives. Despite years of western sanctions, Russia remains firmly in control of Crimea, which it absorbed following a referendum vote discredited by much of the international community. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine last month, a growing number of Russians have been sanctioned by the UK. Most recently,386 Russian MPs who voted to recognise two rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine as independent have been hitby asset freezes and UK travel bans. Russia has maintained its grip on Crimea despite years of western sanctions In its latest sanctions, the EU has agreed bans on any transactions with certain Russian state-owned enterprises and the export of luxury goods to ""directly hit Russian elites"". Sources have told the BBC that the EU's measures will target Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich,who has already been sanctioned by the UK. Co-ordinated with western allies, the sanctions ""will further contribute to ramping up economic pressure on the Kremlin and cripple its ability to finance its invasion of Ukraine"", the European Commission said. BBC Brussels correspondent Jessica Parker says the EU has gone farther and faster than many expected, although there is a growing rift between cautious countries and those like Poland and the Baltic states, who want even stronger measures. On Tuesday,the UK announced new sanctions,externalthat mirrored the EU's in several areas, including the export ban on luxury goods such as high-end fashion and works of art. As part of these measures, Russian vodka and hundreds of other goods worth Â£900m were hit with an additional 35% import tariff. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the new tariffs ""will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade"". On top of this, the UK's fast-tracked Economic Crime Bill, which passed through Parliament the early hours of Tuesday, will now allow the UK to automatically sanction those who have had their assets already frozen by the EU, US or Canada. This will potentially open the door to hundreds more individual sanctions. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is likely to announce new measures on Tuesday on more than 100 individuals with links to President Putin's regime, the BBC understands. Speaking to BBC's Hardtalk, senior Conservative and chair of the Defence Select Committee Tobias Ellwood said sanctions on Russia would lead members of the Russian elite and generals to ""recognise there is no future for Russia"" and Mr Putin would ""eventually go"". However, Mr Ellwood warned that ""until then, he will cause absolute carnage in Ukraine and beyond unless we stand up to him"".

"The arrivals process into England is set to become easier for travellers The transport secretary has confirmed that all remaining Covid travel measures will be scrapped. Currently, everyone travelling to the UK must complete a passenger locator form before they arrive. Travellers who are not fully vaccinated have to take a Covid test before departure, fill in the form, and book and pay for a PCR test after arriving. Grant Shapps confirmed in a tweet that these rules will end at 04:00 on Friday. His announcement means that passengers who are not fully vaccinated will no longer have to take Covid tests before and after travelling to the UK. The passenger locator form will no longer be necessary either. People planning an overseas trip will still need to be aware of other countries' entry rules. Mr Shapps tweeted: ""These changes are possible due to our vaccine rollout and mean greater freedom in time for Easter."" When any new Covid strains appear in the future, the government said its default approach would be to use ""the least-stringent measures"" for restricting travel. Its ""Living with Covid"" plan said new measures at the border would only be considered in ""extreme circumstances"". It said the UKHSA would closely monitor the prevalence and spread of Covid variants. What are the UK's 'Living with Covid' plans? Scotland and Wales have agreed to follow England in scrapping the remaining coronavirus border measures. But Welsh Health Minister Eluned Morgan said she was doing so ""reluctantly"" - and was ""extremely disappointed"" that testing requirements and the passenger location form were being ditched. The Scottish government said consistency across the four nations was agreed because of the ""negative impact of non-alignment on the tourism industry"". Testing requirements for fully-vaccinated arrivals into the UK were dropped in February. The latest move was welcomed by some figures in the travel industry, which has campaigned forthe remaining rules to be droppedso businesses can take full advantage of strong summer holiday demand. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of trade body Airlines UK, said: ""Today's announcement sends a clear message to the world - the UK travel sector is back. ""With travellers returning to the UK no longer burdened by unnecessary forms and testing requirements, we can now look forward to the return to pre-Covid normality throughout the travel experience."" A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: ""The removal of all remaining UK travel restrictions is the final important step towards frictionless air travel, helping to further restore consumer confidence as we welcome more customers back to the skies this spring and summer. ""To uphold the experience of all travellers, it's vital that the UK Government works closely with industry to ensure the UK border is ready for increasing passengers, as international travel ramps up."" Meanwhile, Eurostar's chief executive Jacques Damas said the easing of restrictions would help the cross-Channel train operator's recovery. ""We hope and expect to see the UK's approach replicated across our other markets in the coming weeks,"" Mr Damas said. However, as Covid restrictions recede, other headwinds for the aviation industry are appearing. The price of jet fuel has soared as a result of higher crude oil prices. This adds to cost pressures on airlines, although some have been protected by their hedging strategies, whereby they purchased fuel in advance at lower prices. On Friday, the chief executive of Heathrow airport, John Holland-Kaye, said the recovery of aviation remained ""overshadowed by war and Covid uncertainty"". Businesses will also be keeping a careful eye on whether consumers' confidence to book is knocked by the war in Ukraine and rising household bills squeezing disposable incomes.

"The previous two years had each seen about 3.8 million referrals The number of referrals for specialist NHS mental health care reached a record high in England by the end of 2021, an analysis suggests. The Royal College of Psychiatrists says the pandemic has led to unprecedented demand and backlogs and services are struggling to keep up. There were 4.3 million referrals, for conditions such as anxiety and depression, in 2021,NHS Digital,externalsays. Just under a quarter - 1.025 million - were for children or adolescents. Child mental health: Huge rise in severe cases, BBC analysis reveals The previous two years had each seen about 3.8 million referrals. The college said the NHS had delivered 1.8 million mental health consultations in December 2021, as the Omicron variant of Covid-19, first identified in South Africa, spread across the UK. But an estimated1.4 million people were still waiting,externalfor treatment. And hundreds of adults were being sent far from home for treatment because of a lack of beds in their area. President Dr Adrian James said: ""As the pressure on services continues to ratchet up, the silence from government continues to be of grave concern for the college, the wider mental health workforce and, most importantly, our patients. ""The warning of the long tail of mental ill health caused by the pandemic has not been heeded. ""Many thousands of people will be left waiting far too long for the treatment they need unless the government wakes up to the crisis that is engulfing the country. ""Staff are working flat out to give their patients the support they need but the lack of resources and lack of staff mean it's becoming an impossible situation to manage. ""We don't need warm words or empty commitments. ""We need a fully funded plan for mental-health services, backed by a long-term workforce plan, as the country comes to terms with the biggest hit to its mental health in generations."" Marjorie Wallace from the mental health charity SANE said: ""We need urgent action or our failures to act now may leave us with a lost generation. The huge rise in the number of referrals last year, including more than one million children, suggests that we are sleepwalking into a crisis. ""Mental health staff are so depleted and on their knees that we know of patients and families told they have to wait until something terrible happens before action is taken."" A government spokesperson said: ""We are committed to ensuring everyone is able to access the help and advice they need, which is why we are investing an additional Â£2.3 billion a year into mental health services by 2023/24, on top of the Â£500 million we have made available to address the impact of the pandemic.
