"Former prime minister Sir John Major has described the contaminated blood scandal as ""incredibly bad luck"", drawing gasps from families watching him give evidence under oath to the public inquiry into the disaster. Up to 30,000 people contracted HIV and hepatitis C in the 1970s and 80s after being given blood treatments or transfusions on the NHS. Thousands have since died. Sir John later apologised for his choice of language. He said: ""I obviously caused offence inadvertently this morning when I referred to the fact that it was awful that people had been fed infected blood and I referred to it as sheer bad luck. ""I can only say to people it wasn't intended to be offensive. I was seeking to express the fact that I was concerned about what happened. ""It was intended simply to say that it was a random matter and I perhaps expressed it injudiciously."" He appeared before the inquiry to answer questions about the government's actions, including decisions on financial assistance for those affected by the contaminated blood incident. The public inquiry into the scandal, chaired by former judge Sir Brian Langstaff, started taking evidence in April 2019 with hearings in Belfast, Leeds, Cardiff, Edinburgh and London. It is expected to publish its final report in mid-2023.

"Rescuers used ladders to reach trapped and injured passengers At least three people have been killed and dozens more are reported injured after a passenger train derailed after hitting a truck in Missouri. About 243 passengers were on board the Los Angeles-Chicago train when it came off the tracks at a rail crossing near the town of Mendon. Seven cars and two locomotives were derailed in the incident, which took place at 12:42 local time (17:52 GMT). Emergency crews from the area have been dispatched to the scene. In a statement, Amtrak - the US national rail operator - said that the ""Southwest Chief"" train travelling eastward from Los Angeles struck ""a truck that was obstructing a public crossing"" near Mendon, a town of approximately 160 people located 84 miles (135km) from Kansas City. Twelve crew members were also on board. Missouri Highway Patrol officials confirmed that two people on the train and one person in the truck were killed in the collision. A member of the local ambulance service said at least 50 people were injured. ""It all happened like slow motion. It started to rock... and then flicker, and then it just all of a sudden - all this dust was through my window,"" Robert Nightingale, who had been asleep in the train, told CNN. Amtrak said that its incident response team had been activated and additional emergency personnel are being sent to the scene, where an investigation is ongoing. Allow Twitter content?

The incident comes one day after an Amtrak train crashed into a car in Brentwood, California, killing three women and injuring several others. Though derailments of Amtrak trains are rare, there have been several in recent years. In September last year, a train derailment in Montana killed three people and injured dozens more. In 2018, three people were killed when an Amtrak train travelled onto the wrong track and hit a parked freight train.

"Barristers in criminal cases have gone on strike across England and Wales in a long-running dispute over pay. Eight out of 10 cases at London's Old Bailey were disrupted by the walkout, barristers outside the court said. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said the strikes will ""delay justice"", as courts already face a backlog of 58,000 cases. Barristers have rejected a proposed 15% rise in their fees for undertaking legal aid work and will be taking action over the next four weeks. Members of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA) have said this is too low and called for a minimum 25% wage increase. Jo Sidhu QC, chair of the CBA, said they had already lost a quarter of specialist criminal barristers over the last five years, with 300 leaving last year. Richard Atkins QC, former chair of CBA, read a statement outside Birmingham Crown Court Kirsty Brimelow QC, deputy chair of the CBA, said the proposed rise in legal aid fees would not be introduced until the end of next year. By then, she told the BBC, it would be too late to help and would not do enough to stem the flow of junior barristers leaving the bar. Under the legal aid system, the government pays for barristers to ensure suspects who cannot afford lawyers are properly advised and represented. The government sets pay rates for barristers doing legal aid work. Dozens of barristers have been rallying outside the Old Bailey in their robes and wigs, as two murder trials at the court - one involving a teenage suspect - were unable to get under way. Others have been striking outside a number of high-profile courts, including Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff and Bristol Crown Courts. Strike leaves defendants facing court delays Barristers in Wales walk out of courts Those joining picket lines have been warned by the most senior judge in England and Wales, The Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett, that they could face disciplinary proceedings for misconduct if they don't turn up to court. Chair of the CBA, Jo Sidhu QC, told striking colleagues they were ""engulfed in a crisis of epic proportions"" Downing Street urged barristers to agree to the proposed 15% pay rise, which a spokesperson said would see a typical barrister earn around Â£7,000 more a year. But Ms Brimelow, speaking outside Manchester Crown Court, told the BBC the system had run on ""good will"" for a long time, including throughout the pandemic, with junior barristers working ""ridiculous hours."" She said the issue had been ""caused by government, not by barristers."" The strikes start with walkouts on Monday and Tuesday and, for four weeks, increase by one day each week until a five-day strike is held from Monday 18 July to Friday 22 July. Barristers are self-employed and often perceived as highly-paid. The median salary for a criminal barrister in the year 2019-20 was Â£79,800,according to an independent review.,external But that figure falls to a range of Â£55,900 to Â£62,900 once expenses are accounted for. Meanwhile, new criminal barristers can earn as little as Â£9,000 once costs, including transport, are factored in, while some barristers say the time they spend preparing cases means their hourly earnings are below minimum wage. Barristers with zero, one or two years of practise earned a median of Â£25,100 before expenses and a net figure of Â£18,800 after expenses. Lawyers who work in other areas, such as private corporate law, can expect to earn Â£100,000 a year from very early in their careers. Junior barristers are working for a ""pittance"" - and sometimes for nothing at all if cases are adjourned, barrister and author Chris Daw told BBC News. He said that the 15% pay rise proposed by the government would not ""touch the sides"" and will be ""wiped out by inflation"" by the time it comes into effect. If nothing changes, he said strike action could go on until August ""or beyond"". The number of lawyers working in criminal justice - both barristers who appear before judges in courts and solicitors who instruct them - has declined over the last decade, as many say they cannot make a living when they take on cases funded by legal aid. Barrister Claire Stevenson is picketing alongside colleagues at the Old Bailey in central London Junior criminal barrister Claire Stevenson says she finds out which court she'll be attending the day before - and any case could include reading hundreds of pages of documents. ""It may be that you have to spend the whole night reading... to ensure that you are acting in the best interests of your client,"" she tells the BBC. Criminal barristers get paid for their preparation and the trial, as well as additional payments per day worked. But she says lots of other unseen work means they're not paid enough: ""People think you turn up on the day of the trial good to go - you don't."" When she began her career a few years ago she was paid about Â£12,000 a year, but since then has started working in other areas of law as the money ""just simply wasn't enough to pay my bills"". There were 567 criminal trials, including 60 sexual offence cases, unable to go ahead last year as there were no barristers to prosecute and defend them, according to Ms Brimelow. And as of the end of April, there was a backlog of 58,271 cases, according to HM Courts and Tribunal Service. This video can not be played Two young lawyers share their concerns about the profession Mr Raab said the strikes were ""regrettable"" and only 43.5% of CBA members voted for the ""most disruptive option"". More than 81% of the 2,055 CBA members who cast their vote supported industrial action, and 53.4% of those also voted to refuse new cases and ""return work"" - stepping in and picking up court hearings for other colleagues. The strike follows the three days of industrial action on Britain's railway network last week -the largest of its kind in 30 years. Additional reporting by Natasha Preskey and Dulcie Lee.

"Government plans to override parts of the Brexit deal relating to Northern Ireland have passed their first hurdle in Parliament. By 295 votes to 221, MPs gave initial approval to a controversial bill allowing ministers to scrap parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol. It comes despite warnings, including from former PM Theresa May, that it breaches international law. The move also risks fresh tensions with the EU, which has taken legal action. But Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said there was no other option to ""fix"" problems the deal has created. The bill would allow ministers to change the part of 2019 deal that introduced post-Brexit checks on goods sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Those were designed to avoid checks at the UK's border with the Republic of Ireland, but they are highly unpopular among unionists in Northern Ireland. Why could parts of the Brexit deal be ditched? UK reveals plans to ditch parts of EU Brexit deal Brexit and Northern Ireland: What does each side want? The bill began its journey through Parliament on Monday, with MPs voting to give it initial approval and allowing it to progress for further scrutiny. The government won the vote with a majority of 74, with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MPs supporting the bill. Voting lists showed no Conservative MPs voted against the bill. However during the debate, some joined opposition MPs in warning that the legislation breaches international law. Ms Truss argued the bill was justified because the EU had not shown enough ""flexibility"" during negotiations change the relevant part of the 2019 deal, known as the Northern Ireland Protocol. She told MPs that ministers expected the passing of the bill to lead to the resumption of power-sharing in Northern Ireland, which has been put on hold since May's assembly elections. Nationalist party Sinn FÃ©in won the most seats in May's elections, but the DUP, which came second, is refusing to re-enter a power-sharing executive until its concerns about the protocol are addressed. Speaking to reporters earlier, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the party would ""consider what steps we can take"" in terms of returning, if the bill gets through all its Commons stages intact. Speaking in favour of the bill during the Commons debate, he said the protocol had had a ""devastating impact"" on Northern Ireland. Ms Truss added that the bill was justified by the ""worsening situation"" in Northern Ireland, and the UK had been left with ""no other choice"" because the EU had ruled out changes to the text of the 2019 agreement the UK had signed. She added that the move was legal because changes to the protocol were required to preserve Northern Ireland's 1998 Belfast/Good Friday peace agreement. Theresa May said the bill would damage the UK's reputation internationally. However, Ms May - who as prime minister started Brexit negotiations in 2017 before quitting in 2019 after failing to get her exit deal passed in Parliament - said the bill would fail to achieve its aims. She questioned the argument that a legal principle of necessity allows for the government's plans, saying: ""Necessity suggests urgent... There is nothing urgent about this bill. ""It has not been introduced as emergency legislation. It's likely to take not weeks but months to get through Parliament."" She said she had concluded it was ""not legal"", and would ""diminish the standing of the United Kingdom in the eyes of the world"". She told MPs she ""cannot support"" the plans. Voting lists show she did not take part in the vote, suggesting she may have abstained. Fellow Tory Simon Hoare, who chairs the Commons Northern Ireland Committee, said the bill represented ""playing fast and loose with our international reputation"" - whilst former Tory international development secretary Andrew Mitchell said it ""brazenly breaks"" the UK's obligations. Labour opposed the bill, with shadow foreign secretary David Lammy saying it would alienate the UK's allies, and risk a trade war with the EU during a cost-of-living crisis. Although stating that the EU had been ""too rigid as well,"" he said it would be better for the UK to continue negotiations with the EU. Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he believed the bill on the Northern Ireland Protocol could be passed by the end of the year. Speaking to the BBC at the G7 summit in Germany, Mr Johnson said the government's plan could be carried out ""fairly rapidly"". The government is aiming to fast-track the bill through the House of Commons before the summer recess in mid-July. It is expected to face stern opposition in the House of Lords, however - with Mr Hoare predicting it could take until next spring to get it through Parliament. The bill has also prompted a backlash from the EU, which said it would berestarting legal actionagainst the UK after the legislation was published. The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal: it means lorries don't face checkpoints when they go from Northern Ireland (in the UK) to the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) Instead,when goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales), they are checked against EU rules The UK and the EU chose this arrangement because theIrish border is a sensitive issuedue to Northern Ireland's troubled political history Read more:A simple guide to the Brexit border problem What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

"The money offered by the Welsh government is thought to be the largest amount offered by a basic income pilot scheme A Â£20m experiment offering a basic income to young people leaving care will launch in Wales on Friday. From 1 July, the Welsh government will offer about 500 18-year-olds Â£19,200 a year before tax - no strings attached. One care leaver said the cash would be a ""safety blanket"" and others hope it will help give the 18-year-olds a good start. But the Welsh Conservatives feared the scheme could create more problems than it solves. Officials plan to analyse the scheme to see if the money - roughly in line with the living wage - can help the youngsters settle into independent living. Research suggests care leavers are at greater risk of homelessness and mental health problems. It is the latest attempt to test the basic income concept of unconditional financial support - promoted by some as an alternative to existing welfare systems. The Welsh government believes the cash offered is the highest amount provided on a basic income pilot anywhere in the world. The income will count against benefits and youngsters who receive the money will pay the basic rate of tax, despite Welsh government hopes that UK ministers would disregard the scheme for both. It works out at Â£1,600 a month - or Â£1,280 once tax is taken into account. Chloe said the cash was a ""safety blanket"", and Chelsea said the money would make a ""big difference"" Some of those who will benefit include care leavers Chloe and Chelsea. Chloe, who has been in care since she was seven, has plans to go to university. She said the scheme will be ""really helpful"". ""I want to do a course in youth work. I think this scheme will help out financially and allow me to do stuff I probably wouldn't be able to do."" She said she had been ""quite lucky"" with the support of foster family, ""but I do know there are some care leavers that don't have the family support that I do"". The cash will go towards paying for things like food, but she hopes to save some too. ""If I'm in university it can help me buying stuff for my studies."" She said the money would be a ""safety blanket"" and felt ""very lucky"" to be taking part. What is a universal basic income? Young care leavers to get Â£1,600 a month in scheme Could this be the future of welfare? Chelsea has been in care since she was about four years old. She told BBC Wales that, as she's moving out soon, much of the basic income will go on rent. She too hopes to save some of it as well. Chelsea hoped to get a job while on the scheme: ""I'm applying for anything at the moment."" She said she ""can't wait"" to be an independent adult, and added the money would make a ""big difference"". Rhian said the pilot will give care leavers a ""kickstart"" Former care leaver Rhian, who will not receive the money herself, was among those involved in helping officials put the pilot together. She left care during the pandemic. ""I was made homeless and I then got a place, about a year ago, and I couldn't afford the bills or anything, so then I had to move out again,"" she said. Rhian said care leavers were often limited in the amount of support they can get: ""It is a big change for us as care leavers from going from loads of support to basic support. ""It will definitely give people turning 18 this year a kickstart to what real life is and give them support around budgeting."" The scheme will run until 2025 - it will cost about Â£20m and will be offered to young people leaving care and turning 18 between 1 July and 30 June. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said the pilot could be used as the basis for arguing for a scheme ""of a wider scale"", if the ""promises that are set out for basic income have been realised in practice"". He said care leavers receiving the cash will be able to make decisions that make an investment in their future, in things like jobs and education. Mr Drakeford promised that ""advice and guidance"" will be available to the care leavers on the scheme for up to two years and said the programme could save taxpayers money. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that young people leaving care were ""over-represented in the prison population and over-represented in the mental health population"". ""We ended up spending a huge amount of money dealing with the consequences of failures,"" he said. ""This is an attempt to move that money out of that part of the spectrum and put it upfront, in which we invest in those young people's futures, so that they are able to make best use of their talents."" Mark Drakeford said the pilot could be the basis of a scheme in the future Basic income schemes have been piloted around the world to see whether they work better than existing systems of welfare. Supporters of the ""universal basic income"" concept - where everyone in an area gets a sum of cash regardless of means - say it could help avoid ""benefit traps"" where people lose money by going into work. The rise in automation has motivated some backers, who say a basic income could help provide financial support when work becomes tougher to find. Small experiments have been triedin Kenya, Finland and California. Welsh ministers announced plans to test out the promise of a basic income in 2021, but they were criticised after it emerged they wanted to focus on care leavers rather than a broader group. Officials want to see if a basic income is useful in helping young people leaving the care system, who often face challenges in finding a stable home and getting a job. The Welsh government stopped calling the scheme ""universal"" when it announcedits plans in February. Researchers will be commissioned from the autumn to look at the impact of the project, surveying and interviewing the individuals involved. About 500 are expected to be eligible, but involvement will be voluntary so take-up could be smaller. Welfare is not devolved and the Welsh Labour government has devised the scheme without the support of the UK government, which controls most benefits in Wales. This video can not be played A basic income experiment in Finland saw 2,000 people paid â¬560 (Â£490) a month, instead of their unemployment benefit. For the Welsh Conservatives, Joel James told the Senedd giving ""some extremely vulnerable people with complex needs"" Â£1600 a month could make things worse for them in the long-term. The MS for South Wales Central said that without the right support the care leavers could be exploited and abused by others. He said ""a very small proportion"" had drug dependency issues and ""such a large sum of money"" could actually worsen existing issues. Mr James added that the Welsh government was creating ""a cliff edge"" for care leavers who will ""simply have their money stopped after two years"". Luke Fletcher, Plaid Cymru's economy spokesman, welcomed the plans. ""We look forward to seeing the positive effect this will have on the lives of those taking part, which I'm sure it will,"" he said. ""As we begin this pilot, it's important that Welsh government makes clear how they will support the care leavers taking part in this pilot not just during it but also once the trial has ended.""

"Rescuers used ladders to reach trapped and injured passengers At least three people have been killed and dozens more are reported injured after a passenger train derailed after hitting a truck in Missouri. About 243 passengers were on board the Los Angeles-Chicago train when it came off the tracks at a rail crossing near the town of Mendon. Seven cars and two locomotives were derailed in the incident, which took place at 12:42 local time (17:52 GMT). Emergency crews from the area have been dispatched to the scene. In a statement, Amtrak - the US national rail operator - said that the ""Southwest Chief"" train travelling eastward from Los Angeles struck ""a truck that was obstructing a public crossing"" near Mendon, a town of approximately 160 people located 84 miles (135km) from Kansas City. Twelve crew members were also on board. Missouri Highway Patrol officials confirmed that two people on the train and one person in the truck were killed in the collision. A member of the local ambulance service said at least 50 people were injured. ""It all happened like slow motion. It started to rock... and then flicker, and then it just all of a sudden - all this dust was through my window,"" Robert Nightingale, who had been asleep in the train, told CNN. Amtrak said that its incident response team had been activated and additional emergency personnel are being sent to the scene, where an investigation is ongoing. Allow Twitter content?

"There's mounting evidence that Russian forces in occupied areas of Ukraine have been systematically stealing grain and other produce from local farmers. The BBC has talked to farmers and analysed satellite images and shipping data to track where the grain is going. A few dozen miles from the frontline, Ukrainian farmer Dmytro describes how the business he nurtured over 25 years was lost in four months of Russian occupation. The BBC tried to contact more than 200 farmers whose land is now in Russian-occupied territory. Dmytro - we are not using his real name to protect him from reprisals - was one of the few willing to meet us. ""They stole our grain. They destroyed our premises, destroyed our equipment."" CCTV footage of the moment Russian soldiers arrived at a storage facility He says Russian forces now occupy 80% of the tens of thousands of hectares he farms and accuses them of stealing grain on an industrial scale. CCTV from one of the company's sites captured the moment the Russians arrived. We've blurred some of the surroundings to protect the identities of the farm owners. Later in the footage, one soldier spots a security camera and shoots at it, but misses. Grain trucks were stolen and Dmytro says a couple of them had GPS trackers fitted. We were able to use this data to see they had gone south into Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, and then on to Russia. From the GPS data, both trucks stopped near a storage facility - identified as a site for unloading and storing grain - in the Crimean town of Oktyabrske. In a satellite image from 14 June this year - you can see a line of trucks on the road next to the facility. We can see the storage facility is next to a rail line, which can be used to transport grain either into Russia or down to ports in southern Crimea. The top of the storage site also appears to have the Z symbol - the emblem of Russia's invasion - on the roof. It's very hard to track individual shipments of stolen grain but there is plenty of evidence that much of it goes first to Crimea. There is satellite imagery at two key entry points - at Chonhar and Armiansk - in which you can see a build-up of vehicles, which could be used to transport grain and other produce. An image from the Chonhar entry point taken on 17 June shows a line of trucks more than 5km (three miles) long. This level of road traffic into Crimea is unusual as Ukraine has not had access to the area since it was annexed by Russia in 2014, and has been exporting grain and other products from elsewhere. It might be possible to explain some of the volume of traffic as empty trucks returning from the occupied areas having delivered supplies to Russian troops. But an obvious interpretation is that many of the trucks are carrying grain - or other products like sunflower seeds - taken from Ukrainian farmers. Satellite images of the town of Dzhankoi in Crimea show trucks waiting on a road next to a grain storage facility and near the connected train station. The images show cargo trains - with wagons of the type used to transport grain and other produce - at the station next to the storage facility. Trains from Dzhankoi are connected to the ports of Sevastopol and Kerch, where produce can be moved into Russia or abroad. ""They take grain to the annexed Crimea first, where they transport it to Kerch or Sevastopol [ports], then they load Ukrainian grain on Russian ships and go to the Kerch Strait,"" says Andrii Klymenko, an expert at the Institute for Black Sea Strategic Studies in Kyiv, who regularly monitors movements of ships around Crimea. ""There, in the Kerch Strait [between Crimea and Russia], they transfer Ukrainian grain from small ships on to bulk carriers, where it is mixed with grain from Russia - or in some cases, they sail to this area just to give the appearance they are loading up with Russian grain."" He adds this is then exported with Russian certificates, saying that it's Russian grain. Ships have then often headed on to Syria or Turkey. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has saidthey have investigated claims about Ukrainian grain being shipped to Turkey and so far not found any evidence.,external ""We saw that the ships' port of departure and the origin of the goods is Russia on the records,"" he said. Satellite images from the Avlita grain terminal at the port of Sevastopol in the west of Crimea show a high level of activity throughout June, with yellow material consistent with the colour of grain being loaded on to a series of ships. This video can not be played Evidence of cargo vessels being loaded with grain in the Avlita Grain Terminal, Sevastopol We reviewed images of the same terminal in June over the past few years, and this amount of activity appears to be unusually high. Some experts we spoke to said this activity could only be accounted for by grain transported from Ukraine's mainland. ""Crimea doesn't really grow a lot of grain for export,"" says Mariia Bogonos, agriculture policy expert at the Kyiv School of Economics. It would also not make geographical sense for Russia to use Sevastopol to export its own grain. But Mike Lee, an agriculture expert with Green Square Agro who has worked in both Ukraine and Russia, says some grain coming out of Crimea could be part of a backlog from last year's harvest, kept in storage because of the war. ""Crimea is under Russian control, but supply chains have been affected there as well."" From Crimea, theUS and Ukrainian authorities,externalandmedia reports,externalhave named nine ships believed to have transported stolen Ukrainian grain abroad. Using data from Lloyd's List Intelligence, the BBC has tracked these ships on journeys between Crimea and ports in Turkey and Syria since April. Lloyd's List Intelligence says the vessels have used what maritime specialists would describe as ""deceptive"" sailing practices - switching off their on-board trackers when entering the Black Sea, or moving around the Kerch Strait near Crimea. When their trackers come back online, the ships are sailing south and many report a lower depth in the water, suggesting they've taken on cargo during the blackout. The BBC mapped the journeys of three vessels: the Matros Pozynich and Sormovskiy 48, owned by two companies in Russia, as well as the Finikia, owned by the Syrian General Maritime Authority. We tried to contact the Russian-registered owners of these vessels to ask about the journeys, but did not get a response.  We were unable to get through to the Syrian owners. Despite the gaps in their tracker histories, satellite imagery has revealed where some of the ships have been. Pictures from Maxar show the Matros Pozynich in Sevastopol in Crimea in mid-May. During this trip, it sailed to the Kerch Strait, had a transponder blackout for five days, and then reappeared hundreds of miles south in the Black Sea. It was later pictured in the Syrian port of Latakia - but had its tracking system off. Under the UN's Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), ships must have their trackers switched on at all times, unless it poses a threat to their safety and security - from piracy, for example. Michelle Wiese Bockmann, a market editor at Lloyd's List Intelligence, believes there is no justification for turning off trackers near Crimea or near the Syrian coast. ""This practice is clearly not linked with piracy risks,"" says Ms Bockmann. ""Other ships have their transponders on, so why don't they?"" The BBC has also obtained documents drawn up by the Russian occupying authorities listing farms where grain is to be transferred to them. A separateinvestigation by BBC Russian and BBC Ukrainianhas shown that in some cases, the Russians are forcing Ukrainian farmers to sell grain at prices well below market rates, and sign documents to prove it was purchased ""legally"". While early reports were typically of outright theft by Russian forces, farmers suggest there has been a change in tactics as the Russians realise that if they pay nothing, future harvests could be sabotaged. The farmers say they have to accept the low prices as they have no alternative and need to buy fuel and pay workers. Emilie Pottle, an international law barrister, told the BBC that these actions may violate the Geneva Convention and International Criminal Court (ICC) rules governing occupying powers. We contacted the Russian authorities to ask about these allegations, but have yet to receive a response. However, some officials in Russian-held areashave spoken openly about Ukrainian grain being taken from the areas they now control.

"Ukraine's president addressed the G7 and two EU representatives via video link Leaders of the world's seven richest nations have promised to support Ukraine ""for as long as it takes"" on the second day of a summit in Germany. In a statement, the G7 group also said that Russia must stop blocking food from leaving Ukraine's ports. Addressing the summit via video-link, Ukraine's president appealed for more heavy weapons from Western allies. G7 leaders are under pressure to be united in their approach against increasing Russian aggression. ""We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support and stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,""they said in a strongly worded statement,externalon Monday. ""We remain appalled by and continue to condemn the brutal, unprovoked, unjustifiable and illegal war of aggression against Ukraine by Russia and aided by Belarus."" The G7 leaders - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US - have been joined in Bavaria, Germany by two representatives from the European Union. The high-level talks were held as Russian forces escalated their attacks on Ukraine, where officials said a busy shopping centre was struck by a missilein the central city of Kremenchuk, killing at least ten peopleaccording to the local governor. President Zelensky shared photos of his address to the G7 leaders on Telegram Dialling into the luxury hotel spa where the summit is being held, President Volodymyr Zelensky asked for more heavy weapons for Ukraine and said he hoped the war would be over by the end of the year ""before winter sets in"". There are concerns that harsh winter conditions will make battle conditions tougher for Ukraine's troops. He also urged Western allies to keep the pressure on Russia with more sanctions. In their joint statement, the G7 leaders said they remain committed to ""sustaining and intensifying"" sanctions against President Vladimir Putin's government and enablers in neighbouring Belarus. There will be sanctions on gold and oil exports and also ""targeted sanctions on those responsible for war crimes"", the joint statement said. EXPLAINER:What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? ANALYSIS:Western leaders pledge action on Russia: Do we believe them? The G7 also demanded that the Kremlin allow food to leave Ukraine's ports - and blamed Moscow for rising threats to global food insecurity as a result of the conflict. Much of Ukraine's highly valued grain exports are in danger of rotting in local warehouses as Russian forces continue blocking Ukraine's ports on the Black Sea. ""We urgently call on Russia to cease, without condition, its attacks on agricultural and transport infrastructure and enable free passage of agricultural shipping from Ukrainian ports,"" the G7 statement says. A BBC investigation has also foundevidence that Russian forces in occupied areas of Ukraine have been systematically stealing grainand other produce from local farmers. Speaking from the summit,UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC""the price of freedom is worth paying"" in supporting Ukraine, and that help must continue to be offered to rebuild its economy, export grain and protect its citizens. Earlier on Monday,Mr Johnson was caught on camera making fun of Vladimir Putin- who is a fan of posing shirtless for photos - telling the other world leaders they should ""show [Russia] our pecs"". While the G7 leaders were meeting on Monday, reports emerged thatRussia had defaulted on its debt for the first time since 1998, after missing a $100m payment deadline. However the Kremlin said the issue is ""not our problem"", because the payment had been made in May, but had been blocked by Western sanctions. World leaders have gone out of their way to put on a show of solidarity. The strongly worded statement they issued today suggests they genuinely are united in their conviction that there is only one way forward, and negates suggestions that some were starting to waver in their support for Ukraine. The war is, after all, exacerbating a cost of living crisis which is hurting their voters. It also - for now at least - appears to dismiss the controversial claim, put forward by analysts and politicians worldwide, that the war could end if Ukraine hands over territory taken by Russian troops to Vladimir Putin in exchange for peace. The leaders state that Ukraine, and Ukraine alone, will determine its future, without external pressure. But the ongoing support will come at a price, which is why the G7 is also focusing on attempts to alleviate the impact on global food and energy supplies. And it's why they're trying to intensify pressure on Vladimir Putin, discussing new sanctions aimed at cutting off the sources of revenue paying for his war. But as the German chancellor Olaf Scholz tweeted earlier, tough but necessary decisions lie ahead. Because, given the Russian leader's intransigence to date, their latest demand he withdraw his troops immediately and unconditionally is extremely unlikely to be met.

"Government plans to override parts of the Brexit deal relating to Northern Ireland have passed their first hurdle in Parliament. By 295 votes to 221, MPs gave initial approval to a controversial bill allowing ministers to scrap parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol. It comes despite warnings, including from former PM Theresa May, that it breaches international law. The move also risks fresh tensions with the EU, which has taken legal action. But Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said there was no other option to ""fix"" problems the deal has created. The bill would allow ministers to change the part of 2019 deal that introduced post-Brexit checks on goods sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Those were designed to avoid checks at the UK's border with the Republic of Ireland, but they are highly unpopular among unionists in Northern Ireland. Why could parts of the Brexit deal be ditched? UK reveals plans to ditch parts of EU Brexit deal Brexit and Northern Ireland: What does each side want? The bill began its journey through Parliament on Monday, with MPs voting to give it initial approval and allowing it to progress for further scrutiny. The government won the vote with a majority of 74, with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MPs supporting the bill. Voting lists showed no Conservative MPs voted against the bill. However during the debate, some joined opposition MPs in warning that the legislation breaches international law. Ms Truss argued the bill was justified because the EU had not shown enough ""flexibility"" during negotiations change the relevant part of the 2019 deal, known as the Northern Ireland Protocol. She told MPs that ministers expected the passing of the bill to lead to the resumption of power-sharing in Northern Ireland, which has been put on hold since May's assembly elections. Nationalist party Sinn FÃ©in won the most seats in May's elections, but the DUP, which came second, is refusing to re-enter a power-sharing executive until its concerns about the protocol are addressed. Speaking to reporters earlier, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the party would ""consider what steps we can take"" in terms of returning, if the bill gets through all its Commons stages intact. Speaking in favour of the bill during the Commons debate, he said the protocol had had a ""devastating impact"" on Northern Ireland. Ms Truss added that the bill was justified by the ""worsening situation"" in Northern Ireland, and the UK had been left with ""no other choice"" because the EU had ruled out changes to the text of the 2019 agreement the UK had signed. She added that the move was legal because changes to the protocol were required to preserve Northern Ireland's 1998 Belfast/Good Friday peace agreement. Theresa May said the bill would damage the UK's reputation internationally. However, Ms May - who as prime minister started Brexit negotiations in 2017 before quitting in 2019 after failing to get her exit deal passed in Parliament - said the bill would fail to achieve its aims. She questioned the argument that a legal principle of necessity allows for the government's plans, saying: ""Necessity suggests urgent... There is nothing urgent about this bill. ""It has not been introduced as emergency legislation. It's likely to take not weeks but months to get through Parliament."" She said she had concluded it was ""not legal"", and would ""diminish the standing of the United Kingdom in the eyes of the world"". She told MPs she ""cannot support"" the plans. Voting lists show she did not take part in the vote, suggesting she may have abstained. Fellow Tory Simon Hoare, who chairs the Commons Northern Ireland Committee, said the bill represented ""playing fast and loose with our international reputation"" - whilst former Tory international development secretary Andrew Mitchell said it ""brazenly breaks"" the UK's obligations. Labour opposed the bill, with shadow foreign secretary David Lammy saying it would alienate the UK's allies, and risk a trade war with the EU during a cost-of-living crisis. Although stating that the EU had been ""too rigid as well,"" he said it would be better for the UK to continue negotiations with the EU. Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he believed the bill on the Northern Ireland Protocol could be passed by the end of the year. Speaking to the BBC at the G7 summit in Germany, Mr Johnson said the government's plan could be carried out ""fairly rapidly"". The government is aiming to fast-track the bill through the House of Commons before the summer recess in mid-July. It is expected to face stern opposition in the House of Lords, however - with Mr Hoare predicting it could take until next spring to get it through Parliament. The bill has also prompted a backlash from the EU, which said it would berestarting legal actionagainst the UK after the legislation was published. The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal: it means lorries don't face checkpoints when they go from Northern Ireland (in the UK) to the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) Instead,when goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales), they are checked against EU rules The UK and the EU chose this arrangement because theIrish border is a sensitive issuedue to Northern Ireland's troubled political history Read more:A simple guide to the Brexit border problem What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

"This video can not be played The first minister convened a meeting to discuss options to protect women using clinics The first minister has said legislation will be passed to enforce protester buffer zones at abortion clinics. Nicola Sturgeon gave the Scottish government's backing to a member's bill protecting access to terminations. At a summit in Edinburgh she said people were entitled to differing views on abortion, but women should not be intimidated while accessing healthcare. Ms Sturgeon acknowledged that there would be complexities around making legislation stand up to legal scrutiny. The new legislation would see 150m (164 yard) no-go areas put in outside health facilities. MSP wrong to criticise abortion clinics - Sturgeon Fresh calls for UK abortion clinic buffer zones The first minister had invited councils, charities, police, health professionals and campaigners to the summit on abortion care following calls for action over protests outside clinics. Pro-choice campaigners want to ensure that women can access services without fear, harassment or intimidation. Anti-abortion protesters at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow Ms Sturgeon said she supported the member's bill, introduced by Green MSP Gillian Mackay. She said: ""There's no doubt in my mind we need to aim for legislation in the long term. ""But we need to ensure we get the balance of that right so that it would be capable of withstanding any human rights challenge. ""There's further action we can take, working with councils and the police in the short term, to make sure that women do have access to healthcare. ""There are different views on abortion - we live in a democracy and people are free to have different views on abortion - but what I don't think any of us are free to do is to impede women's right to access healthcare without intimidation and harassment."" The summit follows recent reports of escalating incidents at the Sandyford clinic in central Glasgow. Women's Health Minister Maree Todd, toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme that patients had told her that protests were intimidating. She said: ""Everybody who is accessing healthcare at these sites has to run the gauntlet past them ""We have seen an escalation in behaviour. We have seen really, truly offensive signage being held up, voice amplification across the front of the building. ""People are unable to ignore the protests and we have potentially seen the use of bodycams which is a real invasion of privacy."" Green MSP Gillian Mackay has introduced a member's bill Ms Sturgeon faces some opposition from within her own party. MSP John Mason said he was ""not convinced"" the issue was a problem. He said the protests he had seen were not intimidating and that people did not have to go near them. He said: ""We have to listen to people's experience but there's two types of experience - people who say they are feeling harassed and intimidated, and people who say they are being coerced into abortions and are not being given the pros and cons."" Anti-abortion groups, such as the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, have said they would continue to defend the right to pray in public and offer help to women outside clinics. UK court ruling on NI abortion law due Glasgow Council's abortion protest buffer zone report overdue Lois McLatchie, from the Christian campaigning group ADF UK, told the BBC her volunteers were offering support and advice on alternatives to abortion. She added: ""Buffer zones ban legitimate offers of help and silent prayer and mean women may not be able to access those other options - practical help or financial help. ""Women have the right to hear about these options at the point of need and it is patronising of the government saying women don't want to hear this."" There are fears the recent reversal of abortion rights in the US will ""embolden"" protesters in Scotland However, Alice Murray of pro-choice group Back Off Scotland -  said there was a misunderstanding from some anti-abortion campaigners over what happens at clinic appointments. She said: ""Women don't need to be offered the other side by strangers outside. You are talked through the process and your options by a specific healthcare provider. ""We believe it should be the NHS and healthcare providers who give that information. A lot of the leaflets we see handed out outside these clinics have misinformation on them. ""These people outside can't be trusted to give accurate advice or support. It's highly inappropriate."" The summit came afterthe US Supreme Court struck down the landmark Roe v Wade decision, transforming abortion rights in America and allowing individual states to ban the procedure. Green MSP Gillian Mackay, who introduced Scotland's members' bill, said the US move would ""stop safe abortions and put lives at risk."" She said: ""Here we need to continue to fight for progress. That means buffer zones, telemedical abortion and services safe and accessible for all. ""There is no place for the type of intimidation and harassment we are regularly seeing outside these healthcare facilities at the moment.

"Transport Minister Jenny Gilruth hopes the move will revitalise local services Councils have been given new powers to run their own bus services. From Monday, local authorities have the flexibility to set up services to benefit local communities. Since 1985, local transport authorities have been prevented from running services, but this has been reversed by changes to existing legislation. Local government body Cosla welcomed the move but said it was not a ""magic solution"" and councils ""would need funding to take advantage"". Transport Minister Jenny Gilruth hoped the powers would give councils flexibility and would revitalise local services. Councils will not have to run services themselves under the new set-up, and can instead opt for a partnership or franchise approach. Councils to be given power to run own bus services Two-thirds not signed up for free bus scheme Ms Gilruth said: ""The act was designed to help make Scotland's transport network cleaner, smarter and more accessible than ever before. ""By giving local authorities the flexible tools they need to respond to their own transport challenges, we can deliver a more responsive and sustainable transport system for everyone in Scotland."" Ms Gilruth said the Scottish government was placing buses at the front of its commitment ""to reduce car kilometres"" by 20% by 2030. She highlighted more than Â£500m in long-term funding for bus infrastructure, the rollout of free bus travel for under-22s and investment to encourage a shift to zero-emission buses. Cosla's environment and economy spokeswoman Gail Macgregor said that bus services were the backbone of public transport in Scotland and ""essential to cost effective, low carbon transport"". However, she added: ""The new powers don't offer a magic solution and councils will still need funding to take advantage of them, but they are a step in the right direction, and I am pleased they are being launched today. How Councils can be resourced to use these new powers will be a discussion which we want to have with Scottish government in the weeks to come."" Scottish Labour Transport spokesman Neil Bibby also welcomed the new powers which he highlighted had been handed to councils ""almost three years after they were agreed by this parliament"". He said ""Years of decline have left bus networks across Scotland on the brink of collapse, and Scottish Labour have long fought for councils to get these powers so they can run and regulate services to meet the needs of their area."" But Mr Bibby added: ""The SNP are granting councils new powers with one hand while slashing their budget with the other, leaving councils in an impossible position."" Supporters of the bus network say it's the Cinderella service in public transport, and in desperate need of help.  Every day, far more people travel by bus than train, but they don't get the same attention when things go wrong or the same level of funding per passenger mile. In recent decades, Scotland's bus services have got worse by some measures, with passenger numbers falling, at the same time that bus firms reduced the number of buses they operate, and routes they serve. The root of the problem, say some critics, is Scotland's deregulated bus network, brought in by Margaret Thatcher almost 40 years ago, which leaves it to the firms themselves to decide where services run - based on profit alone. So how to fix the problem? The Scottish government's offering local authorities what it calls ""flexible tools"" to boost local bus services. This includes the power for councils to create partnership deals with bus firms, to fill in gaps in the service. This means funding companies to run buses on neglected routes, which wouldn't otherwise be profitable. There's also the power to allow councils to set up franchise arrangements - like the one which operates in London. This would require bus firms to operate services across several less profitable routes in return for the right to run their buses on the busy profitable lines. It's the model used by CalMac ferries. Finally - there's the nuclear option, with councils getting the right to set up their own ""municipal"" bus service which they run themselves or through a wholly-owned operator. It's what many bus campaigners want. To work properly, a scheme like this might need a region's councils to work together to operate a service, as they already do, to good effect, in the Lothians. But such a scheme faces challenges - not least the upfront cost of establishing a big regional bus operator from scratch. There's also the potential political hurdle of persuading several councils to team up to create a joint venture of this kind. So would a minority SNP council want to join forces with a majority Labour one? But, whatever powers councils may have, much depends on funding. By one recent estimate, train journeys get as much as 10 times the funding per passenger mile as bus journeys. So unless this Cinderella service gets more financial support, it's likely to disappoint.

"Emergency Covid powers required landlords to seek approval for evictions from a tribunal Landlords are warning that new laws on tenant evictions in Scotland could cut the number of rental homes. Emergency powers granted during the Covid pandemic required landlords to seek approval for evictions from a tribunal. MSPs are due to decide whether this should be made permanent. The Scottish Association of Landlords said members would ""lose confidence"" and sell their homes if it goes ahead. The Scottish government said a tribunal process helps prevent homelessness. The final stage of theCoronavirus (Recovery and Reform) Bill,externalwill be debated in the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday. Landlord eviction action will be 'last resort' Charities welcome extended Scottish eviction ban The Scottish Association of Landlords, the National Farmers' Union of Scotland, the National Trust for Scotland and Scottish Land & Estates claim the proposals could backfire. The organisations said up to one in five landlords could withdraw from the market, with rental homes already in short supply. John Blackwood, chief executive of the Scottish Association of Landlords, said: ""We are appealing to our parliamentarians to think again. ""There is a tried and tested eviction process which already works well and protects tenants and landlords. ""There is a very real danger that if this goes ahead landlords will lose confidence and simply sell homes at a time when they are in great need."" Sarah Jane Laing, chief executive of Scottish Land & Estates, said: ""Whether you are a landlord with a single buy to let flat or someone with multiple properties, the prospect of not being able to regain possession of the home you own scares landlords, driving them from the sector and reducing availability of homes for tenants."" The Scottish government said it would continue to seek improvements in the sector to ensure tenants are treated fairly and can access good-quality properties. A spokesperson said: ""Over the last 20 years, there have been a range of necessary changes to the private rented sector aimed at improving quality and accountability. ""Although stakeholders have often warned that such changes would lead to a reduction in supply of private rented homes, the private rented sector has more than doubled over that time. ""Good landlords recognise the case for keeping tenants in their homes where possible, so adding a final check from the tribunal will support responsible management, recognise financial and other pressures that tenants can face and help prevent homelessness.""

Phil Mackie, BBC Midlands correspondent It is a scene of devastation today. The blast destroyed one house and has caused severe damage to several others. Debris is strewn across the street and one car which was upended has now been moved.Â Fire investigators, working alongside specialists from the gas company, have begun sifting through the wreckage as they try to determine what caused the explosion.Â Some residents who were evacuated last night have been allowed to return to their homes this morning to collect any essentials but have been told they may not be allowed to stay in their homes again tonight. Others simply can't access their properties because the damage is so extensive. Ch Insp Monaghan said there were no suspicious circumstances ""at this stage"". Asked about reports the house had been up for sale and that the boiler had needed replacing, fire service area commander Alex Shapland stated: ""That may form part of the investigation. ""As I say, we've got colleagues and professionals who will be looking at all of the different circumstances."" Mr Shapland said a multi-agency inquiry was now under way and added: ""We have searched the properties we can get into.""

"The Welsh government calls the replacement ""robust self-evaluation"" but the Conservatives say it's ""change for the sake of it"" A colour-coding system for measuring how schools in Wales perform is being scrapped. The National School Categorisation System rated schools green, yellow, amber and red depending on how much help they need. The Welsh government said it would be replaced by ""a robust self-evaluation system"" but the Welsh Conservatives called it ""change for the sake of it."" Some head teachers and parents have welcomed the move. Introduced in 2015, the process has been judged for labelling schools and encouraging competition. More schools 'green' in performance ratings School inspections in Wales off until 2022 However, it has been paused during the pandemic. Education Minister Jeremy Miles said with the change, parents would get ""better and more up to date information"" from a summary of each school's improvement priorities and development plan, published on their websites. He said the focus would be on how pupils are progressing ""rather than on headline descriptions"". Tories have argued the colour-coding system was ""a very useful way of tracking the progress of a school"", though said it could be improved. ""The problem has been how it's communicated as to why your school moves from green to red and red to green."" the party's education spokeswoman Laura Anne Jones added. ""I think that the way that is communicated needs to change, but I think the system itself has been very, very good."" She said it not only provided useful information for parents but also for politicians and local government to help support schools. ""We need to make the system work rather than just scrapping it and replacing it with something new."" Ellis says her focus is on the quality of care children are receiving At Amaze Playz play centre in Cardiff, most parents are just beginning to think about where their young children will go to school. Ellis, mother to an 11-month-old daughter, said word of mouth, the quality of care and after school clubs will be more important to her than academic standards. ""Because I'm only looking at primary schools, I think league tables for how the kids do isn't quite on my mind yet because it's more 'is she going to be looked after?' and 'is she going to enjoy it?' and 'are the teachers nice?',"" she said. Former teacher Sam, who has a three-and-a-half-year-old son starting nursery in September, said: ""I personally don't take loads of notice of all those sort of things [school ratings]. ""I guess from being on the inside, being a teacher and I know how they work. ""It's often due to area and intake and all these sort of things and it doesn't always show how good the actual school is."" Sam says the colour coding system does not always truly reflect how a school is performing The new system comes alongside changes to the way Estyn inspects schools - with a move away from giving gradings of excellent, good, adequate and unsatisfactory to an overview of areas for development and strengths. There will also be more frequent inspections from September 2024, the Welsh government said. Ending categorisation has been welcomed by the head teacher of Ysgol Dyffryn Conwy secondary school in Llanrwst, Conwy county. ""Obviously seeing a school that was in a red category compared with amber or even green was certainly looked at as a negative impact on that school,"" said Owain Gethin Davies. He felt it could affect parents' choice of school and the data could be misinterpreted. Parents also wanted to know how their school was doing but there should be a lot more emphasis on how a school promotes young people's wellbeing, he added.

"This video can not be played The RSPCA says there is an issue in Wales with illegal dog breeding The number of investigations into illegal dog breeding in Wales rose by 63% last year, figures have shown. RSPCA Cymru said there were 366 cases being investigated by councils, although prosecutions remained low with figures doubling to just eight. The rise has been more notable since the pandemic. The Welsh government said it was supporting councils in tackling illegal dog breeding, including training of more enforcement officers. Raspberry, a six-month-old English Bulldog, was rescued along with her mother Blackcurrant from an unlicensed breeder. Illegal dog breeder who mutilated puppies jailed Dog charity braced for Â£30,000 monthly vet bill More than 200 dogs rescued from unlicensed breeder She has already had an operation to treat a defective soft palate and is expected to suffer with health complications throughout her life. Both are being cared for by staff at the Hope Rescue centre in Pontyclun, Rhondda Cynon Taf, and are just two of the 219 dogs rescued by this centre alone over the past 12 months. Previously the number has been closer to 30 dogs per year. ""Blackcurrant is three years old and has had a number of puppies,"" said Sara Rosser, head of welfare and adoption at Hope Rescue, which works in partnership with RSPCA Cymru. ""The skin rolls on her head need cleaning or they become infected, she has suffered ear infections and she has also had an operation on her eye since she came here."" She added: ""Unfortunately during Covid we had an explosion in low-welfare breeders, but we are thankful that the public seem to be more aware of animal welfare issues and are reporting those concerns."" Raspberry and Blackcurrant are two of the 219 dogs helped by Hope Rescue in Pontyclun in the past year RSPCA Cymru's figures follow the charity's freedom of information requests to Welsh councils to find out how much of a challenge they are facing It said the figures may only be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to poor puppy breeding practices in Wales, and is calling for more council investigators and for more irresponsible breeders to be sent to prison. ""There is clearly an issue in Wales,"" said RSPCA's Chris O'Brien. ""We know that the early years are so important for puppies in terms of their health and development and their future behaviour and so the conditions in these establishments are crucial and it is disturbing to hear that there has been such a big increase in complaints and investigations. ""We've historically had a problem in Wales with poor breeding standards and practices, and while there are good dog breeders out there these statistics show the problem has not gone away. Indeed the problem has escalated to a concerning level through Covid. ""We do have dog breeding laws in Wales, but we want to see those strengthened."" A spokeswoman for Trading Standards Wales, Alison Farrar, said the ""lack of prosecutions"" does not mean there is a ""problem"". ""I actually see that as a good thing,"" she said, ""because it's only when things are really bad that you have to get as far as a prosecution. Alison Farrar says social media influencers are driving demand for dog breeds, with some people paying up to Â£4,000 for a puppy ""The work of trading standards isn't to go straight for a prosecution,"" Ms Farrar said, explaining its role is to help ""breeders bring their business into compliance"". Ms Farrar said there has been an upsurge in dogs being advertised on social media, including adverts being shared on online groups. ""We want to encourage the public if they see any dogs being advertised anywhere they're not sure we want them to report them to our Crimestoppers line,"" she said. ""We'll go out and check the licensing...  things like the microchips on the dogs to make sure that everything is above board."" The Welsh government said its animal welfare plan for 2021-26 outlined the actions it will take. A spokesman added: ""Our new regulations on pet sales which came into force in September 2021 with funding support for enforcement, work alongside the delivery of existing dog breeding regulations, and are already resulting in lasting improvements to the welfare standards of puppies bred in Wales.""

"Members of the Unite union, employed by Caterpillar in Larne and Belfast, have been on strike since April Caterpillar, the manufacturing company, is making a pay offer directly to its Northern Ireland workforce after failing to reach agreement with a trade union. Members of the Unite union, employed by the firm in Larne and Belfast, have been on strike since April. Caterpillar said it is going directly to the workforce because a 14-month process has not produced a resolution. The firm has emphasised that it was not attempting to de-recognise the union. In a letter to staff it said: ""We are not walking away from our relationship with the union and remain committed to collective bargaining procedures for future terms and conditions."" Caterpillar said it is offering a 9% base salary increase effective from 1 April 2022 and a one-time lump sum equal to 2.6% of wages earned from 1 April 2021 to 1 April 2022. The package also includes an annual opportunity to cash in up to two days of leave. George Brash, Unite regional officer, described the move as ""a direct attack on the trade union"". ""It's just a clear attempt to circumvent the collective bargaining process and its an anti-trade union tactic,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. ""We'll certainly be consulting our members on what the company has proposed as well as looking at all legal avenues to challenge them on it."" A major union objection to the package is that it is tied to a change in overtime arrangements which would involve compulsory overtime to deal with periods of high customer demand. The company says this ""customer-driven overtime"" would come with 30-days notice and no more than 120 hours of overtime in a rolling 12-month period. The union has said the deal also still amounts to a real terms pay cut compared to RPI inflation. A Caterpillar spokesperson said: ""After 14 months of direct meetings with the union, four different mediation sessions through the Labour Relations Agency, and considerable movement from our first offer, we made it clear to Unite and our workforce that the offer on the table was final. ""The negotiations process is now exhausted and we have reached an impasse - all while Unite continues to extend the period of strike action. ""As a result, we've started the process of making direct offers to our workforce."" It is understood each individual worker will be asked to accept the new pay and conditions on a ""take it or leave it"" basis in the coming weeks.

"Government plans to override parts of the Brexit deal relating to Northern Ireland have passed their first hurdle in Parliament. By 295 votes to 221, MPs gave initial approval to a controversial bill allowing ministers to scrap parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol. It comes despite warnings, including from former PM Theresa May, that it breaches international law. The move also risks fresh tensions with the EU, which has taken legal action. But Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said there was no other option to ""fix"" problems the deal has created. The bill would allow ministers to change the part of 2019 deal that introduced post-Brexit checks on goods sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Those were designed to avoid checks at the UK's border with the Republic of Ireland, but they are highly unpopular among unionists in Northern Ireland. Why could parts of the Brexit deal be ditched? UK reveals plans to ditch parts of EU Brexit deal Brexit and Northern Ireland: What does each side want? The bill began its journey through Parliament on Monday, with MPs voting to give it initial approval and allowing it to progress for further scrutiny. The government won the vote with a majority of 74, with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MPs supporting the bill. Voting lists showed no Conservative MPs voted against the bill. However during the debate, some joined opposition MPs in warning that the legislation breaches international law. Ms Truss argued the bill was justified because the EU had not shown enough ""flexibility"" during negotiations change the relevant part of the 2019 deal, known as the Northern Ireland Protocol. She told MPs that ministers expected the passing of the bill to lead to the resumption of power-sharing in Northern Ireland, which has been put on hold since May's assembly elections. Nationalist party Sinn FÃ©in won the most seats in May's elections, but the DUP, which came second, is refusing to re-enter a power-sharing executive until its concerns about the protocol are addressed. Speaking to reporters earlier, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the party would ""consider what steps we can take"" in terms of returning, if the bill gets through all its Commons stages intact. Speaking in favour of the bill during the Commons debate, he said the protocol had had a ""devastating impact"" on Northern Ireland. Ms Truss added that the bill was justified by the ""worsening situation"" in Northern Ireland, and the UK had been left with ""no other choice"" because the EU had ruled out changes to the text of the 2019 agreement the UK had signed. She added that the move was legal because changes to the protocol were required to preserve Northern Ireland's 1998 Belfast/Good Friday peace agreement. Theresa May said the bill would damage the UK's reputation internationally. However, Ms May - who as prime minister started Brexit negotiations in 2017 before quitting in 2019 after failing to get her exit deal passed in Parliament - said the bill would fail to achieve its aims. She questioned the argument that a legal principle of necessity allows for the government's plans, saying: ""Necessity suggests urgent... There is nothing urgent about this bill. ""It has not been introduced as emergency legislation. It's likely to take not weeks but months to get through Parliament."" She said she had concluded it was ""not legal"", and would ""diminish the standing of the United Kingdom in the eyes of the world"". She told MPs she ""cannot support"" the plans. Voting lists show she did not take part in the vote, suggesting she may have abstained. Fellow Tory Simon Hoare, who chairs the Commons Northern Ireland Committee, said the bill represented ""playing fast and loose with our international reputation"" - whilst former Tory international development secretary Andrew Mitchell said it ""brazenly breaks"" the UK's obligations. Labour opposed the bill, with shadow foreign secretary David Lammy saying it would alienate the UK's allies, and risk a trade war with the EU during a cost-of-living crisis. Although stating that the EU had been ""too rigid as well,"" he said it would be better for the UK to continue negotiations with the EU. Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he believed the bill on the Northern Ireland Protocol could be passed by the end of the year. Speaking to the BBC at the G7 summit in Germany, Mr Johnson said the government's plan could be carried out ""fairly rapidly"". The government is aiming to fast-track the bill through the House of Commons before the summer recess in mid-July. It is expected to face stern opposition in the House of Lords, however - with Mr Hoare predicting it could take until next spring to get it through Parliament. The bill has also prompted a backlash from the EU, which said it would berestarting legal actionagainst the UK after the legislation was published.

"It was claimed a suitcase of cash was handed over to Prince Charles The Charity Commission is examining whether it needs to carry out a review of donations received by a charity of the Prince of Wales. The Sunday Times reported that millions of euros in cash were handed over by a former prime minister of Qatar. ""We will review the information to determine whether there is any role for the commission in this matter,"" said the charities regulator. Prince Charles's representatives said ""all correct processes were followed"". The Charity Commission will examine whether it needs to take any action over the claimed donations of a total of three million euros from Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim to Prince Charles's charity, between 2011 and 2015. Some of the money was reported to have been in cash in a suitcase and in carrier bags from the upmarket shop Fortnum and Mason. Former Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker has written to the Metropolitan Police, asking for these latest reports to be included in continuing investigations intoclaims of cash for honours, involving another of the prince's charities. Mr Baker told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it showed Prince Charles was personally involved in accepting money from the Qatari donor. And he said it raised the question of whether there had been any more payments in 95 other meetings since 2011 between the prince and members of Middle Eastern royal families. There have been no suggestions of any wrongdoing but Mr Baker said it looked ""grubby and scuzzy"". ""We really don't think the heir to the throne should be behaving in a way accepting cash in Fortnum and Mason bags behind closed doors in secret. The optics are really terrible,"" he said. The billionaire donor of the cash, Sheikh Hamad, was the prime minister of the wealthy Gulf state of Qatar between 2007 and 2013. As head of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, he had been called ""the man who bought London"" after investments in landmark properties and businesses such as the Shard and Harrods. Prince Charles reported to have accepted suitcase of cash Police to investigate Prince Charles charity Charles's aide quits in honours inquiry The reported donation was for the Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund, which provides grants for conservation, environment, education and social inclusion projects. It's understood that donations were also made by bank draft and there could be a challenge about the details of the amounts and how payments were handed over. More recent financial accounts from the Charity Commission, between 2017 and 2021, show the Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund had an annual income between Â£10m and Â£15m. The charity regulations allow donations to be made in cash and for donors to remain anonymous. But charities would have to carry out due diligence to ensure that the funds were from a legitimate source. ""Charitable donations received from Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim were passed immediately to one of the prince's charities, who carried out the appropriate governance and have assured us that all the correct processes were followed,"" said a statement from Clarence House. Earlier this year the Charity Commission ran a formal inquiry into the charities of Viateschlav Kantor, a billionaire oligarch sanctioned by the UK over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Mr Kantor's charity had madedonations to another of Prince Charles's charities, the Prince's Foundation. Charity records show Â£600,000 was paid to the foundation over two years, as part of a pledge for Â£3m, that had been intended to be paid in stages until 2028. The Prince's Foundation had said it wouldn't comment on individual donations, but donors would have been subject to a process of due diligence, based on what was known at the time.

"Family members of the victims have been gathering at the tavern Yellow police tape now cordons off the drinking place in the South African city of East London where 21 teenagers died in unexplained circumstances. A forensic team has been going through the site at the Enyobeni Tavern to try to understand what exactly took place. There were no visible injuries on the bodies of the deceased, the authorities have said, so a crush seems an unlikely explanation. Some have said the victims were poisoned, but this is not confirmed. South Africa's liquor board has said the owners of the tavern would face criminal charges after allegedly breaching licensing agreements. Some family members of the victims have been gathering at the tavern to try and find out the latest news. Among them was Xolile Malangeni. His 17-year-old daughter, Sinako, snuck out of her home on Saturday night but never returned. ""[She] always loved and took care of me when I was ill,"" her father told the BBC with tears in his eyes. Alongside her there are 20 other victims in a nearby mortuary. Post-mortem examinations have now been completed but one person remains unidentified and the provincial authorities have called on possible family members to come forward. The youngest of those who died was 13 and the oldest was 17, according to Police Minister Bheki Cele - but a detailed list of the victims has not yet been produced. The minimum drinking age in South Africa is 18, so they should not have been allowed in. A forensic team has been inspecting the site where the tragedy happened in the early hours of Sunday ""The venue was packed. Entrance was free... and free alcohol was also being dished out. We started drinking and having fun with others,"" a 16-year-old girl who did not want to be named told the BBC. ""Those that were outside were trying to force their way in. Only two bouncers were at the scene to control the crowd. That's when people started collapsing, they were dropping like flies. ""I thought they were just passing out because they had too much to drink. Many others including myself escaped through the windows. My friends are dead now and we've all been left traumatised."" ""They die[d] as they danced. They dance, fall, and die - literally. Others would just feel dizzy, sleep on the sofa, [and] die,"" South African website News24 quotes Mr Cele as saying on Monday. The tavern, a two-storey building, sits amid residential properties in a densely populated area of East London's Scenery Park township. It has been the focus of a lot of community anger, residents said. They had previously complained to the police about the noise and the late opening hours. It is not clear why there were so many young people there on Saturday night. The owner has been quoted in local media as saying they had come to celebrate the end of school exams, having gone there after a ""pens down"" party ended elsewhere. A birthday party was also being held at the tavern. Two of the victims died either on the way to hospital or in hospital, but the other 19 died inside the venue itself. They were found slumped over tables or on the floor. On Monday afternoon, community members gathered in a church hall near the tavern for a subdued prayer service. Between hymns people spoke about the tragedy of parents burying children. There has been a prayer service and the community has been offered counselling The tavern's entertainment manager, Promise Matinise, told the BBC that he saw people collapsing one after the other in the early hours of Sunday morning. At first he assumed they had passed out from drinking too much and then realised that some had stopped breathing. Earlier, he said, bouncers had struggled to control the large crowds that had entered the establishment. Speaking on Sunday, Oscar Mabuyane, premier of Eastern Cape province where the tragedy happened, did not give possible reasons for the deaths, but condemned the ""unlimited consumption of liquor"". Visiting the scene, he said: ""You can't just trade in the middle of society like this and think that young people are not going to experiment.""

"Ukraine's president addressed the G7 and two EU representatives via video link Leaders of the world's seven richest nations have promised to support Ukraine ""for as long as it takes"" on the second day of a summit in Germany. In a statement, the G7 group also said that Russia must stop blocking food from leaving Ukraine's ports. Addressing the summit via video-link, Ukraine's president appealed for more heavy weapons from Western allies. G7 leaders are under pressure to be united in their approach against increasing Russian aggression. ""We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support and stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,""they said in a strongly worded statement,externalon Monday. ""We remain appalled by and continue to condemn the brutal, unprovoked, unjustifiable and illegal war of aggression against Ukraine by Russia and aided by Belarus."" The G7 leaders - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US - have been joined in Bavaria, Germany by two representatives from the European Union. The high-level talks were held as Russian forces escalated their attacks on Ukraine, where officials said a busy shopping centre was struck by a missilein the central city of Kremenchuk, killing at least ten peopleaccording to the local governor. President Zelensky shared photos of his address to the G7 leaders on Telegram Dialling into the luxury hotel spa where the summit is being held, President Volodymyr Zelensky asked for more heavy weapons for Ukraine and said he hoped the war would be over by the end of the year ""before winter sets in"". There are concerns that harsh winter conditions will make battle conditions tougher for Ukraine's troops. He also urged Western allies to keep the pressure on Russia with more sanctions. In their joint statement, the G7 leaders said they remain committed to ""sustaining and intensifying"" sanctions against President Vladimir Putin's government and enablers in neighbouring Belarus. There will be sanctions on gold and oil exports and also ""targeted sanctions on those responsible for war crimes"", the joint statement said. EXPLAINER:What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? ANALYSIS:Western leaders pledge action on Russia: Do we believe them? The G7 also demanded that the Kremlin allow food to leave Ukraine's ports - and blamed Moscow for rising threats to global food insecurity as a result of the conflict. Much of Ukraine's highly valued grain exports are in danger of rotting in local warehouses as Russian forces continue blocking Ukraine's ports on the Black Sea. ""We urgently call on Russia to cease, without condition, its attacks on agricultural and transport infrastructure and enable free passage of agricultural shipping from Ukrainian ports,"" the G7 statement says. A BBC investigation has also foundevidence that Russian forces in occupied areas of Ukraine have been systematically stealing grainand other produce from local farmers. Speaking from the summit,UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC""the price of freedom is worth paying"" in supporting Ukraine, and that help must continue to be offered to rebuild its economy, export grain and protect its citizens. Earlier on Monday,Mr Johnson was caught on camera making fun of Vladimir Putin- who is a fan of posing shirtless for photos - telling the other world leaders they should ""show [Russia] our pecs"". While the G7 leaders were meeting on Monday, reports emerged thatRussia had defaulted on its debt for the first time since 1998, after missing a $100m payment deadline. However the Kremlin said the issue is ""not our problem"", because the payment had been made in May, but had been blocked by Western sanctions. World leaders have gone out of their way to put on a show of solidarity. The strongly worded statement they issued today suggests they genuinely are united in their conviction that there is only one way forward, and negates suggestions that some were starting to waver in their support for Ukraine. The war is, after all, exacerbating a cost of living crisis which is hurting their voters. It also - for now at least - appears to dismiss the controversial claim, put forward by analysts and politicians worldwide, that the war could end if Ukraine hands over territory taken by Russian troops to Vladimir Putin in exchange for peace. The leaders state that Ukraine, and Ukraine alone, will determine its future, without external pressure. But the ongoing support will come at a price, which is why the G7 is also focusing on attempts to alleviate the impact on global food and energy supplies. And it's why they're trying to intensify pressure on Vladimir Putin, discussing new sanctions aimed at cutting off the sources of revenue paying for his war. But as the German chancellor Olaf Scholz tweeted earlier, tough but necessary decisions lie ahead. Because, given the Russian leader's intransigence to date, their latest demand he withdraw his troops immediately and unconditionally is extremely unlikely to be met.

"An unexploded Russian bomb is removed from a block in Kharkiv The Russian war against Ukraine will inevitably dominate the summit of G7 nations in Bavaria. And the leaders of the US, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Japan face a difficult challenge. They are aiming to put on a show of unity and resolve over the war. In recent months, the Western alliance has shown signs of strain and fatigue. Some voices - particularly in France, Germany and Italy - have asked if it might not be better for the war to end, even if it came at the cost of Ukraine having to cede territory. Arecent cross-Europe opinion poll,externalsuggested some voters put solving the cost-of-living crisis ahead of punishing Russia. Others argue about the need to salvage some kind of relationship with Russia in the future. Countries like the UK, Poland and the three Baltic States have been resisting these arguments, saying that any peace deal with Moscow that is not on Ukraine's terms would lead to further Russian aggression in the future. President Zelensky is likely to reinforce this argument when he addresses the summit virtually on Monday. So the G7 leaders are expected to try to use the summit to clear these muddy waters, promising more weapons to Ukraine and more sanctions against Russia. The idea will be to send a signal to Russian President Vladimir Putin that the West has the strategic patience to maintain its support for Ukraine, even if it faces domestic political pressure at home from voters concerned about rising prices. The problem for G7 leaders is they also face growing pressure to show they are tackling the global economic crisis. The soaring price of fuel and food is causing hunger and unrest across the world. And some countries are pointing the finger at the West. Many countries in the global south do not share Western concerns about Russian aggression. They see the conflict as a European war and seem unmoved by Western arguments that Vladimir Putin is acting as a colonial aggressor. And they blame Western sanctions - as much as Russia's invasion - for the rising costs of gas and oil, and the massive shortage of wheat and fertiliser. WTO boss warns of global food crisis Russia earns $97bn on fuel exports since invasion To try to resist this narrative, G7 countries are expected to use the summit to show they are acting to help countries round the world - with development aid, debt restructuring, climate finance, help finding alternative sources of energy and, of course, fresh efforts to get grain out of Ukraine's ports. That is why Germany has invited the leaders of India, Indonesia, Senegal, Argentina and South Africa to the summit, to hear their perspective and show the rest of the world the G7 is listening. So on the one hand, these Western leaders must show resolve to keep backing Ukraine, and on the other, they must show a readiness to fix the global economic shocks that some blame, in part, on the war. One senior US official described the dilemma thus: ""How do we maximise pain on Putin's regime? How do we minimise spillbacks back to the rest of the world?"" That is quite a circle to square.

"There's mounting evidence that Russian forces in occupied areas of Ukraine have been systematically stealing grain and other produce from local farmers. The BBC has talked to farmers and analysed satellite images and shipping data to track where the grain is going. A few dozen miles from the frontline, Ukrainian farmer Dmytro describes how the business he nurtured over 25 years was lost in four months of Russian occupation. The BBC tried to contact more than 200 farmers whose land is now in Russian-occupied territory. Dmytro - we are not using his real name to protect him from reprisals - was one of the few willing to meet us. ""They stole our grain. They destroyed our premises, destroyed our equipment."" CCTV footage of the moment Russian soldiers arrived at a storage facility He says Russian forces now occupy 80% of the tens of thousands of hectares he farms and accuses them of stealing grain on an industrial scale. CCTV from one of the company's sites captured the moment the Russians arrived. We've blurred some of the surroundings to protect the identities of the farm owners. Later in the footage, one soldier spots a security camera and shoots at it, but misses. Grain trucks were stolen and Dmytro says a couple of them had GPS trackers fitted. We were able to use this data to see they had gone south into Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, and then on to Russia. From the GPS data, both trucks stopped near a storage facility - identified as a site for unloading and storing grain - in the Crimean town of Oktyabrske. In a satellite image from 14 June this year - you can see a line of trucks on the road next to the facility. We can see the storage facility is next to a rail line, which can be used to transport grain either into Russia or down to ports in southern Crimea. The top of the storage site also appears to have the Z symbol - the emblem of Russia's invasion - on the roof. It's very hard to track individual shipments of stolen grain but there is plenty of evidence that much of it goes first to Crimea. There is satellite imagery at two key entry points - at Chonhar and Armiansk - in which you can see a build-up of vehicles, which could be used to transport grain and other produce. An image from the Chonhar entry point taken on 17 June shows a line of trucks more than 5km (three miles) long. This level of road traffic into Crimea is unusual as Ukraine has not had access to the area since it was annexed by Russia in 2014, and has been exporting grain and other products from elsewhere. It might be possible to explain some of the volume of traffic as empty trucks returning from the occupied areas having delivered supplies to Russian troops. But an obvious interpretation is that many of the trucks are carrying grain - or other products like sunflower seeds - taken from Ukrainian farmers. Satellite images of the town of Dzhankoi in Crimea show trucks waiting on a road next to a grain storage facility and near the connected train station. The images show cargo trains - with wagons of the type used to transport grain and other produce - at the station next to the storage facility. Trains from Dzhankoi are connected to the ports of Sevastopol and Kerch, where produce can be moved into Russia or abroad. ""They take grain to the annexed Crimea first, where they transport it to Kerch or Sevastopol [ports], then they load Ukrainian grain on Russian ships and go to the Kerch Strait,"" says Andrii Klymenko, an expert at the Institute for Black Sea Strategic Studies in Kyiv, who regularly monitors movements of ships around Crimea. ""There, in the Kerch Strait [between Crimea and Russia], they transfer Ukrainian grain from small ships on to bulk carriers, where it is mixed with grain from Russia - or in some cases, they sail to this area just to give the appearance they are loading up with Russian grain."" He adds this is then exported with Russian certificates, saying that it's Russian grain. Ships have then often headed on to Syria or Turkey. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has saidthey have investigated claims about Ukrainian grain being shipped to Turkey and so far not found any evidence.,external ""We saw that the ships' port of departure and the origin of the goods is Russia on the records,"" he said. Satellite images from the Avlita grain terminal at the port of Sevastopol in the west of Crimea show a high level of activity throughout June, with yellow material consistent with the colour of grain being loaded on to a series of ships. This video can not be played Evidence of cargo vessels being loaded with grain in the Avlita Grain Terminal, Sevastopol We reviewed images of the same terminal in June over the past few years, and this amount of activity appears to be unusually high. Some experts we spoke to said this activity could only be accounted for by grain transported from Ukraine's mainland. ""Crimea doesn't really grow a lot of grain for export,"" says Mariia Bogonos, agriculture policy expert at the Kyiv School of Economics. It would also not make geographical sense for Russia to use Sevastopol to export its own grain. But Mike Lee, an agriculture expert with Green Square Agro who has worked in both Ukraine and Russia, says some grain coming out of Crimea could be part of a backlog from last year's harvest, kept in storage because of the war. ""Crimea is under Russian control, but supply chains have been affected there as well."" From Crimea, theUS and Ukrainian authorities,externalandmedia reports,externalhave named nine ships believed to have transported stolen Ukrainian grain abroad. Using data from Lloyd's List Intelligence, the BBC has tracked these ships on journeys between Crimea and ports in Turkey and Syria since April. Lloyd's List Intelligence says the vessels have used what maritime specialists would describe as ""deceptive"" sailing practices - switching off their on-board trackers when entering the Black Sea, or moving around the Kerch Strait near Crimea. When their trackers come back online, the ships are sailing south and many report a lower depth in the water, suggesting they've taken on cargo during the blackout. The BBC mapped the journeys of three vessels: the Matros Pozynich and Sormovskiy 48, owned by two companies in Russia, as well as the Finikia, owned by the Syrian General Maritime Authority. We tried to contact the Russian-registered owners of these vessels to ask about the journeys, but did not get a response.  We were unable to get through to the Syrian owners. Despite the gaps in their tracker histories, satellite imagery has revealed where some of the ships have been. Pictures from Maxar show the Matros Pozynich in Sevastopol in Crimea in mid-May. During this trip, it sailed to the Kerch Strait, had a transponder blackout for five days, and then reappeared hundreds of miles south in the Black Sea. It was later pictured in the Syrian port of Latakia - but had its tracking system off. Under the UN's Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), ships must have their trackers switched on at all times, unless it poses a threat to their safety and security - from piracy, for example. Michelle Wiese Bockmann, a market editor at Lloyd's List Intelligence, believes there is no justification for turning off trackers near Crimea or near the Syrian coast. ""This practice is clearly not linked with piracy risks,"" says Ms Bockmann. ""Other ships have their transponders on, so why don't they?"" The BBC has also obtained documents drawn up by the Russian occupying authorities listing farms where grain is to be transferred to them. A separateinvestigation by BBC Russian and BBC Ukrainianhas shown that in some cases, the Russians are forcing Ukrainian farmers to sell grain at prices well below market rates, and sign documents to prove it was purchased ""legally"". While early reports were typically of outright theft by Russian forces, farmers suggest there has been a change in tactics as the Russians realise that if they pay nothing, future harvests could be sabotaged. The farmers say they have to accept the low prices as they have no alternative and need to buy fuel and pay workers. Emilie Pottle, an international law barrister, told the BBC that these actions may violate the Geneva Convention and International Criminal Court (ICC) rules governing occupying powers. We contacted the Russian authorities to ask about these allegations, but have yet to receive a response. However, some officials in Russian-held areashave spoken openly about Ukrainian grain being taken from the areas they now control.

"Family members of the victims have been gathering at the tavern Yellow police tape now cordons off the drinking place in the South African city of East London where 21 teenagers died in unexplained circumstances. A forensic team has been going through the site at the Enyobeni Tavern to try to understand what exactly took place. There were no visible injuries on the bodies of the deceased, the authorities have said, so a crush seems an unlikely explanation. Some have said the victims were poisoned, but this is not confirmed. South Africa's liquor board has said the owners of the tavern would face criminal charges after allegedly breaching licensing agreements. Some family members of the victims have been gathering at the tavern to try and find out the latest news. Among them was Xolile Malangeni. His 17-year-old daughter, Sinako, snuck out of her home on Saturday night but never returned. ""[She] always loved and took care of me when I was ill,"" her father told the BBC with tears in his eyes. Alongside her there are 20 other victims in a nearby mortuary. Post-mortem examinations have now been completed but one person remains unidentified and the provincial authorities have called on possible family members to come forward. The youngest of those who died was 13 and the oldest was 17, according to Police Minister Bheki Cele - but a detailed list of the victims has not yet been produced. The minimum drinking age in South Africa is 18, so they should not have been allowed in. A forensic team has been inspecting the site where the tragedy happened in the early hours of Sunday ""The venue was packed. Entrance was free... and free alcohol was also being dished out. We started drinking and having fun with others,"" a 16-year-old girl who did not want to be named told the BBC. ""Those that were outside were trying to force their way in. Only two bouncers were at the scene to control the crowd. That's when people started collapsing, they were dropping like flies. ""I thought they were just passing out because they had too much to drink. Many others including myself escaped through the windows. My friends are dead now and we've all been left traumatised."" ""They die[d] as they danced. They dance, fall, and die - literally. Others would just feel dizzy, sleep on the sofa, [and] die,"" South African website News24 quotes Mr Cele as saying on Monday. The tavern, a two-storey building, sits amid residential properties in a densely populated area of East London's Scenery Park township. It has been the focus of a lot of community anger, residents said. They had previously complained to the police about the noise and the late opening hours. It is not clear why there were so many young people there on Saturday night. The owner has been quoted in local media as saying they had come to celebrate the end of school exams, having gone there after a ""pens down"" party ended elsewhere. A birthday party was also being held at the tavern. Two of the victims died either on the way to hospital or in hospital, but the other 19 died inside the venue itself. They were found slumped over tables or on the floor. On Monday afternoon, community members gathered in a church hall near the tavern for a subdued prayer service. Between hymns people spoke about the tragedy of parents burying children. There has been a prayer service and the community has been offered counselling The tavern's entertainment manager, Promise Matinise, told the BBC that he saw people collapsing one after the other in the early hours of Sunday morning. At first he assumed they had passed out from drinking too much and then realised that some had stopped breathing. Earlier, he said, bouncers had struggled to control the large crowds that had entered the establishment. Speaking on Sunday, Oscar Mabuyane, premier of Eastern Cape province where the tragedy happened, did not give possible reasons for the deaths, but condemned the ""unlimited consumption of liquor"". Visiting the scene, he said: ""You can't just trade in the middle of society like this and think that young people are not going to experiment.""

"Russia is believed to have defaulted on its debt for the first time since 1998 after missing a key deadline. Russia has the money to make a $100m payment, which was due on Sunday, but sanctions made it impossible to get the sum to international creditors. The country had been determined to avoid the default, which is a major blow to the nation's prestige. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, said ""statements of a default were absolutely unjustified"". He added that an intermediary bank had withheld the money and that the reserves were blocked ""unlawfully"". The White House said that Russia had defaulted on paying yields on its international bonds, crediting sanctions for effectively cutting Russia off from the global financial system. Russia's finance minister called the situation ""a farce"" and said the situation is not expected to have short-term impact. This is because Russia does not need to raise money internationally as it is reaping revenue from high-priced commodities such as oil, according to Chris Weafer, chief executive at Moscow-based consultancy Macro Advisory. But he said it would create a ""legacy"" problem if the situation with Ukraine and international sanctions improves. ""This is the sort of action that will hang over the economy and make recovery much more difficult when we get to that stage,"" he said. The $100m interest payment was due on 27 May. Russia says the money was sent to Euroclear, a bank which would then distribute the payment to investors. But that payment has been stuck there,according to Bloomberg News,external, and creditors have not received it. Meanwhile, some Taiwanese holders of Russian bonds denominated in euros have not received interest payments, according to the Reuters news agency, which cited two sources. The money had not arrived within 30 days of the due date, that is, Sunday evening, and so is considered a default. Euroclear would not say if the payment had been blocked, but said it adhered to all sanctions, introduced following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia disputed that it had defaulted on the debt. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it had made the payments due in May, and the fact that it was blocked by Euroclear because of sanctions was ""not our problem."" Russia's economy in for a bumpy ride as sanctions bite What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion? Russia finance minister Anton Siluanov admitted foreign investors would ""not be able to receive"" the payments, according to the RIA Novosti news wire. Because Russia wants to pay and has plenty of money to do it, he denied that this amounts to a genuine default, which usually occur when governments refuse to pay, or their economies are so weak that they cannot find the money. ""Everyone in the know understands that this is not a default at all. This whole situation looks like a farce."" Defaulting nations usually find it impossible to borrow any more money, but Russia is already in effect barred from borrowing in Western markets by sanctions. Also, Russia is reportedly earning about $1bn a day from fossil fuel exports, and its finance minister Anton Siluanov said in April the country had no plans to borrow more. The default will trigger repayments on a large chunk of Russia's debt, according to Mr Weafer. About $40bn of Russia's debts are denominated in dollars or euros, with around half held outside the country. ""Some parts of that debt will now become automatically due because there will be early repayment clauses in all debt instruments so if you default on one it usually triggers the immediate demand for payment on the other debts, so Russia could certainly face immediate debt repayment of about $20bn at this stage,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov says the so-called default is a farce"" Russia's last debt default of any kind was in 1998 as the country was rocked by the rouble crisis during the chaotic end of Boris Yeltsin's regime. At the time Moscow failed to keep up payments on its domestic bonds and defaulted on some overseas debt. Russia has seemed on an inevitable path to default since sanctions were first imposed by the US and European Union following the invasion of Ukraine. These restricted the country's access to the international banking networks which would process payments from Russia to investors around the world. The Russian government has said it wants to make all of its payments on time, and up until now it had succeeded. Default seemed inevitable when the US Treasury decided not to renew the special exemption in sanctions rules allowing investors to receive interest payments from Russia, which expired on 25 May. The Kremlin now appears to have accepted this inevitability too, decreeing on 23 June stating that all future debt payments would be made in roubles through a Russian bank, the National Settlements Depository, even when contracts state they should be in dollars or other international currencies. Meanwhile, Mr Weafer, who is based in Moscow, said that life was more or less operating as normal despite sanctions and Western companies withdrawing from Russia. ""If you're in Moscow right now frankly, if you weren't reading the newspapers, you'd see there's been a price increase but otherwise life is as it was before February 24. ""In March and April there was a lot of concern that products would disappear, that factories would not be able to get components or materials to continue operating and we could be looking therefore at a severe drop in employment or a rise in unemployment by the summer [or] early autumn. That situation has improved,"" he added. ""We've seen alternative import routes opening via Kazakhstan and Turkey, the government has promoted what they call a parallel import scheme so effectively a lot of products that were blocked in March and April are now starting to reappear, albeit at a higher price.""

"NHS patients in England who have been waiting more than two years for surgery are being offered hospital treatment in alternative parts of the country. More than 6,000 long-term waiting-list patients are being offered travel and accommodation costs where appropriate to help the NHS through the backlog. Health officials want to ensure nobody is waiting more than two years by the end of July. More than 400 patients have already said they would be prepared to travel. Three patients waiting for surgery in Derby have already received treatment in the Northumbria health region, with another two patients booked in, NHS England said. And in south-west London, 17 orthopaedic patients from the South West of England are being treated, with another 11 patients set to follow in the coming weeks. Hospital waiting list at 6.5 million in England 'Please ask the ambulance to hurry or I'll be dead' Gynaecology waits soar by 60% during pandemic Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said the number of two-year waits had already reduced by two-thirds since January. ""Innovations like this are helping to tackle waiting lists and speed up access to treatment, backed by record investment,"" he said. Mr Javid also pointed to more than 90 community diagnostic centres delivering more than a million checks and scans in the past year. With weekend clinics and dedicated surgery hubs, he said NHS staff were making ""great progress"" in busting the Covid backlogs. But British Medical Association leader Dr Chaand Nagpaul is warning that attempts to address what he called a ""once in a generation backlog of unimaginable proportions"" would be undermined by a lack of staff and beds. He pointed out that there were already 100,000 vacancies in the NHS in England and that risked getting worse because doctors were ""utterly exhausted"" and their wellbeing was at ""rock bottom"". He will tell the BMA's annual conference in Brighton later that the health service is ""at serious risk of haemorrhaging more doctors"", with many considering early retirement or likely to work fewer hours. He will also say there is a ""parallel hidden backlog of potentially tens of millions waiting for medical, mental health and chronic disease care who don't feature in any government statistics"". There were 22,500 people waiting more than two years for an operation in England in January, but this has fallen by 15,000. However, the latest monthly NHS figures show it was the busiest May for emergency care, with 2.2 million A&E attendances. And nearly 6.5 million people in England are waiting for hospital treatment - a record high - with many waiting for knee and hip replacements, and eye surgery. Backlogs built up during the Covid pandemic as hospitals treated thousands of people who were ill with the virus, forcing patients with other illnesses to wait much longer than usual for surgery or treatment. Amanda Pritchard, chief executive of NHS England, said: ""Millions who did not seek help earlier in the pandemic are now coming forward."" But she said despite the emergence of the Omicron variant and a difficult winter, the NHS was on track to ""eliminate two-year waiters"" by the end of July. ""One of the benefits of the NHS is that hospitals can work together to bring Covid backlogs down together, and so if people can and want to be treated quicker elsewhere in the country, NHS staff are ensuring that it can happen,"" Ms Pritchard said. However, even if patients are happy to be treated in another part of the country, it might not always be possible because of the specialist nature of their treatment.

"It was claimed a suitcase of cash was handed over to Prince Charles The Charity Commission is examining whether it needs to carry out a review of donations received by a charity of the Prince of Wales. The Sunday Times reported that millions of euros in cash were handed over by a former prime minister of Qatar. ""We will review the information to determine whether there is any role for the commission in this matter,"" said the charities regulator. Prince Charles's representatives said ""all correct processes were followed"". The Charity Commission will examine whether it needs to take any action over the claimed donations of a total of three million euros from Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim to Prince Charles's charity, between 2011 and 2015. Some of the money was reported to have been in cash in a suitcase and in carrier bags from the upmarket shop Fortnum and Mason. Former Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker has written to the Metropolitan Police, asking for these latest reports to be included in continuing investigations intoclaims of cash for honours, involving another of the prince's charities. Mr Baker told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme it showed Prince Charles was personally involved in accepting money from the Qatari donor. And he said it raised the question of whether there had been any more payments in 95 other meetings since 2011 between the prince and members of Middle Eastern royal families. There have been no suggestions of any wrongdoing but Mr Baker said it looked ""grubby and scuzzy"". ""We really don't think the heir to the throne should be behaving in a way accepting cash in Fortnum and Mason bags behind closed doors in secret. The optics are really terrible,"" he said. The billionaire donor of the cash, Sheikh Hamad, was the prime minister of the wealthy Gulf state of Qatar between 2007 and 2013. As head of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, he had been called ""the man who bought London"" after investments in landmark properties and businesses such as the Shard and Harrods. Prince Charles reported to have accepted suitcase of cash Police to investigate Prince Charles charity Charles's aide quits in honours inquiry The reported donation was for the Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund, which provides grants for conservation, environment, education and social inclusion projects. It's understood that donations were also made by bank draft and there could be a challenge about the details of the amounts and how payments were handed over. More recent financial accounts from the Charity Commission, between 2017 and 2021, show the Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund had an annual income between Â£10m and Â£15m. The charity regulations allow donations to be made in cash and for donors to remain anonymous. But charities would have to carry out due diligence to ensure that the funds were from a legitimate source. ""Charitable donations received from Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim were passed immediately to one of the prince's charities, who carried out the appropriate governance and have assured us that all the correct processes were followed,"" said a statement from Clarence House. Earlier this year the Charity Commission ran a formal inquiry into the charities of Viateschlav Kantor, a billionaire oligarch sanctioned by the UK over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Mr Kantor's charity had madedonations to another of Prince Charles's charities, the Prince's Foundation. Charity records show Â£600,000 was paid to the foundation over two years, as part of a pledge for Â£3m, that had been intended to be paid in stages until 2028. The Prince's Foundation had said it wouldn't comment on individual donations, but donors would have been subject to a process of due diligence, based on what was known at the time.

"Forensic teams are investigating at the the scene The youngest victim among the at least 21 people who died at a drinking place at the weekend was 13, police minister Bheki Cele has said. The cause of the deaths was not immediately clear and the authorities are investigating. The victims were found strewn across floors and tables at the Enyobeni Tavern in the town of East London. The bodies were taken to mortuaries, where post-mortem examinations will be carried out. Mr Cele, who had visited the scene and was briefed by the local police, said those who had died were between the ages of 13 and 17 - but a detailed list of the victims has not yet been produced. The legal minimum drinking age in South Africa is 18. There are reports that people who had gone to the tavern were celebrating the end of school exams. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa expressed his ""deepest condolences"" to families of the victims. ""This tragedy is made even more grave by its occurrence during Youth Month - a time during which we... advocate and advance opportunities for improved socio-economic conditions for the youth of our nation,"" he said in a tweet. Oscar Mabuyane, premier of East Cape Province where the tragedy happened, did not give possible reasons for the deaths, but condemned the ""unlimited consumption of liquor"". Speaking at the scene, he said: ""You can't just trade in the middle of society like this and think that young people are not going to experiment."" The incident occurred in the early hours of Sunday. A provincial safety official told AFP news agency that a stampede had been ruled out as the cause of death as there were ""no visible wounds"". ""Forensic [investigators] will take samples and test to see if there was any poisoning of any sort,"" Unathi Binqose said. Were you in the area? Did you witness the incident?

"The government wants to change the Northern Ireland Protocol to make it easier for some goods to flow from Great Britain to Northern Ireland MPs will vote on Monday on new legislation to give ministers the power to scrap parts of the post-Brexit deal between the UK and the EU. The government wants to change the NI Protocol to make it easier for some goods to flow from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he believed legislation on the deal could be passed by the end of the year. The EU opposes the move, saying it breaches international law. The government is aiming to fast track the protocol bill through the House of Commons before the summer recess in mid July. It is proposing to condense the committee stage of the legislation across just three days - a process which can sometimes take weeks. Boris Johnson was asked about the legislation while at a meeting of world leaders in Germany The protocol is part of the 2019 Brexit deal and keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, preventing a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. But it means checks on some items which come into Northern Ireland from other parts of the UK, creating a trade border in the Irish Sea. Speaking to the BBC, the prime minister said its plan could be carried out ""fairly rapidly"". ""What we are trying to do is fix something that is very important to our country, which is the balance of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement,"" Mr Johnson said. ""You have got one tradition, one community, that feels that things really aren't working in a way that they like or understand."" He argued ""unnecessary"" barriers to trade could be removed without endangering the EU single market. But the PM said it would be ""even better"" to agree more flexibility with Brussels. Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said the protocol bill was ""no fix"" and would damage the Good Friday peace deal, rather than protect it. Allow Twitter content?

Ahead of the vote, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the protocol was undermining peace in Northern Ireland. The government's plans, published earlier in June, faced a fierce backlash from the EU, whichlaunched legal action against the UK governmentover the legislation. Mr Å efÄoviÄ has also indicated that further measures may follow if the bill proceeds, including atrade war between the UK and EU. The protocol is opposed by unionists in Northern Ireland who argue it undermines Northern Ireland's place in the UK. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol row about? How will NI protocol plans affect businesses? How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed Sinn FÃ©in won the most seats in May's assembly election but the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which came second, is refusing to re-enter a power-sharing executive until its concerns about the protocol are addressed. Ms Truss said on Sunday night that the protocol was undermining the peace and stability secured in Northern Ireland by the Good Friday Agreement. Three Northern Ireland parties - Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance and the SDLP, who collectively won the most seats in May's election - say the protocol is necessary to mitigate the effects of Brexit in Northern Ireland. The UK governmentpublished plansfor the bill earlier this month. At the centre of the proposal is the concept of green lanes and red lanes for trade. This would mean: Goods coming from Great Britain (GB) into Northern Ireland (NI) and which are staying would use the green lane. This means there would be no checks and paperwork would be minimal GB goods moving through NI into Ireland or the wider European Union would use the red lane and continue to be checked at NI ports London also wants any trade disputes resolved by ""independent arbitration"" and not by the European Court of Justice, and for Northern Ireland to benefit from the same tax breaks as elsewhere in the UK. After a debate on Monday, MPs will then vote on whether the bill can proceed for further consideration. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer confirmed his party will vote against the legislation, adding that they would scrap the proposed laws if it was in power. The prime minister may also face opposition from his backbenches after heovercame a vote of confidence among Conservative MPs earlier in June. This is another big day at Westminster and one that could expose just how many problems Boris Johnson has with rebels in his own party. Bruised from theby-election defeats last week, some may seek to punish him further by voting against the bill or abstaining. However, according to several London sources, a large rebellion is unlikely. Regardless, it's thought the government wants to push the bill through its remaining Commons stages before summer recess - a move that will spark strong reaction in Belfast and Brussels. The DUP has welcomed the move but there's still some way to go before it will commit to return to power-sharing government in Northern Ireland. Other parties, including Sinn FÃ©in, say the bill breaks international law and are urging MPs to vote it down. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the party would ""consider what steps we can take"" if the bill gets through all its Commons stages intact. ""We have made clear that getting decisive action on the protocol, addressing the harm that the protocol is doing to Northern Ireland, is very important to rebuild the cross-community consensus that is essential for power-sharing to work. ""We're already beginning the preparatory working for the restoration of the devolved institutions, but as to when that might happen I've made clear that we will be condition led, not calendar led."" Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said if the bill goes through intact his party would look to respond in terms of restoring the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland However, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the government was prepared to rip up international law and threaten the stability of the Good Friday Agreement. ""This is a country that is turning into a rogue state,"" he said. ""This is all about Boris Johnson shoring up the support of the hard right of the Tory Party, this is nothing to do with the DUP or Northern Ireland or even the protocol, it's about Boris Johnson and everything he does is about himself."" In a statement ahead of the vote, Ms Truss said: ""This legislation will fix the problems the protocol has created, ensuring that goods can flow freely within the UK, while avoiding a hard border and safeguarding the EU single market. ""A negotiated solution has been and remains our preference, but the EU continues to rule out changing the protocol itself - even though it is patently causing serious problems in Northern Ireland - which therefore means we are obliged to act."" The EU has said it is unwilling to renegotiate the protocol but has offered to work on different aspects of how it is implemented. Earlier this week, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin saidthe UK government's plans would be ""economic vandalism""on Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal: it means lorries don't face checkpoints when they go from Northern Ireland (in the UK) to the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) Instead,when goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales), they are checked against EU rules The UK and the EU chose this arrangement because theIrish border is a sensitive issuedue to Northern Ireland's troubled political history Read more:A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Second reading of protocol bill set for next week EU takes new legal action over Brexit deal changes What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

"NHS patients in England who have been waiting more than two years for surgery are being offered hospital treatment in alternative parts of the country. More than 6,000 long-term waiting-list patients are being offered travel and accommodation costs where appropriate to help the NHS through the backlog. Health officials want to ensure nobody is waiting more than two years by the end of July. More than 400 patients have already said they would be prepared to travel. Three patients waiting for surgery in Derby have already received treatment in the Northumbria health region, with another two patients booked in, NHS England said. And in south-west London, 17 orthopaedic patients from the South West of England are being treated, with another 11 patients set to follow in the coming weeks. Hospital waiting list at 6.5 million in England 'Please ask the ambulance to hurry or I'll be dead' Gynaecology waits soar by 60% during pandemic Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said the number of two-year waits had already reduced by two-thirds since January. ""Innovations like this are helping to tackle waiting lists and speed up access to treatment, backed by record investment,"" he said. Mr Javid also pointed to more than 90 community diagnostic centres delivering more than a million checks and scans in the past year. With weekend clinics and dedicated surgery hubs, he said NHS staff were making ""great progress"" in busting the Covid backlogs. But British Medical Association leader Dr Chaand Nagpaul is warning that attempts to address what he called a ""once in a generation backlog of unimaginable proportions"" would be undermined by a lack of staff and beds. He pointed out that there were already 100,000 vacancies in the NHS in England and that risked getting worse because doctors were ""utterly exhausted"" and their wellbeing was at ""rock bottom"". He will tell the BMA's annual conference in Brighton later that the health service is ""at serious risk of haemorrhaging more doctors"", with many considering early retirement or likely to work fewer hours. He will also say there is a ""parallel hidden backlog of potentially tens of millions waiting for medical, mental health and chronic disease care who don't feature in any government statistics"". There were 22,500 people waiting more than two years for an operation in England in January, but this has fallen by 15,000. However, the latest monthly NHS figures show it was the busiest May for emergency care, with 2.2 million A&E attendances. And nearly 6.5 million people in England are waiting for hospital treatment - a record high - with many waiting for knee and hip replacements, and eye surgery. Backlogs built up during the Covid pandemic as hospitals treated thousands of people who were ill with the virus, forcing patients with other illnesses to wait much longer than usual for surgery or treatment. Amanda Pritchard, chief executive of NHS England, said: ""Millions who did not seek help earlier in the pandemic are now coming forward."" But she said despite the emergence of the Omicron variant and a difficult winter, the NHS was on track to ""eliminate two-year waiters"" by the end of July. ""One of the benefits of the NHS is that hospitals can work together to bring Covid backlogs down together, and so if people can and want to be treated quicker elsewhere in the country, NHS staff are ensuring that it can happen,"" Ms Pritchard said. However, even if patients are happy to be treated in another part of the country, it might not always be possible because of the specialist nature of their treatment.

"There's mounting evidence that Russian forces in occupied areas of Ukraine have been systematically stealing grain and other produce from local farmers. The BBC has talked to farmers and analysed satellite images and shipping data to track where the grain is going. A few dozen miles from the frontline, Ukrainian farmer Dmytro describes how the business he nurtured over 25 years was lost in four months of Russian occupation. The BBC tried to contact more than 200 farmers whose land is now in Russian-occupied territory. Dmytro - we are not using his real name to protect him from reprisals - was one of the few willing to meet us. ""They stole our grain. They destroyed our premises, destroyed our equipment."" CCTV footage of the moment Russian soldiers arrived at a storage facility He says Russian forces now occupy 80% of the tens of thousands of hectares he farms and accuses them of stealing grain on an industrial scale. CCTV from one of the company's sites captured the moment the Russians arrived. We've blurred some of the surroundings to protect the identities of the farm owners. Later in the footage, one soldier spots a security camera and shoots at it, but misses. Grain trucks were stolen and Dmytro says a couple of them had GPS trackers fitted. We were able to use this data to see they had gone south into Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, and then on to Russia. From the GPS data, both trucks stopped near a storage facility - identified as a site for unloading and storing grain - in the Crimean town of Oktyabrske. In a satellite image from 14 June this year - you can see a line of trucks on the road next to the facility. We can see the storage facility is next to a rail line, which can be used to transport grain either into Russia or down to ports in southern Crimea. The top of the storage site also appears to have the Z symbol - the emblem of Russia's invasion - on the roof. It's very hard to track individual shipments of stolen grain but there is plenty of evidence that much of it goes first to Crimea. There is satellite imagery at two key entry points - at Chonhar and Armiansk - in which you can see a build-up of vehicles, which could be used to transport grain and other produce. An image from the Chonhar entry point taken on 17 June shows a line of trucks more than 5km (three miles) long. This level of road traffic into Crimea is unusual as Ukraine has not had access to the area since it was annexed by Russia in 2014, and has been exporting grain and other products from elsewhere. It might be possible to explain some of the volume of traffic as empty trucks returning from the occupied areas having delivered supplies to Russian troops. But an obvious interpretation is that many of the trucks are carrying grain - or other products like sunflower seeds - taken from Ukrainian farmers. Satellite images of the town of Dzhankoi in Crimea show trucks waiting on a road next to a grain storage facility and near the connected train station. The images show cargo trains - with wagons of the type used to transport grain and other produce - at the station next to the storage facility. Trains from Dzhankoi are connected to the ports of Sevastopol and Kerch, where produce can be moved into Russia or abroad. ""They take grain to the annexed Crimea first, where they transport it to Kerch or Sevastopol [ports], then they load Ukrainian grain on Russian ships and go to the Kerch Strait,"" says Andrii Klymenko, an expert at the Institute for Black Sea Strategic Studies in Kyiv, who regularly monitors movements of ships around Crimea. ""There, in the Kerch Strait [between Crimea and Russia], they transfer Ukrainian grain from small ships on to bulk carriers, where it is mixed with grain from Russia - or in some cases, they sail to this area just to give the appearance they are loading up with Russian grain."" He adds this is then exported with Russian certificates, saying that it's Russian grain. Ships have then often headed on to Syria or Turkey. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has saidthey have investigated claims about Ukrainian grain being shipped to Turkey and so far not found any evidence.,external ""We saw that the ships' port of departure and the origin of the goods is Russia on the records,"" he said. Satellite images from the Avlita grain terminal at the port of Sevastopol in the west of Crimea show a high level of activity throughout June, with yellow material consistent with the colour of grain being loaded on to a series of ships. This video can not be played Evidence of cargo vessels being loaded with grain in the Avlita Grain Terminal, Sevastopol We reviewed images of the same terminal in June over the past few years, and this amount of activity appears to be unusually high. Some experts we spoke to said this activity could only be accounted for by grain transported from Ukraine's mainland. ""Crimea doesn't really grow a lot of grain for export,"" says Mariia Bogonos, agriculture policy expert at the Kyiv School of Economics. It would also not make geographical sense for Russia to use Sevastopol to export its own grain. But Mike Lee, an agriculture expert with Green Square Agro who has worked in both Ukraine and Russia, says some grain coming out of Crimea could be part of a backlog from last year's harvest, kept in storage because of the war. ""Crimea is under Russian control, but supply chains have been affected there as well."" From Crimea, theUS and Ukrainian authorities,externalandmedia reports,externalhave named nine ships believed to have transported stolen Ukrainian grain abroad. Using data from Lloyd's List Intelligence, the BBC has tracked these ships on journeys between Crimea and ports in Turkey and Syria since April. Lloyd's List Intelligence says the vessels have used what maritime specialists would describe as ""deceptive"" sailing practices - switching off their on-board trackers when entering the Black Sea, or moving around the Kerch Strait near Crimea. When their trackers come back online, the ships are sailing south and many report a lower depth in the water, suggesting they've taken on cargo during the blackout. The BBC mapped the journeys of three vessels: the Matros Pozynich and Sormovskiy 48, owned by two companies in Russia, as well as the Finikia, owned by the Syrian General Maritime Authority. We tried to contact the Russian-registered owners of these vessels to ask about the journeys, but did not get a response.  We were unable to get through to the Syrian owners. Despite the gaps in their tracker histories, satellite imagery has revealed where some of the ships have been. Pictures from Maxar show the Matros Pozynich in Sevastopol in Crimea in mid-May. During this trip, it sailed to the Kerch Strait, had a transponder blackout for five days, and then reappeared hundreds of miles south in the Black Sea. It was later pictured in the Syrian port of Latakia - but had its tracking system off. Under the UN's Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), ships must have their trackers switched on at all times, unless it poses a threat to their safety and security - from piracy, for example. Michelle Wiese Bockmann, a market editor at Lloyd's List Intelligence, believes there is no justification for turning off trackers near Crimea or near the Syrian coast. ""This practice is clearly not linked with piracy risks,"" says Ms Bockmann. ""Other ships have their transponders on, so why don't they?"" The BBC has also obtained documents drawn up by the Russian occupying authorities listing farms where grain is to be transferred to them. A separateinvestigation by BBC Russian and BBC Ukrainianhas shown that in some cases, the Russians are forcing Ukrainian farmers to sell grain at prices well below market rates, and sign documents to prove it was purchased ""legally"". While early reports were typically of outright theft by Russian forces, farmers suggest there has been a change in tactics as the Russians realise that if they pay nothing, future harvests could be sabotaged. The farmers say they have to accept the low prices as they have no alternative and need to buy fuel and pay workers. Emilie Pottle, an international law barrister, told the BBC that these actions may violate the Geneva Convention and International Criminal Court (ICC) rules governing occupying powers. We contacted the Russian authorities to ask about these allegations, but have yet to receive a response. However, some officials in Russian-held areashave spoken openly about Ukrainian grain being taken from the areas they now control.

"Japan's government has urged people in Tokyo and its surrounding area to use less electricity on Monday, as it warned that supplies will be strained as the country faces a heatwave. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry expects demand for power to be ""severe"" this afternoon local time. It said people should switch off unnecessary lights but still use air conditioning to avoid heatstroke. For weeks, officials have warned of a power crunch as temperatures rise. Over the weekend, the temperature in central Tokyo rose above 35C, while the city of Isesaki, northwest of the capital, saw a record 40.2C. That was the highest temperature ever recorded in June for Japan. June marks the start of summer in Japan, with temperatures typically staying below 30C during the month. In a statement on Sunday, the ministry said that excess generating capacity for electricity was expected to drop to 3.7% on Monday afternoon in Tokyo and eight surrounding prefectures. It views a buffer of 3% as necessary for stable power supply. The government asked people to turn off unnecessary lights for three hours from 15:00 Tokyo time (07:00 BST) while ""properly using air conditioning and hydrating during hot hours"". Yen falls as Bank of Japan bucks rate rise trend Japan reopens to tourists but with strict rules Although electricity providers are working to increase supply, the ministry said the situation was ""unpredictable"" as temperatures climb. ""If there is an increase in demand and sudden supply troubles, the reserve margin will fall below the minimum required of 3%,"" it said. Japan's power supply has been tight since an earthquake in its northeastern region in March forced some nuclear power plants to suspend operations. Officials have also closed several aging fossil fuel plants in an attempt to cut carbon dioxide emissions. These issues, along with a surge in demand for electricity, have resulted in a power squeeze. Earlier this month, the Japanese government called on households and companies to save as much electricity as possible during the summer. Meanwhile, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported that 46 people in Tokyo had been taken to hospital for suspected heatstroke, as of Sunday afternoon. It also said a 94-year-old man in the nearby Kawagoe city was suspected to have died from the condition. The news comes after Australian officials urged households in New South Wales - a state which includes the country's biggest city Sydney -to switch off their lights in the face of an energy crisis.

"The Welsh government calls the replacement ""robust self-evaluation"" but the Conservatives say it's ""change for the sake of it"" A colour-coding system for measuring how schools in Wales perform is being scrapped. The National School Categorisation System rated schools green, yellow, amber and red depending on how much help they need. The Welsh government said it would be replaced by ""a robust self-evaluation system"" but the Welsh Conservatives called it ""change for the sake of it."" Some head teachers and parents have welcomed the move. Introduced in 2015, the process has been judged for labelling schools and encouraging competition. More schools 'green' in performance ratings School inspections in Wales off until 2022 However, it has been paused during the pandemic. Education Minister Jeremy Miles said with the change, parents would get ""better and more up to date information"" from a summary of each school's improvement priorities and development plan, published on their websites. He said the focus would be on how pupils are progressing ""rather than on headline descriptions"". Tories have argued the colour-coding system was ""a very useful way of tracking the progress of a school"", though said it could be improved. ""The problem has been how it's communicated as to why your school moves from green to red and red to green."" the party's education spokeswoman Laura Anne Jones added. ""I think that the way that is communicated needs to change, but I think the system itself has been very, very good."" She said it not only provided useful information for parents but also for politicians and local government to help support schools. ""We need to make the system work rather than just scrapping it and replacing it with something new."" Ellis says her focus is on the quality of care children are receiving At Amaze Playz play centre in Cardiff, most parents are just beginning to think about where their young children will go to school. Ellis, mother to an 11-month-old daughter, said word of mouth, the quality of care and after school clubs will be more important to her than academic standards. ""Because I'm only looking at primary schools, I think league tables for how the kids do isn't quite on my mind yet because it's more 'is she going to be looked after?' and 'is she going to enjoy it?' and 'are the teachers nice?',"" she said. Former teacher Sam, who has a three-and-a-half-year-old son starting nursery in September, said: ""I personally don't take loads of notice of all those sort of things [school ratings]. ""I guess from being on the inside, being a teacher and I know how they work. ""It's often due to area and intake and all these sort of things and it doesn't always show how good the actual school is."" Sam says the colour coding system does not always truly reflect how a school is performing The new system comes alongside changes to the way Estyn inspects schools - with a move away from giving gradings of excellent, good, adequate and unsatisfactory to an overview of areas for development and strengths. There will also be more frequent inspections from September 2024, the Welsh government said. Ending categorisation has been welcomed by the head teacher of Ysgol Dyffryn Conwy secondary school in Llanrwst, Conwy county. ""Obviously seeing a school that was in a red category compared with amber or even green was certainly looked at as a negative impact on that school,"" said Owain Gethin Davies. He felt it could affect parents' choice of school and the data could be misinterpreted. Parents also wanted to know how their school was doing but there should be a lot more emphasis on how a school promotes young people's wellbeing, he added.

"Amy says her dream is to get well A woman from north Wales with anorexia has said she believes she will die without specialist treatment which is only available privately in England. Amy Ellis from Broughton, Flintshire, is trying to raise thousands of pounds to fund the treatment after being told it would not be paid for by the NHS. She is now cared for by her mum and needs mobility aids to get around. The Welsh government said every health board had received funding to improve eating disorder services. Warning: You may find some of the following content distressing Former charity worker Amy, 42, has suffered with eating disorders all her life, but was diagnosed with a form of anorexia four years ago when her weight plummeted, and now has to use a wheelchair or walking stick to get around. The care Amy wants offers a combination of treatments, including cognitive behavioural therapy, and dialectical therapy, as well as dietic and body image support. There is no specialist eating disorder unit in Wales, and the care offered in England is residential and private, costing about Â£7,500 a week.

I am at that dying point now,"" she said. ""If I don't have help, I am going to die, that's where this brings you to if you don't have help.

""I have been with the NHS for 20 years, they could offer no help, because there is no help."" Amy said she believed NHS Wales had funded others in her situation to get the private treatment, but said she was told she was ""not sick enough"" and that she has a care plan which is helping her locally. Amy's mum Lyn says her daughter used to be ""so full of life"" However, Amy's mum Lyn Ellis said there was no-one who could help her daughter. ""It's very frustrating, someone with a different illness is given the treatment they need, for people with eating disorders, they either put them in psychiatric unit or put them on a drip to feed them, and then off you go... it's not enough,"" she said. ""It breaks my heart to hear her (Amy) in the toilet crying, I don't want to do this anymore, she knows it's straining her heart and that alone could take her,"" she said. The Welsh government recently said since 2017, health boards had received an additional Â£4.1m to support improvements such as early intervention and improved waiting times. It added: ""Improving support for eating disorders is a priority for Welsh government and as part of the additional Â£50m to improve mental health and well-being in 2022-23, we are providing an additional Â£2.5m for eating disorder services."" Prof Alberto Salmoiraghi, from Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, said it was unable to comment on Amy's treatment because of patient confidentiality, but said it intended to get in touch with her to discuss her concerns. Prof Salmoiraghi, medical director for mental health and learning disabilities, said: ""We share Amy's desire to ensure that she receives the most appropriate care. ""Our specialist adult eating disorder service provides highly specialist interventions and treatment for moderate to severe eating disorders, these treatments are compliant with NICE guidelines. ""Each patient is provided with a comprehensive multi-disciplinary assessment and treatment plan based on their unique presentation and difficulties, this can include referral to specialist providers outside of north Wales where clinically appropriate."" Amy, who is documenting her struggle with daily videos on TikTok, where she has about 53,000 followers, said she felt a huge responsibility to them. ""It's unbelievable, all the support from around the world, from sufferers, and from people that just didn't understand that this isn't a life choice. ""What's been hard for me is seeing the amount of people, not just from Wales, but the whole of the UK, going through what I'm going through, with no help,"" she said. She said her dream was to get well so she could bring eating disorders to the forefront and help others. Her childhood friend, Simon Quick, who has run half marathons to raise money for Amy's treatment and helps her run the Saving Amy Cymru campaign, said it was hard to see her struggle with the illness. ""It seems like one of the worst diseases anyone can have, she's down, depressed, in a lot of pain - we just want her to get better.""

"Barristers in criminal cases have gone on strike across England and Wales in a long-running dispute over pay. Eight out of 10 cases at London's Old Bailey were disrupted by the walkout, barristers outside the court said. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said the strikes will ""delay justice"", as courts already face a backlog of 58,000 cases. Barristers have rejected a proposed 15% rise in their fees for undertaking legal aid work and will be taking action over the next four weeks. Members of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA) have said this is too low and called for a minimum 25% wage increase. Jo Sidhu QC, chair of the CBA, said they had already lost a quarter of specialist criminal barristers over the last five years, with 300 leaving last year. Richard Atkins QC, former chair of CBA, read a statement outside Birmingham Crown Court Kirsty Brimelow QC, deputy chair of the CBA, said the proposed rise in legal aid fees would not be introduced until the end of next year. By then, she told the BBC, it would be too late to help and would not do enough to stem the flow of junior barristers leaving the bar. Under the legal aid system, the government pays for barristers to ensure suspects who cannot afford lawyers are properly advised and represented. The government sets pay rates for barristers doing legal aid work. Dozens of barristers have been rallying outside the Old Bailey in their robes and wigs, as two murder trials at the court - one involving a teenage suspect - were unable to get under way. Others have been striking outside a number of high-profile courts, including Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff and Bristol Crown Courts. Strike leaves defendants facing court delays Barristers in Wales walk out of courts Those joining picket lines have been warned by the most senior judge in England and Wales, The Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett, that they could face disciplinary proceedings for misconduct if they don't turn up to court. Chair of the CBA, Jo Sidhu QC, told striking colleagues they were ""engulfed in a crisis of epic proportions"" Downing Street urged barristers to agree to the proposed 15% pay rise, which a spokesperson said would see a typical barrister earn around Â£7,000 more a year. But Ms Brimelow, speaking outside Manchester Crown Court, told the BBC the system had run on ""good will"" for a long time, including throughout the pandemic, with junior barristers working ""ridiculous hours."" She said the issue had been ""caused by government, not by barristers."" The strikes start with walkouts on Monday and Tuesday and, for four weeks, increase by one day each week until a five-day strike is held from Monday 18 July to Friday 22 July. Barristers are self-employed and often perceived as highly-paid. The median salary for a criminal barrister in the year 2019-20 was Â£79,800,according to an independent review.,external But that figure falls to a range of Â£55,900 to Â£62,900 once expenses are accounted for. Meanwhile, new criminal barristers can earn as little as Â£9,000 once costs, including transport, are factored in, while some barristers say the time they spend preparing cases means their hourly earnings are below minimum wage. Barristers with zero, one or two years of practise earned a median of Â£25,100 before expenses and a net figure of Â£18,800 after expenses. Lawyers who work in other areas, such as private corporate law, can expect to earn Â£100,000 a year from very early in their careers. Junior barristers are working for a ""pittance"" - and sometimes for nothing at all if cases are adjourned, barrister and author Chris Daw told BBC News. He said that the 15% pay rise proposed by the government would not ""touch the sides"" and will be ""wiped out by inflation"" by the time it comes into effect. If nothing changes, he said strike action could go on until August ""or beyond"". The number of lawyers working in criminal justice - both barristers who appear before judges in courts and solicitors who instruct them - has declined over the last decade, as many say they cannot make a living when they take on cases funded by legal aid. Barrister Claire Stevenson is picketing alongside colleagues at the Old Bailey in central London Junior criminal barrister Claire Stevenson says she finds out which court she'll be attending the day before - and any case could include reading hundreds of pages of documents. ""It may be that you have to spend the whole night reading... to ensure that you are acting in the best interests of your client,"" she tells the BBC. Criminal barristers get paid for their preparation and the trial, as well as additional payments per day worked. But she says lots of other unseen work means they're not paid enough: ""People think you turn up on the day of the trial good to go - you don't."" When she began her career a few years ago she was paid about Â£12,000 a year, but since then has started working in other areas of law as the money ""just simply wasn't enough to pay my bills"". There were 567 criminal trials, including 60 sexual offence cases, unable to go ahead last year as there were no barristers to prosecute and defend them, according to Ms Brimelow. And as of the end of April, there was a backlog of 58,271 cases, according to HM Courts and Tribunal Service.

"Forensic teams are investigating at the the scene The youngest victim among the at least 21 people who died at a drinking place at the weekend was 13, police minister Bheki Cele has said. The cause of the deaths was not immediately clear and the authorities are investigating. The victims were found strewn across floors and tables at the Enyobeni Tavern in the town of East London. The bodies were taken to mortuaries, where post-mortem examinations will be carried out. Mr Cele, who had visited the scene and was briefed by the local police, said those who had died were between the ages of 13 and 17 - but a detailed list of the victims has not yet been produced. The legal minimum drinking age in South Africa is 18. There are reports that people who had gone to the tavern were celebrating the end of school exams. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa expressed his ""deepest condolences"" to families of the victims. ""This tragedy is made even more grave by its occurrence during Youth Month - a time during which we... advocate and advance opportunities for improved socio-economic conditions for the youth of our nation,"" he said in a tweet. Oscar Mabuyane, premier of East Cape Province where the tragedy happened, did not give possible reasons for the deaths, but condemned the ""unlimited consumption of liquor"". Speaking at the scene, he said: ""You can't just trade in the middle of society like this and think that young people are not going to experiment."" The incident occurred in the early hours of Sunday. A provincial safety official told AFP news agency that a stampede had been ruled out as the cause of death as there were ""no visible wounds"".

"Russia is believed to have defaulted on its debt for the first time since 1998 after missing a key deadline. Russia has the money to make a $100m payment, which was due on Sunday, but sanctions made it impossible to get the sum to international creditors. The country had been determined to avoid the default, which is a major blow to the nation's prestige. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, said ""statements of a default were absolutely unjustified"". He added that an intermediary bank had withheld the money and that the reserves were blocked ""unlawfully"". The White House said that Russia had defaulted on paying yields on its international bonds, crediting sanctions for effectively cutting Russia off from the global financial system. Russia's finance minister called the situation ""a farce"" and said the situation is not expected to have short-term impact. This is because Russia does not need to raise money internationally as it is reaping revenue from high-priced commodities such as oil, according to Chris Weafer, chief executive at Moscow-based consultancy Macro Advisory. But he said it would create a ""legacy"" problem if the situation with Ukraine and international sanctions improves. ""This is the sort of action that will hang over the economy and make recovery much more difficult when we get to that stage,"" he said. The $100m interest payment was due on 27 May. Russia says the money was sent to Euroclear, a bank which would then distribute the payment to investors. But that payment has been stuck there,according to Bloomberg News,external, and creditors have not received it. Meanwhile, some Taiwanese holders of Russian bonds denominated in euros have not received interest payments, according to the Reuters news agency, which cited two sources. The money had not arrived within 30 days of the due date, that is, Sunday evening, and so is considered a default. Euroclear would not say if the payment had been blocked, but said it adhered to all sanctions, introduced following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia disputed that it had defaulted on the debt. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it had made the payments due in May, and the fact that it was blocked by Euroclear because of sanctions was ""not our problem."" Russia's economy in for a bumpy ride as sanctions bite What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion? Russia finance minister Anton Siluanov admitted foreign investors would ""not be able to receive"" the payments, according to the RIA Novosti news wire. Because Russia wants to pay and has plenty of money to do it, he denied that this amounts to a genuine default, which usually occur when governments refuse to pay, or their economies are so weak that they cannot find the money. ""Everyone in the know understands that this is not a default at all. This whole situation looks like a farce."" Defaulting nations usually find it impossible to borrow any more money, but Russia is already in effect barred from borrowing in Western markets by sanctions. Also, Russia is reportedly earning about $1bn a day from fossil fuel exports, and its finance minister Anton Siluanov said in April the country had no plans to borrow more. The default will trigger repayments on a large chunk of Russia's debt, according to Mr Weafer. About $40bn of Russia's debts are denominated in dollars or euros, with around half held outside the country. ""Some parts of that debt will now become automatically due because there will be early repayment clauses in all debt instruments so if you default on one it usually triggers the immediate demand for payment on the other debts, so Russia could certainly face immediate debt repayment of about $20bn at this stage,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov says the so-called default is a farce"" Russia's last debt default of any kind was in 1998 as the country was rocked by the rouble crisis during the chaotic end of Boris Yeltsin's regime. At the time Moscow failed to keep up payments on its domestic bonds and defaulted on some overseas debt. Russia has seemed on an inevitable path to default since sanctions were first imposed by the US and European Union following the invasion of Ukraine. These restricted the country's access to the international banking networks which would process payments from Russia to investors around the world. The Russian government has said it wants to make all of its payments on time, and up until now it had succeeded. Default seemed inevitable when the US Treasury decided not to renew the special exemption in sanctions rules allowing investors to receive interest payments from Russia, which expired on 25 May. The Kremlin now appears to have accepted this inevitability too, decreeing on 23 June stating that all future debt payments would be made in roubles through a Russian bank, the National Settlements Depository, even when contracts state they should be in dollars or other international currencies. Meanwhile, Mr Weafer, who is based in Moscow, said that life was more or less operating as normal despite sanctions and Western companies withdrawing from Russia. ""If you're in Moscow right now frankly, if you weren't reading the newspapers, you'd see there's been a price increase but otherwise life is as it was before February 24. ""In March and April there was a lot of concern that products would disappear, that factories would not be able to get components or materials to continue operating and we could be looking therefore at a severe drop in employment or a rise in unemployment by the summer [or] early autumn. That situation has improved,"" he added. ""We've seen alternative import routes opening via Kazakhstan and Turkey, the government has promoted what they call a parallel import scheme so effectively a lot of products that were blocked in March and April are now starting to reappear, albeit at a higher price.""

"This video can not be played The RSPCA says there is an issue in Wales with illegal dog breeding The number of investigations into illegal dog breeding in Wales rose by 63% last year, figures have shown. RSPCA Cymru said there were 366 cases being investigated by councils, although prosecutions remained low with figures doubling to just eight. The rise has been more notable since the pandemic. The Welsh government said it was supporting councils in tackling illegal dog breeding, including training of more enforcement officers. Raspberry, a six-month-old English Bulldog, was rescued along with her mother Blackcurrant from an unlicensed breeder. Illegal dog breeder who mutilated puppies jailed Dog charity braced for Â£30,000 monthly vet bill More than 200 dogs rescued from unlicensed breeder She has already had an operation to treat a defective soft palate and is expected to suffer with health complications throughout her life. Both are being cared for by staff at the Hope Rescue centre in Pontyclun, Rhondda Cynon Taf, and are just two of the 219 dogs rescued by this centre alone over the past 12 months. Previously the number has been closer to 30 dogs per year. ""Blackcurrant is three years old and has had a number of puppies,"" said Sara Rosser, head of welfare and adoption at Hope Rescue, which works in partnership with RSPCA Cymru. ""The skin rolls on her head need cleaning or they become infected, she has suffered ear infections and she has also had an operation on her eye since she came here."" She added: ""Unfortunately during Covid we had an explosion in low-welfare breeders, but we are thankful that the public seem to be more aware of animal welfare issues and are reporting those concerns."" Raspberry and Blackcurrant are two of the 219 dogs helped by Hope Rescue in Pontyclun in the past year RSPCA Cymru's figures follow the charity's freedom of information requests to Welsh councils to find out how much of a challenge they are facing It said the figures may only be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to poor puppy breeding practices in Wales, and is calling for more council investigators and for more irresponsible breeders to be sent to prison. ""There is clearly an issue in Wales,"" said RSPCA's Chris O'Brien. ""We know that the early years are so important for puppies in terms of their health and development and their future behaviour and so the conditions in these establishments are crucial and it is disturbing to hear that there has been such a big increase in complaints and investigations. ""We've historically had a problem in Wales with poor breeding standards and practices, and while there are good dog breeders out there these statistics show the problem has not gone away. Indeed the problem has escalated to a concerning level through Covid. ""We do have dog breeding laws in Wales, but we want to see those strengthened."" A spokeswoman for Trading Standards Wales, Alison Farrar, said the ""lack of prosecutions"" does not mean there is a ""problem"". ""I actually see that as a good thing,"" she said, ""because it's only when things are really bad that you have to get as far as a prosecution. Alison Farrar says social media influencers are driving demand for dog breeds, with some people paying up to Â£4,000 for a puppy ""The work of trading standards isn't to go straight for a prosecution,"" Ms Farrar said, explaining its role is to help ""breeders bring their business into compliance"". Ms Farrar said there has been an upsurge in dogs being advertised on social media, including adverts being shared on online groups. ""We want to encourage the public if they see any dogs being advertised anywhere they're not sure we want them to report them to our Crimestoppers line,"" she said. ""We'll go out and check the licensing...  things like the microchips on the dogs to make sure that everything is above board."" The Welsh government said its animal welfare plan for 2021-26 outlined the actions it will take. A spokesman added: ""Our new regulations on pet sales which came into force in September 2021 with funding support for enforcement, work alongside the delivery of existing dog breeding regulations, and are already resulting in lasting improvements to the welfare standards of puppies bred in Wales.""

"There's mounting evidence that Russian forces in occupied areas of Ukraine have been systematically stealing grain and other produce from local farmers. The BBC has talked to farmers and analysed satellite images and shipping data to track where the grain is going. A few dozen miles from the frontline, Ukrainian farmer Dmytro describes how the business he nurtured over 25 years was lost in four months of Russian occupation. The BBC tried to contact more than 200 farmers whose land is now in Russian-occupied territory. Dmytro - we are not using his real name to protect him from reprisals - was one of the few willing to meet us. ""They stole our grain. They destroyed our premises, destroyed our equipment."" CCTV footage of the moment Russian soldiers arrived at a storage facility He says Russian forces now occupy 80% of the tens of thousands of hectares he farms and accuses them of stealing grain on an industrial scale. CCTV from one of the company's sites captured the moment the Russians arrived. We've blurred some of the surroundings to protect the identities of the farm owners. Later in the footage, one soldier spots a security camera and shoots at it, but misses. Grain trucks were stolen and Dmytro says a couple of them had GPS trackers fitted. We were able to use this data to see they had gone south into Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, and then on to Russia. From the GPS data, both trucks stopped near a storage facility - identified as a site for unloading and storing grain - in the Crimean town of Oktyabrske. In a satellite image from 14 June this year - you can see a line of trucks on the road next to the facility. We can see the storage facility is next to a rail line, which can be used to transport grain either into Russia or down to ports in southern Crimea. The top of the storage site also appears to have the Z symbol - the emblem of Russia's invasion - on the roof. It's very hard to track individual shipments of stolen grain but there is plenty of evidence that much of it goes first to Crimea. There is satellite imagery at two key entry points - at Chonhar and Armiansk - in which you can see a build-up of vehicles, which could be used to transport grain and other produce. An image from the Chonhar entry point taken on 17 June shows a line of trucks more than 5km (three miles) long. This level of road traffic into Crimea is unusual as Ukraine has not had access to the area since it was annexed by Russia in 2014, and has been exporting grain and other products from elsewhere. It might be possible to explain some of the volume of traffic as empty trucks returning from the occupied areas having delivered supplies to Russian troops. But an obvious interpretation is that many of the trucks are carrying grain - or other products like sunflower seeds - taken from Ukrainian farmers. Satellite images of the town of Dzhankoi in Crimea show trucks waiting on a road next to a grain storage facility and near the connected train station. The images show cargo trains - with wagons of the type used to transport grain and other produce - at the station next to the storage facility. Trains from Dzhankoi are connected to the ports of Sevastopol and Kerch, where produce can be moved into Russia or abroad. ""They take grain to the annexed Crimea first, where they transport it to Kerch or Sevastopol [ports], then they load Ukrainian grain on Russian ships and go to the Kerch Strait,"" says Andrii Klymenko, an expert at the Institute for Black Sea Strategic Studies in Kyiv, who regularly monitors movements of ships around Crimea. ""There, in the Kerch Strait [between Crimea and Russia], they transfer Ukrainian grain from small ships on to bulk carriers, where it is mixed with grain from Russia - or in some cases, they sail to this area just to give the appearance they are loading up with Russian grain."" He adds this is then exported with Russian certificates, saying that it's Russian grain. Ships have then often headed on to Syria or Turkey. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has saidthey have investigated claims about Ukrainian grain being shipped to Turkey and so far not found any evidence.,external ""We saw that the ships' port of departure and the origin of the goods is Russia on the records,"" he said. Satellite images from the Avlita grain terminal at the port of Sevastopol in the west of Crimea show a high level of activity throughout June, with yellow material consistent with the colour of grain being loaded on to a series of ships. This video can not be played Evidence of cargo vessels being loaded with grain in the Avlita Grain Terminal, Sevastopol We reviewed images of the same terminal in June over the past few years, and this amount of activity appears to be unusually high. Some experts we spoke to said this activity could only be accounted for by grain transported from Ukraine's mainland. ""Crimea doesn't really grow a lot of grain for export,"" says Mariia Bogonos, agriculture policy expert at the Kyiv School of Economics. It would also not make geographical sense for Russia to use Sevastopol to export its own grain. But Mike Lee, an agriculture expert with Green Square Agro who has worked in both Ukraine and Russia, says some grain coming out of Crimea could be part of a backlog from last year's harvest, kept in storage because of the war. ""Crimea is under Russian control, but supply chains have been affected there as well."" From Crimea, theUS and Ukrainian authorities,externalandmedia reports,externalhave named nine ships believed to have transported stolen Ukrainian grain abroad. Using data from Lloyd's List Intelligence, the BBC has tracked these ships on journeys between Crimea and ports in Turkey and Syria since April. Lloyd's List Intelligence says the vessels have used what maritime specialists would describe as ""deceptive"" sailing practices - switching off their on-board trackers when entering the Black Sea, or moving around the Kerch Strait near Crimea. When their trackers come back online, the ships are sailing south and many report a lower depth in the water, suggesting they've taken on cargo during the blackout. The BBC mapped the journeys of three vessels: the Matros Pozynich and Sormovskiy 48, owned by two companies in Russia, as well as the Finikia, owned by the Syrian General Maritime Authority. We tried to contact the Russian-registered owners of these vessels to ask about the journeys, but did not get a response.  We were unable to get through to the Syrian owners. Despite the gaps in their tracker histories, satellite imagery has revealed where some of the ships have been. Pictures from Maxar show the Matros Pozynich in Sevastopol in Crimea in mid-May. During this trip, it sailed to the Kerch Strait, had a transponder blackout for five days, and then reappeared hundreds of miles south in the Black Sea. It was later pictured in the Syrian port of Latakia - but had its tracking system off. Under the UN's Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), ships must have their trackers switched on at all times, unless it poses a threat to their safety and security - from piracy, for example. Michelle Wiese Bockmann, a market editor at Lloyd's List Intelligence, believes there is no justification for turning off trackers near Crimea or near the Syrian coast. ""This practice is clearly not linked with piracy risks,"" says Ms Bockmann. ""Other ships have their transponders on, so why don't they?"" The BBC has also obtained documents drawn up by the Russian occupying authorities listing farms where grain is to be transferred to them. A separateinvestigation by BBC Russian and BBC Ukrainianhas shown that in some cases, the Russians are forcing Ukrainian farmers to sell grain at prices well below market rates, and sign documents to prove it was purchased ""legally"". While early reports were typically of outright theft by Russian forces, farmers suggest there has been a change in tactics as the Russians realise that if they pay nothing, future harvests could be sabotaged. The farmers say they have to accept the low prices as they have no alternative and need to buy fuel and pay workers. Emilie Pottle, an international law barrister, told the BBC that these actions may violate the Geneva Convention and International Criminal Court (ICC) rules governing occupying powers. We contacted the Russian authorities to ask about these allegations, but have yet to receive a response. However, some officials in Russian-held areashave spoken openly about Ukrainian grain being taken from the areas they now control.

"Leaders of the G7, including US President Joe Biden (L) and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson (R), proposed a plan geared towards competing with China's Belt and Road Initiative G7 leaders have detailed plans to mobilise $600bn in funding for the developing world in a move seen as a counter to China's Belt and Road plan. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) relaunches a schemeunveiled at last year's G7 talksin England. US President Joe Biden said the plan would deliver returns for everyone. China's multi-trillion dollar infrastructure initiative is criticised for hitting nations with too much debt. ""I want to be clear. This isn't aid or charity,"" Mr Biden said of the G7's PGII scheme. ""It's an investment that will deliver returns for everyone."" The scheme would allow countries to ""see the concrete benefits of partnering with democracies,"" the US president added. The plan calls on G7 leaders to raise $600bn over five years to fund the launch of infrastructure projects in middle and low-income countries. The US has promised to raise $200bn (Â£162bn) of the total through grants, federal funds and private investment, while the EU has announced a further 300bn euros (Â£257bn). The initiative will be geared towards tackling climate change, improving global health, achieving gender equity and building digital infrastructure. Is China luring poorer countries into debt? China: Big spender or loan shark? Some of the highlighted initiatives include a solar-powered project in Angola, a vaccine manufacturing facility in Senegal, and a 1,609 km submarine telecommunications cable connecting Singapore to France via Egypt and the Horn of Africa. The plan has been pitched as a way to counter China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Launched by Chinese president Xi Jinping in 2013, the BRI provides financing for emerging countries to build infrastructure like ports, roads and bridges. While it has developed trade links, it has also been criticised as a means of providing ""predatory loans"", forcing debt-saddled countries to cede key assets if they fail to meet their debt repayments. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the aim of the latest project was to present a ""positive powerful investment impulse to the world to show our partners in the developing world that they have a choice"". The infrastructure plan was first unveiled at the 2021 G7 summit in Britain. Called the Build Back Better World at the time, the US-driven plan faltered from a lack of progress, and the project was renamed to PGII before being resuscitated at the 2022 summit.

"Amy says her dream is to get well A woman from north Wales with anorexia has said she believes she will die without specialist treatment which is only available privately in England. Amy Ellis from Broughton, Flintshire, is trying to raise thousands of pounds to fund the treatment after being told it would not be paid for by the NHS. She is now cared for by her mum and needs mobility aids to get around. The Welsh government said every health board had received funding to improve eating disorder services. Warning: You may find some of the following content distressing Former charity worker Amy, 42, has suffered with eating disorders all her life, but was diagnosed with a form of anorexia four years ago when her weight plummeted, and now has to use a wheelchair or walking stick to get around. The care Amy wants offers a combination of treatments, including cognitive behavioural therapy, and dialectical therapy, as well as dietic and body image support. There is no specialist eating disorder unit in Wales, and the care offered in England is residential and private, costing about Â£7,500 a week. If you are affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available viathe BBC Action Lineand the charityBeat Eating Disorders.,external This video can not be played Amy Ellis is trying to raise money for anorexia treatment not available on the NHS in Wales ""Where I am...

""I have been with the NHS for 20 years, they could offer no help, because there is no help."" Amy said she believed NHS Wales had funded others in her situation to get the private treatment, but said she was told she was ""not sick enough"" and that she has a care plan which is helping her locally. Amy's mum Lyn says her daughter used to be ""so full of life"" However, Amy's mum Lyn Ellis said there was no-one who could help her daughter. ""It's very frustrating, someone with a different illness is given the treatment they need, for people with eating disorders, they either put them in psychiatric unit or put them on a drip to feed them, and then off you go... it's not enough,"" she said. ""It breaks my heart to hear her (Amy) in the toilet crying, I don't want to do this anymore, she knows it's straining her heart and that alone could take her,"" she said. The Welsh government recently said since 2017, health boards had received an additional Â£4.1m to support improvements such as early intervention and improved waiting times. It added: ""Improving support for eating disorders is a priority for Welsh government and as part of the additional Â£50m to improve mental health and well-being in 2022-23, we are providing an additional Â£2.5m for eating disorder services."" Prof Alberto Salmoiraghi, from Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, said it was unable to comment on Amy's treatment because of patient confidentiality, but said it intended to get in touch with her to discuss her concerns. Prof Salmoiraghi, medical director for mental health and learning disabilities, said: ""We share Amy's desire to ensure that she receives the most appropriate care. ""Our specialist adult eating disorder service provides highly specialist interventions and treatment for moderate to severe eating disorders, these treatments are compliant with NICE guidelines. ""Each patient is provided with a comprehensive multi-disciplinary assessment and treatment plan based on their unique presentation and difficulties, this can include referral to specialist providers outside of north Wales where clinically appropriate."" Amy, who is documenting her struggle with daily videos on TikTok, where she has about 53,000 followers, said she felt a huge responsibility to them. ""It's unbelievable, all the support from around the world, from sufferers, and from people that just didn't understand that this isn't a life choice.

She said her dream was to get well so she could bring eating disorders to the forefront and help others. Her childhood friend, Simon Quick, who has run half marathons to raise money for Amy's treatment and helps her run the Saving Amy Cymru campaign, said it was hard to see her struggle with the illness.

"The prime minister has signalled controls on steel imports that were due to expire this week could be retained. When asked whether this could lead to a possible breach of international law, Boris Johnson responded ""these are tough choices we have to make"". It follows a proposed approach set out by the international trade secretary on Thursday. But the Department for International Trade said a final decision has not yet been made. Speaking at the G7 summit in Germany, Mr Johnson said keeping the import controls on foreign steel would protect British producers which are already under pressure from rising energy prices. ""We need British steel to be provided with much cheaper energy,"" Mr Johnson said. ""But until we can fix that, I think it is reasonable for UK steel to have the same protections that absolutely every other European steel economy does."" Energy-intensive firms to get electricity bill help UK makes last-ditch extension to steel protections Earlier this month, Mr Johnson linked the resignation of his ethics adviser Lord Geidt to a disagreement about future decisions on steel tariffs. But Mr Geidt said that interpretation of his decision to quit didn't reflect ""the far wider scope of my objection"". The limits on steel imports being considered were first introduced by the European Union in 2018 in response to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The controls were mirrored by the UK after Brexit. The restrictions, which add a tariff to steel imports once a certain quota has been reached, are known as ""steel safeguards"" because they are designed to protect the domestic market from surges of cheap steel from overseas. The controls are currently in place for 15 categories of steel. While controls protecting 10 of those categories have already been extended to 2024, import limits on five categories are set to expire on 30 June. The question of extending tariffs on steel imports is seen as potentially breaking World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments. The prime minister has been at the G7 summit discussing shaping the global economy Asked whether the government was considering imposing tariffs which may be illegal, cabinet minister Brandon Lewis said the government was focused on ""ensuring we work within international law."" Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, the Northern Ireland Secretary said he was ""not saying the government is going to do this"" but that ""this is something that is supported across the sector"" and the government has ""got to look at all these things"" and ""get the balance right."" UK Steel, the lobby group for the British steel industry, said it was confident extending the steel controls would be ""WTO compliant"" and ""there would be no legitimate reason for challenges"". The Department for International Trade said it is consulting with foreign counterparts in adherence with World Trade Organization rules, before making a final decision on whether to extend the safeguards. UK Steel said ending the import controls would expose British steelmakers to a distorted global marketplace and that could cause as much as Â£150m a year in damage. Also speaking on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said Labour would support the prime minister in the tariffs being continued. ""It's an extension that both the EU and the Americans have continued with so we would support him,"" he said. ""Steel workers support him, the unions support him, industry supports him and Labour does support him."" But the Conservative MP and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Tom Tugendhat tweeted today: ""Protectionism is destructive to all of us. Tariffs are un-Conservative because they're a tax on consumers.""

"Amid the beauty of the Bavarian mountains and fields, a fundamental truth is immediately striking at this G7 Summit. When a collection of democracies gather, each national leader is flexing to the political and public mood back home, subtly, sometimes strikingly different from one country to the next. The G7 has an opponent in Russia, whose leader faces no such democratic pressure, and is acutely savvy about the weaknesses, as he might see them, of the western model of governance. Amid the security and the choreography, the grip and grin photo ops and the alpine backdrops, the differences of emphasis between the G7 countries, and their desire to project a collective impression to the wider world is worth exploring in turn. Firstly, those internal differences. The prime minister, as we know, arrives here with domestic political issues having chased him north from the Commonwealth summit in Rwanda. It'll probably chase him to the summit of the Nato defence alliance in Spain in a few days too. He is out of the country for a week, while Conservatives back home from the cabinet speculate privately about his future. But other leaders face domestic political pressures too. Take President Emmanuel Macron of France, for instance. A few months after being re-elected as president, he's lost control of the French National Assembly. The British government feel Germany and in particular France are feeling the domestic political pressure of some of the consequences of the Ukraine war - not least spiralling prices. After Boris Johnson's meeting with President Macron, Downing Street told us: ""The prime minister stressed any attempt to settle the conflict now will only cause enduring instability and give Putin licence to manipulate both sovereign countries and international markets in perpetuity."" Foreign Secretary Liz Truss co-wrote something very similar, with her Ukrainian counterpart, in the Sunday Telegraph. Publicly, No 10 insists President Macron has done ""huge amounts"" to support Ukraine, but privately there is concern Paris is losing appetite for the long-term slog of the war, and its costs. Beyond the internal G7 diplomacy, there are then the efforts being made together to reassure countries beyond the group, some of whom blame western sanctions as much as Russian aggression for rising prices, as my colleague James Landalewrites about here. Argentina, India and South Africa are among the other countries invited here to join discussions. I'm told that tomorrow a quad of key countries will meet here - the United States, France, Germany and the UK. Those around the prime minister talk about the need for a ""gear change"" on sanctions, and they believe the new ones on Russian gold contribute to this, and a ""game changer"" on military support, which will be talked about more at the Nato summit in Madrid. Getting there, this week and beyond, will require persuasion and patience. And it comes at a cost.

"Delays unloading ambulances at busy hospitals are causing serious harm to patients, a safety watchdog is warning. TheHealthcare Safety Investigation Branch,externalhas been investigating how the long waits are delaying 999 emergency response times across England. Kenneth Shadbolt, 94, waited more than five hours for an ambulance after a bad fall - an accident that proved fatal. Logs show that in his final 999 call he asked: ""Can you please tell them to hurry up or I shall be dead."" The BBC has been given permission from the coroner to view detailed evidence into his recent death. Ken Shadbolt had been in good shape for his age. A retired factory worker and carpenter, he lived alone in a semi-detached house in the market town of Chipping Campden in the Cotswolds, and could often be spotted cycling around the local housing estate on his electric trike. On the night of Wednesday, 23 March 2022, he called one of his five sons for a chat before turning in for the night. Just before 03:00, he got out of bed to go the bathroom and fell, hitting a wardrobe before collapsing on the floor. He had hurt his hip - how badly he didn't know - and couldn't get up. He could reach his mobile on his bedside, though, and dialled 999 for help. The BBC has seen transcripts of the three separate phone calls he made to South Western Ambulance Service that night. The first was short and factual, covering the basic details of his injury. He seemed calm and lucid but made clear he was in pain and needed an ambulance. He was told by the call handler not to try to move unless he felt in danger and assured that help was ""being arranged"". ""How long will it be?"" he asked. ""I don't know, unfortunately, [but] we will try to get someone there as soon as we can,"" came the reply. He then spoke to one of his sons who offered to drive up that night from the other side of the country. Ken said he thought an ambulance was on the way, and not to worry. Internal call logs seen by the BBC show that at this point Ken was triaged as a category two emergency, meaning paramedics should arrive in 18 minutes, on average. That didn't happen. About 15 minutes later, he called 999 for a second time. It was clear by now that he was starting to worry. He said he couldn't move his right leg and talked about an injury to his shoulder as he'd hit the floor. He was worried about his mobile phone, saying the battery ""won't last forever"". ""When I rang up 999 I thought I would get some treatment straight away,"" he told the next person on the line. ""It is still down as an emergency response,"" the call handler replied. ""We are extremely busy at the moment but we are working on getting that help to you as quickly as we possibly can, ok?"" An internal ambulance service log seen by the BBC shows that South Western Ambulance Service was indeed busy that night. It talks about ""high demand"" in the Gloucester area, with more than 60 patients waiting for help, some for more than eight hours. But something else was going on at the same time. The local A&E was very full, so paramedics arriving outside the emergency department were unable to unload their sick patients straight away. The ambulance service log warns there were ""long delays with unloading at GRH [Gloucestershire Royal Hospital]"" that night. Data seen by the BBC shows that 75% of ambulances were delayed for at least half an hour at Gloucester or its sister hospital in Cheltenham on 24 March, with 54% having to wait for more than an hour. That handover should be completed in under 15 minutes. If paramedics are queuing outside A&E, then they are not able to get back on the road and quickly pick up the next patient who needs help. A doctor's report into Ken's case specifically refers to ""a lack of ambulances available"" that night. Ambulances waiting to unload patients at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital on 13 June, 2022. Another hour passed before he made his third and final call to 999. It was clear now that he was in serious pain. He felt ""terrible sick"" and said his ""breathing is going too"". ""I need an ambulance because I'm going to fade away quite quickly,"" he said. The same reply came back: ""The ambulance service is just under a lot of pressure at the moment... we are doing our best. ""I appreciate that you've been stuck for quite some time, Ken... we've not forgotten about you at all."" Later in the call he said he was cold and could not reach his duvet. He'd already tried phoning one of his neighbours but could not get through, and said they ""might be away"". He was told by the 999 call handler to ""try to stay still"". ""Can you please tell them to hurry up or I shall be dead,"" he said. ""Send me the undertaker, that would be the best bet."" He put the phone down for the last time. Kenneth Shadbolt's son Jerry says his father must have felt abandoned An ambulance finally got to Kenneth Shadbolt's house at 08:10 that morning, four hours after that final call. By then one of his sons had contacted a neighbour, who found him unconscious on his bedroom floor. He arrived at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital at 09:59, and was handed over to the trauma team. A doctor phoned the family and told them to come straight away and explained that his injuries were not survivable. Ken died at 14:21 that afternoon, with the cause of death given as a ""very large subdural haematoma"" or bleed on the brain. His son Jerry Shadbolt said: ""The doctors were saying his injuries were non-survivable but would they have been non-survivable if he'd arrived at hospital four hours earlier? I'd like an answer to that question. ""He was on his own and he knew he was on his own. He must have felt abandoned and alone on his bedroom floor. That's the most troubling part of it for me."" Jenny Winslade, executive director of quality and clinical care for the South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust, offered her ""sincere condolences"" to the family and friends of Mr Shadbolt. She said delays handing over patients to A&E, and busy hospitals, meant it was ""taking us too long to get an ambulance to patients"". ""This is a risk which we recognise is unacceptable,"" she said. ""We continue to work on a daily basis with our partners to ensure our crews can get back out on the road as quickly as possible, to respond to other 999 calls."" Prof Mark Pietroni, medical director and acting chief executive of Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said local and national health systems were ""under intense pressure"" and continued to face significant challenges ""in response to unrelenting demand"". The trust said that, currently, 240 hospital patients - out of a total of 837 beds for patients - were waiting for support to go home or be moved to other locations in the community. Doctors and paramedics have become increasingly concerned about long ambulance wait times across the UK this year. In England as a whole, the average response for a category two emergency, such as a heart attack or stroke, was almost 40 minutes in May - more than twice as long as the 18-minute target. Last month, Dr Katherine Henderson, an A&E consultant and president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine,described the situation as ""more serious than we've ever seen it"". She said the problem is often caused by delays discharging patients from hospital wards into a care setting, which then creates a bottleneck in A&E, leaving no space for new patients arriving by ambulance. The BBC has spoken to people who have spent hours waiting outside emergency departments this year, sometimes transferred between different ambulance vehicles because there is no room to treat them in the hospital itself. The Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) says the delays are causing harm to patients, including some deaths. Its final report will be published later this year, but the interim findings - released on Thursday - show that staff who have witnessed harm to patients and their families are traumatised. ""Harm is happening on a daily basis,"" said the HSIB's national investigator Neil Alexander. He referred to patients deteriorating in ambulances while waiting for treatment in emergency departments, and patients getting infections in hospital because they were staying there too long. ""And we are no longer using the word 'risk' in this investigation, because risk is being realised and is now harm,"" Mr Alexander said. The government said it would carefully consider the HSIB's report and would ""respond in due course"". ""The NHS has allocated Â£150m of additional funding to address pressures on ambulance services, with the number of ambulance and support staff increasing by almost 40% since February 2010,"" said a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care. ""We have also established a national taskforce to identify ways to reduce delayed discharges and ensure patients are only in hospital for as long as they need to be.""

"Russia is believed to have defaulted on its debt for the first time since 1998 after missing a key deadline. Russia has the money to make a $100m payment, which was due on Sunday, but sanctions made it impossible to get the sum to international creditors. The country had been determined to avoid the default, which is a major blow to the nation's prestige. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, said ""statements of a default were absolutely unjustified"". He added that an intermediary bank had withheld the money and that the reserves were blocked ""unlawfully"". The White House said that Russia had defaulted on paying yields on its international bonds, crediting sanctions for effectively cutting Russia off from the global financial system. Russia's finance minister called the situation ""a farce"" and said the situation is not expected to have short-term impact. This is because Russia does not need to raise money internationally as it is reaping revenue from high-priced commodities such as oil, according to Chris Weafer, chief executive at Moscow-based consultancy Macro Advisory. But he said it would create a ""legacy"" problem if the situation with Ukraine and international sanctions improves. ""This is the sort of action that will hang over the economy and make recovery much more difficult when we get to that stage,"" he said. The $100m interest payment was due on 27 May. Russia says the money was sent to Euroclear, a bank which would then distribute the payment to investors. But that payment has been stuck there,according to Bloomberg News,external, and creditors have not received it. Meanwhile, some Taiwanese holders of Russian bonds denominated in euros have not received interest payments, according to the Reuters news agency, which cited two sources. The money had not arrived within 30 days of the due date, that is, Sunday evening, and so is considered a default. Euroclear would not say if the payment had been blocked, but said it adhered to all sanctions, introduced following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia disputed that it had defaulted on the debt. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it had made the payments due in May, and the fact that it was blocked by Euroclear because of sanctions was ""not our problem."" Russia's economy in for a bumpy ride as sanctions bite What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion? Russia finance minister Anton Siluanov admitted foreign investors would ""not be able to receive"" the payments, according to the RIA Novosti news wire. Because Russia wants to pay and has plenty of money to do it, he denied that this amounts to a genuine default, which usually occur when governments refuse to pay, or their economies are so weak that they cannot find the money. ""Everyone in the know understands that this is not a default at all. This whole situation looks like a farce."" Defaulting nations usually find it impossible to borrow any more money, but Russia is already in effect barred from borrowing in Western markets by sanctions. Also, Russia is reportedly earning about $1bn a day from fossil fuel exports, and its finance minister Anton Siluanov said in April the country had no plans to borrow more. The default will trigger repayments on a large chunk of Russia's debt, according to Mr Weafer. About $40bn of Russia's debts are denominated in dollars or euros, with around half held outside the country. ""Some parts of that debt will now become automatically due because there will be early repayment clauses in all debt instruments so if you default on one it usually triggers the immediate demand for payment on the other debts, so Russia could certainly face immediate debt repayment of about $20bn at this stage,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov says the so-called default is a farce"" Russia's last debt default of any kind was in 1998 as the country was rocked by the rouble crisis during the chaotic end of Boris Yeltsin's regime. At the time Moscow failed to keep up payments on its domestic bonds and defaulted on some overseas debt. Russia has seemed on an inevitable path to default since sanctions were first imposed by the US and European Union following the invasion of Ukraine. These restricted the country's access to the international banking networks which would process payments from Russia to investors around the world. The Russian government has said it wants to make all of its payments on time, and up until now it had succeeded. Default seemed inevitable when the US Treasury decided not to renew the special exemption in sanctions rules allowing investors to receive interest payments from Russia, which expired on 25 May. The Kremlin now appears to have accepted this inevitability too, decreeing on 23 June stating that all future debt payments would be made in roubles through a Russian bank, the National Settlements Depository, even when contracts state they should be in dollars or other international currencies. Meanwhile, Mr Weafer, who is based in Moscow, said that life was more or less operating as normal despite sanctions and Western companies withdrawing from Russia. ""If you're in Moscow right now frankly, if you weren't reading the newspapers, you'd see there's been a price increase but otherwise life is as it was before February 24. ""In March and April there was a lot of concern that products would disappear, that factories would not be able to get components or materials to continue operating and we could be looking therefore at a severe drop in employment or a rise in unemployment by the summer [or] early autumn. That situation has improved,"" he added. ""We've seen alternative import routes opening via Kazakhstan and Turkey, the government has promoted what they call a parallel import scheme so effectively a lot of products that were blocked in March and April are now starting to reappear, albeit at a higher price.""

Phil Mackie, BBC Midlands correspondent It is a scene of devastation today. The blast destroyed one house and has caused severe damage to several others. Debris is strewn across the street and one car which was upended has now been moved.Â Fire investigators, working alongside specialists from the gas company, have begun sifting through the wreckage as they try to determine what caused the explosion.Â Some residents who were evacuated last night have been allowed to return to their homes this morning to collect any essentials but have been told they may not be allowed to stay in their homes again tonight. Others simply can't access their properties because the damage is so extensive. Ch Insp Monaghan said there were no suspicious circumstances ""at this stage"". Asked about reports the house had been up for sale and that the boiler had needed replacing, fire service area commander Alex Shapland stated: ""That may form part of the investigation.
