"In the wake of the Manchester suicide bomb attack a former assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police has called for the reintroduction of internment camps. With security services revealing there are 3,000 people engaged in plots in the UK and as many as 23,000 who have appeared on the radar of counter-terror agencies, Tarique Ghaffur - in charge during the 7/7 bombings - wrotein the Mail on Sunday,externalthat ""a proper national debate"" should take place. But what would such a policy entail? Internment is when people are imprisoned without trial. It is often associated with wartime situations, or when foreign nationals or people with strong political stances are detained. The most famous use of it in the UK was during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The British Army began Operation Demetrius in 1971, which involved the mass arrest and internment of 342 people suspected of carrying out tasks for the IRA. The government-approved policy was in place until 1975, during which time 1,981 people were interned. The Long Kesh internment camp held internees during the Troubles in Northern Ireland Internment was also used during both World War One andWorld War Two. Both sides set up internment camps to detain civilians with sympathies to the enemy cause. For the first two years of the Second World War, around 8,000 people deemed enemy aliens were temporarily interned in British camps before being deported to the colonies. A more modern example of an internment camp is Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, used by the US to detain terror suspects after the attacks on 9/11. Mr Ghaffur proposed setting up specialist centres to detain the 3,000 extremists. He said they would be community-based centres where the internees would be ""risk-assessed and theologically examined"". Once this step was taken, they would then be made to go through a deradicalisation programme, using the expertise of imams, charity workers and counter-terrorism officers. Those who could be deradicalised should then be ""carefully allowed back into the community,"" said Mr Ghaffur, but those ""deemed too dangerous should be locked up"". He said the centres would need to have oversight from vetted Muslim and other community leaders. Some people backed Mr Ghaffur's stance, including a former head of the government's emergency council Cobra, Colonel Richard Kemp, who said the UK's police and intelligence services simply could not monitor everyone they needed to. But there is fierce opposition to his plan as well, with figures such as ex-Scotland Yard chief Lord Blair rejecting the idea as counter-productive. Martha Spurrier, director of rights group Liberty, said: ""We're a civilised country. We believe in the rule of law - suspects knowing the case against them, standing trial and, if found guilty, being sent to prison by a judge. ""This is the foundation of our free, democratic society - the exact thing terrorists want to destroy. ""Countering the scourge of extremism will clearly be a priority for the next government - but they can and must do so while protecting our values more vigorously than ever."" The police can hold a person for up to 24 hours before they have to charge them with a crime or release them. They can apply to a court to hold a person for up to 36 or 96 hours they are suspected of a serious crime, such as murder. But if a person is arrested under the Terrorism Act, they can be held without charge for up to 14 days. Police would then have to return to the courts for any extension.

"Pinball champion Robert Gagno says having autism has made him a better player. But it's also true that playing pinball has helped him live with autism. When Robert Gagno plays pinball at his local arcade a crowd usually gathers to watch. The Canadian, who lives near Vancouver in British Columbia, has such control he can make each metal ball last up to an hour. He regularly smashes machine records, typing R E G - Robert Emilio Gagno - in the roll of honour. ""If I'm just playing for fun I can play safe shots over and over again. Along the way I figure out which shots score the most points,"" the 27-year-old says. He bends almost horizontally over the machine, bouncing the ball delicately between the flippers, before sending it high up the playfield. Each hit generates a flurry of electronic noises and flashing lights that reflect off his glasses. Robert, who has autism, says this is what first attracted him to the game. His father, Maurizio, remembers the day it all began. ""I took him out for a hamburger when he was five,"" he says. ""There was a pinball machine in the corner and he was much more interested in that than the food. My wife Kathy and I realised we could actually sit and relax for a bit while Robert played."" Kathy noticed her son was ""different"" early on. He was fascinated by Exit signs, liked to spin in circles and often cried and screamed in parent and toddler groups. Robert struggled to form sentences until he was seven ""The word autism was first mentioned when Robert was three,"" Kathy says. ""It wasn't well known back then. The library books I found blamed bad mothering, which made no sense to me."" Robert took longer than usual to learn to speak and his words would come out in a jumbled order. He became frustrated when he couldn't be understood and remembers feeling like he didn't fit in. ""He was a sweet and funny kid but he needed a lot of supervision. We were always open about his struggles to other kids saying things like, 'Sometimes it may not seem like it but he is really happy to play near you,'"" Kathy says. Listen toRobert Gagno talking about the role pinball plays in hislife on Outlook, on the BBC World Service Pinball provided a sanctuary from an often confusing world. His parents bought him his own machine, called Whirlwind, when he was 10 years old and he dedicated hours each day to improving his skills. They now have a dozen machines in their garage in Burnaby, outside Vancouver. As Robert's playing improved so too did his confidence. He began to play at outdoor venues such as bowling alleys. ""It's helped with things like turn-taking, sportsmanship and making small talk and it's certainly boosted his self-esteem,"" Kathy says. It has also provided opportunities to make friends. ""I like playing with other people in leagues. There are good players in Vancouver and it is fun to try and beat each other's scores, or show new players how to play the game,"" he says. Robert likes to talk about play style at tournaments Robert took up competitive pinball when he was 19. Today he is Canada's top player and ranks among the top 10 in the world. He thinks having autism has boosted his game. ""I find I can focus on one thing for a long time and I have a strong visual memory. So I only have to play a machine once to remember it,"" he says. ""I'm also able to notice a lot of things happening at the same time and quickly calculate where the ball is going to go."" However, the condition also has its disadvantages. Robert struggles with social cues, such as the best time to give a friendly hug. ""I find it hard to understand when to talk and when not to talk or figure out what kinds of greetings to give people,"" he says. Robert also has trouble picking the ""right words"" for a situation. In a documentary about him called Wizard Mode, he is asked what he would like an employer to know about him. ""That I'm affectionate,"" he says. There is a pause. ""I think you mean you're friendly and can get on with people,"" his mother replies. His autism can also have a negative effect on his game. Maurizio maintains 12 pinball machines in the family garage ""I'm more prone to becoming anxious and I can struggle to concentrate if I get upset or worried. When that happens I don't play as well,"" Robert says. He plays pinball for a couple of hours each day in the run-up to a tournament. His father helps him prepare for the inevitable change to his routine, something Robert tends to find quite difficult. ""We talk about things like waiting in line at the airport,"" Maurizio says. ""I also sort out his tournament entries and make sure he eats and gets enough sleep when we're there, because otherwise he would probably forget."" Maurizio acts as a coach. He helps Robert to stay calm and put bad games behind him. Tournaments are held across Europe, Canada and America. However, the most prestigious is the Professional and Amateur Pinball Association (PAPA) World Pinball Championship in Pennsylvania, where the winner is crowned world champion. The winner's name is printed on a banner and hung from the rafters of the PAPA headquarters in Pittsburgh. Robert entered last year and made short work of the early rounds. ""It feels amazing when you're in the zone,"" he says. His mother was keeping an eye on the results back at home. ""I remember thinking, 'Holy Crow, he's made it to the top four,'"" Kathy says. Robert went into the final against the top seeded player Zach Sharpe. Sharpe chose the machine they would play on - Flash Gordon, an old game but a notoriously difficult one. However, Robert chalked up a huge score on his second ball, which proved unbeatable. Moments later he was lifting the trophy, while his father looked on with tears in his eyes. ""I was so excited, happy and proud to win PAPA,"" Robert says. ""I love proving people wrong about me."" Robert continues to play competitive pinball but is now focusing on becoming more independent. He works for two mornings a week doing office work in a bank and attends an evening class on computer programming. He has also talked about his pinball career at public events. While Robert currently lives at home with his parents, he is keen to get his own place. ""I would also like to get a girlfriend and even get married one day,"" he says. His proud parents encourage him to keep challenging himself. ""Robert's a good-looking guy and I've encouraged him to sign up to dating websites,"" Maurizio says. ""I don't want him to feel limited or have any barriers.""

"Over Christmas 1989, US soldiers used music to lay siege to Panama's General Manuel Noriega Everyone has at least one song that sets their teeth on edge. Most of the time, they're easy to avoid. But what if you'd lost the power to change the TV channel, switch off the radio, or simply walk away? What if someone played it non-stop for an hour. A day. A week. Even longer? This is ""music torture"" - and while some of its practitioners say it shouldn't count as torture, there's little doubt it works. On Christmas Day, 1989, Panamanian strongman General Manuel Noriega -who died this week- became the most famous victim. The repressive military leader had holed himself up in the Vatican's embassy in Panama City, after President George Bush Senior invaded Panama. Noriega was facing a US indictment for drug-trafficking, as well as claims he had rigged the 1989 election. The embassy was surrounded by US troops, but he refused to give himself up. The US army decided to use psychological warfare - by blasting a wall of sound non-stop outside. A fleet of Humvees mounted with loudspeakers rolled in, and rock music rolled out. The troops' playlist came care of the Southern Command Network, the US military radio in central America. It featured hits picked for their irony value, including I Fought The Law by The Clash, Panama by the stadium rock band Van Halen, U2's All I Want Is You, and Bruce Cockburn's If I Had A Rocket Launcher. Guns'N'Roses and The Doors both played starring roles. Guns'N'Roses tracks like Welcome to the Jungle featured on the ""Noriega playlist"" Noriega was in power in October 1989 but by January 1990 was in Miami facing drugs charges The full list has been saved for posterity in The George Washington University's National Security Archive, while parts of it are availableon YouTube,external. Perhaps inevitably, The Holy See complained to President Bush, and the musical war was stopped after three days. By 3 January 1990 the general, said to be an opera lover, had agreed to surrender. General Manuel Noriega's fall from grace Torture by music: British citizen describes Guantanamo tactics Sesame Street breaks Iraqi POWs,external David Gray's warning on 'torture music',external It's hard to say if it was The Clash wot won it, but the US Army has often repeated the approach. In February 1993, law enforcement agents and the military laid siege to a Texas compound belonging to the Branch Davidians cult, trying to arrest its leader David Koresh. During the 51-day stand-off, it is claimed they played pop music - including Nancy Sinatra's These Boots Are Made for Walkin' - and the sound of jet planes all night. The onslaught included Tibetan chanting and the screams of rabbits being slaughtered. The US alsodeployed Metallica and Thin Lizzy on the frontline in Afghanistan in 2010.,external Marines reportedly blared heavy metal into villages in Marjah for several hours, along with threats to the Taliban. One officer put it succinctly: There are no obscenities, ""but we tell them they're gonna die"". Metallica singer James Hetfield has said he is proud that his music is used against enemies of the US Metallica's Enter Sandman had became a particular favourite at the height of the War on Terror, when US interrogators admitted using music to break the resistance of captives in Iraq. The goal was to deprive them of sleep and offend their cultural sensibilities. Unco-operative prisoners were exposed tochildren's TV music from Sesame Street,external, and the purple singing dinosaur Barney. Sergeant Mark Hadsell of the Psychological Operations Company (Psy Ops) told Newsweek magazine: ""These people haven't heard heavy metal. They can't take it. ""If you play it for 24 hours, your brain and body functions start to slide, your train of thought slows down and your will is broken. That's when we come in and talk to them."" ""In training, they forced me to listen tothe Barney I Love You song,externalfor 45 minutes. I never want to go through that again,"" one US operative told Newsweek. Enter Sandman - Metallica The Real Slim Shady - Eminem I Love You - from the children's TV show Barney & Friends The theme music from Sesame Street Staying Alive - The Bee Gees Babylon - David Gray Dirrty - Christina Aguilera feat. Redman In 2003, Rick Hoffman, vice president of the Psy Ops Veterans' Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such a tactic would have no long-lasting effect on prisoners. ""The use of this kind of audio-technique is rather new in interrogation,"" he said. ""There have been other kinds of non-lethal, non-harmful techniques, such as sleep deprivation... which leave no long-lasting effects but do have the end result of breaking down the individual's will to resist questioning."" Former prisoners disagree. UK resident and ex Guantanamo Bay detainee Binyam Mohamed told the Human Rights group Reprieve: ""There was loud music, [rapper Eminem's] Slim Shady and Dr Dre for 20 days. [...] Plenty lost their minds. I could hear people knocking their heads against the walls and the doors, screaming their heads off."" Former Guantanamo Bay prisoner Binyam Mohamed said people ""lost their minds"" thanks to music torture Haj Ali, who was also held at Guantanamo, told the Daily Mirror that his captors deliberately played only the title phrase of a David Gray song. ""Babylon... Babylon... Babylon... over and over again. It was so loud I thought my head would burst. It went on for a day and a night,"" he said. The United Nations and the European Court of Human Rights have banned the use of loud music in interrogations. The human rights group Amnesty International counts it as a method of torture. ""It's important to appreciate that this is not about 'music' in any normal sense,"" Amnesty's Sara MacNeicetold the BBC,external, ""but more like an aural assault on a person designed to intimidate, disorientate and eventually break down a prisoner. ""Whether it's the use of loud music, extremes of heat or light, painful 'stress' positions or simulations of drowning, these techniques are cruel and inhuman and strictly forbidden under international law.""

"This video can not be played ""I was asked if I planned to have a baby in the next six months"" Ever had a job interview that seemed to have nothing to do with your ability to do the job? It appears that plenty of people can answer ""yes"" to that question. Katherine Irvine was 37 when she went for a job as a recruitment consultant in Cornwall. She was shocked to find her interviewer was concerned that she was too old and wouldn't have the energy to do the role. ""It was a group interview and the interviewer commented that myself and one of the others were 'older'. There was a concern about us being able to work long hours."" She was then asked: ""What do you think? Do you think you're too old?"" Katherine Irvine was quizzed about whether she was too old at 37 to be a recruitment consultant Katherine was surprised at such open discrimination and informed the company's HR department who said they were ""shocked"". Katherine is far from alone when it comes to such unexpected interview experiences. When we asked on theBBC News LinkedIn page,external, more than 1,500 of you contacted us with a whole range of questions deemed ""inappropriate"" and ""outrageous"" for a variety of reasons. Mature student Kevin Helton told us: ""The interviewer asked, 'You used to be in the Army, how many people have you killed?' ""My answer was, 'Depending on the outcome of this interview, the number might change.'"" Others have faced a grilling about their personal lives, particularly women of child-bearing age. Francine is a high-flying solicitor now but when she first entered the job market and applied for a medical secretary role, she was asked if she was going to get pregnant and leave. ""I was 24 years old then and it was one of my first interviews. I turned down the job when they offered it to me."" Even just a year ago an interviewer asked her, ""Are you Jewish?"" ""In retrospect, I should have said that was none of your business,"" she says. But first you have to get through the job interview Marc Callow was shocked to be asked in an interview for a recruitment management position if he was gay. ""I was that gobsmacked that I just replied 'yes'. I got the job but it was a portent to what the company was like."" These kinds of questions really have no place in a job interview, because there are laws against discrimination, as Peter Reilly, principal associate at the Institute for Employment Studies (IES), explains. ""In a legal sense, you have to be careful,"" he says. ""You have to ask, is that relevant to the task? And if it's not, you shouldn't be asking it."" That goes for racial issues too. One person told the BBC: ""The interviewer said he was surprised I was white because he thought my name sounded black."" Is English your first language? Are you married? Do you have children? How old are you? How many days were you off sick in your last job? Do you have any criminal convictions? What religion are you? What are your sexual preferences? Are you a trade union member? Source: Reed.co.uk Jo Foat knew the job interview wasn't going so well when the interviewer brought out a large straw hat. ""Put this hat over your face and tell me why I should give you a job,"" he said. ""Why do you want me to do that?"" she said. He replied: ""In my experience, pretty girls like you rely too much on their looks."" Jo Foat decided not to accept the job after the ordeal of the interview Even though this happened several years ago, the memory still hurts. ""I didn't put it on, he held it in front of my face,"" she says. ""As soon as I came out of the room, I just burst into tears. I felt violated. ""Now I think it says more about him that he didn't trust himself to make a business decision when looking at my face."" In the end, she was actually offered the job, as a barperson in a private health club. She turned it down and went on to build a successful career in public relations, and is now broadening her social media management skills with Digital Mums. However, as Mr Reilly from the IES explains, there may be some cases when what appears to be an inappropriate question is actually intended to help, not hinder the candidate. When a big firm recruits people, ""the line manager is thinking, who can we get to fill the job, will they stay and are they going to be competent?"" Inappropriate questions can leave you uncomfortable after an interview But at the same time, on a corporate level, the company wants to ensure that its gender balance and ethnic minority representation, for example, are up to scratch. In certain circumstances, then, a question ""might be seen to be wholly inappropriate"". But from the point of view of a company wanting to ""celebrate the fact that we have a very diverse workforce"", it might take on a different meaning. ""There are two types of outrageous interview questions,"" says James Reed, chairman of the Reed group of companies specialising in recruitment and human resource consulting. ""There are the ones that are there to provoke you, and there's nothing illegal about provoking someone, but they can be annoying."" If you've ever been asked what kind of animal or biscuit you see yourself as, then you've been on the receiving end of those. ""The other type is illegal or improper questions,"" says Mr Reed. ""If you feel a question is improper, then it's up to you to bat that back."" Another issue that can cause difficulties in job interviews is the proverbial ""bottom line"" - the actual going rate for the job. Do you know how much that job you're going for actually pays? There was a time when job ads would, as a matter of course, contain details of the salary that the company was willing to offer. But nowadays, as one PR executive found out when he was approached by a well-known tech firm, it can actually be quite hard to pin down an interviewer on that kind of detail. ""The second question was: what's your current salary? I asked, what's the range for the role? and the response I got was, 'We don't reveal salary ranges, it's not our policy, so you go first.' I was astonished,"" he says. ""I just thought, that, for me, is completely unprofessional, and I said, 'I don't think that's a very productive way to go forward.'"" As it turns out, that executive decided he didn't like the firm enough to want the job anyway. But from the point of view of workplace experts, he did the right thing in standing up for himself. As the IES's Mr Reilly says, if you're asked a question that seems inappropriate, you don't just have to accept it. ""The more savvy employee might want to follow that up and ask, 'Why are you asking that kind of question,'"" he says. ""Good employers stress that it's right to challenge. You want people to speak their mind. Both interviewees and interviewers should do their homework beforehand ""If you're reluctant to challenge, then maybe it's not the kind of organisation you might want to work in. But it depends on who has the labour market power. ""If you're desperate for a job, then you might be prepared to answer questions that you don't think are appropriate."" James Reed says that job interviewees owe it to themselves to do their homework beforehand, but that applies to interviewers as well. ""A lot of people are not professional interviewers and it's essential for the company to make the right choices,"" he says. ""What worries me most is rejecting someone who goes off and does a brilliant job somewhere else. That's really galling. So being well prepared for interviewing is really important.""

"Daniel Flaherty is working on getting back to full fitness Eighteen months ago amateur boxer Daniel Flaherty was embarking on the fight of his life - but it wasn't in the ring. After collapsing in a changing room following a title fight in Motherwell, he was being treated in hospital for a serious brain injury. Daniel would go on to have a series of life-saving operations, including one to have a large chunk of his skull removed, and another to replace it with a metal plate. His recovery has been long and arduous but the 25-year-old and his family, who live in Stirling, are confident that he is now in the final stages. He won't be returning to boxing, but he is back at work a couple of days a week, he's a regular at his local gym and he's looking forward to a holiday in Magaluf. His determination has won him the admiration of friends and family. ""What he has done is incredible,"" says John Flaherty, Daniel's father. Daniel trained with Bannockburn Boxing Club ""He's pushed himself, it's came from him, it's came from inside him, the desire to get back to as much of a normal life as possible, and not just sit about,"" he added. ""He's optimistic and hopeful for the future. There's enormous pride from his mum and me and the rest of his family and friends."" Daniel's injury means he has no memory of the fight - which he lost on a computer-selected split decision - or of the bouts leading up to it. ""I can't mind any of it,"" he said. ""I can't remember any of the fights. I woke up in hospital two weeks later. I've been recovering for the last year and a half. ""At the start I was just trying to recover, now I am trying to get my fitness back and lead a normal life."" Daniel first took up boxing several years ago, before drifting away from the sport. When he got back into training in 2015, he was determined to ""give it everything"", he said. ""This was my first competition coming back. I stayed off the drink, I was training, eating properly, and getting the weight down and then that happened."" Daniel has had a metal plate fitted after getting part of his skull removed. Medics discovered Daniel suffered a bleed to his brain when he collapsed following the Scottish Novice Champion fight in October 2015. The severity of the situation dawned on John as plans were made to transfer his son to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow. ""From that point on, it kicked in for me - this was a real life-or-death fight,"" he said. ""For want of a better word, I went into battle mode... I was determined that he was going to make it. ""We came through the first operation, we came through the second operation... we never flinched. ""It probably did make us braver people but it was a life or death situation. If we weren't doing it, nobody else was going to do it."" The recovery process has been a long, and at times, lonely experience, said John. ""It's hard for people sometimes to deal with him,"" he added. ""For a while I turned into his best friend. ""I felt I had to go everywhere with him to keep an eye on him. I couldn't expect anyone else to watch him the way a father would watch his son. I had to be with him."" But the experience has brought the pair closer, with Daniel insisting: ""He is my best friend anyway."" Daniel has no memory of the two weeks before he was injured Daniel admits that at times he has been frustrated by the limitations placed on him by the recovery process. He overcame initial problems with his sight and slurred speech, but he continues to be affected by tiredness and memory issues. While his peers were building their careers and socialising with friends, for some time he was ""stuck in the house"" and only able to take short walks with his parents. However, he is in no doubt that their support has been invaluable. ""They have been by my side through it all from day one,"" he said. ""Them and my girlfriend, they have been strong for me. It's been a massive help."" He is philosophical about his injury and he bears no grudge towards the sport of boxing. And he's keen that other young men thinking of stepping into the ring know the risks. ""If I knew that that kind of thing could happen, then I probably wouldn't have taken it up,"" he said. ""Everyone needs to know that there's a chance that bleeds to the brain do happen. They need to know the full risks of boxing before they take it up or step in the ring.""

"When it comes to the UK election, Americans have hardly been grabbing the popcorn. Box office it is not. And up against the summer blockbuster of the Trump presidency it looks more like a village hall production - the vicar's daughter playing the lead. Modern-day movie-goers like franchises, with characters and plotlines that are instantly recognisable; with over-arching themes that comport with a broader narrative. The French presidential election fitted that bill, with Marine Le Pen cast as the female Trump, the face of populist fury. But May versus Corbyn - it feels like an indie production with a very limited cinema release, a few movie theatres perhaps in Washington, New York and Boston. Brexit worked on the franchise front. The prequel to Trump's unexpected victory last November, it truly was an epic. But the UK general election doesn't even feature Nigel Farage, one of the few British politicians American viewers are familiar with. Theresa May at a campaign event in Wales It's not even accurate to call it a forgettable election. Most Americans, I feel confident in saying, aren't aware it's even taking place. Articles have appeared in the quality press. But they've felt perfunctory, dull but worthy yarns to mark something editors feel is vaguely important but not ones that demand front page attention. Where's the drama? Where are the unexpected twists? To stretch the movie metaphor to breaking point, where is Helen Mirren or Hugh Grant? More UK Election Parties and their manifestos Poll tracker The places where Britons can't vote for a female candidate Britain does still command attention here. Last week, obviously, the awfulness of Manchester was the headline story - part of a larger picture. But the other stories to cut through here in recent months have mostly involved the royal family. Prince Philip's retirement from public duties. The young royals' admirable decision to talk openly about their mental health. A small digression here. America's longstanding fixation with the royal family is not as historically anomalous as it seems. The American Revolution wasn't a rejection of the British monarchy, it was a rejection of the British parliament. Jeremy Corbyn arrives for a campaign speech Many of the American revolutionaries, foremost amongst them the voguish Alexander Hamilton, were arch-monarchists. Their gripe with King George was that he exercised too little power rather than too much: they wanted him to use his royal prerogative to overrule parliament over its much-hated tax regime. America's royal obsession sometimes has the feel of a cargo cult on a small Polynesian island, but it's faithful to the thinking of some of the country's leading founding fathers. History. That's what continues to fascinate Americans about Britain, not its modern-day politics. That's evidenced by the enormous popularity of the Netflix drama, The Crown. America in a time of Trump Will intelligence leaks sink US-UK relationship? The heritage theme park view of the UK still persists here, and maybe Brexit reinforces it, because of its nostalgic overtones. It's the period dramas that always do well here rather than gritty social realism. Masterpiece Theatre rather than Mike Leigh. I'm always intrigued, for example, by the reaction of American politicians to Boris Johnson. Senior Republicans and senior administration officials absolutely love him. An American fan at the royal wedding But you get the impression this is partly because he seems to have stepped straight from central casting. The English eccentric. The likeable buffoon. The diplomatic vaudeville act. Doubtless they admire his intelligence - one high-ranking Trump official I spoke with was positively giddy - but it's his entertainment value they seem to savour most. Entertainment. That's become a big part of American electoral politics, with Donald Trump not just blurring the lines between politics and celebrity culture but turning them into the self-same thing. His campaign became a reality show, with all the exaggerations and absurdities that we've come to associate with the genre. That, in ratings terms, is the problem with the British election. To the few American eyes that have bothered to peer over the Atlantic, it's just boring old reality.

"It was no doubt planned many months ago, but the timing of Narendra Modi's short tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte with Angela Merkel in Berlin on Tuesday will be interpreted as deeply symbolic in Germany and beyond. Could there be something of a pivot to Asia going on in Europe's economic powerhouse? The Indian prime minister arrived in Europe after what has already been something of a whirlwind few days for Germany's chancellor. First there was a tense Nato summit in Brussels, followed by, to use Frau Merkel's understated phrasing, a ""very difficult"" G7 summit in Italy, where differences over climate change were particularly apparent. Then on Sunday, in a Bavarian beer tent, Mrs Merkel made theremarkable pronouncementthat Germany could no longer rely on its long-standing partners - for which read: Brexit-Britain and Donald Trump's America. It's telling, though, that Mrs Merkel's remarks were covered with more fanfare abroad than they were in the Germany's domestic press, where they were largely recognised as a deft piece of electioneering. She wants to make clear she's as prepared as anyone else to stand up to Trump, who reiterated past criticisms on Tuesday with his tweet: ""We have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany, plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO & military. Very bad for U.S. This will change"". But while things may have come to a head this week, Germany's business community had already been slowly coming to the conclusion that it may - regrettably - be time to seek new friends. How Merkel is 'taking back control' - German style German leaders step up Trump attacks Berlin's old partners are still of supreme importance, of course. Germany exports more to the US and UK than it does to India, China, Korea and Japan combined. And despite the warm handshakes, photo-ops and memorandums of understanding announced this week, the EU is still some distance from signing a free trade agreement with Narendra Modi's government. But a quick glance at the diary of Germany's economics minister, Brigitte Zypries, or the schedules of some of the country's largest business lobbies tell a different tale: one in which Asian economies are mentioned frequently and enthusiastically, while the US and UK are often referred to in muted, disappointed terms. You can't move for ""Sino-German"" business conferences in Berlin and Brussels these days, and large, enthusiastic Chinese delegations are a common sight at many of Germany's famous trade fairs. The Chinese premier's visit later this week, comes after years of concerted effort to build ties between Germany, the EU and Xi Jinping's administration. Yet Germany's eager embrace of rapidly-developing economies has another, less discussed, motive. The country needs new, young, collaborators to help it move forward. The unwelcome truth is that Germany's rather traditional businesses are lagging behind in areas such as digital innovation, and are slow to adapt to the fluid working practices of a globalised world. And when it comes to public investment, Germany is playing catch-up. Its economy is booming, but much of its infrastructure is crumbling. Its schools are underfunded and it's failing to train enough high-skilled workers - there are hundreds of thousands of professional vacancies at German companies. Its digital systems are ailing, and in some cases non-existent (particularly in the Mittelstand - medium-sized, often family-owned enterprises). The so-called ""clean energy transition"" has failed to bring down emissions - the level of greenhouse gasses has actually increased, and Germany still relies heavily on lignite, among the dirtiest of coals. A target to bring one million electric cars to the streets of Germany will almost certainly be missed. The ""Made in Germany"" brand continues to be damaged by the never-ending ""dieselgate"" saga, over Volkswagen's manipulation of car emissions tests. Unemployment is low, but people in work are paying higher taxes; since 2004, the total number of tax payers paying a rate of 42% has doubled. These problems are compounded by the country's deep-seated antipathy to debt, at least under the current coalition, which has prioritised balancing the budget over increasing public investment to help with the future-proofing of the German economy. As Mrs Merkel seeks to be re-elected for a record fourth term, the above issues will serve as ammunition for her opponents, particularly the SPD's Martin Schulz, who will be asking why the benefits of Germany's incessant growth are not as widespread as they could be. And if the Chancellor is forced to lead from the front in the battle against protectionism, who Germany's friends are, new or old, may turn out to be more significant than expected.

"Wenger has won seven FA Cups - more than any other manager The Arsene Wenger era - a story that started at Ewood Park against Blackburn Rovers on 12 October 1996 - will extend further into its third decade after heagreed a two-year dealto stay as Arsenal manager. Wenger has become an increasingly divisive figure among Arsenal fans in recent years but has agreed to remain at the club in the after-glow of an historic seventh FA Cup win at the club afterSaturday's 2-1 win against Chelseaat Wembley. It was a success that added to his three Premier League titles, including two domestic doubles, and six Charity and Community Shields, ensuring he could play a strong hand in Monday's meeting with Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke that finally ended a tortuous, acrimonious period of uncertainty over his future. A section of Arsenal's support have organised protest marches and made their discontent clear as Wenger's side once again failed to halt a barren title sequence stretching back to ""The Invincibles"" season of 2003/04 - with the manager describing some of his treatment as ""a disgrace."" So will the wounds heal in the next phase of the Wenger era? And is this the right decision for Wenger and Arsenal? Analysis: What next for Arsenal and Wenger? 'There will be protests if Wenger stays' Arsenal 'a long way behind' - Lineker Wenger says he will ""never forget""some of the criticism he has endured this season, clearly believing he should have been afforded more respect given his track record. He delivered a very clear message to his detractors, and indeed Arsenal's board, when he said after the FA Cup Final win: ""It is not about popularity. It is about competence."" Wenger's competence has been questioned by some this season but Saturday's win, when Premier League champions Chelsea were overpowered and outplayed, clawed back credibility and provided a platform of success for next season. This video can not be played Lack of respect towards me a disgrace - Wenger Arsenal have not qualified for the Champions League for the first time in 20 years - and many would believe an FA Cup triumph would be the perfect parting point, allowing Wenger to go out on a high and a successor to usher in the new era. Wenger does not think in those terms. He is the eternal optimist who has never felt Arsenal were far away from recreating a title-winning team, even though the evidence against has piled up before him. He is committed as ever, even after 1,175 games as Arsenal manager, 676 wins and a remarkable win percentage of 57.5% - but did Saturday start a new era of success that can emulate his early glories, or will he simply face the same criticism again at the first sign of trouble next season? The Daily Mirror's chief football writer John Cross, author of ""Arsene Wenger: The Inside Story Of Arsenal Under Arsene Wenger"", first covered the club for Islington Gazette and has covered his reign through 20 years as a national reporter. He told BBC Sport: ""I think it has gone a bit stale at times. I'd love to see Arsene Wenger go out on a high and, maybe now on the back of FA Cup glory and history, the time has come for him to go. ""The fans enjoyed their day at Wembley but is that the mood long term, or will they quickly go back to being unhappy? It's a fine line and Wenger should be remembered as nothing but a hero. Staying longer would put that in jeopardy."" Cross adds: ""He has been Arsenal's best ever manager. He's been fantastic, absolutely magnificent and an innovator for English football and Arsenal. But all good things come to an end and I just think, despite the FA Cup win, he's not the force he once was."" Arsene Wenger's first Arsenal game ended with a 2-0 win, both goals scored by Ian Wright Arsenal season ticket holder and shareholder Darren Epstein, one of the most respected fan voices on Twitter with a following of 117,000, also believes there was a case for change. He says: ""In my opinion we have reached a natural time when he should depart and the club should look to new ideas - but given that we have won a trophy, in that sense it has been a successful season to some extent."" Wenger's stubbornness has been his strength so often, but the French revolutionary who changed the face of British football when he arrived in 1996, has seemed reluctant to change himself faced with the new breed of managers arriving in the Premier League, such as Antonio Conte at Chelsea, Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool, Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, old adversary Jose Mourinho at Manchester United and Tottenham's Mauricio Pochettino. He may, though, offer the counter argument that for all the praise and respect lavished on Klopp, Guardiola and Pochettino this season, Wenger has actually won more than any of them. In his mind trophies are still a currency worth dealing in and will refresh his ambitions for the summer now he is staying. And while he picked up 69% of his trophy haul, 11 out of 16, from 1996/97 to 2005/06, his win percentage in that period has rarely dropped, reducing from 57.6% in that first phase to 57.5% in the subsequent period. Ironically, Wenger and Arsenal's win percentage in all competitions this season, 63.6% from 55 matches, is actually higher than the 62.7% from 59 matches in ""The Invincibles"" campaign - an example of the vagaries of statistics. Indeed, this season he won an impressive 23 league games compared to 26 in 2003/04. The sign of the soft underbelly Wenger has failed to cure in recent years, and has made him the target for such criticism, is illustrated by nine defeats this season. In 2004, Arsenal became the first side to go through a league season unbeaten since Preston achieved the feat in 1888-89 Wenger will now overtake Sir Alex Ferguson's record total of 810 games in charge, with his current total standing at 790. And it is a tribute to his longevity that his record of 20 years and seven months at Arsenal puts him 16 years ahead of the next Premier League manager's record at his current club, Eddie Howe's four years and seven months at Bournemouth. Wenger is experienced enough to know that the undercurrent of unhappiness that has swirled around Emirates Stadium will not disappear with news he is staying. He will be aware many fans will not rejoice and a slow start next season could see the ill-feeling return. But Martin Keown, a cornerstone of Wenger's glittering early period, when he won three titles and three FA Cups under the Frenchman, believes he will relish the fight. He told BBC Sport: ""This guy is a fighter. He told me he was fighting every day in the playground at school. I hadn't met anyone else like that and I know I was. He is a scrapper and a survivor - more of a fighter and scrapper than people will ever think,"" There is an element of further risk to his reputation by staying on. It remains to be seen whether it was risk worth taking. This video can not be played Wenger proud of 'outstanding' Arsenal Arsene Wenger insists Arsenal do not need major work on their squad, saying: ""We have to keep 90% of the squad together and bring in one or two more to strengthen the group - not too many but top quality."" The win against Chelsea and a run of seven wins out of Arsenal's last eight Premier League games suggests he is right - but the wider context of failure to reach the Champions League for the first time in two decades and a seventh successive exit at the last 16 stage of that tournament are the more significant statistics. Wenger's argument cut no ice with former England striker Alan Shearer, who told BBC Sport after the FA Cup Final win: ""He said this week that he feels, with one or two signings, this Arsenal team is good enough to win the league - it's not. ""This Arsenal team is good enough to beat anyone on its day, as we saw at Wembley, but it's not good enough to win the league over a 38-game campaign. ""We saw that this season and they will have to strengthen considerably if they are going to change to become title contenders."" Transfer bargains Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit were both signed by Wenger in the summer of 1997 Wenger claimed Arsenal's season fell victim to a ""blip"" in March. It did contain desperate performances in 3-1 losses at Liverpool and West Bromwich Albion but a pattern of failure to challenge for the title for 13 years cannot simply be attributed to a ""blip."" How to cure this ailment must now be Wenger's top priority. He must inject stronger physical and mental resolve into his side, a failing exemplified by the embarrassing 10-2 aggregate loss to Bayern Munich in the Champions League last 16 and the lame 3-0 loss at Crystal Palace in April. Wenger must also rediscover his great alchemist's touch of the early days at Arsenal when he took the best of George Graham's legacy - and indeed Bruce Rioch's given that he bought Dennis Bergkamp - and sprinkled gold dust on The Gunners. He brought in Patrick Vieira, Emmanuel Petit, Thierry Henry, Marc Overmars, Robert Pires and the teenage Nicolas Anelka - bought from Paris St. Germain for Â£500,000 in February 1997 as a 17-year-old and sold to Real Madrid in the summer of 1999 for Â£22.3m - and Robin van Persie. It displayed the touch of a master in the transfer market. As Keown says: ""He bought great players and made them greater."" This video can not be played 'Arsene Who?' - Wenger remembers joining Arsenal Wenger's brilliance has appeared to desert him in recent times, with the list of stellar departures over the last decade such as Ashley Cole, Thierry Henry, Cesc Fabregas, Samir Nasir, Kolo Toure, Emmanuel Adebayor and Van Persie - who left Arsenal to win the title at Manchester United - not offset by a similar quality of arrivals. Wenger was handicapped financially as Emirates Stadium was built but this is a trend which he and Arsenal's hierarchy, who have been able to use Wenger as a convenient shield from criticism, must change. He has still brought in players of world repute such as Mesut Ozil from Real Madrid and Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona, but he must unearth the old habit of marrying that quality to uncovering the hidden gems that were once his trademark. Keown says: ""I think he's got good staff around him. I think the issue is the judgement of players, that's where now maybe there is a flaw coming in. He's judging these players as good enough and they haven't been. ""That can only stop with the manager and therefore he needs to get the right ingredients back into the club."" Contract negotiations with star players Ozil and Sanchez have been another subplot of Arsenal's season John Cross says: ""They must buy better. He must change and evolve in terms of scouting and maybe the backroom staff needs a shake-up. I do think a bit of change can freshen things up even if the manager remains the same."" Keown believes structural change is important, along with that improved transfer strategy, although Wenger has made his distaste and disdain for the appointment of a director of football obvious. ""We need to see a really ruthless summer now,"" says shareholder and fan Darren Epstein, ""with departures being replaced by far better arrivals. ""He needs to be ruthless. He is way too loyal and that has been to the huge detriment of the football club in my opinion. ""Big clubs don't wait that length of time to see if a player will end up being good enough."" Former Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann, a member of ""The Invincibles"", believes Wenger can make the necessary changes, telling BBC Sport: ""Of course there is criticism but on the other hand everybody who knows Arsene is aware he has got the intelligence and creativity to turn it right again. ""He has to make changes but if he can do that he can go on for another one or two years."" This video can not be played Watch Arsenal lift record 13th FA Cup Wenger must solve contract issues for Ozil and Sanchez, who both have a year left on current deals, swiftly to stop the scenery shifting to another debate backstage. He has a good chance of keeping the German because of a lack of serious alternatives but Bayern Munich are among a clutch of clubs linked with the Chilean. Sanchez may be high maintenance and prone to public petulance, but he has almost become priceless to Arsenal. The unrest off the field has been mirrored by discontent aimed at the boardroom, with supporters chanting for owner Kroenke to leave the club during and after the final game of the season against Everton, days after it was revealed he had rejected a Â£1.3bn takeover bid from Alisher Usmanov, who has a 30% stake in the club. Kroenke has always been a staunch Wenger supporter but is seen by many fans as too much of a benign, distant presence. Epstein adds: ""The club position is harder to tell - a non-intervening owner in Stan Kroenke, a chief executive officer in Ivan Gazidis who seems to want to implement change but Arsene is against it, a schism within the fanbase. It's hard to see how that is repaired unless we become truly competitive."" Keown also hints that Arsenal must now adopt a tougher mindset and aim higher to end the years of being marginalised in the chase for the elusive Premier League prize. He told the BBC: ""The mediocrity that has been created by accepting fourth place is good enough has created a problem for this current group. ""When the manager and the club come out and say they are happy with fourth, well I don't know what happened there because they certainly weren't happy with that when I was there."" And this is the pattern Wenger, having re-committed to Arsenal, must quickly change. Wenger has enjoyed both loyal support and fierce criticism from sections of the Arsenal fanbase this season Wenger's stock is currently high - even those who have marched against him and brandished banners such as ""Thanks For The Memories But It's Time To Say Goodbye"", ""Wexit"" and ""Every Good Story Has An Ending"" must give him huge praise for the Wembley victory. The question is how long it will be before the reservoir of goodwill starts to run dry once more should Wenger and his team fail to challenge for title next season. John Cross says decision on Wenger will not be a cause for unanimous celebration. ""I don't think the fans will be impressed"", says Cross ""I think it's time for change. It's been more pessimistic than optimistic for large parts of the season. But no-one should forget the glory and celebrations from the FA Cup final. That should be the abiding memory of the season and of Wenger."" If Wenger is rejuvenated by Saturday's success and his third FA Cup win in four years - a highly impressive record - there is now the chance of a summer to rebuild optimism. ""My, and many other fans', optimism stems from what the club usually does in the summer"" adds Epstein. ""The summer we bought Petr Cech from Chelsea and nobody else has led us to where we are this season in my opinion and did huge harm to the team's ability to compete. ""I would hope they know this summer they need to add quality in two or three players."" And with the debate around his future finally resolved, Arsene Wenger can start to write fresh chapters in his Arsenal story. Wenger agrees new two-year Arsenal deal What next for Arsenal and Wenger?

"What's the biggest issue facing England's schools? In the last few weeks you'll have heard that it's funding, or the kind of school, or what subjects pupils study. You could argue for each of them, but in the end it's what happens in the classroom that matters most. So perhaps we should be asking instead - does the teacher know their subject inside out, and are they experts in passing on their knowledge? England has a teacher shortageand it could be one of the biggest headaches facing a new education secretary. For several years now, not enough people have started teacher training. At the same time a baby boom has been working its way through primary schools and is now hitting secondary schools. By 2024, that means there will be 8% more pupils in primary schools, and 20% more secondary pupils, compared to 2015. Last year, the target number for graduates starting training as a secondary teacher was missed by 18% overall. And there's another problem too: growing numbers of young teachers are leaving within a few years. Maths and science teachers are among the most likely to leave,which is why they are headhunted by secondary schools already. That's despite the Â£25,000 to Â£30,000 you can get as a bursary to train as a teacher in these shortage subjects. More maths and physics lessons than five years ago are being taught by someone who hasn't studied the subject beyond an A-level themselves. Maths and science teachers are among the most likely to leave the profession early So what's behind this? Like the rest of the public sector, teachers have now had years of pay restraint, which has led to pay falling behind other graduate jobs. A mid-point graduate starting salary outside London was estimated in 2015 to be Â£28,000 whereas a teacher starting out now could expect Â£22,244. In other words, a social worker, quantity surveyor or IT analyst for business could expect a slightly better starting salary outside London. Economists say the 1% cap on public sector pay should be looked at again if teacher shortages continue. There's no sign of reassessing the cap in the Conservative plans - but Labour and the Lib Dems say they'd allow pay rises to go above 1% - keeping up with rising living costs. But it's not just about pay. Despite an effort by ministers to look at ways of reducing their workload, it remains an issue. Teachers want more time outside the classroom to do their job properly. Compared to the most successful education systems in the world, they get less time to prepare or to study themselves to become better teachers.

"Pinball champion Robert Gagno says having autism has made him a better player. But it's also true that playing pinball has helped him live with autism. When Robert Gagno plays pinball at his local arcade a crowd usually gathers to watch. The Canadian, who lives near Vancouver in British Columbia, has such control he can make each metal ball last up to an hour. He regularly smashes machine records, typing R E G - Robert Emilio Gagno - in the roll of honour. ""If I'm just playing for fun I can play safe shots over and over again. Along the way I figure out which shots score the most points,"" the 27-year-old says. He bends almost horizontally over the machine, bouncing the ball delicately between the flippers, before sending it high up the playfield. Each hit generates a flurry of electronic noises and flashing lights that reflect off his glasses. Robert, who has autism, says this is what first attracted him to the game. His father, Maurizio, remembers the day it all began. ""I took him out for a hamburger when he was five,"" he says. ""There was a pinball machine in the corner and he was much more interested in that than the food. My wife Kathy and I realised we could actually sit and relax for a bit while Robert played."" Kathy noticed her son was ""different"" early on. He was fascinated by Exit signs, liked to spin in circles and often cried and screamed in parent and toddler groups. Robert struggled to form sentences until he was seven ""The word autism was first mentioned when Robert was three,"" Kathy says. ""It wasn't well known back then. The library books I found blamed bad mothering, which made no sense to me."" Robert took longer than usual to learn to speak and his words would come out in a jumbled order. He became frustrated when he couldn't be understood and remembers feeling like he didn't fit in. ""He was a sweet and funny kid but he needed a lot of supervision. We were always open about his struggles to other kids saying things like, 'Sometimes it may not seem like it but he is really happy to play near you,'"" Kathy says. Listen toRobert Gagno talking about the role pinball plays in hislife on Outlook, on the BBC World Service Pinball provided a sanctuary from an often confusing world. His parents bought him his own machine, called Whirlwind, when he was 10 years old and he dedicated hours each day to improving his skills. They now have a dozen machines in their garage in Burnaby, outside Vancouver. As Robert's playing improved so too did his confidence. He began to play at outdoor venues such as bowling alleys. ""It's helped with things like turn-taking, sportsmanship and making small talk and it's certainly boosted his self-esteem,"" Kathy says. It has also provided opportunities to make friends. ""I like playing with other people in leagues. There are good players in Vancouver and it is fun to try and beat each other's scores, or show new players how to play the game,"" he says. Robert likes to talk about play style at tournaments Robert took up competitive pinball when he was 19. Today he is Canada's top player and ranks among the top 10 in the world. He thinks having autism has boosted his game. ""I find I can focus on one thing for a long time and I have a strong visual memory. So I only have to play a machine once to remember it,"" he says. ""I'm also able to notice a lot of things happening at the same time and quickly calculate where the ball is going to go."" However, the condition also has its disadvantages. Robert struggles with social cues, such as the best time to give a friendly hug. ""I find it hard to understand when to talk and when not to talk or figure out what kinds of greetings to give people,"" he says. Robert also has trouble picking the ""right words"" for a situation. In a documentary about him called Wizard Mode, he is asked what he would like an employer to know about him. ""That I'm affectionate,"" he says. There is a pause. ""I think you mean you're friendly and can get on with people,"" his mother replies. His autism can also have a negative effect on his game. Maurizio maintains 12 pinball machines in the family garage ""I'm more prone to becoming anxious and I can struggle to concentrate if I get upset or worried. When that happens I don't play as well,"" Robert says. He plays pinball for a couple of hours each day in the run-up to a tournament. His father helps him prepare for the inevitable change to his routine, something Robert tends to find quite difficult. ""We talk about things like waiting in line at the airport,"" Maurizio says. ""I also sort out his tournament entries and make sure he eats and gets enough sleep when we're there, because otherwise he would probably forget."" Maurizio acts as a coach. He helps Robert to stay calm and put bad games behind him. Tournaments are held across Europe, Canada and America. However, the most prestigious is the Professional and Amateur Pinball Association (PAPA) World Pinball Championship in Pennsylvania, where the winner is crowned world champion. The winner's name is printed on a banner and hung from the rafters of the PAPA headquarters in Pittsburgh. Robert entered last year and made short work of the early rounds. ""It feels amazing when you're in the zone,"" he says. His mother was keeping an eye on the results back at home. ""I remember thinking, 'Holy Crow, he's made it to the top four,'"" Kathy says. Robert went into the final against the top seeded player Zach Sharpe. Sharpe chose the machine they would play on - Flash Gordon, an old game but a notoriously difficult one. However, Robert chalked up a huge score on his second ball, which proved unbeatable. Moments later he was lifting the trophy, while his father looked on with tears in his eyes. ""I was so excited, happy and proud to win PAPA,"" Robert says. ""I love proving people wrong about me."" Robert continues to play competitive pinball but is now focusing on becoming more independent. He works for two mornings a week doing office work in a bank and attends an evening class on computer programming. He has also talked about his pinball career at public events. While Robert currently lives at home with his parents, he is keen to get his own place. ""I would also like to get a girlfriend and even get married one day,"" he says. His proud parents encourage him to keep challenging himself. ""Robert's a good-looking guy and I've encouraged him to sign up to dating websites,"" Maurizio says. ""I don't want him to feel limited or have any barriers.""

"When it comes to the UK election, Americans have hardly been grabbing the popcorn. Box office it is not. And up against the summer blockbuster of the Trump presidency it looks more like a village hall production - the vicar's daughter playing the lead. Modern-day movie-goers like franchises, with characters and plotlines that are instantly recognisable; with over-arching themes that comport with a broader narrative. The French presidential election fitted that bill, with Marine Le Pen cast as the female Trump, the face of populist fury. But May versus Corbyn - it feels like an indie production with a very limited cinema release, a few movie theatres perhaps in Washington, New York and Boston. Brexit worked on the franchise front. The prequel to Trump's unexpected victory last November, it truly was an epic. But the UK general election doesn't even feature Nigel Farage, one of the few British politicians American viewers are familiar with. Theresa May at a campaign event in Wales It's not even accurate to call it a forgettable election. Most Americans, I feel confident in saying, aren't aware it's even taking place. Articles have appeared in the quality press. But they've felt perfunctory, dull but worthy yarns to mark something editors feel is vaguely important but not ones that demand front page attention. Where's the drama? Where are the unexpected twists? To stretch the movie metaphor to breaking point, where is Helen Mirren or Hugh Grant? More UK Election Parties and their manifestos Poll tracker The places where Britons can't vote for a female candidate Britain does still command attention here. Last week, obviously, the awfulness of Manchester was the headline story - part of a larger picture. But the other stories to cut through here in recent months have mostly involved the royal family. Prince Philip's retirement from public duties. The young royals' admirable decision to talk openly about their mental health. A small digression here. America's longstanding fixation with the royal family is not as historically anomalous as it seems. The American Revolution wasn't a rejection of the British monarchy, it was a rejection of the British parliament. Jeremy Corbyn arrives for a campaign speech Many of the American revolutionaries, foremost amongst them the voguish Alexander Hamilton, were arch-monarchists. Their gripe with King George was that he exercised too little power rather than too much: they wanted him to use his royal prerogative to overrule parliament over its much-hated tax regime. America's royal obsession sometimes has the feel of a cargo cult on a small Polynesian island, but it's faithful to the thinking of some of the country's leading founding fathers. History. That's what continues to fascinate Americans about Britain, not its modern-day politics. That's evidenced by the enormous popularity of the Netflix drama, The Crown. America in a time of Trump Will intelligence leaks sink US-UK relationship? The heritage theme park view of the UK still persists here, and maybe Brexit reinforces it, because of its nostalgic overtones. It's the period dramas that always do well here rather than gritty social realism. Masterpiece Theatre rather than Mike Leigh. I'm always intrigued, for example, by the reaction of American politicians to Boris Johnson. Senior Republicans and senior administration officials absolutely love him. An American fan at the royal wedding But you get the impression this is partly because he seems to have stepped straight from central casting. The English eccentric. The likeable buffoon. The diplomatic vaudeville act. Doubtless they admire his intelligence - one high-ranking Trump official I spoke with was positively giddy - but it's his entertainment value they seem to savour most. Entertainment. That's become a big part of American electoral politics, with Donald Trump not just blurring the lines between politics and celebrity culture but turning them into the self-same thing. His campaign became a reality show, with all the exaggerations and absurdities that we've come to associate with the genre. That, in ratings terms, is the problem with the British election. To the few American eyes that have bothered to peer over the Atlantic, it's just boring old reality.

"The use of internet - or electronic - voting in elections is growing. But there are still plenty of concerns about reliability, safety and privacy. Will electing your government via the tap of a smartphone ever catch on? Next month people in the UK will vote in ageneral election, heading to polling stations at schools, libraries and other public buildings to put a cross on a piece of paper. In the digital era, it all seems quaintly archaic. Bad weather can put people off going to vote, while others forget to register or might be away on holiday and not have arranged a postal vote. Couldn't technology remove some of these barriers to democratic involvement? Estonia certainly thinks so. About 14 countries have used some form of online voting, but Estonia was the first to introduce permanent national internet voting. The small Baltic state began using online voting in 2005, and i-voting has served in eight elections. In the 2005 local elections, only 1.9% of voters cast their ballot online, rising to more than 30% in the most recent parliamentary election. ""I-voting has become massive, and statistically there is no such thing as a typical i-voter,"" says Arne Koitmae, deputy head of Estonia's Electoral Office. ""All voters, irrespective of gender, income, education, nationality and even computer skills, have the likelihood of becoming an i-voter,"" he says. The ability to vote by smartphone would engage young people in politics, say campaigners Online voting is a good way to engage with younger voters, busy workers, and even Estonians living abroad, Mr Koitmae says. ""In 2015, Estonians living in 116 different countries participated in the elections using internet voting."" However, it does not seem to have increased the total number of people voting, he says. Rather, people  have changed their preferred method of voting. Since Estonia's i-voting began, there have been no serious security issues, Mr Koitmae says. The technology and processes used are updated regularly based on technical advances and experiences from each election. A crucial part of Estonia's system is that online voting is linked to the country's state-of-the-art electronic identity cards - carried by every citizen and resident. Digital ID cards allow for the secure authentication of the owner online, and enables a digital signature to be linked to the account. Newer cards include an electronic copy of the owner's fingerprints. Little has changed in the way the UK votes since 1872 Estonian voter Igor Hobotov says the ID-linked i-voting system makes him feel a lot more secure when voting than a paper-based method. In fact, he says he might not vote at all if the online option was not available to him. ""I have e-voted multiple times, in local elections and parliament elections. Mostly I've been at home, but once I even voted on holiday from Cape Town. I prefer to e-vote because it is more convenient and more secure - we have a digital ID card with [strong] encryption, which is really, really hard to hack,"" Mr Hobotov says. ""I can vote without any hassle, just sat at the computer. I would probably never vote if I had to go somewhere to do it."" Facebook's tentacles reach further than you think How Cuba's growing internet is fuelling new businesses How DNA-testing kits are becoming big business 'You can tell by the way I use my walk...' Seeing the light: How India is embracing solar power Australia's state of New South Wales allows voters with impaired vision, other disabilities, those in rural areas, and those not present in the state on election day to vote online or via telephone in state general elections. A few municipalities in Canada allow for online voting in municipal elections, but the government has specifically decided against it for federal elections. Norway tested i-voting in parliamentary elections in 2011 and 2013, but decided to discontinue online voting due to political disagreement and voters' concerns. And France previously allowed citizens living abroad to cast their vote online in legislative elections, but has disallowed this for the upcoming June legislative elections amid cyber-security concerns. Would Estonia-style i-voting work in the UK? Recently, a special report by the Digital Democracy Commission recommended that by 2020, secure online voting should be an option for all voters. Matthew Burton thinks i-voting could trivialise the electoral process UK voter Matthew Burton says he definitely wouldn't switch the paper and pen vote for an online system. ""Voting is an important activity, and something people have died for and continue to die for. It should be more important than pressing a button on a smartphone on your way to work or when you're out with friends,"" he says. Not only could i-voting trivialise the process, he says, there may also be security concerns - not just over voter fraud, but also ballot secrecy. Would some people be scared to vote knowing it might not be 100% secret, he wonders. Stephen Schneider, professor in security for the department of computer science at the University of Surrey, says the success of Estonia's system lies in the fact it was built from the ground up, supported by a solid infrastructure including the digital identification system. ""Their digital ID cards underpin the whole thing,"" Prof Schneider says. ""Without it, it would be like building [a voting system] on sand."" Electronic ballot boxes in polling booths were used for the first time in Mexico in 2009 To make i-voting work in the UK, several changes would be needed, including introducing electronic ID cards. The technical ability for digital identification is certainly already here. One company is even trialling smartphone-based selfies for voter authentication. However, Prof Schneider says the necessary changes pose more of a societal challenge, as many people are uncomfortable with registering personal data, such as with ID cards. Prof Schneider says the main security threat to online voting would be from malware on personal computers, which could potentially change votes cast via the internet. Similarly, the use of internet-enabled voting machines in polling stations is ""not really very secure"", he says. Many older machines, some used in the US, are ""more easy to subvert"". However, security software company Symantec says individual voters are not at any real risk, and it has not seen a single incident of external attackers interfering with voters. Symantec says hackers prefer to target political systems not individual voters Symantec believes large-scale attackers - including state-sponsored hackers - prefer to target political systems more generally, for example, the cyber-attack on the US Democratic Party in 2016. ""State-sponsored attack groups are not interested in affecting individual voters. What they are interested in is affecting the outcome of these election events,"" Dick O'Brien, threat researcher at Symantec says. Politicians and political parties are the ""low-hanging fruit"" for attackers, he says, because of the often chaotic nature of communications within these organisations. And with a number of elections coming up across Europe, he says, it is not the individual voter who must remain vigilant, but politicians and political parties.
