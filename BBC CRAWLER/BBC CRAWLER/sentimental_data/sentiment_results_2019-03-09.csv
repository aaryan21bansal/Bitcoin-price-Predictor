"The body of Laureline Garcia-Bertaux was found in a shallow grave A film-maker whose body was found buried in a shallow grave had been strangled, police have said. Laureline Garcia-Bertaux, 34, was found in her garden in Darell Road in Kew, west London, on Wednesday, after being reported missing on Tuesday. A post-mortem examination gave her cause of death as ""consistent with compression of the neck"", the Metropolitan Police said. A murder investigation is ongoing and there have been no arrests. Ms Garcia-Bertaux, a French national who had been living in the UK for many years, did not turn up for work at public relations firm Golin on Monday, and was reported missing the following day. Murder detectives said they wanted to hear from anyone who might have spoken to her between 2 March and Wednesday. ""This may have been via phone calls, texts messages, WhatsApp or via any other social media platform,"" Det Ch Insp Simon Harding said. ""Laureline was known to local people as she walked her two dogs each day."" Police said toxicology test results were pending A forensic crime scene remains in place at the victim's home. Ms Garcia-Bertaux was last seen on Saturday 2 March at a supermarket in the Manor Circus area of Richmond. The Met had previously said her disappearance was ""out of character"". Originally from Aix-en-Provence, Ms Garcia-Bertaux had worked with Dame Joan Collins on the 2018 short film Gerry, with the actress saying she was ""shocked by the horrifying news"" of her death. Producer and actress friend Hester Ruoff described her as ""an amazing individual"" and said they had been due to start filming on a new movie next month.

"The company specialises in plastic, metal, glass, pearl, and olive-wood buttons, as well as wooden toggles A family-run business is calling for help to get rid of 30 tonnes of buttons. A Brown & Co Buttons, based in Croydon, south London, was forced to shut down because of a slump in sales. Owner Stuart Brown feared ""hundreds of thousands"" of unsold buttons in the warehouse would have to be thrown away. But he has been able to sell off or give away most of the stock since an appeal on Twitter garnered interest from button-lovers across the globe. Mr Brown's great-uncle set up the company more than 100 years ago. But he said in recent years large clients such as M&S and Next stopped manufacturing clothes in the UK, meaning sales have dwindled. The leftover buttons would have fetched up to Â£1.5m if they were sold at full price, the owner says His wife Esther Brown said it has been a ""tough decision"" for them to close down. ""It has not been economically viable for a long time,"" she added. ""We thought, we want to sell as much of it as possible but if we have to we will just skip it if not."" Mr Brown said he would have fetched up to Â£1.5m if he had been able to sell all of the buttons he had stored in the warehouse at full price. However, when their appeal for help to rehome the buttons wasposted on Twitter,externalit was retweeted more than 4,000 times. Several people who saw the Twitter appeal asked for buttons to be shipped to other countries including the US and China. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Tom Ballard (left) and Daniele Nardi last made contact with their team two weeks ago The bodies of two climbers who went missing on a mountain in Pakistan have been found. Briton Tom Ballard and Italian Daniele Nardi last made contact from Nanga Parbat at an altitude of about 20,700ft (6,300m) almost two weeks ago. On Wednesday it was reported the search had been called off, but resumed when ""silhouettes"" were spotted on a passage taken by the climbers. Officials have now confirmed the two ""shapes"" are the missing men. Stefano Pontecorvo, the Italian ambassador to Pakistan, said Spanish climber Alex Txikon found the bodies on the Mummery Spur trail. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Ballard, 30, originally from Belper in Derbyshire, is the son of Alison Hargreaves, who died descending from the summit of K2 in 1995 - the same yearshe became the first woman to conquer Everest unaided,external. Ahead of her death, he had moved to Fort William in Lochaber in the Scottish Highlands with his sister Kate and father Jim. Mr Ballard and Mr Nardi, 42, last made contact with their team at base camp on 24 February as they tried to reach the summit of Nanga Parbat - the world's ninth highest mountain. A number of deaths on the peak, which is notoriously difficult to climb, have earned it the nickname ""Killer Mountain"". Mr Pontecorvo said the bodies were in a place that was difficult to reach but everything possible would be done to try and recover them. Tom Ballard has been described as one of the world's best climbers Confirming the news on his official Facebook page,,externalMr Nardi's team wrote: ""We are devastated by pain; we inform you that Daniele and Tom's searches are completed. ""Part of them will remain forever at Nanga Parbat."" They said Mr Nardi was a ""lover of life and adventures, scrupulous, brave, loyal, attentive to details and always present in moments of need"". The statement added: ""The family remembers Tom as a competent alpinist and brave friend of Daniele. Our thoughts are with him."" 'Silhouettes' spotted in climber search The mum and son who lived 'as tigers' Thousands raised for missing climbers Writing on Facebook, Mr Ballard's girlfriend Stefania Pederiva said her heart was ""completely drowned"". ""There are or will never be words suitable to describe the void you left,"" she added. ""I thank the universe for giving me such a special person, there are only the wonderful memories of the times spent together that are the most beautiful of my life."" Tom Ballard's mother Alison Hargreaves on her descent from the top Everest, which she reached unaided in 1995 Searches for the men began days after they last made contact with their team, but these were delayed because of bad weather andtensions between Pakistan and India. Mr Nardi, from near Rome, had attempted the Nanga Parbat summit in winter several times in the past. In 2015, Mr Ballard became the first person ever to solo climb all six major north faces of the Alps in one winter. He had been living in Italy's Dolomites mountain range with his father for the last few years. The Nanga Parbat peak is known as ""Killer Mountain"" Friend of the family Chris Terrill told the BBC they were a ""mountain family"" and said he accompanied Jim Ballard and his children on a trip to K2 after Ms Hargreaves died. ""It was an extraordinary expedition and it ignited something in Tom,"" he said. ""And no-one was going to stop him from following in his mother's footsteps. ""As tragic as his death is, he died doing what he loved."" One of Britain's most experienced climbers, Alan Hinkes, who knew Mr Ballard's mother, described their deaths as a great loss. ""This is one of the most dangerous, difficult mountains in the world, and in winter, I think if anything goes wrong, it happens pretty quickly,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Protesters tried to push back lines of riot police in Caracas Rival demonstrations are taking place in Venezuela in response to calls by opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ and President NicolÃ¡s Maduro. In the capital Caracas, some supporters of Mr GuaidÃ³ scuffled with police and were driven back with pepper spray. Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself interim president on 23 January and has been at loggerheads with Mr Maduro ever since. Saturday's protests follow widespread power cuts that have affected much of Venezuela since Thursday. Mr GuaidÃ³, who leads the opposition-controlled National Assembly, has been recognised as interim president by more than 50 countries. However, Mr Maduro retains the support of the military and close allies including Russia and China. On Saturday, police were out in force where the opposition march was taking place in Caracas. Some protesters pushed against police in riot gear shouting ""murderers"" and the officers responded by firing pepper spray at them. Addressing the rally later, Mr GuaidÃ³ announced he would embark on a tour of the country and summon all his supporters to attend a mass protest in Caracas ""very soon"". ""We are going to come, all of Venezuela to Caracas, because we need all of them united,"" he said. Using a megaphone to be heard above the chanting crowd, he called on his followers to remain ""united and mobilised... in the streets"". Juan GuaidÃ³ told supporters to keep up pressure on the government President Maduro, meanwhile, thanked the army for staying loyal to him, saying they had defeated an attempted opposition coup. Speaking outside the Miraflores presidential palace, he referred to Mr GuaidÃ³ as ""a clown and a puppet"" of the US. ""They invited the armed forces to carry out a military coup and their reply was clear - they have defeated the coup plotters,"" he said. President Maduro told supporters to celebrate ""anti-imperialism day"" President Maduro has accused Mr GuaidÃ³ of trying to mount a coup against him with the help of ""US imperialists"". Mr Maduro took over the presidency when his late mentor Hugo Chavez died in 2013. In recent years Venezuela has experienced economic collapse, with severe food shortages and inflation reaching at least 800,000% last year. The Maduro government is becoming increasingly isolated as more and more countries blame it for the economic crisis, which has prompted more than three million people to leave Venezuela. The widespread power cuts have reportedly been caused by problems at the Guri hydroelectric plant in Bolivar state - one of the largest such facilities in Latin America. A fresh blackout struck on Saturday, El Nacional newspaper reported, cutting power to many areas where it had previously been restored. In Caracas, traffic lights in some areas were back in action but the city's metro remained closed, reports said. Venezuela depends on its vast hydroelectric infrastructure, rather than its oil reserves, for its domestic electricity supply. But decades of underinvestment have damaged the major dams, and sporadic blackouts are commonplace. This video can not be played Much of the country, including Caracas, was plunged into darkness President Maduro said on Saturday that electrical substations had been attacked with ""the support and assistance of the US"". ""Many saboteurs have infiltrated the state's electrical company,"" he said. ""We have evidence and they will be held accountable. We will also introduce new measures to protect our electrical system from hackers."" Mr GuaidÃ³ says the blackouts are the result of years of under-investment. On Friday, some hospitals saw chaotic scenes as relatives tried to move patients in the dark to other medical facilities with emergency power generators. In pictures: Lights go out on Venezuela Venezuela crisis in nine charts Is there a cult of personality in Venezuela? Venezuela's exodus In Caracas's University Hospital, 25-year-old patient Marielsi Aray died after her respirator stopped working. ""The doctors tried to help her by pumping manually, they did everything they could, but with no electricity, what were they to do?"" said her uncle Jose Lugo. Generators at a Caracas children's hospital failed, with staff reportedly working overnight using their mobile phones for light.

"R. Kelly was released on bail last month but was taken back into custody after failing to pay child support R. Kelly has been released from jail in Chicago after the $161,000 (Â£122,000) he owed in child support was paid. The Cook County sheriff's office said the money was paid on Saturday morning and he was set free shortly afterwards. It is unclear who made the singer's payment. The embattled US R&B artist was last month charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, involving four alleged victims, three of whom were minors. He pleaded not guilty to all the charges and was released on bail after spending three nights in jail. If convicted, he faces three to seven years in prison on each charge.

The singer had been prepared to pay up to $60,000 of what he owed to his former wife, Andrea Kelly, and their three children, but the judge had required the full amount and ordered him detained. The singer's defence attorney had previously said the singer was having financial difficulties and his finances were a ""mess"". R.

"Helen McCourt was killed in 1988 A murder victim's mother said she was ""shocked"" her daughter's killer has been allowed out of prison on temporary release. Ian Simms abducted and murdered Helen McCourt in 1988, but has never revealed the location of her body. Ms McCourt's mother Marie told the BBC she was ""angry"" not to have been informed Simms had been allowed ""in the public domain"". The Ministry of Justice said it did not comment on individual cases. Mrs McCourt hasled a campaignto introduce ""Helen's Law"" to block parole for killers who conceal the whereabouts of their victims' bodies. Simms was photographed waiting for a bus in Birmingham bythe Daily Mail,external. He has never revealed the location of 22-year-old Ms McCourt's remains, maintaining he is innocent despite DNA evidence. Mrs McCourt said: ""I was shocked when I saw his face because I don't know what this man looks like [...] especially because he has been in for 31 years now."" Ian Simms outside court in 1988 She added she was also ""relieved"" as ""that picture of him gives me at least some idea of what this man is like"". ""But I am also angry because I want to know - and I will be getting in touch with probation on Monday - why I wasn't informed that he is in the public domain,"" Mrs McCourt said. Her daughter vanished in February 1988 on her way home from her work as an insurance clerk. 'Helen's law' backed by MPs after vote Murderer 'could move to open prison' Law change bid to find victims' bodies Simms, whose pub was just yards from her home in Billinge, near St Helens, quickly became a suspect and he was convicted after her earring was found in his car boot. He was jailed for life in 1989 and told he would have to serve at least 16 years before he could be considered for parole. MP Conor McGinn joined Marie McCourt as they presented a petition at Downing Street in 2018 Last year, Mrs McCourt was told Simms had been outside his open prison - where he had been moved in 2016 - while accompanied by prison officers. At the time she said a parole board officer had told her a prison governor intended to allow Simms to visit a town centre without supervision. Mrs McCourt's MP Conor McGinn, who represents St Helens North, said he had ""asked for an urgent meeting with the justice secretary"" to discuss the case ""but also to get some clarity"" on the government's response to the Helen Law's campaign. Mrs McCourt said she remained ""hopeful that we will get Helen's Law but I really do think that parliament and ministers have to work a lot quicker"". In October 2016, MPs voted in favour of a new ""Helen's Law"" to deny killers parole if they will not reveal the location of their victims' remains but it has yet to receive the government backing it needs to become law. In February 2017, Justice Minister Phillip Lee said such a move risked creating ""perverse incentives"" for murderers to lie about the burial places, causing further ""unthinkable"" pain for victims' families. Dr Lee added that the government was examining other ways to address the issue. More than 580,000 people have signed a petition in support of the law.

"The doctor delivered the news through a video robot A doctor in California told a patient he was going to die, using a robot with a video-link screen. Ernest Quintana, 78, was at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Fremont when a doctor - appearing on the robot's screen - informed him that he would die within a few days. A family friend wrote on social media that it was ""not the way to show value and compassion to a patient"". The hospital says it ""regrets falling short"" of the family's expectations. Mr Quintana died the next day. Julianne Spangler, a friend of Mr Quintana's daughter, posted a photo of the robot on Facebook and said it ""told [Mr Quintana] he has no lungs left only option is comfort care, remove the mask helping him breathe and put him on a morphine drip until he dies"". She later told BBC News that it was ""an extremely frustrating situation"", and ""an atrocity of how care and technology are colliding"". ""I think the technological advances in medicine have been wonderful, but the line of 'where' and 'when' need to be black and white,"" she added. 'A new bladder made from my cells gave me my life back' How 'ninja polymers' are fighting killer superbugs Parkinson's AI to speed up diagnosis Mr Quintana's granddaughter, Annalisa Wilharm, who was with him at the hospital, also told the BBC that she was ""trying not to cry"". ""I look up and there's this robot at the door,"" she said, adding that the doctor on the screen ""looked like he was in a chair in a room somewhere"". ""The next thing I know he's telling him, 'I got these MRI results back and there's no lungs left, there's nothing to work with'. I'm freaking out inside, I'm trying not to cry - I'm trying not to scream because it's just me and him."" She added: ""He just got the worst news of his life without his wife of 58 years."" When Mr Quintana's wife arrived, she complained to hospital staff about how the news was broken to her husband. Annalisa Wilharm said that Mr Quintana's wife was told by a nurse ""this is our policy, this is how we do things"". Michelle Gaskill-Hames, senior vice-president of Kaiser Permanente Greater Southern Alameda County, said in a statement that its policy was to have a nurse or doctor in the room when remote consultations took place. ""The evening video tele-visit was a follow-up to earlier physician visits,"" she added. ""It did not replace previous conversations with patient and family members and was not used in the delivery of the initial diagnosis."" She added: ""That said, we don't support or encourage the use of technology to replace the personal interactions between our patients and their care teams - we understand how important this is for all concerned, and regret that we fell short of the family's expectations.

Single kitchen knives are the most frequently stolen knives, Asda said, prompting the decision to stop their sale by the end of April. Nick Jones, Asda senior vice-president, said the company had ""a responsibility to support the communities we serve"". ""Whilst we have already taken steps to restrict the sale of knives to ensure that they do not fall into the wrong hands, we felt there was more we could be doing to support those looking at how to bring this issue under control"", he said. The store said it would continue to sell multipacks of knives. It is illegal to sell knives to under 18s, unless they have a folding blade less than 3in (7.6cm) long. In Scotland, 16 to 18-year-olds may buy cutlery and kitchen knives, however. Treat knife crime like terrorism, urges MP 'I don't know how many people I've stabbed' What is the punishment for carrying a knife? Asda was one of several companies to sign a voluntary agreement in 2016 to display and package knives securely aftera man was stabbed with a knife from a Poundland shop. Last year Poundland announced it would stop selling kitchen knives altogether. Following Asda's decision, Austin Cooke, retail director of Poundland, said: ""We know this issue is important to customers and colleagues alike and now urgently ask other retailers to consider where they stand."" This video can not be played Yvonne Lawson: I lost my son to knife crime - here's my advice for parents Responding to the announcement by Asda, the Home Office said: ""We welcome retailers playing their part in preventing young people accessing knives."" Concerns over knife crime rose last week after seven people were killed in London and two elsewhere in England. A relative of Jodie Chesney, a 17-year-old girl stabbed to death in east London, called fortougher penalties for carrying and using knives. And Prime Minister Theresa May faced criticismafter saying there was no direct link between cuts to policing and rising violence.

"Elizabeth Warren is one of 14 people so far vying to be the Democratic candidate in 2020 US Democrat Elizabeth Warren has proposed breaking up tech giants like Amazon, Facebook and Google if elected to the US presidency in 2020. Seeking to stand out in a crowded Democratic field, Ms Warren told a crowd in Queens, New York, that she was ""sick of freeloading billionaires"". Her regulatory plan would reverse some tech mergers and stop companies from competing on their own platforms. This would promote competition and safeguard small businesses, she said. Ms Warren pinpointed the Amazon acquisition of WholeFoods as one she would reverse, along with Facebook's merger with WhatsApp and Instagram, and Google's with Waze. And she said she would halt practices such as Amazon selling on its own Amazon Marketplace platform. She outlined her proposals ina post on the website Medium,external. The companies have not yet commented. Tech giants and the spotlight on their taxes Amazon had planned to build a new headquarters close to where Ms Warren spoke but withdrew plans last month, blaming local leaders. One woman at the rally, who was undecided about who to vote for, said: ""What I like is that she's proposing big ideas."" Analysis by BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher Elizabeth Warren was the first major Democrat to announce a 2020 presidential bid. She's since been joined by five of fellow senators, a current governor, a former governor and an ex-cabinet secretary, among others. Although she came out of the gate first, the pack has quickly caught up. She's tried to stand out from the crowd by proposing a series of big, detailed progressive policies, including a ""wealth tax"" on multimillionaires, universal childcare and - in her latest move - using the government's anti-monopoly power to break up big tech companies. She'll have a chance to make her case for it on Saturday in front of what could be a not-so-welcoming crowd, here at the South by Southwest technology conference in Austin, Texas. Politicians sometimes benefit from taking uncomfortable - and politically risky - stands in front of otherwise sympathetic audiences as a way to show a bit of spine. There is still a very long road ahead for Ms Warren, and her competitors - many of whom will also be on the Austin stage this weekend. The Massachusetts senator is doing her best to be heard above the din - but so is everyone else. A Massachusetts senator, she has a background in law and policy academia and sits on the progressive left of the Democratic Party. She burst on to the national scene following the 2008 economic collapse, championing the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - a government agency that would serve as a Wall Street watchdog and public advocate. In 2010, following congressional passage of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, she helped the Obama administration set it up. Two years later, Ms Warren rode that wave of attention to a seat in the US Senate, and on New Year's Eve she became the first major Democratic candidate to announce that she was planning a presidential bid.

"Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom is ""deeply disappointed"" by the EU proposal The government will not sign up to a Brexit agreement that breaks up the UK, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom has said. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Friday that the UK would be free to leave a proposed single customs territory with the EU - provided Northern Ireland remained within it. The DUP - the party Theresa May relies on for a majority in Parliament - has rejected the proposal. The plan is designed to avoid physical checks on the Irish border. The UK is due to leave on 29 March, although Parliament has yet to agree the terms of withdrawal. The UK and the EU remain at loggerheads over the contentious issue of the Irish backstop - which is designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland by keeping the UK aligned with EU customs rules until the two sides' future relationship is agreed or alternative arrangements are worked out. The Commons Northern Ireland Affairs Committee has suggested there may be a possible technical solution to the border problem ""but only if there is trust and goodwill"". Big Brexit vote: What do I need to know? Brexit: If not 29 March, then when? No deal Brexit - 'grave outcome' for NI On Friday the EU said it was prepared to include a number of existing commitments relating to the application of the backstop in a legally-binding document. In a series of tweets,externalMr Barnier said the UK would not be forced into a customs union against its will through the Northern Ireland backstop. He said it would be able to exit the single customs territory unilaterally if it chose to do so. But, he added, Northern Ireland would remain part of the EU's customs territory, subject to many of its rules and regulations. Mrs Leadsom said she was ""deeply disappointed"" by the proposal. She told the BBC: ""We will not break up the United Kingdom and have a border down the Irish Sea - so, I have to ask myself: what game are [the EU] playing?"" Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has also been dismissive of Mr Barnier's proposal. Mr Barclay tweeted on Friday: ""With a very real deadline looming, now is not the time to rerun old arguments. ""The UK has put forward clear new proposals. We now need to agree a balanced solution that can work for both sides."" The DUP said the proposal disrespected the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK, and was neither ""realistic nor sensible"". The UK government has previously said it will not agree to anything which threatens the constitutional integrity of the UK. But Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald backed Mr Barnier's position and said the Irish government needed to ""hold firm"" regardless of ""pressure that might be applied from London"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Meanwhile,a report published on Saturday by the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee,externalhas suggested a ""world first"" mobile phone identification system could be the way to achieve invisible border controls. The system would use either the mobile phone network or radio frequency identification to check goods or driver's IDs without them leaving the vehicle, in combination with a trusted trader scheme. Border surveillance would utilise automated number plate recognition and CCTV. Lars Karlsson, a former director at the World Customs Organisation, said all the separate elements which made upthe proposal,externalhad been tested ""somewhere in the world, just not in one single border"". The border in Northern Ireland would be ""the first and a leading example in the world of this kind,"" he added. However, the committee urged the UK and EU negotiators to agree on a definition of a hard border by 12 March. ""Mistrust over the backstop protocol has been heightened by lack of clarity on what exactly constitutes a 'hard border',"" said chairman Andrew Murrison. ""My committee is calling for clarification of the term in a legally explicit way to ensure both parties share the same understanding of how the backstop can be avoided."" ""Time is running out to reach common ground,"" the Conservative MP warned. Underthe proposals,,externalcompanies and drivers intending to move goods between the UK and Ireland must be registered to existing EU databases of trusted traders To join the register they must show they meet specific ""risk and compliance"" standards Physical checks of goods would be carried out at a company's premises or by ""mobile inspection units"" (MIUs) The driver's mobile is identified at the border using either the mobile phone network or Radio Frequency Identification. A permit to pass is then sent to the phone A notification is then sent to border control in the import country It could be implemented using ""technical surveillance"" such as CCTV, Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras MIUs from the EU or the UK could then carry out further checks using shared facilities and data MPs are due to vote again on Theresa May's Brexit deal on Tuesday, but so far the UK has not secured any changes to the withdrawal agreement in its negotiations with Brussels. UK and EU negotiating teams will meet again over the weekend but correspondents say there is little sign of a breakthrough. The first Commons vote on the dealwas rejected by 432 votes to 202 in January, the largest defeat for a sitting government in history. Leading Brexiteers are unlikely to change their position on the deal unless Mrs May can secure promises that the backstop will not endure indefinitely. Remainer Dominic Grieve, who supports a referendum to endorse the terms of Brexit, said it was ""hard to see"" how Parliament would agree to the current deal. The Labour leadership is also unlikely to back Mrs May's deal.

"Oscar Saxelby-Lee needs a stem cell transplant after being diagnosed with leukaemia More than 6,000 people are bidding to be stem cell donors to help a boy facing a race against time to beat leukaemia. Oscar Saxelby-Lee, five, needs a transplant within three months of his chemotherapy or his chances of survival will ""severely diminish"". More than 1,000 were swabbed at an event in Worcester on Saturday on top of the 5,000 tested last weekend. ""It's fantastic to see how many people care,"" said organiser Louise White. The latest event to join the NHS blood stem cell register was held at the Guildhall in Worcester, following on from a sign-up session at Pitmaston Primary School where thousands queued in the rain. Among those being swabbed was Worcester MP Robin Walker. Events are being held around Worcester to help find a match for Oscar It has been a Herculean effort by the city - six-thousand people is about 10% of the eligible population in Worcester, because you could only participate if you are older than 16 or younger than 55. A further event at Worcester University later this week will increase numbers further. It has not stopped under-16s participating. There was a small army of Year 10 and 11 pupils from the Blessed Edward Oldcorne school, aged 14 and 15, acting as marshals at today's event or walking the city streets to publicise what was happening and rounding up more volunteers. The campaign to help Oscar has captured the imagination of young people in the city who are really doing their bit. Swabs will be tested by DKMS, the charity that fights blood cancer, in the hope one of the donors will be a match for the boy. Oscar became unwell over Christmas and his mother Olivia Saxelby, 23, and father Jamie Lee, 26, thought he was anaemic. Following a blood test, he was diagnosed withacute lymphoblastic leukaemia,external. This video can not be played Oscar is being treated by doctors in Birmingham A stem cell transplant replaces damaged blood blood cells with healthy ones. Often, a close family member with the same type of tissue can donate the cells but neither of Oscar's parents are a close enough match. Many of those joining the effort are young people, as experts say it is most likely a match will be found amongst those aged between 17 and 30. Allow Twitter content?

"Lionel Simenya was fatally injured in Fords Road The death of a chef who was found lying in an Edinburgh street is being treated as murder. Police said Lionel Simenya had been involved in an altercation anddied of his injuries in Fords Road in the city's Saughton areaon Thursday. Mr Simenya was originally from Burundi but had lived in the UK for some years. Detectives are trying to establish if a stolen Peugeot car found abandoned in the same street is connected to the murder. Man's body found in Edinburgh street Officers were alerted at about 03:50 on Thursday morning after the 36-year-old was found with serious injuries. Det Insp Stuart Alexander from the Major Investigation Team said: ""It is understood that Mr Simenya was within his vehicle in Fords Road and has become involved in an altercation.

A Peugeot car had been stolen on Fords Road on Thursday morning and was found abandoned nearby. Det Insp Alexander added: ""Lionel Simenya moved to the UK a number of years ago. He was a highly thought of, hard working man who kept himself to himself and has met a tragic death. ""I am confident the answer to solving this horrific crime lies in the communities of Edinburgh and no matter how insignificant you think any information is, please contact us and let us assess it. ""This must be playing on the consciences of the individuals responsible and I would urge those people to come forward."" In a statement issued through Police Scotland, Mr Simenya's family said: ""We are profoundly shocked and extremely saddened that our beloved Lionel has been taken from us in such a cruel manner. ""Lionel was a hard-working and dedicated chef, who had won an award for his skills.

"One climber was airlifted to safety A climber is seriously ill after he went missing overnight on a mountain in the Highlands. The 57-year-old was airlifted from Stob Coire nan Lochan, part of the Three Sisters ridges in Glencoe, on Saturday. He and another climber, 47, were found at about mid-day, both with hypothermia, after they were reported overdue from a climb the previous day. Police Scotland said the older man was in a life-threatening condition at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. A climber was airlifted from the mountain suffering from hypothermia The other climber is at Belford Hospital in Fort William and described as stable. The men, from Nottinghamshire, were found following an extensive search involving police, HM Coastguard and mountain rescue teams.

"Richard Leonard told the Scottish Labour conference that his ultimate goal was free bus travel for all Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has told the party's conference that he would seek to deliver ""free bus travel for all"" if they win power. Labour activists are in Dundee for the three-day event, having heard from UK leader Jeremy Corbyn on Friday. Mr Leonard said the deregulation of bus services has been a ""failure"", and that in government Labour would reverse it. He said his long-term goal would be to ""build a free bus network to serve the whole of Scotland"". The MSP also said the idea of anti-Semitism in the Labour movement ""sickens"" him, saying ""it is not who we are"" and pledging to ""root it out"". Corbyn makes plea for Labour unity Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford also addressed the conference on Saturday, while Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell will speak on Sunday. Saturday also saw policy debates on education, local government and equalities - with the latter including a statement from the party executive about anti-Semitism after local party groups had been denied an emergency motion on the topic. Mr Leonard told the conference that his party would table amendments to the Transport Bill currently under consideration at Holyrood to ""put our bus services back in public hands"". He said this would see the network ""run not for profit, not to line the pockets of shareholders, but to give the public a service that we will all benefit from"". And the MSP said the party's ultimate aim was a ""universal public service"", saying: ""The Scottish Labour government that I lead will not only end the failure of deregulation, we will deliver the success of free bus travel for all. ""We will build a proper bus network that connects Scotland's communities. From that collective strength and that commitment to being a truly public service, we will shift the balance from shareholder profit to public investment. ""Labour will build a free bus network to serve the whole of Scotland."" Mr Leonard did not say specifically how the policy would be paid for, but endorsed the idea of an annual ""wealth tax"" to raise more money from the better-off in society. He said wealth in Scotland was accumulating every year even as most people's incomes were shrinking, calling for ""radical redistribution of power and wealth"". Jeremy Corbyn addressed the conference on Friday On Friday, Mr Corbyn issued a plea for party unity after rows about Brexit and anti-Semitism, telling delegates that ""the only thing that can hold us back is if we were to turn our fire on each other rather than on the Tory government"". This was echoed by Mr Leonard, who told the conference that ""splits are damaging"". He added: ""I do not welcome people leaving the Labour Party - it is not a cause for celebration, it is a cause for regret. ""Under my leadership, the Scottish Labour Party will remain a broad church."" This was disputed by local SNP MSP Shona Robison, who said Labour were ""more interested in fighting each other than fighting for the people of Scotland"". She said Labour ""can't match the SNP's ambition it comes to delivering for public services"", saying it was ""no wonder they are trailing a distant third in Scottish politics"".

Although she came out of the gate first, the pack has quickly caught up. She's tried to stand out from the crowd by proposing a series of big, detailed progressive policies, including a ""wealth tax"" on multimillionaires, universal childcare and - in her latest move - using the government's anti-monopoly power to break up big tech companies. She'll have a chance to make her case for it on Saturday in front of what could be a not-so-welcoming crowd, here at the South by Southwest technology conference in Austin, Texas. Politicians sometimes benefit from taking uncomfortable - and politically risky - stands in front of otherwise sympathetic audiences as a way to show a bit of spine. There is still a very long road ahead for Ms Warren, and her competitors - many of whom will also be on the Austin stage this weekend. The Massachusetts senator is doing her best to be heard above the din - but so is everyone else. A Massachusetts senator, she has a background in law and policy academia and sits on the progressive left of the Democratic Party. She burst on to the national scene following the 2008 economic collapse, championing the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - a government agency that would serve as a Wall Street watchdog and public advocate. In 2010, following congressional passage of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, she helped the Obama administration set it up. Two years later, Ms Warren rode that wave of attention to a seat in the US Senate, and on New Year's Eve she became the first major Democratic candidate to announce that she was planning a presidential bid.

"The company specialises in plastic, metal, glass, pearl, and olive-wood buttons, as well as wooden toggles A family-run business is calling for help to get rid of 30 tonnes of buttons. A Brown & Co Buttons, based in Croydon, south London, was forced to shut down because of a slump in sales. Owner Stuart Brown feared ""hundreds of thousands"" of unsold buttons in the warehouse would have to be thrown away. But he has been able to sell off or give away most of the stock since an appeal on Twitter garnered interest from button-lovers across the globe. Mr Brown's great-uncle set up the company more than 100 years ago. But he said in recent years large clients such as M&S and Next stopped manufacturing clothes in the UK, meaning sales have dwindled. The leftover buttons would have fetched up to Â£1.5m if they were sold at full price, the owner says His wife Esther Brown said it has been a ""tough decision"" for them to close down. ""It has not been economically viable for a long time,"" she added. ""We thought, we want to sell as much of it as possible but if we have to we will just skip it if not."" Mr Brown said he would have fetched up to Â£1.5m if he had been able to sell all of the buttons he had stored in the warehouse at full price. However, when their appeal for help to rehome the buttons wasposted on Twitter,externalit was retweeted more than 4,000 times. Several people who saw the Twitter appeal asked for buttons to be shipped to other countries including the US and China. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played ""My throat hit the seat in front of me"" More than 80 passengers have been injured, several seriously, after a ferry hit what appears to have been a whale in the Sea of Japan. The high-speed hydrofoil ship was en route to Sado Island from the port of Niigata on Saturday. Ferry operators said the vessel hit an object, leaving a 15cm (6in) crack in its stern. Public broadcaster NHK quoted a marine expert,externalwho said the scale of the impact suggests the ship struck a whale. In a statement,the ferry operator apologised to its customers,externaland said the ship looked to have collided with ""marine life"". ""My throat hit the seat in front of me,"" one passenger told local media. ""People around me were moaning [in pain]."" There were 121 passengers and four crew members on board at the time. Sado Steam Ship Company, which operates the Ginga ferry, says it managed to reach its destination under its own power about an hour behind schedule. The Coast Guard reportedly said 13 were in a serious condition, although they were conscious. The injured have been taken to hospital. The boat is powered by jets of seawater and can travel at up to 80km/h (49mph). One of the hydrofoil wings on the ship was also damaged in the collision.

"Councils have had to make ""incredibly difficult decisions"" to balance the books in setting their budgets and council tax, a senior leader has said. Residents face tax increases ranging from 3.6% in Rhondda Cynon Taff to almost 10% in Pembrokeshire, although the county charges less than others. Torfaen council leader Anthony Hunt said savings could only go so far to ensure vital services were maintained. The Welsh Government said councils were given ""the best settlement possible"". Core funding from the Welsh Government,externalcovers between two-thirds and three-quarters of each council's budget. No council will see their core funding rise enough to cover inflation - Cardiff council will have the biggest increase of 0.9% while five others will see a 0.3% cut. With statutory services such as schools and social care taking up the lion's share of spending, local authority leaders have had to look to other services to bear the brunt of cuts. Proposed savings overturned in the face of public opposition include threats tolibraries in Powys,free Christmas parking in Gwynedd, andschool crossing patrols in Blaenau Gwent. Councils fund schools, care services, waste collections and some local transport Mr Hunt, who speaks on finance and resources for the Welsh Local Government Association, said: ""Local authorities are having to make incredibly difficult decisions in order to set balanced budgets and council tax for 2019-20. ""Thanks to continuing austerity, councils have been left with a large shortfall for next financial year, as funding is not rising in line with the pressures faced by services like social care."" He said budget planning had also been made more difficult by uncertainty over who would foot the bill for nationally-agreed pay and pension increases for groups such as teachers and firefighters. NB Figures for council element only - excluding charges for police and town or community councils A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We have offered local government the best settlement possible in this ninth year of austerity, reducing the cuts councils had been expecting. ""As a result, the 1% reduction announced at the 2018-19 final budget has turned into a 0.2% increase in general funding for local government. ""This includes Â£3.5m for a settlement floor so no local authority faces a reduction of more than 0.3% in its core funding."" The spokesman said Â£4.2bn core funding was shared out according to an agreed formula, taking into account ""a wealth of information about the demographic, physical, economic and social characteristics of authorities, some of which can change from year to year"". Residents in Pembrokeshire towns such as Tenby face the biggest increase in council tax Despite setting the biggest council tax increase once again, Pembrokeshire still has the lowest bills for for each type of property - Â£1,093 this year for Band D. While Rhondda Cynon Taf and Neath Port Talbot will see the smallest increases, they are among the councils charging the most. Charges for the police and - in areas that have them - town and community councils can add about Â£300 a year to a household's bill. Leaders of two councils - Powys and Vale of Glamorgan - faced rebellions from within the ranks of their own groups and only saw their budgets passed at the second time of asking.

"Persico represented himself in court - and lost The former boss of a major New York crime gang has died, after serving 33 years of a 139-year prison sentence. Carmine Persico's lawyer said he died of complications arising from diabetes. He leaves a wife, two children and 15 grandchildren. The 85-year-old was known as The Snake, a nickname he reportedly hated. He is thought to have continued running his criminal organisation from behind bars, making his one of the longest-running mob leaderships in history. Persico was born in Brooklyn in 1933, the son of a law firm stenographer. Before his teens were over, he had been arrested for murder. A high school dropout, he became the leader of a street gang and was 17 when he was arrested for the fatal beating of another young man in a park fight. The charges were dropped. Extortion and omerta: The mafia where it all began What happened to crime in New York City? He advanced in the Colombo organisation, one of five crime ""families"" in the Italian-American Mafia in New York at the time, and eventually reached leadership in the 1970s, after internecine strife with other gang leaders. It was through a landmark 1986 case, led by Rudy Giuliani, later a mayor of New York and presently President Donald Trump's lawyer, that the crime boss was finally put in jail. Mr Giuliani, who at the time was the US Attorney for Manhattan, also jailed seven others on racketeering charges. Persico represented himself in court but was found guilty of being the leader of the Colombo family and extorting millions of dollars from unions and construction companies. ""He was the most fascinating figure I encountered in the world of organised crime,"" a former federal prosecutor told the New York Times.,external ""Because of his reputation for intelligence and toughness, he was a legend by the age of 17, and later as a mob boss he became a folk hero in certain areas of Brooklyn,"" Edward A McDonald said. Persico is reported to have been involved in more than 20 murders, either carrying out the killings himself or by giving the order. The secret lives of Sicily's Mafia hunters One day in 1961 a police sergeant walked in to a bar to find him and another man strangling someone with a rope. The assault charges were dropped due to lack of testimony - a common theme in attempted prosecutions of Persico. He was also accused of being involved in loan sharking, assault, burglary, attempted rape, hijacking, possession of an unregistered gun and other charges. Persico's lawyer, Benson Weintraub, alleged that Persico was not properly cared for while in prison, which contributed to his death.

"Supermarket chain Asda has pledged to remove all single kitchen knives from sale amid concerns about their use in violent crime. It comes as 41 people have been killed in stabbings in the UK this year. Single kitchen knives are the most frequently stolen knives, Asda said, prompting the decision to stop their sale by the end of April. Nick Jones, Asda senior vice-president, said the company had ""a responsibility to support the communities we serve"". ""Whilst we have already taken steps to restrict the sale of knives to ensure that they do not fall into the wrong hands, we felt there was more we could be doing to support those looking at how to bring this issue under control"", he said. The store said it would continue to sell multipacks of knives. It is illegal to sell knives to under 18s, unless they have a folding blade less than 3in (7.6cm) long. In Scotland, 16 to 18-year-olds may buy cutlery and kitchen knives, however. Treat knife crime like terrorism, urges MP 'I don't know how many people I've stabbed' What is the punishment for carrying a knife? Asda was one of several companies to sign a voluntary agreement in 2016 to display and package knives securely aftera man was stabbed with a knife from a Poundland shop. Last year Poundland announced it would stop selling kitchen knives altogether. Following Asda's decision, Austin Cooke, retail director of Poundland, said: ""We know this issue is important to customers and colleagues alike and now urgently ask other retailers to consider where they stand."" This video can not be played Yvonne Lawson: I lost my son to knife crime - here's my advice for parents Responding to the announcement by Asda, the Home Office said: ""We welcome retailers playing their part in preventing young people accessing knives."" Concerns over knife crime rose last week after seven people were killed in London and two elsewhere in England. A relative of Jodie Chesney, a 17-year-old girl stabbed to death in east London, called fortougher penalties for carrying and using knives. And Prime Minister Theresa May faced criticismafter saying there was no direct link between cuts to policing and rising violence.

"Oscar Saxelby-Lee needs a stem cell transplant after being diagnosed with leukaemia More than 6,000 people are bidding to be stem cell donors to help a boy facing a race against time to beat leukaemia. Oscar Saxelby-Lee, five, needs a transplant within three months of his chemotherapy or his chances of survival will ""severely diminish"". More than 1,000 were swabbed at an event in Worcester on Saturday on top of the 5,000 tested last weekend. ""It's fantastic to see how many people care,"" said organiser Louise White. The latest event to join the NHS blood stem cell register was held at the Guildhall in Worcester, following on from a sign-up session at Pitmaston Primary School where thousands queued in the rain. Among those being swabbed was Worcester MP Robin Walker. Events are being held around Worcester to help find a match for Oscar It has been a Herculean effort by the city - six-thousand people is about 10% of the eligible population in Worcester, because you could only participate if you are older than 16 or younger than 55. A further event at Worcester University later this week will increase numbers further. It has not stopped under-16s participating. There was a small army of Year 10 and 11 pupils from the Blessed Edward Oldcorne school, aged 14 and 15, acting as marshals at today's event or walking the city streets to publicise what was happening and rounding up more volunteers. The campaign to help Oscar has captured the imagination of young people in the city who are really doing their bit. Swabs will be tested by DKMS, the charity that fights blood cancer, in the hope one of the donors will be a match for the boy. Oscar became unwell over Christmas and his mother Olivia Saxelby, 23, and father Jamie Lee, 26, thought he was anaemic. Following a blood test, he was diagnosed withacute lymphoblastic leukaemia,external.

Often, a close family member with the same type of tissue can donate the cells but neither of Oscar's parents are a close enough match.

"Elizabeth Warren is one of 14 people so far vying to be the Democratic candidate in 2020 US Democrat Elizabeth Warren has proposed breaking up tech giants like Amazon, Facebook and Google if elected to the US presidency in 2020. Seeking to stand out in a crowded Democratic field, Ms Warren told a crowd in Queens, New York, that she was ""sick of freeloading billionaires"". Her regulatory plan would reverse some tech mergers and stop companies from competing on their own platforms. This would promote competition and safeguard small businesses, she said. Ms Warren pinpointed the Amazon acquisition of WholeFoods as one she would reverse, along with Facebook's merger with WhatsApp and Instagram, and Google's with Waze. And she said she would halt practices such as Amazon selling on its own Amazon Marketplace platform. She outlined her proposals ina post on the website Medium,external. The companies have not yet commented. Tech giants and the spotlight on their taxes Amazon had planned to build a new headquarters close to where Ms Warren spoke but withdrew plans last month, blaming local leaders.

"The company specialises in plastic, metal, glass, pearl, and olive-wood buttons, as well as wooden toggles A family-run business is calling for help to get rid of 30 tonnes of buttons. A Brown & Co Buttons, based in Croydon, south London, was forced to shut down because of a slump in sales. Owner Stuart Brown feared ""hundreds of thousands"" of unsold buttons in the warehouse would have to be thrown away. But he has been able to sell off or give away most of the stock since an appeal on Twitter garnered interest from button-lovers across the globe. Mr Brown's great-uncle set up the company more than 100 years ago. But he said in recent years large clients such as M&S and Next stopped manufacturing clothes in the UK, meaning sales have dwindled. The leftover buttons would have fetched up to Â£1.5m if they were sold at full price, the owner says His wife Esther Brown said it has been a ""tough decision"" for them to close down. ""It has not been economically viable for a long time,"" she added. ""We thought, we want to sell as much of it as possible but if we have to we will just skip it if not."" Mr Brown said he would have fetched up to Â£1.5m if he had been able to sell all of the buttons he had stored in the warehouse at full price. However, when their appeal for help to rehome the buttons wasposted on Twitter,externalit was retweeted more than 4,000 times. Several people who saw the Twitter appeal asked for buttons to be shipped to other countries including the US and China. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Zac is believed to be the only child in the UK with a rare strain of the disease A four-year-old boy who had pioneering treatment in the United States for a rare strain of leukaemia is now cancer free. In a video onFacebook,external, Zac Oliver told his thousands of followers: ""Guess what everyone, I have no cancer."" Zac and his family, from Shropshire, travelled to Philadelphia after raising Â£500,000 for travel and treatment. His father Mark Garbett said: ""We couldn't have wished for it to go any better."" Zac, from Broseley, was diagnosed with a particularly rare strain of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in May 2018 that affects only one in 200 childhood leukaemia patients worldwide. He was taken to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in November, where doctors said its 17-week CAR T-cell therapy would give Zac a 60% to 80% chance of survival. A high-profile campaign to get to the family to the US received a Â£50,000 boost from Simon Cowell andÂ£100,000 from a mystery donor. Zac's family claimed he was not eligible for treatment in the UK becausehis condition did not meet criteria set by the NHS. This video can not be played A mystery person boosted the family's appeal with a Â£100,000 donation Zac's T-cells were harvested as part ofthe therapy,external, which involves using patients' own immune cells to treat their cancer. Speaking to the BBC, his father said medics genetically modified his immune system and ""trained it to go and hunt and fight cancer"". He said the family had been ""confident"" it would be successful but added: ""We were trying not to think of what would happen if it didn't work."" Zac came back to the UK while the hospital engineered the cells and then returned for the next stage. Ill boy in US after mystery donor's help Mystery donor gives thousands to ill boy This week, the family were given the news at the hospital the treatment had worked and they travelled back home yesterday. ""Everything that they said that they expected to happen - and all the processes they expected us to go through - happened,"" said Mr Garbett. ""There were very minimal side effects, he was very lucky in that respect, and a month after they gave him the re-infusion they broke the news to us that he was in remission and was cancer free."" This video can not be played 'We're not prepared to wait for our son to relapse' Zac will travel back to Philadelphia in spring for a biopsy to check if he is still in remission, with three-monthly trips to follow for a year. Describing the last few months as a ""rollercoaster"", Mr Garbett said Zac had had ""good and bad days"" but that he had been transformed in the last few weeks. ""He's up and about, running around - he's the Zac we used to know, so full of energy again. ""He's cancer free, and we are praying it will stay that way.""

"This video can not be played ""My throat hit the seat in front of me"" More than 80 passengers have been injured, several seriously, after a ferry hit what appears to have been a whale in the Sea of Japan. The high-speed hydrofoil ship was en route to Sado Island from the port of Niigata on Saturday. Ferry operators said the vessel hit an object, leaving a 15cm (6in) crack in its stern. Public broadcaster NHK quoted a marine expert,externalwho said the scale of the impact suggests the ship struck a whale. In a statement,the ferry operator apologised to its customers,externaland said the ship looked to have collided with ""marine life"". ""My throat hit the seat in front of me,"" one passenger told local media. ""People around me were moaning [in pain]."" There were 121 passengers and four crew members on board at the time. Sado Steam Ship Company, which operates the Ginga ferry, says it managed to reach its destination under its own power about an hour behind schedule. The Coast Guard reportedly said 13 were in a serious condition, although they were conscious. The injured have been taken to hospital. The boat is powered by jets of seawater and can travel at up to 80km/h (49mph). One of the hydrofoil wings on the ship was also damaged in the collision.

"This video can not be played Protesters tried to push back lines of riot police in Caracas Rival demonstrations are taking place in Venezuela in response to calls by opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ and President NicolÃ¡s Maduro. In the capital Caracas, some supporters of Mr GuaidÃ³ scuffled with police and were driven back with pepper spray. Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself interim president on 23 January and has been at loggerheads with Mr Maduro ever since. Saturday's protests follow widespread power cuts that have affected much of Venezuela since Thursday. Mr GuaidÃ³, who leads the opposition-controlled National Assembly, has been recognised as interim president by more than 50 countries. However, Mr Maduro retains the support of the military and close allies including Russia and China. On Saturday, police were out in force where the opposition march was taking place in Caracas. Some protesters pushed against police in riot gear shouting ""murderers"" and the officers responded by firing pepper spray at them. Addressing the rally later, Mr GuaidÃ³ announced he would embark on a tour of the country and summon all his supporters to attend a mass protest in Caracas ""very soon"". ""We are going to come, all of Venezuela to Caracas, because we need all of them united,"" he said. Using a megaphone to be heard above the chanting crowd, he called on his followers to remain ""united and mobilised... in the streets"". Juan GuaidÃ³ told supporters to keep up pressure on the government President Maduro, meanwhile, thanked the army for staying loyal to him, saying they had defeated an attempted opposition coup. Speaking outside the Miraflores presidential palace, he referred to Mr GuaidÃ³ as ""a clown and a puppet"" of the US. ""They invited the armed forces to carry out a military coup and their reply was clear - they have defeated the coup plotters,"" he said. President Maduro told supporters to celebrate ""anti-imperialism day"" President Maduro has accused Mr GuaidÃ³ of trying to mount a coup against him with the help of ""US imperialists"". Mr Maduro took over the presidency when his late mentor Hugo Chavez died in 2013. In recent years Venezuela has experienced economic collapse, with severe food shortages and inflation reaching at least 800,000% last year. The Maduro government is becoming increasingly isolated as more and more countries blame it for the economic crisis, which has prompted more than three million people to leave Venezuela. The widespread power cuts have reportedly been caused by problems at the Guri hydroelectric plant in Bolivar state - one of the largest such facilities in Latin America. A fresh blackout struck on Saturday, El Nacional newspaper reported, cutting power to many areas where it had previously been restored. In Caracas, traffic lights in some areas were back in action but the city's metro remained closed, reports said. Venezuela depends on its vast hydroelectric infrastructure, rather than its oil reserves, for its domestic electricity supply. But decades of underinvestment have damaged the major dams, and sporadic blackouts are commonplace. This video can not be played Much of the country, including Caracas, was plunged into darkness President Maduro said on Saturday that electrical substations had been attacked with ""the support and assistance of the US"". ""Many saboteurs have infiltrated the state's electrical company,"" he said. ""We have evidence and they will be held accountable. We will also introduce new measures to protect our electrical system from hackers."" Mr GuaidÃ³ says the blackouts are the result of years of under-investment. On Friday, some hospitals saw chaotic scenes as relatives tried to move patients in the dark to other medical facilities with emergency power generators.

"Richard Leonard told the Scottish Labour conference that his ultimate goal was free bus travel for all Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has told the party's conference that he would seek to deliver ""free bus travel for all"" if they win power. Labour activists are in Dundee for the three-day event, having heard from UK leader Jeremy Corbyn on Friday. Mr Leonard said the deregulation of bus services has been a ""failure"", and that in government Labour would reverse it. He said his long-term goal would be to ""build a free bus network to serve the whole of Scotland"". The MSP also said the idea of anti-Semitism in the Labour movement ""sickens"" him, saying ""it is not who we are"" and pledging to ""root it out"". Corbyn makes plea for Labour unity Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford also addressed the conference on Saturday, while Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell will speak on Sunday. Saturday also saw policy debates on education, local government and equalities - with the latter including a statement from the party executive about anti-Semitism after local party groups had been denied an emergency motion on the topic. Mr Leonard told the conference that his party would table amendments to the Transport Bill currently under consideration at Holyrood to ""put our bus services back in public hands"". He said this would see the network ""run not for profit, not to line the pockets of shareholders, but to give the public a service that we will all benefit from"". And the MSP said the party's ultimate aim was a ""universal public service"", saying: ""The Scottish Labour government that I lead will not only end the failure of deregulation, we will deliver the success of free bus travel for all. ""We will build a proper bus network that connects Scotland's communities. From that collective strength and that commitment to being a truly public service, we will shift the balance from shareholder profit to public investment. ""Labour will build a free bus network to serve the whole of Scotland."" Mr Leonard did not say specifically how the policy would be paid for, but endorsed the idea of an annual ""wealth tax"" to raise more money from the better-off in society. He said wealth in Scotland was accumulating every year even as most people's incomes were shrinking, calling for ""radical redistribution of power and wealth"". Jeremy Corbyn addressed the conference on Friday On Friday, Mr Corbyn issued a plea for party unity after rows about Brexit and anti-Semitism, telling delegates that ""the only thing that can hold us back is if we were to turn our fire on each other rather than on the Tory government"". This was echoed by Mr Leonard, who told the conference that ""splits are damaging"". He added: ""I do not welcome people leaving the Labour Party - it is not a cause for celebration, it is a cause for regret. ""Under my leadership, the Scottish Labour Party will remain a broad church."" This was disputed by local SNP MSP Shona Robison, who said Labour were ""more interested in fighting each other than fighting for the people of Scotland"". She said Labour ""can't match the SNP's ambition it comes to delivering for public services"", saying it was ""no wonder they are trailing a distant third in Scottish politics"".

Mr Maduro took over the presidency when his late mentor Hugo Chavez died in 2013. In recent years Venezuela has experienced economic collapse, with severe food shortages and inflation reaching at least 800,000% last year. The Maduro government is becoming increasingly isolated as more and more countries blame it for the economic crisis, which has prompted more than three million people to leave Venezuela. The widespread power cuts have reportedly been caused by problems at the Guri hydroelectric plant in Bolivar state - one of the largest such facilities in Latin America. A fresh blackout struck on Saturday, El Nacional newspaper reported, cutting power to many areas where it had previously been restored. In Caracas, traffic lights in some areas were back in action but the city's metro remained closed, reports said. Venezuela depends on its vast hydroelectric infrastructure, rather than its oil reserves, for its domestic electricity supply. But decades of underinvestment have damaged the major dams, and sporadic blackouts are commonplace. This video can not be played Much of the country, including Caracas, was plunged into darkness President Maduro said on Saturday that electrical substations had been attacked with ""the support and assistance of the US"". ""Many saboteurs have infiltrated the state's electrical company,"" he said. ""We have evidence and they will be held accountable. We will also introduce new measures to protect our electrical system from hackers."" Mr GuaidÃ³ says the blackouts are the result of years of under-investment. On Friday, some hospitals saw chaotic scenes as relatives tried to move patients in the dark to other medical facilities with emergency power generators.

"This video can not be played Ahmed Ali on his daughter Shamima Begum: ""She has done wrong, whether or not she realised it"" Shamima Begum's father has apologised to the British public for his daughter's decision to join the Islamic State group (IS). Ahmed Ali said Ms Begum, who travelled from London to Syria aged 15, had ""done wrong, whether or not she realised it"". Mr Ali spoke to the BBC in a village in north-eastern Bangladesh before he found outMs Begum's baby son had died. He said the UK should allow his daughter to return home, where she could face prosecution. Ms Begum had her British citizenship revoked by the home secretary after she asked to return. Why countries face a dilemma over IS children Where now for IS bride Shamima Begum? What was life like for the IS couple? Ms Begum - who left the UK in 2015 - was nine months pregnant and living in a Syrian refugee camp whenthe Times newspaper found her,externalin February. She said she did not regret joining IS, but that she felt the ""caliphate"" was at an end. Shortly after the birth of her son, Jarrah, she told the BBC she wished her child to be raised in the UK. But Jarrah died of pneumonia on Thursday, according to a medical certificate. He was less than three weeks old. As Jarrah was born before Ms Begum was deprived of UK citizenship by the Home Office, he was considered British. This video can not be played Shamima Begum told the BBC she never sought to be an IS ""poster girl"" Referring to Ms Begum, Mr Ali told the BBC: ""She has done wrong, I apologise to everyone as her father, to the British people. ""I am sorry for Shamima's doing. I request to the British people, please forgive her."" Mr Ali, 60, pointed out his daughter was a child when she travelled to Syria. ""She was under age at that time, she couldn't understand that much. I suppose someone influenced her to do that,"" he said. ""I admit that she has done wrong, whether or not she realised it."" He urged the British government and public to ""take her back and punish her if she had done any mistake"". How many IS foreign fighters are left? Tales from inside the chaos left by IS Asked whether he knew Ms Begum was being radicalised, he said he had ""no idea"". In recent years he had lived mainly in Bangladesh, he said, visiting London for periods of between two and four weeks. ""I do not stay there more than that. I do not know much about her [lately],"" he said. ""The time I stayed with Shamima, I never felt any such behaviour of going to Syria or joining IS."" By BBC News reporter Ethirajan Anbarasan - who interviewed Ahmed Ali Mr Ali was looking frail, anxious and worried. He was surprised to hear that we had come all the way from London to talk to him. He preferred to speak in his native Bengali language than English and he sounded very worried about his daughter's future. He couldn't explain how she got radicalised. But at the same time he also questioned how British immigration allowed her to travel on someone else's passport. Living far away from the media gaze, Mr Ali seems to be living a quiet life with his second wife in Dawrai, a picturesque village in the district of Sunamganj. His house was surrounded by coconut and mango trees and lush green paddy fields. A single track road, most of it potholed dirt track, leads to the village. Chickens and other birds were chirping all the time. For Mr Ali, it must be a different world compared to his other home in noisy east London. The home secretary has been criticisedfor refusing to allow Ms Begum to return to the UK with her child. Ms Begum's sister, Renu,wrote to him two weeks ago on behalf of the familychallenging the decision to strip her of her citizenship - which she described as ""her only hope at rehabilitation"". Ms Begum blamed inhospitable conditions in Syria for the deaths of two of her previous children. In three months, more than 100 people have died on the way, or soon after, arriving at the camp, with two-thirds of those dying aged under five.

"The Serial podcast and a court hearing in 2016 set Syed on the path of trying to have his conviction overturned Adnan Syed, who was convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee in 1999 and whose story featured in the 2014 podcast Serial, has been told he will not now get a retrial. The Court of Appeals of Maryland, the state's highest court, on Friday overruled an earlier decision. Syed's lawyer, Justin Brown, said the case could now go to federal courts. The case for a retrial centres on an alibi witness who was not called in the original trial. The hit podcast suggested the evidence it had unearthed from Asia McClain could have corroborated Syed's account that he was in the library when his ex-girlfriend was killed. But judges said that her not being there did not prejudice the trial. They did however say that Syed's original legal team was ""deficient"". How true-crime podcasts find clues the police miss The decision was carried with four judges against three. Syed had been granted a new trial in June 2016 but the state appealed against it. First the appeal was rejected but now it has been upheld. Syed's lawyer told the Baltimore Sun newspaper that there were ""at least three other avenues of relief"" and said on Twitter that Syed would keep trying to clear his name. Allow Twitter content?

"The company specialises in plastic, metal, glass, pearl, and olive-wood buttons, as well as wooden toggles A family-run business is calling for help to get rid of 30 tonnes of buttons. A Brown & Co Buttons, based in Croydon, south London, was forced to shut down because of a slump in sales. Owner Stuart Brown feared ""hundreds of thousands"" of unsold buttons in the warehouse would have to be thrown away. But he has been able to sell off or give away most of the stock since an appeal on Twitter garnered interest from button-lovers across the globe. Mr Brown's great-uncle set up the company more than 100 years ago. But he said in recent years large clients such as M&S and Next stopped manufacturing clothes in the UK, meaning sales have dwindled. The leftover buttons would have fetched up to Â£1.5m if they were sold at full price, the owner says His wife Esther Brown said it has been a ""tough decision"" for them to close down. ""It has not been economically viable for a long time,"" she added. ""We thought, we want to sell as much of it as possible but if we have to we will just skip it if not."" Mr Brown said he would have fetched up to Â£1.5m if he had been able to sell all of the buttons he had stored in the warehouse at full price. However, when their appeal for help to rehome the buttons wasposted on Twitter,externalit was retweeted more than 4,000 times. Several people who saw the Twitter appeal asked for buttons to be shipped to other countries including the US and China. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Christine Anderson is among those who invested thousands, attracted by 8% interest rates Thousands of people who invested in a high-risk bond scheme marketed as a ""Fixed Rate ISA"" fear they have lost everything after the company collapsed. London Capital & Finance (LCF), now in administration, took Â£236m following a marketing campaign that is now under investigation for mis-selling. Many were first-time investors - inheritance recipients, small business owners or newly retired. Administrators said investors could get as little as 20% of their money back. Peter Thornley could lose savings he had built up over decades Peter Thornley and his wife retired to Devon after a teaching career. He now fears he may have to return to work if their money is lost. ""It put us under a lot of pressure - socially and emotionally. It makes you feel really foolish,"" he said. ""There is a group of us bondholders; there are about 900 in ours. ""We have all got money that we have been left by parents or a lump we got on retirement, then all of a sudden 35 years of savings has gone in a couple of months."" John Wright, a retired joiner from Northampton, was recovering from heart surgery when he found out LCF was in administration. ""This was money for our grandchildren, we weren't going on fancy holidays or buying flash cars - my wife worked in BHS and saved her whole life, this is hard-earned money, we saved and saved and saved. ""I am devastated, I feel a complete fool. I was completely taken in by the marketing."" LCF promised returns of 8% for people investing for more than three years LCF paid an agent, Brighton-based Surge PLC, 25% commission - which amounted to Â£60m - to run the marketing campaign. A series of web adverts promising 8% returns from secure ISAs were released and in addition a comparison website - run by a company with links to Surge - would compare the 1% and 2% return ISAs from high street banks with the investments at LCF. LCF was authorised by regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) - but the FCA said the authorisation was to provide consumer financial advice, not the sale of bonds or ISAs. The FCA subsequently ordered the advertisements should stop running. In aletter to bondholders,externaladministrator Finbarr O'Connell said once the Â£60m to Surge was paid, returns of up to 44% would be required in order for LCF to make good on its promises. Investors were told the funds - and therefore risk - would be spread across hundreds of companies but, according to Companies House records, LCF loaned money to 12 - four of which have never filed accounts, nine are fewer than three years old, and nine had loans from LCF in 2017. Much of the cash was loaned to companies that then ""sub loaned"" to others. Bondholders have raised concerns about connections between the directors of companies that received money and those who ran LCF. Paul Careless is a director of Surge PLC which ran the marketing campaign promoting LCF Michael Andrew Thomson, known as Andy Thomson, took over as the boss of LCF in 2015 and is also director of horse riding company GT Eventing. Paul Careless is the majority shareholder of both Surge PLC and RPDigitalServices - the company that powered ISA comparison websites. Christine Anderson is one of many investors who fear they have lost thousands of pounds Christine Anderson put thousands of pounds into LCF. She runs her own business, a surf school in Devon. ""They have done very well out of hard-working people - a lot have put some or all of their savings into this company,"" she said. ""The directors and ex-directors are living the life of Riley from what I can see, with their helicopters, their horses and their properties. ""It is very sad that this could have been allowed to happen."" Surge said LCF ""signed off all marketing materials and financial promotions prior to publication"" In December the FCA froze LCF's activities, pulled the adverts and in January found that LCF had ""made communications in relation to its fixed rate ISA or bond which were misleading, not fair and not clear"". The FCA findings,externalincluded that LCF's bonds did not qualify to be held in an ISA account and therefore investors were being misled by being told the interest they earned would be tax free. The FCA said it was""unlikely"" investors would be protected under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme,external(FSCS) but it was ""for the FSCS to determine"". Independent financial adviser Neil Liversidge wrote to the FCA in 2015 warning it about the scheme. Mr Liversidge said: ""The way it was promoted, a great many people could have fallen for this. ""A client brought it to us but when we looked into it there was a lot of interconnection between the people they were lending to and the management of LCF themselves. ""We warned our clients off and the same day we wrote to the regulator raising our concerns about the promotion."" Ms Anderson said: ""We feel let down - we trusted this company because they had been regulated and authorised - we then found that they weren't even allowed to manage ISAs. ""The FCA should have known that before they allowed us to buy these products."" A spokesman for Surge Financial said: ""Surge has a number of clients and its fees for LCF are in line with the industry standard. ""LCF was an FCA regulated business and it signed off all marketing materials and financial promotions prior to publication as required by the Financial Services and Markets Act. ""Surge was a supplier of services used in relation to raising investment for LCF. It did not handle client money and had no involvement in the deployment of funds to borrowing companies."" Mr Thomson has not responded to BBC requests for comment. The FCA said it could not comment further.

"Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom is ""deeply disappointed"" by the EU proposal The government will not sign up to a Brexit agreement that breaks up the UK, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom has said. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Friday that the UK would be free to leave a proposed single customs territory with the EU - provided Northern Ireland remained within it. The DUP - the party Theresa May relies on for a majority in Parliament - has rejected the proposal. The plan is designed to avoid physical checks on the Irish border. The UK is due to leave on 29 March, although Parliament has yet to agree the terms of withdrawal. The UK and the EU remain at loggerheads over the contentious issue of the Irish backstop - which is designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland by keeping the UK aligned with EU customs rules until the two sides' future relationship is agreed or alternative arrangements are worked out. The Commons Northern Ireland Affairs Committee has suggested there may be a possible technical solution to the border problem ""but only if there is trust and goodwill"". Big Brexit vote: What do I need to know? Brexit: If not 29 March, then when? No deal Brexit - 'grave outcome' for NI On Friday the EU said it was prepared to include a number of existing commitments relating to the application of the backstop in a legally-binding document. In a series of tweets,externalMr Barnier said the UK would not be forced into a customs union against its will through the Northern Ireland backstop. He said it would be able to exit the single customs territory unilaterally if it chose to do so. But, he added, Northern Ireland would remain part of the EU's customs territory, subject to many of its rules and regulations. Mrs Leadsom said she was ""deeply disappointed"" by the proposal. She told the BBC: ""We will not break up the United Kingdom and have a border down the Irish Sea - so, I have to ask myself: what game are [the EU] playing?"" Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has also been dismissive of Mr Barnier's proposal. Mr Barclay tweeted on Friday: ""With a very real deadline looming, now is not the time to rerun old arguments. ""The UK has put forward clear new proposals. We now need to agree a balanced solution that can work for both sides."" The DUP said the proposal disrespected the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK, and was neither ""realistic nor sensible"". The UK government has previously said it will not agree to anything which threatens the constitutional integrity of the UK. But Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald backed Mr Barnier's position and said the Irish government needed to ""hold firm"" regardless of ""pressure that might be applied from London"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Meanwhile,a report published on Saturday by the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee,externalhas suggested a ""world first"" mobile phone identification system could be the way to achieve invisible border controls. The system would use either the mobile phone network or radio frequency identification to check goods or driver's IDs without them leaving the vehicle, in combination with a trusted trader scheme. Border surveillance would utilise automated number plate recognition and CCTV. Lars Karlsson, a former director at the World Customs Organisation, said all the separate elements which made upthe proposal,externalhad been tested ""somewhere in the world, just not in one single border"". The border in Northern Ireland would be ""the first and a leading example in the world of this kind,"" he added. However, the committee urged the UK and EU negotiators to agree on a definition of a hard border by 12 March. ""Mistrust over the backstop protocol has been heightened by lack of clarity on what exactly constitutes a 'hard border',"" said chairman Andrew Murrison. ""My committee is calling for clarification of the term in a legally explicit way to ensure both parties share the same understanding of how the backstop can be avoided."" ""Time is running out to reach common ground,"" the Conservative MP warned. Underthe proposals,,externalcompanies and drivers intending to move goods between the UK and Ireland must be registered to existing EU databases of trusted traders To join the register they must show they meet specific ""risk and compliance"" standards Physical checks of goods would be carried out at a company's premises or by ""mobile inspection units"" (MIUs) The driver's mobile is identified at the border using either the mobile phone network or Radio Frequency Identification. A permit to pass is then sent to the phone A notification is then sent to border control in the import country It could be implemented using ""technical surveillance"" such as CCTV, Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras MIUs from the EU or the UK could then carry out further checks using shared facilities and data MPs are due to vote again on Theresa May's Brexit deal on Tuesday, but so far the UK has not secured any changes to the withdrawal agreement in its negotiations with Brussels. UK and EU negotiating teams will meet again over the weekend but correspondents say there is little sign of a breakthrough. The first Commons vote on the dealwas rejected by 432 votes to 202 in January, the largest defeat for a sitting government in history. Leading Brexiteers are unlikely to change their position on the deal unless Mrs May can secure promises that the backstop will not endure indefinitely. Remainer Dominic Grieve, who supports a referendum to endorse the terms of Brexit, said it was ""hard to see"" how Parliament would agree to the current deal. The Labour leadership is also unlikely to back Mrs May's deal.

"Christine Anderson is among those who invested thousands, attracted by 8% interest rates Thousands of people who invested in a high-risk bond scheme marketed as a ""Fixed Rate ISA"" fear they have lost everything after the company collapsed. London Capital & Finance (LCF), now in administration, took Â£236m following a marketing campaign that is now under investigation for mis-selling. Many were first-time investors - inheritance recipients, small business owners or newly retired. Administrators said investors could get as little as 20% of their money back. Peter Thornley could lose savings he had built up over decades Peter Thornley and his wife retired to Devon after a teaching career. He now fears he may have to return to work if their money is lost. ""It put us under a lot of pressure - socially and emotionally. It makes you feel really foolish,"" he said. ""There is a group of us bondholders; there are about 900 in ours. ""We have all got money that we have been left by parents or a lump we got on retirement, then all of a sudden 35 years of savings has gone in a couple of months."" John Wright, a retired joiner from Northampton, was recovering from heart surgery when he found out LCF was in administration. ""This was money for our grandchildren, we weren't going on fancy holidays or buying flash cars - my wife worked in BHS and saved her whole life, this is hard-earned money, we saved and saved and saved. ""I am devastated, I feel a complete fool. I was completely taken in by the marketing."" LCF promised returns of 8% for people investing for more than three years LCF paid an agent, Brighton-based Surge PLC, 25% commission - which amounted to Â£60m - to run the marketing campaign. A series of web adverts promising 8% returns from secure ISAs were released and in addition a comparison website - run by a company with links to Surge - would compare the 1% and 2% return ISAs from high street banks with the investments at LCF. LCF was authorised by regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) - but the FCA said the authorisation was to provide consumer financial advice, not the sale of bonds or ISAs. The FCA subsequently ordered the advertisements should stop running. In aletter to bondholders,externaladministrator Finbarr O'Connell said once the Â£60m to Surge was paid, returns of up to 44% would be required in order for LCF to make good on its promises. Investors were told the funds - and therefore risk - would be spread across hundreds of companies but, according to Companies House records, LCF loaned money to 12 - four of which have never filed accounts, nine are fewer than three years old, and nine had loans from LCF in 2017. Much of the cash was loaned to companies that then ""sub loaned"" to others. Bondholders have raised concerns about connections between the directors of companies that received money and those who ran LCF. Paul Careless is a director of Surge PLC which ran the marketing campaign promoting LCF Michael Andrew Thomson, known as Andy Thomson, took over as the boss of LCF in 2015 and is also director of horse riding company GT Eventing. Paul Careless is the majority shareholder of both Surge PLC and RPDigitalServices - the company that powered ISA comparison websites. Christine Anderson is one of many investors who fear they have lost thousands of pounds Christine Anderson put thousands of pounds into LCF. She runs her own business, a surf school in Devon. ""They have done very well out of hard-working people - a lot have put some or all of their savings into this company,"" she said. ""The directors and ex-directors are living the life of Riley from what I can see, with their helicopters, their horses and their properties. ""It is very sad that this could have been allowed to happen."" Surge said LCF ""signed off all marketing materials and financial promotions prior to publication"" In December the FCA froze LCF's activities, pulled the adverts and in January found that LCF had ""made communications in relation to its fixed rate ISA or bond which were misleading, not fair and not clear"". The FCA findings,externalincluded that LCF's bonds did not qualify to be held in an ISA account and therefore investors were being misled by being told the interest they earned would be tax free. The FCA said it was""unlikely"" investors would be protected under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme,external(FSCS) but it was ""for the FSCS to determine"". Independent financial adviser Neil Liversidge wrote to the FCA in 2015 warning it about the scheme. Mr Liversidge said: ""The way it was promoted, a great many people could have fallen for this. ""A client brought it to us but when we looked into it there was a lot of interconnection between the people they were lending to and the management of LCF themselves. ""We warned our clients off and the same day we wrote to the regulator raising our concerns about the promotion."" Ms Anderson said: ""We feel let down - we trusted this company because they had been regulated and authorised - we then found that they weren't even allowed to manage ISAs. ""The FCA should have known that before they allowed us to buy these products."" A spokesman for Surge Financial said: ""Surge has a number of clients and its fees for LCF are in line with the industry standard. ""LCF was an FCA regulated business and it signed off all marketing materials and financial promotions prior to publication as required by the Financial Services and Markets Act. ""Surge was a supplier of services used in relation to raising investment for LCF. It did not handle client money and had no involvement in the deployment of funds to borrowing companies."" Mr Thomson has not responded to BBC requests for comment. The FCA said it could not comment further.

"Richard Leonard told the Scottish Labour conference that his ultimate goal was free bus travel for all Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has told the party's conference that he would seek to deliver ""free bus travel for all"" if they win power. Labour activists are in Dundee for the three-day event, having heard from UK leader Jeremy Corbyn on Friday. Mr Leonard said the deregulation of bus services has been a ""failure"", and that in government Labour would reverse it. He said his long-term goal would be to ""build a free bus network to serve the whole of Scotland"". The MSP also said the idea of anti-Semitism in the Labour movement ""sickens"" him, saying ""it is not who we are"" and pledging to ""root it out"". Corbyn makes plea for Labour unity Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford also addressed the conference on Saturday, while Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell will speak on Sunday. Saturday also saw policy debates on education, local government and equalities - with the latter including a statement from the party executive about anti-Semitism after local party groups had been denied an emergency motion on the topic. Mr Leonard told the conference that his party would table amendments to the Transport Bill currently under consideration at Holyrood to ""put our bus services back in public hands"". He said this would see the network ""run not for profit, not to line the pockets of shareholders, but to give the public a service that we will all benefit from"". And the MSP said the party's ultimate aim was a ""universal public service"", saying: ""The Scottish Labour government that I lead will not only end the failure of deregulation, we will deliver the success of free bus travel for all. ""We will build a proper bus network that connects Scotland's communities. From that collective strength and that commitment to being a truly public service, we will shift the balance from shareholder profit to public investment. ""Labour will build a free bus network to serve the whole of Scotland."" Mr Leonard did not say specifically how the policy would be paid for, but endorsed the idea of an annual ""wealth tax"" to raise more money from the better-off in society. He said wealth in Scotland was accumulating every year even as most people's incomes were shrinking, calling for ""radical redistribution of power and wealth"". Jeremy Corbyn addressed the conference on Friday On Friday, Mr Corbyn issued a plea for party unity after rows about Brexit and anti-Semitism, telling delegates that ""the only thing that can hold us back is if we were to turn our fire on each other rather than on the Tory government"". This was echoed by Mr Leonard, who told the conference that ""splits are damaging"". He added: ""I do not welcome people leaving the Labour Party - it is not a cause for celebration, it is a cause for regret. ""Under my leadership, the Scottish Labour Party will remain a broad church."" This was disputed by local SNP MSP Shona Robison, who said Labour were ""more interested in fighting each other than fighting for the people of Scotland"". She said Labour ""can't match the SNP's ambition it comes to delivering for public services"", saying it was ""no wonder they are trailing a distant third in Scottish politics"".

"Nearly half of babies born before 37 weeks suffer from growth failure A supplement given to breastfed premature babies after they leave hospital can prevent weight loss at a crucial time in their development, a small study suggests. Doctors in Southampton found eight weeks of extra nutrients led to better growth in babies a year later. It also gave mothers confidence and encouraged them to continue breastfeeding, they report. Larger studies are now needed to confirm the findings. Breast milk alone does not always meet the dietary needs of vulnerable babies born before 37 weeks, with about half failing to grow properly. Dr Luise Marino, clinical academic paediatric dietician at Southampton Children's Hospital, said all babies' weights dip by about 10% soon after birth, through water loss. ""But you don't want preterm babies to do that,"" she said. ""They don't have as much fat, minerals or iron, so they need extra nutrients."" Currently, in the UK, breastfed premature babies are given a supplement packed with proteins and minerals, such as calcium, during their stay on neonatal units. At this stage, the supplements, also known as breast milk fortifier, are mixed with breast milk and given to babies through feeding tubes. However, once premature babies are sent home, when they have reached an acceptable weight, the supplements stop. GPs cannot prescribe them, and so any additional nutrients these babies need are often obtained from formula milk, the researchers from Southampton Children's Hospital said. 'Tiniest baby boy' leaves Tokyo hospital The patch unplugging premature babies Carrying car seats could injure new mums They looked at the effects of giving the supplements to 32 mothers and their babies for eight weeks at home and found improvements in the newborns' weight, head growth and length, at eight weeks and again at 12 months, compared with premature babies who were only breastfed. The average weight of babies in the study was 2.8lb (1.3kg) at birth, and most were born at about 30 weeks of pregnancy. When they went home, the babies weighed 5.5lb on average. The supplement sachets can be added to a small amount of expressed breast milk and given to babies by cup or syringe before each breastfeed. Dr Marino said parents involved in the study said they felt less worried about their baby's growth and found it easy to give the supplements to their babies. She said larger studies were now needed to see if the results could be repeated. The study is published inArchives of Disease in Childhood,external.

"Jodie Chesney was stabbed to death in a park in Harold Hill, east London A man has appeared in court charged with the murder of a 17-year-old girl who was stabbed to death in a park in east London. Jodie Chesney was knifed in the back near a children's playground in Harold Hill, Romford, last Friday. Manuel Petrovic, 20, was remanded in custody after appearing at Barkingside Magistrates' Court. Mr Petrovic, of Highfield Road, Romford, will next appear at the Old Bailey on Monday. He was charged after being arrested in Leicester. Officers said a second murder suspect arrested in London remained in custody. Jodie was the fifth teenager to be stabbed to death in the capital so far this year. Her father Peter led tributes, describing his daughter, who was a keen Scout, as a ""great girl"" and a ""proud geek"". Tributes have been left outside the park where she died, and purple ribbons have been hung across Harold Hill and Romford. Peter Chesney paid an emotional tribute to his daughter Students and teachers at Havering Sixth Form College, where Jodie studied, remembered her by donning her favourite colour on Friday. Former classmates described her as a ""bundle of joy"" and said she was ""so beautiful - inside and out"". Scout leader Anna Skipworth said Jodie had ""blossomed into an amazing young woman"" during her time with the Scouts. ""She was funny, intelligent and a joy to work with,"" she said. Bows and ribbons are on display across Romford in memory of Jodie, whose favourite colour was purple Jodie was pronounced dead after police were called to the park near St Neot's Road at 21:25 GMT on 1 March.

"Thomas Marshall and Baverstock Academy featured on Panorama in 2014 The former head of a school who starred in a BBC documentary has been banned from teaching by a disciplinary panel. Thomas Marshall, 50, ran Baverstock Academy in Birmingham when Panorama covered itswork in keeping disruptive children in mainstream education. The panel found he hired his mother's consultancy firm without declaring it and also did not follow proper recruitment procedures. Mr Marshall did not wish to make any comment on the ruling. It is not known whether he had been teaching elsewhere up until the ruling was made. The schoolclosed in 2017and was placed in special measures in November 2014. The allegations against Mr Marshall dated from between 2012 and 2015. West Midlands Police launched a fraud investigation into the school in 2017, but said three people interviewed would face no further action. Latest news from the West Midlands In his appearance on Panorama in 2014, Mr Marshall said the school had ""one chance"" to help its pupils. ""I'm not saying at all we get it right with everyone. But we're going to try,"" he added. Thomas Marshall was head teacher at the now closed Baverstock Academy The hearing was told Mr Marshall had hired his mother's company, Stone Educational Consultants, without following the proper tendering process, without declaring its connection to school governors and without ensuring there was proper contract or a service level agreement in place. A report of the hearing,externalalso said he had authorised payments to the company which included VAT charges, despite the company not being VAT registered at the time. It also found he hired three employees without following proper recruitment procedures and was involved in the recruitment of one person despite having a family connection, which he had failed to declare. Other allegations against Mr Marshall were found not proven, but, imposing a prohibition order, the panel said ""the repeated failure"" by Mr Marshall ""and his overall lack of insight and remorse"" was a significant factor in its decision. He has 28 days to appeal the order, and can apply to have the teaching ban reviewed after two years.

"This video can not be played Ahmed Ali on his daughter Shamima Begum: ""She has done wrong, whether or not she realised it"" Shamima Begum's father has apologised to the British public for his daughter's decision to join the Islamic State group (IS). Ahmed Ali said Ms Begum, who travelled from London to Syria aged 15, had ""done wrong, whether or not she realised it"". Mr Ali spoke to the BBC in a village in north-eastern Bangladesh before he found outMs Begum's baby son had died. He said the UK should allow his daughter to return home, where she could face prosecution. Ms Begum had her British citizenship revoked by the home secretary after she asked to return. Why countries face a dilemma over IS children Where now for IS bride Shamima Begum? What was life like for the IS couple? Ms Begum - who left the UK in 2015 - was nine months pregnant and living in a Syrian refugee camp whenthe Times newspaper found her,externalin February. She said she did not regret joining IS, but that she felt the ""caliphate"" was at an end. Shortly after the birth of her son, Jarrah, she told the BBC she wished her child to be raised in the UK. But Jarrah died of pneumonia on Thursday, according to a medical certificate. He was less than three weeks old. As Jarrah was born before Ms Begum was deprived of UK citizenship by the Home Office, he was considered British. This video can not be played Shamima Begum told the BBC she never sought to be an IS ""poster girl"" Referring to Ms Begum, Mr Ali told the BBC: ""She has done wrong, I apologise to everyone as her father, to the British people. ""I am sorry for Shamima's doing. I request to the British people, please forgive her."" Mr Ali, 60, pointed out his daughter was a child when she travelled to Syria. ""She was under age at that time, she couldn't understand that much. I suppose someone influenced her to do that,"" he said. ""I admit that she has done wrong, whether or not she realised it."" He urged the British government and public to ""take her back and punish her if she had done any mistake"". How many IS foreign fighters are left? Tales from inside the chaos left by IS Asked whether he knew Ms Begum was being radicalised, he said he had ""no idea"". In recent years he had lived mainly in Bangladesh, he said, visiting London for periods of between two and four weeks. ""I do not stay there more than that. I do not know much about her [lately],"" he said. ""The time I stayed with Shamima, I never felt any such behaviour of going to Syria or joining IS."" By BBC News reporter Ethirajan Anbarasan - who interviewed Ahmed Ali Mr Ali was looking frail, anxious and worried. He was surprised to hear that we had come all the way from London to talk to him. He preferred to speak in his native Bengali language than English and he sounded very worried about his daughter's future. He couldn't explain how she got radicalised. But at the same time he also questioned how British immigration allowed her to travel on someone else's passport. Living far away from the media gaze, Mr Ali seems to be living a quiet life with his second wife in Dawrai, a picturesque village in the district of Sunamganj. His house was surrounded by coconut and mango trees and lush green paddy fields. A single track road, most of it potholed dirt track, leads to the village. Chickens and other birds were chirping all the time. For Mr Ali, it must be a different world compared to his other home in noisy east London. The home secretary has been criticisedfor refusing to allow Ms Begum to return to the UK with her child. Ms Begum's sister, Renu,wrote to him two weeks ago on behalf of the familychallenging the decision to strip her of her citizenship - which she described as ""her only hope at rehabilitation"". Ms Begum blamed inhospitable conditions in Syria for the deaths of two of her previous children. In three months, more than 100 people have died on the way, or soon after, arriving at the camp, with two-thirds of those dying aged under five.

"Members of the public getting a tour of the drained canal at Fort Augustus Members of the public have been able to wander along the bottom of a drained section of the UK's biggest canal. Opened almost 200 years ago, the Caledonian Canal in the Highlands took 12 years to build. The waterway's 60 miles (96.5km) length includes lochs Ness, Oich and Lochy and 22 miles (35km) of canal with 29 locks. A stretch at Fort Augustus has been emptied of water so that lock gates can be replaced, and this section was opened to the public on Friday. A Loch Ness Monster mascot was on hand to greet visitors on Friday The canal has been drained so that lock gates can be replaced Scottish Canals engineer Peter Robinson described the shape and size of the drained canal and its massive lock gates as being like an ""upside down cathedral"". He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""For me as an engineer this is a fantastic day to celebrate engineering, history, heritage and engagement with the public."" Mr Robinson added: ""You can hear the people's astonishment at the scale of what it is."" People were given a rare opportunity to walk along the bottom of the Caledonian Canal Scottish Canals has drained more than four miles (7km) of the canal to provide safe access to the gates at Fort Augustus, at Loch Ness, and also nearby Kytra to replace lock gates. Opened in 1822, with repairs and improvements made in the 1840s, the canal was built to designs made by famous Scottish engineer Thomas Telford. The waterway runs between Inverness and Fort William. Scottish Canals engineer Peter Robinson described the drained canal as being like an upside down cathedral A mark left on canal wall by a stonemason during the waterway's construction 200 years ago Marks left by men involved in the building of the Caledonian Canal 200 years ago have been found during the work. Several stonemasons' marks have been found carved into stone of the walls that line the canal. The marks would normally be hidden underwater.

"One climber was airlifted to safety A climber is seriously ill after he went missing overnight on a mountain in the Highlands. The 57-year-old was airlifted from Stob Coire nan Lochan, part of the Three Sisters ridges in Glencoe, on Saturday. He and another climber, 47, were found at about mid-day, both with hypothermia, after they were reported overdue from a climb the previous day. Police Scotland said the older man was in a life-threatening condition at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. A climber was airlifted from the mountain suffering from hypothermia The other climber is at Belford Hospital in Fort William and described as stable. The men, from Nottinghamshire, were found following an extensive search involving police, HM Coastguard and mountain rescue teams. Brian Bathurst, deputy team leader for Glencoe Mountain Rescue said: ""Both are hypothermic but one more so than the other. ""One casualty who is worse off has been taken to the Belford Hospital in Fort William by helicopter. ""The second casualty is walking wounded and is just being picked up. ""It's been quite a big rescue , it's been a good effort by us and our neighbouring teams."" A number of teams combed the area to find the two men Two coastguard helicopters were involved in the operation Inverness Coastguard helicopter transported Glencoe and Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Teams to the area, while a Prestwick Coastguard helicopter searched the walkers' route. A spokesperson for HM Coastguard added: ""HM Coastguard Stornoway helicopter was sent to the area just before 22:00 to carry out a search.  They were unable to find the walkers but reported that they did see evidence of an avalanche in the area. ""Due to the weather conditions on scene the search was suspended until first light today. ""The search was resumed just after 08:00 this morning with two Coastguard helicopters from Inverness and Prestwick tasked to assist. ""One climber was located at mid-day and the helicopter paramedic winchman assessed them for hypothermia. ""The second climber was located around 12:30."" The men had been climbing at Stob Coire nan Lochan The risk of avalanche in Glencoe on Friday and Saturday was rated ""considerable"" by the Scottish Avalanche Information Service (SAIS), particularly at corrie rims, gully tops and steep slope tops. A SAIS report warned that conditions would ""remain wintry and unsettled"" for a few days.

"Captain Marvel's backstory is about as straightforward as a Heston Blumenthal tasting menu. Even the snippet of it explored in this latest Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) release, which barely scratches the surface of the character's 80-year old history, manages to be more opaque than a billionaire's tax return. That, at least, is the premise of this origin movie, which could just as well have been called Captain Millennial. Our photon-fisted all-action hero is a tech-savy, civic-minded, self-improver with identity issues. Captain Marvel (Brie Larson), or Kree alien Vers as she is called when we first meet her, doesn't know who she is. Constant flashbacks to past events suggest there's more to her than her Kree colleagues are letting on. But it's all a bit of a fog, as are the first 10 minutes of the movie. Vers is being schooled in the art of combat by Kree Starforce commander Yon-Rogg (a yellow-eyed Jude Law), who is trying to help her be the ""best version of herself"", by mansplaining to the wilful wannabe-superhero the classic philosophical trope of not letting her heart rule her head. Jude Law as Cdr Yon-Rogg, gives a guiding hand to Carol Danvers/Vers/Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) She has to get a handle on her emotions and fiery fists, he insists, before Supreme Intelligence (Annette Bening) will allow her to go out on a mission to fight the Kree's arch enemy: the shape-shifting, lizard-eared, identity-snatching Skrulls. She doesn't have to wait long. Annette Bening plays the embodiment of the Kree supercomputer, the Supreme Intelligence, Mar-Vell The directing duo behind the camera, Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, have a film to get on with and hi-fi sci-fi fight sequences to deliver. You can sense them frantically priming their cinematic canvas: arranging players, establishing storylines, and giving MCU's ""first stand-alone, female-franchise title character"" a personality. The film only starts to find its feet when Vers loses hers and crash lands in Los Angeles, circa 1995. Cue a nostalgia fest as the Woman Who Fell to Earth through the roof of a Blockbuster Video store picks herself up (a recurring theme) before picking out a VHS of The Right Stuff - the Tom Wolfe-written Philip Kaufman-directed 1983 film about the pioneering Mercury Seven astronauts. The Right Stuff (1983 film about the original Mercury Seven astronauts) comes in handy for both Captain Marvel and our understanding of her character The shot lasts for only a few seconds but it carries some weight. It is more than an amusing aside about the film rental choice of a visiting alien. It's a significant clue to discovering her past. And a mark of the subtlety brought by both Brie Larson and the directors to a genre not always recognised for understatement... Enter S.H.I.E.L.D agent Nick Fury, a digitally ""de-aged"" Samuel L Jackson, who appears not only impossibly fresh-faced but also without the character's trademark eye patch. Given the time and place in which the action is set, and the film's retro vibe and pop-culture call-backs, there's the tantalising possibility of Fury bumping into Jules Winnfield (the hitman Jackson played in Pulp Fiction) proclaiming ""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men."" And aliens, he should have added. Samuel L Jackson, who returns as a ""gentler"" Nick Fury, said part of the challenge in this film was that he now has two eyes and hair Because Agent Fury is caught between the Krees and the Skrulls who are having it out on Earth - or Planet C-53 as they call it when being polite - he is destined to be collateral damage if he doesn't do something sharpish. The laborious set-up is complete. Vers, or, more accurately Carol Danvers of the United States Air Force, as she soon discovers, buddies up with Fury and the film takes off like its namesake. There are twists and turns and a spot of soul-searching as Danvers realises she has to shed who she thought she was, to become who she is, Captain Marvel. It is a journey that the Oscar-winning Brie Larson tackles with real skill. Playing an insecure, self-doubting, slightly lost superhero is not an easy trick to pull off: vulnerability and invincibility don't generally go hand-in-hand. The fact that Larson convincingly portrays both, simultaneously, is testament to her talent and those with whom she interacts, particularly Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn as Skrull leader Talos, and Lashana Lynch who plays Maria Rambeau: a single mother, a flying ace and Danvers's best friend. Ben Mendelsohn, who plays leading Skrull baddie, Talos, says the Skrulls are ""the heavy metal rock stars of Marvel"" Lashana Lynch (Maria Rambeau) says she's ""part of a shift in the world"" with this first female Marvel superhero film There is one small snag, however. Once the '90s visual jokes, the Top Gun references (among which is a star turn by an orange cat called Goose), and Agent Fury one-liners have run their course, the actual action adventure plot driving the film forward is fatally exposed: it is about as exciting as watching Windows 95 load. Brie Larson carries the film as a warrior with incredible powers, but it is her character's internal journey that stands out The interior life of Carol Danvers, which ranges from self-discovery to a philosophical questioning about the nature of female empowerment, overshadows all else and makes the action sequences appear as afterthoughts. Maybe that is the trajectory of Marvel movies: more introspection, less action. We'll find out soon enough when Avengers returns next month featuring Brie Larson as Captain Marvel. Has she done for the #MeToo movement what Black Panther did for African American cinema? Is Captain Marvel as culturally significant as that first ever Oscar-winning MCU film? No, in short. It is not as good a film. I very much doubt it will follow in Black Panther's award-wining footsteps. But it is not as far behind in terms of reflecting a shifting attitude in Hollywood as some would have you believe. This is an incarnation of a thoughtful superhero who operates on her own terms, or, seeing as we are in the mid-'90s, knows how to assert her girl power.

"Thomas Marshall and Baverstock Academy featured on Panorama in 2014 The former head of a school who starred in a BBC documentary has been banned from teaching by a disciplinary panel. Thomas Marshall, 50, ran Baverstock Academy in Birmingham when Panorama covered itswork in keeping disruptive children in mainstream education. The panel found he hired his mother's consultancy firm without declaring it and also did not follow proper recruitment procedures. Mr Marshall did not wish to make any comment on the ruling. It is not known whether he had been teaching elsewhere up until the ruling was made. The schoolclosed in 2017and was placed in special measures in November 2014. The allegations against Mr Marshall dated from between 2012 and 2015. West Midlands Police launched a fraud investigation into the school in 2017, but said three people interviewed would face no further action. Latest news from the West Midlands In his appearance on Panorama in 2014, Mr Marshall said the school had ""one chance"" to help its pupils. ""I'm not saying at all we get it right with everyone. But we're going to try,"" he added. Thomas Marshall was head teacher at the now closed Baverstock Academy The hearing was told Mr Marshall had hired his mother's company, Stone Educational Consultants, without following the proper tendering process, without declaring its connection to school governors and without ensuring there was proper contract or a service level agreement in place. A report of the hearing,externalalso said he had authorised payments to the company which included VAT charges, despite the company not being VAT registered at the time. It also found he hired three employees without following proper recruitment procedures and was involved in the recruitment of one person despite having a family connection, which he had failed to declare. Other allegations against Mr Marshall were found not proven, but, imposing a prohibition order, the panel said ""the repeated failure"" by Mr Marshall ""and his overall lack of insight and remorse"" was a significant factor in its decision. He has 28 days to appeal the order, and can apply to have the teaching ban reviewed after two years.

"The Serial podcast and a court hearing in 2016 set Syed on the path of trying to have his conviction overturned Adnan Syed, who was convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee in 1999 and whose story featured in the 2014 podcast Serial, has been told he will not now get a retrial. The Court of Appeals of Maryland, the state's highest court, on Friday overruled an earlier decision. Syed's lawyer, Justin Brown, said the case could now go to federal courts. The case for a retrial centres on an alibi witness who was not called in the original trial. The hit podcast suggested the evidence it had unearthed from Asia McClain could have corroborated Syed's account that he was in the library when his ex-girlfriend was killed. But judges said that her not being there did not prejudice the trial. They did however say that Syed's original legal team was ""deficient"". How true-crime podcasts find clues the police miss The decision was carried with four judges against three. Syed had been granted a new trial in June 2016 but the state appealed against it. First the appeal was rejected but now it has been upheld. Syed's lawyer told the Baltimore Sun newspaper that there were ""at least three other avenues of relief"" and said on Twitter that Syed would keep trying to clear his name. Allow Twitter content?

"President Trump said he would be ""very disappointed"" if there was testing by North Korea Satellite images of a facility near Pyongyang suggest that North Korea may be preparing to launch a missile or a satellite. The increase in activity is around a site known as Sanumdong, where North Korea assembled most of its ballistic missiles and rockets. It comes after reports earlier this week that North Korea's main rocket launch site at Sohae had been rebuilt. Work to dismantle Sohae began last year but stopped as US talks stalled. On Friday US President Donald Trump said he would be disappointed if North Korea was to resume weapons testing. ""I would be surprised in a negative way if he did anything that was not per our understanding. But we'll see what happens,"" he said. ""I would be very disappointed if I saw testing."" What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? Analysts believe that it is more likely at this stage that Pyongyang is preparing to launch a satellite rather than test a missile. However the US said earlier this week that this would still be inconsistent with the commitments North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has made to President Trump. Large vehicles have been seen moving around Sanumdong, activity which has in the past indicated that North Korea was at least preparing to move some kind of missile or rocket to a launch area. The satellite images were published by the US public radio network NPR. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The BBC's Seoul correspondent Laura Bicker says that North Korea might be testing the US after talks in Hanoi between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un broke down, hoping that the US will offer a better deal to avoid a launch. Our correspondent adds that experts say the rockets used to launch satellites are usually unsuitable for use as long-range missiles. North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis North Korea's missile and nuclear programme A much anticipated meeting between the two leaders in the Vietnamese capital last week ended without a deal over differences in how much North Korea was willing to limit its nuclear programme before it was granted some sanction relief. The Sohae launch facility at the Tongchang-ri site has been used for satellite launches and engine testing but never for ballistic missile launches. This week's satellite images, coming from several US think tanks and testimony from the South Korean intelligence service, appear to show rapid progress has been made in rebuilding structures on the rocket launch pad. Sohae has been the site of North Korea's controversial satellite launches US National Security Adviser John Bolton has said North Korea could yet face more sanctions if there is no progress on denuclearisation. A historic first meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Kim in 2018 in Singapore produced a vaguely worded agreement on ""denuclearisation"" but little progress.

"Persico represented himself in court - and lost The former boss of a major New York crime gang has died, after serving 33 years of a 139-year prison sentence. Carmine Persico's lawyer said he died of complications arising from diabetes. He leaves a wife, two children and 15 grandchildren. The 85-year-old was known as The Snake, a nickname he reportedly hated. He is thought to have continued running his criminal organisation from behind bars, making his one of the longest-running mob leaderships in history. Persico was born in Brooklyn in 1933, the son of a law firm stenographer. Before his teens were over, he had been arrested for murder. A high school dropout, he became the leader of a street gang and was 17 when he was arrested for the fatal beating of another young man in a park fight. The charges were dropped. Extortion and omerta: The mafia where it all began What happened to crime in New York City? He advanced in the Colombo organisation, one of five crime ""families"" in the Italian-American Mafia in New York at the time, and eventually reached leadership in the 1970s, after internecine strife with other gang leaders. It was through a landmark 1986 case, led by Rudy Giuliani, later a mayor of New York and presently President Donald Trump's lawyer, that the crime boss was finally put in jail. Mr Giuliani, who at the time was the US Attorney for Manhattan, also jailed seven others on racketeering charges. Persico represented himself in court but was found guilty of being the leader of the Colombo family and extorting millions of dollars from unions and construction companies. ""He was the most fascinating figure I encountered in the world of organised crime,"" a former federal prosecutor told the New York Times.,external ""Because of his reputation for intelligence and toughness, he was a legend by the age of 17, and later as a mob boss he became a folk hero in certain areas of Brooklyn,"" Edward A McDonald said. Persico is reported to have been involved in more than 20 murders, either carrying out the killings himself or by giving the order. The secret lives of Sicily's Mafia hunters One day in 1961 a police sergeant walked in to a bar to find him and another man strangling someone with a rope. The assault charges were dropped due to lack of testimony - a common theme in attempted prosecutions of Persico. He was also accused of being involved in loan sharking, assault, burglary, attempted rape, hijacking, possession of an unregistered gun and other charges. Persico's lawyer, Benson Weintraub, alleged that Persico was not properly cared for while in prison, which contributed to his death.

"Margaret Thatcher apparently used alternative medicines and was sent them by romance author Dame Barbara Cartland, newly released files show. Dame Barbara, who wrote more than 800 books and was Princess Diana's step-grandmother, sent the then-prime minister capsules to tackle tiredness. Baroness Thatcher is famously said to have slept for only four hours a night. Dame Barbara also sent supplements to tackle jetlag or travel sickness ahead of a trip to the Far East. The Margaret Thatcher Foundation is gradually overseeing the release of her private files. Also included among them is a briefing from a young David Cameron on the European single market. In this most recent batch of files released by the foundation, letters show that Dame Barbara corresponded with Baroness Thatcher fairly regularly and lunched with her. Dame Barbara,externalis best known for her historical romance fiction and was most prolific in the 1970s and 80s when she also appeared regularly on television. Even aged in her 80s, she was writing an average of 23 books a year. In one letter, dated 8 June 1989, she wrote to ""my dear prime minister"" after seeing her the night before. ""It is incredible, with all you do, how you can still look as though you were 25,"" she wrote. Dame Barbara enclosed a new product from the ""Health Movement"" in case Baroness Thatcher ever felt tired. The novelist told Baroness Thatcher the product ""takes oxygen to every part of the body, including the brain"" and that as someone aged nearly 88 herself, she found it ""fantastic"". And just a few weeks later, on 3 July 1989, Dame Barbara sent another product to the prime minister's diary secretary, Amanda Ponsonby, for her to give Mrs Thatcher to take on a long trip to the Far East. She said it would not induce sleep, but ""just stops that awful feeling in the head and ears"". In November of the same year, Baroness Thatcher wrote to the novelist after a ""wonderful luncheon"" and thanked her for a ""golden acorn"". It is not clear what this item was, but Baroness Thatcher wrote: ""I shall need it in the coming days!"" At the time, her chancellor had resigned the month before, and a leadership challenge had been launched. When Margaret Thatcher met Gazza How Thatcher was briefed on Sex Pistols The celebrities 'banned' from Thatcherâs party Thatcher was urged to soften image Elsewhere in the newly released files are references to Baroness Thatcher taking royal jelly and vitamin C. According to a profile in Vanity Fair magazine in June 1989, the former prime minister was also fond of ""electric baths"" in which 0.3 amps of electricity was run through water in a bid to stay youthful. Chris Collins, of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation, said he believed her interest in alternative medicines was genuine, though references in the archives were ""obscure, perhaps deliberately so"". The ""electric baths"" report generated a lot of attention in the world's media. He said Baroness Thatcher's press secretary Bernard Ingham could not treat lightly ""the impression of dottiness, of a woman 'slightly off her trolley'."" The files, available for the public to view from Monday at www.margaretthatcher.org, also include a briefing paper on the benefits of the coming European Single Market, written by a young David Cameron, who was then at the Conservative Research Department. ""We believe that creating a single community market will be good for Britain, good for Europe and good for the world,"" runs the opening quote, from the party's manifesto for the European elections in 1989. Pages initialled by ""DC"" set out how the single market, due to start in 1992, would help business, workers, consumers, savers, holidaymakers. It detailed the changes in different sectors of the economy and was extremely positive about the effect this would have. The files also reveal that Mrs Thatcher tried to refuse the resignation of her chancellor Nigel Lawson in October 1989, calling it ""an absurd proposition"" and a ""flimsy and unworthy proposal"". According to the note, she told him to ""go away and think again"". Documents also refer to a leadership challenge launched by Sir Anthony Meyer later that year. While Baroness Thatcher won the MPs' vote decisively that December, documents show at least one of her advisers feared this was ""the beginning of the end of the Thatcher era"". She left office in 1990, after 11 years as prime minister.

"Captain Marvel's backstory is about as straightforward as a Heston Blumenthal tasting menu. Even the snippet of it explored in this latest Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) release, which barely scratches the surface of the character's 80-year old history, manages to be more opaque than a billionaire's tax return. That, at least, is the premise of this origin movie, which could just as well have been called Captain Millennial. Our photon-fisted all-action hero is a tech-savy, civic-minded, self-improver with identity issues. Captain Marvel (Brie Larson), or Kree alien Vers as she is called when we first meet her, doesn't know who she is. Constant flashbacks to past events suggest there's more to her than her Kree colleagues are letting on. But it's all a bit of a fog, as are the first 10 minutes of the movie. Vers is being schooled in the art of combat by Kree Starforce commander Yon-Rogg (a yellow-eyed Jude Law), who is trying to help her be the ""best version of herself"", by mansplaining to the wilful wannabe-superhero the classic philosophical trope of not letting her heart rule her head. Jude Law as Cdr Yon-Rogg, gives a guiding hand to Carol Danvers/Vers/Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) She has to get a handle on her emotions and fiery fists, he insists, before Supreme Intelligence (Annette Bening) will allow her to go out on a mission to fight the Kree's arch enemy: the shape-shifting, lizard-eared, identity-snatching Skrulls. She doesn't have to wait long. Annette Bening plays the embodiment of the Kree supercomputer, the Supreme Intelligence, Mar-Vell The directing duo behind the camera, Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, have a film to get on with and hi-fi sci-fi fight sequences to deliver. You can sense them frantically priming their cinematic canvas: arranging players, establishing storylines, and giving MCU's ""first stand-alone, female-franchise title character"" a personality. The film only starts to find its feet when Vers loses hers and crash lands in Los Angeles, circa 1995. Cue a nostalgia fest as the Woman Who Fell to Earth through the roof of a Blockbuster Video store picks herself up (a recurring theme) before picking out a VHS of The Right Stuff - the Tom Wolfe-written Philip Kaufman-directed 1983 film about the pioneering Mercury Seven astronauts. The Right Stuff (1983 film about the original Mercury Seven astronauts) comes in handy for both Captain Marvel and our understanding of her character The shot lasts for only a few seconds but it carries some weight. It is more than an amusing aside about the film rental choice of a visiting alien. It's a significant clue to discovering her past. And a mark of the subtlety brought by both Brie Larson and the directors to a genre not always recognised for understatement... Enter S.H.I.E.L.D agent Nick Fury, a digitally ""de-aged"" Samuel L Jackson, who appears not only impossibly fresh-faced but also without the character's trademark eye patch. Given the time and place in which the action is set, and the film's retro vibe and pop-culture call-backs, there's the tantalising possibility of Fury bumping into Jules Winnfield (the hitman Jackson played in Pulp Fiction) proclaiming ""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men."" And aliens, he should have added. Samuel L Jackson, who returns as a ""gentler"" Nick Fury, said part of the challenge in this film was that he now has two eyes and hair Because Agent Fury is caught between the Krees and the Skrulls who are having it out on Earth - or Planet C-53 as they call it when being polite - he is destined to be collateral damage if he doesn't do something sharpish. The laborious set-up is complete. Vers, or, more accurately Carol Danvers of the United States Air Force, as she soon discovers, buddies up with Fury and the film takes off like its namesake. There are twists and turns and a spot of soul-searching as Danvers realises she has to shed who she thought she was, to become who she is, Captain Marvel. It is a journey that the Oscar-winning Brie Larson tackles with real skill. Playing an insecure, self-doubting, slightly lost superhero is not an easy trick to pull off: vulnerability and invincibility don't generally go hand-in-hand. The fact that Larson convincingly portrays both, simultaneously, is testament to her talent and those with whom she interacts, particularly Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn as Skrull leader Talos, and Lashana Lynch who plays Maria Rambeau: a single mother, a flying ace and Danvers's best friend. Ben Mendelsohn, who plays leading Skrull baddie, Talos, says the Skrulls are ""the heavy metal rock stars of Marvel"" Lashana Lynch (Maria Rambeau) says she's ""part of a shift in the world"" with this first female Marvel superhero film There is one small snag, however. Once the '90s visual jokes, the Top Gun references (among which is a star turn by an orange cat called Goose), and Agent Fury one-liners have run their course, the actual action adventure plot driving the film forward is fatally exposed: it is about as exciting as watching Windows 95 load. Brie Larson carries the film as a warrior with incredible powers, but it is her character's internal journey that stands out The interior life of Carol Danvers, which ranges from self-discovery to a philosophical questioning about the nature of female empowerment, overshadows all else and makes the action sequences appear as afterthoughts. Maybe that is the trajectory of Marvel movies: more introspection, less action. We'll find out soon enough when Avengers returns next month featuring Brie Larson as Captain Marvel. Has she done for the #MeToo movement what Black Panther did for African American cinema? Is Captain Marvel as culturally significant as that first ever Oscar-winning MCU film? No, in short. It is not as good a film. I very much doubt it will follow in Black Panther's award-wining footsteps. But it is not as far behind in terms of reflecting a shifting attitude in Hollywood as some would have you believe. This is an incarnation of a thoughtful superhero who operates on her own terms, or, seeing as we are in the mid-'90s, knows how to assert her girl power.

"This video can not be played Jussie Smollett: What Chicago Police say happened US actor Jussie Smollett has been charged by a grand jury in Chicago on 16 counts, accused of falsely claiming to police that he had been the victim of a hate crime. Prosecutors had previously charged him with one count of filing a false report. The 36-year-old African-American actor told police he had been the victim of a homophobic and racist assault. Police say he staged the attack in an attempt to further his acting career. Last month he was suspended from the Empire TV show he starred in. Timeline of events 'I'm the gay Tupac' Sources told NBC and CNN Mr Smollett had apologised to the cast for any embarrassment caused by the incident but maintained his innocence. Mr Smollett is accused of paying two brothers to stage the attack on 29 January. Chicago officials also believe that he sent a racist and homophobic letter to himself at a Fox studio beforehand. He was charged with making a false statement to police and, on Thursday, a grand jury returned 16 counts of disorderly conduct against him. At an earlier hearing, a judge set the actor's bail at $100,000 (Â£76,000). Mr Smollett denies all the charges against him and will appear in court on 16 March. His lawyers have said they will ""mount an aggressive defence"" of Mr Smollett, who they described as ""a young man of impeccable character"". Mr Smollett said two white men hurled racist and homophobic insults at him when he went out late at night to buy food from a Subway sandwich shop in Chicago. He said they then punched him, poured a potentially chemical substance over him and put a rope around his neck - a reference to racist lynchings of African-Americans. He also claimed the men said ""this is Maga country"" during the assault, a reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again"". Officers began to grow suspicious when they were unable to find any footage of the incident, despite reviewing more than 50 surveillance cameras. There were also no witnesses. But investigators say they managed to use a ride-sharing app to track and identify two brothers who were filmed near the scene. The men, Ola and Abel Osundairo, flew to Nigeria after the alleged attack. On their return they were held for almost 48 hours. Officials said they were released without charge after providing information that ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation"". One of the brothers is Mr Smollett's personal trainer, and both had worked as extras on Empire. Police say they have a cheque, signed by Mr Smollett, which showed that he had agreed to pay the brothers $3,500. Chicago PD Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Mr Smollett told at least one of the brothers that he was ""dissatisfied"" with his salary on the show. According to the Huffington Post, he was being paid $65,000 per episode for his starring role. In a press conference, Supt Johnson called the alleged scheme ""shameful"", adding: ""Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?"" He also accused Mr Smollett of taking ""advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career"". Mr Smollett turned himself in shortly afterwards.

"Nearly half of babies born before 37 weeks suffer from growth failure A supplement given to breastfed premature babies after they leave hospital can prevent weight loss at a crucial time in their development, a small study suggests. Doctors in Southampton found eight weeks of extra nutrients led to better growth in babies a year later. It also gave mothers confidence and encouraged them to continue breastfeeding, they report. Larger studies are now needed to confirm the findings. Breast milk alone does not always meet the dietary needs of vulnerable babies born before 37 weeks, with about half failing to grow properly. Dr Luise Marino, clinical academic paediatric dietician at Southampton Children's Hospital, said all babies' weights dip by about 10% soon after birth, through water loss. ""But you don't want preterm babies to do that,"" she said. ""They don't have as much fat, minerals or iron, so they need extra nutrients."" Currently, in the UK, breastfed premature babies are given a supplement packed with proteins and minerals, such as calcium, during their stay on neonatal units. At this stage, the supplements, also known as breast milk fortifier, are mixed with breast milk and given to babies through feeding tubes. However, once premature babies are sent home, when they have reached an acceptable weight, the supplements stop. GPs cannot prescribe them, and so any additional nutrients these babies need are often obtained from formula milk, the researchers from Southampton Children's Hospital said. 'Tiniest baby boy' leaves Tokyo hospital The patch unplugging premature babies Carrying car seats could injure new mums They looked at the effects of giving the supplements to 32 mothers and their babies for eight weeks at home and found improvements in the newborns' weight, head growth and length, at eight weeks and again at 12 months, compared with premature babies who were only breastfed. The average weight of babies in the study was 2.8lb (1.3kg) at birth, and most were born at about 30 weeks of pregnancy. When they went home, the babies weighed 5.5lb on average. The supplement sachets can be added to a small amount of expressed breast milk and given to babies by cup or syringe before each breastfeed. Dr Marino said parents involved in the study said they felt less worried about their baby's growth and found it easy to give the supplements to their babies. She said larger studies were now needed to see if the results could be repeated. The study is published inArchives of Disease in Childhood,external.

"Many in Syria are living in makeshift camps The UK government is to pledge an additional Â£100m for Syria crisis response this year, on top of the Â£300m already allocated for 2019. The Â£400m will support ongoing aid ""to those most in need"" both in Syria and in the neighbouring countries where many have fled since war broke out. More than 360,000 people have died in Syria's civil warwhich began in 2011. Funds will provide access to clean water, food, clothes and shelter, as well as emergency medical care. The UK has donated more than Â£2.8bn to the Syrian crisis since 2012, including more than 10 million vaccines and 140 million medical consultations. As well as causing hundreds of thousands of deaths, the war has left 1.5 million people with permanent disabilities, including 86,000 who have lost limbs. At least 6.2 million Syrians are internally displaced, while another 5.7 million have fled abroad, typically to neighbouring Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey. The latest pledge will be made at a conference titled the Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region, co-hosted by the EU and the UN in Brussels next week.

"Richard Leonard told the Scottish Labour conference that his ultimate goal was free bus travel for all Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has told the party's conference that he would seek to deliver ""free bus travel for all"" if they win power. Labour activists are in Dundee for the three-day event, having heard from UK leader Jeremy Corbyn on Friday. Mr Leonard said the deregulation of bus services has been a ""failure"", and that in government Labour would reverse it. He said his long-term goal would be to ""build a free bus network to serve the whole of Scotland"". The MSP also said the idea of anti-Semitism in the Labour movement ""sickens"" him, saying ""it is not who we are"" and pledging to ""root it out"". Corbyn makes plea for Labour unity Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford also addressed the conference on Saturday, while Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell will speak on Sunday. Saturday also saw policy debates on education, local government and equalities - with the latter including a statement from the party executive about anti-Semitism after local party groups had been denied an emergency motion on the topic. Mr Leonard told the conference that his party would table amendments to the Transport Bill currently under consideration at Holyrood to ""put our bus services back in public hands"". He said this would see the network ""run not for profit, not to line the pockets of shareholders, but to give the public a service that we will all benefit from"". And the MSP said the party's ultimate aim was a ""universal public service"", saying: ""The Scottish Labour government that I lead will not only end the failure of deregulation, we will deliver the success of free bus travel for all. ""We will build a proper bus network that connects Scotland's communities. From that collective strength and that commitment to being a truly public service, we will shift the balance from shareholder profit to public investment. ""Labour will build a free bus network to serve the whole of Scotland."" Mr Leonard did not say specifically how the policy would be paid for, but endorsed the idea of an annual ""wealth tax"" to raise more money from the better-off in society. He said wealth in Scotland was accumulating every year even as most people's incomes were shrinking, calling for ""radical redistribution of power and wealth"". Jeremy Corbyn addressed the conference on Friday On Friday, Mr Corbyn issued a plea for party unity after rows about Brexit and anti-Semitism, telling delegates that ""the only thing that can hold us back is if we were to turn our fire on each other rather than on the Tory government"". This was echoed by Mr Leonard, who told the conference that ""splits are damaging"". He added: ""I do not welcome people leaving the Labour Party - it is not a cause for celebration, it is a cause for regret. ""Under my leadership, the Scottish Labour Party will remain a broad church."" This was disputed by local SNP MSP Shona Robison, who said Labour were ""more interested in fighting each other than fighting for the people of Scotland"". She said Labour ""can't match the SNP's ambition it comes to delivering for public services"", saying it was ""no wonder they are trailing a distant third in Scottish politics"".

"Christine Anderson is among those who invested thousands, attracted by 8% interest rates Thousands of people who invested in a high-risk bond scheme marketed as a ""Fixed Rate ISA"" fear they have lost everything after the company collapsed. London Capital & Finance (LCF), now in administration, took Â£236m following a marketing campaign that is now under investigation for mis-selling. Many were first-time investors - inheritance recipients, small business owners or newly retired. Administrators said investors could get as little as 20% of their money back. Peter Thornley could lose savings he had built up over decades Peter Thornley and his wife retired to Devon after a teaching career. He now fears he may have to return to work if their money is lost. ""It put us under a lot of pressure - socially and emotionally. It makes you feel really foolish,"" he said. ""There is a group of us bondholders; there are about 900 in ours. ""We have all got money that we have been left by parents or a lump we got on retirement, then all of a sudden 35 years of savings has gone in a couple of months."" John Wright, a retired joiner from Northampton, was recovering from heart surgery when he found out LCF was in administration. ""This was money for our grandchildren, we weren't going on fancy holidays or buying flash cars - my wife worked in BHS and saved her whole life, this is hard-earned money, we saved and saved and saved. ""I am devastated, I feel a complete fool. I was completely taken in by the marketing."" LCF promised returns of 8% for people investing for more than three years LCF paid an agent, Brighton-based Surge PLC, 25% commission - which amounted to Â£60m - to run the marketing campaign. A series of web adverts promising 8% returns from secure ISAs were released and in addition a comparison website - run by a company with links to Surge - would compare the 1% and 2% return ISAs from high street banks with the investments at LCF. LCF was authorised by regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) - but the FCA said the authorisation was to provide consumer financial advice, not the sale of bonds or ISAs. The FCA subsequently ordered the advertisements should stop running. In aletter to bondholders,externaladministrator Finbarr O'Connell said once the Â£60m to Surge was paid, returns of up to 44% would be required in order for LCF to make good on its promises. Investors were told the funds - and therefore risk - would be spread across hundreds of companies but, according to Companies House records, LCF loaned money to 12 - four of which have never filed accounts, nine are fewer than three years old, and nine had loans from LCF in 2017. Much of the cash was loaned to companies that then ""sub loaned"" to others. Bondholders have raised concerns about connections between the directors of companies that received money and those who ran LCF. Paul Careless is a director of Surge PLC which ran the marketing campaign promoting LCF Michael Andrew Thomson, known as Andy Thomson, took over as the boss of LCF in 2015 and is also director of horse riding company GT Eventing. Paul Careless is the majority shareholder of both Surge PLC and RPDigitalServices - the company that powered ISA comparison websites. Christine Anderson is one of many investors who fear they have lost thousands of pounds Christine Anderson put thousands of pounds into LCF. She runs her own business, a surf school in Devon. ""They have done very well out of hard-working people - a lot have put some or all of their savings into this company,"" she said. ""The directors and ex-directors are living the life of Riley from what I can see, with their helicopters, their horses and their properties. ""It is very sad that this could have been allowed to happen."" Surge said LCF ""signed off all marketing materials and financial promotions prior to publication"" In December the FCA froze LCF's activities, pulled the adverts and in January found that LCF had ""made communications in relation to its fixed rate ISA or bond which were misleading, not fair and not clear"". The FCA findings,externalincluded that LCF's bonds did not qualify to be held in an ISA account and therefore investors were being misled by being told the interest they earned would be tax free. The FCA said it was""unlikely"" investors would be protected under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme,external(FSCS) but it was ""for the FSCS to determine"". Independent financial adviser Neil Liversidge wrote to the FCA in 2015 warning it about the scheme. Mr Liversidge said: ""The way it was promoted, a great many people could have fallen for this. ""A client brought it to us but when we looked into it there was a lot of interconnection between the people they were lending to and the management of LCF themselves. ""We warned our clients off and the same day we wrote to the regulator raising our concerns about the promotion."" Ms Anderson said: ""We feel let down - we trusted this company because they had been regulated and authorised - we then found that they weren't even allowed to manage ISAs. ""The FCA should have known that before they allowed us to buy these products."" A spokesman for Surge Financial said: ""Surge has a number of clients and its fees for LCF are in line with the industry standard. ""LCF was an FCA regulated business and it signed off all marketing materials and financial promotions prior to publication as required by the Financial Services and Markets Act. ""Surge was a supplier of services used in relation to raising investment for LCF. It did not handle client money and had no involvement in the deployment of funds to borrowing companies."" Mr Thomson has not responded to BBC requests for comment. The FCA said it could not comment further.

"Jodie Chesney was stabbed to death in a park in Harold Hill, east London A man has appeared in court charged with the murder of a 17-year-old girl who was stabbed to death in a park in east London. Jodie Chesney was knifed in the back near a children's playground in Harold Hill, Romford, last Friday. Manuel Petrovic, 20, was remanded in custody after appearing at Barkingside Magistrates' Court. Mr Petrovic, of Highfield Road, Romford, will next appear at the Old Bailey on Monday. He was charged after being arrested in Leicester. Officers said a second murder suspect arrested in London remained in custody. Jodie was the fifth teenager to be stabbed to death in the capital so far this year. Her father Peter led tributes, describing his daughter, who was a keen Scout, as a ""great girl"" and a ""proud geek"". Tributes have been left outside the park where she died, and purple ribbons have been hung across Harold Hill and Romford. Peter Chesney paid an emotional tribute to his daughter Students and teachers at Havering Sixth Form College, where Jodie studied, remembered her by donning her favourite colour on Friday. Former classmates described her as a ""bundle of joy"" and said she was ""so beautiful - inside and out"". Scout leader Anna Skipworth said Jodie had ""blossomed into an amazing young woman"" during her time with the Scouts. ""She was funny, intelligent and a joy to work with,"" she said. Bows and ribbons are on display across Romford in memory of Jodie, whose favourite colour was purple Jodie was pronounced dead after police were called to the park near St Neot's Road at 21:25 GMT on 1 March. She was with friends at the time of the attack. A post-mortem examination gave the cause of her death as trauma and haemorrhage.

"President Trump said he would be ""very disappointed"" if there was testing by North Korea Satellite images of a facility near Pyongyang suggest that North Korea may be preparing to launch a missile or a satellite. The increase in activity is around a site known as Sanumdong, where North Korea assembled most of its ballistic missiles and rockets. It comes after reports earlier this week that North Korea's main rocket launch site at Sohae had been rebuilt. Work to dismantle Sohae began last year but stopped as US talks stalled. On Friday US President Donald Trump said he would be disappointed if North Korea was to resume weapons testing. ""I would be surprised in a negative way if he did anything that was not per our understanding. But we'll see what happens,"" he said. ""I would be very disappointed if I saw testing."" What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? Analysts believe that it is more likely at this stage that Pyongyang is preparing to launch a satellite rather than test a missile. However the US said earlier this week that this would still be inconsistent with the commitments North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has made to President Trump. Large vehicles have been seen moving around Sanumdong, activity which has in the past indicated that North Korea was at least preparing to move some kind of missile or rocket to a launch area. The satellite images were published by the US public radio network NPR. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The BBC's Seoul correspondent Laura Bicker says that North Korea might be testing the US after talks in Hanoi between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un broke down, hoping that the US will offer a better deal to avoid a launch. Our correspondent adds that experts say the rockets used to launch satellites are usually unsuitable for use as long-range missiles. North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis North Korea's missile and nuclear programme A much anticipated meeting between the two leaders in the Vietnamese capital last week ended without a deal over differences in how much North Korea was willing to limit its nuclear programme before it was granted some sanction relief. The Sohae launch facility at the Tongchang-ri site has been used for satellite launches and engine testing but never for ballistic missile launches. This week's satellite images, coming from several US think tanks and testimony from the South Korean intelligence service, appear to show rapid progress has been made in rebuilding structures on the rocket launch pad. Sohae has been the site of North Korea's controversial satellite launches US National Security Adviser John Bolton has said North Korea could yet face more sanctions if there is no progress on denuclearisation. A historic first meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Kim in 2018 in Singapore produced a vaguely worded agreement on ""denuclearisation"" but little progress.

"This video can not be played Much of the country, including Caracas, was plunged into darkness A widespread power cut affecting much of Venezuela has continued ahead of planned protests on Saturday. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro and the US-backed opposition trying to oust him have blamed each other for the outage. Hospitals struggled to cope and at least one hospital patient died when her respirator stopped working. The power cuts, which started on Thursday, have reportedly been caused by problems at a major hydroelectric plant. Venezuela depends on its vast hydroelectric infrastructure, rather than its oil reserves, for its domestic electricity supply. But decades of underinvestment have damaged the major dams, and sporadic blackouts are commonplace. President Maduro, however, has blamed the outages on ""sabotage"". In a defiant tweet early on Saturday he vowed to battle the ""brutal aggression against our people"", adding: ""We will never surrender."" In pictures: Lights go out on Venezuela Venezuela crisis in nine charts Venezuela's exodus Power supplies in Caracas appeared to be erratic on Saturday morning. Traffic lights in some areas were back in action but the city's metro remained closed, reports said. Fourteen of Venezuela's 23 states are still affected by the outages, El Nacional newspaper reported. Opposition protesters confronted police in Caracas ahead of the march Venezuelans, meanwhile, are bracing themselves for a weekend of pro- and anti-government protests. Police were out in force on the road in Caracas where Saturday's opposition march was planned. Even before the rally began, some protesters were hit by pepper spray fired by officers, La Patilla news website said. On Friday, offices and school were closed to help efforts to restore electricity, Vice-President Delcy Rodriguez said. Some hospitals saw chaotic scenes as relatives tried to move patients in the dark to other medical facilities with emergency power generators. Many businesses in Caracas were closed on Friday In Caracas's University Hospital, 25-year-old patient Marielsi Aray died after her respirator stopped working. ""The doctors tried to help her by pumping manually, they did everything they could, but with no electricity, what were they to do?"" said her uncle Jose Lugo. Generators at a Caracas children's hospital failed, with staff reportedly working overnight using their mobile phones for light. ""The children were very scared,"" Emilse Arellano, whose child's dialysis had to be cancelled, told the AFP news agency. Mr Maduro accused the opposition of sabotage while his deputy, Ms Rodriguez, condemned what she called an ""imperial electrical war"". Mr GuaidÃ³ hit back, urging Venezuelans to demonstrate on Saturday ""against the usurping, corrupt and incompetent regime that has put our country in the dark"". Staff in some hospitals were forced to use mobile phones for light He said the blackout was the result of years of under-investment and told a gathering marking International Women's Day that it could not be normal that ""50% of hospitals in the country don't have an electric plant"". Mr Maduro has also called for a demonstration and tens of thousands of people are expected to participate in the two rallies. However the BBC's Will Grant in Caracas says the blackout has affected public transport and mobility in the capital city and may have an impact on turnout. They are nothing new. Critics say they have been getting worse since the nationalisation of the power grid in 2007. In 2016, the problem reached such a critical level that the government declared a 60-day nationwide state of emergency. This is the worst power cut in decades In an attempt to stem the country's chronic power shortages, the government has periodically enforced controlled blackouts, where they would switch the power off for up to six hours at a time. Critics say that far from helping, this has caused perishable food to go bad and crime to run rampant. And when unplanned blackouts - such as the latest one - have happened, officials have blamed a number of different outside forces, including animals such as iguanas entering hydroelectric substations. Mr Maduro took over the presidency when his late mentor Hugo Chavez died in 2013. In recent years Venezuela has experienced an economic collapse, with severe food shortages and inflation reaching at least 800,000% last year. The Maduro government is becoming increasingly isolated as more and more countries blame it for the economic crisis, which has prompted more than three million people to leave Venezuela. This video can not be played Juan GuaidÃ³ was greeted by thousands of supporters on his return on Monday Mr GuaidÃ³, who leads the opposition-controlled National Assembly, declared himself interim president on 23 January and has been at loggerheads with President Maduro ever since. He has been recognised as interim president by more than 50 countries but Mr Maduro retains the support of his close allies Russia, Cuba and China, among others.

"Captain Marvel's backstory is about as straightforward as a Heston Blumenthal tasting menu. Even the snippet of it explored in this latest Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) release, which barely scratches the surface of the character's 80-year old history, manages to be more opaque than a billionaire's tax return. That, at least, is the premise of this origin movie, which could just as well have been called Captain Millennial. Our photon-fisted all-action hero is a tech-savy, civic-minded, self-improver with identity issues. Captain Marvel (Brie Larson), or Kree alien Vers as she is called when we first meet her, doesn't know who she is. Constant flashbacks to past events suggest there's more to her than her Kree colleagues are letting on. But it's all a bit of a fog, as are the first 10 minutes of the movie. Vers is being schooled in the art of combat by Kree Starforce commander Yon-Rogg (a yellow-eyed Jude Law), who is trying to help her be the ""best version of herself"", by mansplaining to the wilful wannabe-superhero the classic philosophical trope of not letting her heart rule her head. Jude Law as Cdr Yon-Rogg, gives a guiding hand to Carol Danvers/Vers/Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) She has to get a handle on her emotions and fiery fists, he insists, before Supreme Intelligence (Annette Bening) will allow her to go out on a mission to fight the Kree's arch enemy: the shape-shifting, lizard-eared, identity-snatching Skrulls. She doesn't have to wait long. Annette Bening plays the embodiment of the Kree supercomputer, the Supreme Intelligence, Mar-Vell The directing duo behind the camera, Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, have a film to get on with and hi-fi sci-fi fight sequences to deliver. You can sense them frantically priming their cinematic canvas: arranging players, establishing storylines, and giving MCU's ""first stand-alone, female-franchise title character"" a personality. The film only starts to find its feet when Vers loses hers and crash lands in Los Angeles, circa 1995. Cue a nostalgia fest as the Woman Who Fell to Earth through the roof of a Blockbuster Video store picks herself up (a recurring theme) before picking out a VHS of The Right Stuff - the Tom Wolfe-written Philip Kaufman-directed 1983 film about the pioneering Mercury Seven astronauts. The Right Stuff (1983 film about the original Mercury Seven astronauts) comes in handy for both Captain Marvel and our understanding of her character The shot lasts for only a few seconds but it carries some weight. It is more than an amusing aside about the film rental choice of a visiting alien. It's a significant clue to discovering her past. And a mark of the subtlety brought by both Brie Larson and the directors to a genre not always recognised for understatement... Enter S.H.I.E.L.D agent Nick Fury, a digitally ""de-aged"" Samuel L Jackson, who appears not only impossibly fresh-faced but also without the character's trademark eye patch. Given the time and place in which the action is set, and the film's retro vibe and pop-culture call-backs, there's the tantalising possibility of Fury bumping into Jules Winnfield (the hitman Jackson played in Pulp Fiction) proclaiming ""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men."" And aliens, he should have added. Samuel L Jackson, who returns as a ""gentler"" Nick Fury, said part of the challenge in this film was that he now has two eyes and hair Because Agent Fury is caught between the Krees and the Skrulls who are having it out on Earth - or Planet C-53 as they call it when being polite - he is destined to be collateral damage if he doesn't do something sharpish. The laborious set-up is complete. Vers, or, more accurately Carol Danvers of the United States Air Force, as she soon discovers, buddies up with Fury and the film takes off like its namesake. There are twists and turns and a spot of soul-searching as Danvers realises she has to shed who she thought she was, to become who she is, Captain Marvel. It is a journey that the Oscar-winning Brie Larson tackles with real skill. Playing an insecure, self-doubting, slightly lost superhero is not an easy trick to pull off: vulnerability and invincibility don't generally go hand-in-hand. The fact that Larson convincingly portrays both, simultaneously, is testament to her talent and those with whom she interacts, particularly Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn as Skrull leader Talos, and Lashana Lynch who plays Maria Rambeau: a single mother, a flying ace and Danvers's best friend. Ben Mendelsohn, who plays leading Skrull baddie, Talos, says the Skrulls are ""the heavy metal rock stars of Marvel"" Lashana Lynch (Maria Rambeau) says she's ""part of a shift in the world"" with this first female Marvel superhero film There is one small snag, however. Once the '90s visual jokes, the Top Gun references (among which is a star turn by an orange cat called Goose), and Agent Fury one-liners have run their course, the actual action adventure plot driving the film forward is fatally exposed: it is about as exciting as watching Windows 95 load. Brie Larson carries the film as a warrior with incredible powers, but it is her character's internal journey that stands out The interior life of Carol Danvers, which ranges from self-discovery to a philosophical questioning about the nature of female empowerment, overshadows all else and makes the action sequences appear as afterthoughts. Maybe that is the trajectory of Marvel movies: more introspection, less action. We'll find out soon enough when Avengers returns next month featuring Brie Larson as Captain Marvel. Has she done for the #MeToo movement what Black Panther did for African American cinema? Is Captain Marvel as culturally significant as that first ever Oscar-winning MCU film? No, in short. It is not as good a film. I very much doubt it will follow in Black Panther's award-wining footsteps. But it is not as far behind in terms of reflecting a shifting attitude in Hollywood as some would have you believe. This is an incarnation of a thoughtful superhero who operates on her own terms, or, seeing as we are in the mid-'90s, knows how to assert her girl power.

"Margaret Thatcher apparently used alternative medicines and was sent them by romance author Dame Barbara Cartland, newly released files show. Dame Barbara, who wrote more than 800 books and was Princess Diana's step-grandmother, sent the then-prime minister capsules to tackle tiredness. Baroness Thatcher is famously said to have slept for only four hours a night. Dame Barbara also sent supplements to tackle jetlag or travel sickness ahead of a trip to the Far East. The Margaret Thatcher Foundation is gradually overseeing the release of her private files. Also included among them is a briefing from a young David Cameron on the European single market. In this most recent batch of files released by the foundation, letters show that Dame Barbara corresponded with Baroness Thatcher fairly regularly and lunched with her. Dame Barbara,externalis best known for her historical romance fiction and was most prolific in the 1970s and 80s when she also appeared regularly on television. Even aged in her 80s, she was writing an average of 23 books a year. In one letter, dated 8 June 1989, she wrote to ""my dear prime minister"" after seeing her the night before. ""It is incredible, with all you do, how you can still look as though you were 25,"" she wrote. Dame Barbara enclosed a new product from the ""Health Movement"" in case Baroness Thatcher ever felt tired. The novelist told Baroness Thatcher the product ""takes oxygen to every part of the body, including the brain"" and that as someone aged nearly 88 herself, she found it ""fantastic"". And just a few weeks later, on 3 July 1989, Dame Barbara sent another product to the prime minister's diary secretary, Amanda Ponsonby, for her to give Mrs Thatcher to take on a long trip to the Far East. She said it would not induce sleep, but ""just stops that awful feeling in the head and ears"". In November of the same year, Baroness Thatcher wrote to the novelist after a ""wonderful luncheon"" and thanked her for a ""golden acorn"". It is not clear what this item was, but Baroness Thatcher wrote: ""I shall need it in the coming days!"" At the time, her chancellor had resigned the month before, and a leadership challenge had been launched. When Margaret Thatcher met Gazza How Thatcher was briefed on Sex Pistols The celebrities 'banned' from Thatcherâs party Thatcher was urged to soften image Elsewhere in the newly released files are references to Baroness Thatcher taking royal jelly and vitamin C. According to a profile in Vanity Fair magazine in June 1989, the former prime minister was also fond of ""electric baths"" in which 0.3 amps of electricity was run through water in a bid to stay youthful. Chris Collins, of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation, said he believed her interest in alternative medicines was genuine, though references in the archives were ""obscure, perhaps deliberately so"". The ""electric baths"" report generated a lot of attention in the world's media. He said Baroness Thatcher's press secretary Bernard Ingham could not treat lightly ""the impression of dottiness, of a woman 'slightly off her trolley'."" The files, available for the public to view from Monday at www.margaretthatcher.org, also include a briefing paper on the benefits of the coming European Single Market, written by a young David Cameron, who was then at the Conservative Research Department. ""We believe that creating a single community market will be good for Britain, good for Europe and good for the world,"" runs the opening quote, from the party's manifesto for the European elections in 1989. Pages initialled by ""DC"" set out how the single market, due to start in 1992, would help business, workers, consumers, savers, holidaymakers. It detailed the changes in different sectors of the economy and was extremely positive about the effect this would have. The files also reveal that Mrs Thatcher tried to refuse the resignation of her chancellor Nigel Lawson in October 1989, calling it ""an absurd proposition"" and a ""flimsy and unworthy proposal"". According to the note, she told him to ""go away and think again"". Documents also refer to a leadership challenge launched by Sir Anthony Meyer later that year. While Baroness Thatcher won the MPs' vote decisively that December, documents show at least one of her advisers feared this was ""the beginning of the end of the Thatcher era"". She left office in 1990, after 11 years as prime minister.

""It put us under a lot of pressure - socially and emotionally. It makes you feel really foolish,"" he said. ""There is a group of us bondholders; there are about 900 in ours. ""We have all got money that we have been left by parents or a lump we got on retirement, then all of a sudden 35 years of savings has gone in a couple of months."" John Wright, a retired joiner from Northampton, was recovering from heart surgery when he found out LCF was in administration. ""This was money for our grandchildren, we weren't going on fancy holidays or buying flash cars - my wife worked in BHS and saved her whole life, this is hard-earned money, we saved and saved and saved. ""I am devastated, I feel a complete fool. I was completely taken in by the marketing."" LCF promised returns of 8% for people investing for more than three years LCF paid an agent, Brighton-based Surge PLC, 25% commission - which amounted to Â£60m - to run the marketing campaign. A series of web adverts promising 8% returns from secure ISAs were released and in addition a comparison website - run by a company with links to Surge - would compare the 1% and 2% return ISAs from high street banks with the investments at LCF. LCF was authorised by regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) - but the FCA said the authorisation was to provide consumer financial advice, not the sale of bonds or ISAs. The FCA subsequently ordered the advertisements should stop running. In aletter to bondholders,externaladministrator Finbarr O'Connell said once the Â£60m to Surge was paid, returns of up to 44% would be required in order for LCF to make good on its promises. Investors were told the funds - and therefore risk - would be spread across hundreds of companies but, according to Companies House records, LCF loaned money to 12 - four of which have never filed accounts, nine are fewer than three years old, and nine had loans from LCF in 2017. Much of the cash was loaned to companies that then ""sub loaned"" to others. Bondholders have raised concerns about connections between the directors of companies that received money and those who ran LCF. Paul Careless is a director of Surge PLC which ran the marketing campaign promoting LCF Michael Andrew Thomson, known as Andy Thomson, took over as the boss of LCF in 2015 and is also director of horse riding company GT Eventing. Paul Careless is the majority shareholder of both Surge PLC and RPDigitalServices - the company that powered ISA comparison websites. Christine Anderson is one of many investors who fear they have lost thousands of pounds Christine Anderson put thousands of pounds into LCF. She runs her own business, a surf school in Devon. ""They have done very well out of hard-working people - a lot have put some or all of their savings into this company,"" she said. ""The directors and ex-directors are living the life of Riley from what I can see, with their helicopters, their horses and their properties. ""It is very sad that this could have been allowed to happen."" Surge said LCF ""signed off all marketing materials and financial promotions prior to publication"" In December the FCA froze LCF's activities, pulled the adverts and in January found that LCF had ""made communications in relation to its fixed rate ISA or bond which were misleading, not fair and not clear"". The FCA findings,externalincluded that LCF's bonds did not qualify to be held in an ISA account and therefore investors were being misled by being told the interest they earned would be tax free. The FCA said it was""unlikely"" investors would be protected under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme,external(FSCS) but it was ""for the FSCS to determine"". Independent financial adviser Neil Liversidge wrote to the FCA in 2015 warning it about the scheme. Mr Liversidge said: ""The way it was promoted, a great many people could have fallen for this. ""A client brought it to us but when we looked into it there was a lot of interconnection between the people they were lending to and the management of LCF themselves. ""We warned our clients off and the same day we wrote to the regulator raising our concerns about the promotion."" Ms Anderson said: ""We feel let down - we trusted this company because they had been regulated and authorised - we then found that they weren't even allowed to manage ISAs. ""The FCA should have known that before they allowed us to buy these products."" A spokesman for Surge Financial said: ""Surge has a number of clients and its fees for LCF are in line with the industry standard. ""LCF was an FCA regulated business and it signed off all marketing materials and financial promotions prior to publication as required by the Financial Services and Markets Act. ""Surge was a supplier of services used in relation to raising investment for LCF. It did not handle client money and had no involvement in the deployment of funds to borrowing companies."" Mr Thomson has not responded to BBC requests for comment. The FCA said it could not comment further.

"A Lords committee wants tech companies to have one overarching regulator setting rules for user privacy, data and anti-social content Tech firms, such as Google and Facebook, must improve their ""inadequate"" responses to privacy and data breaches and anti-social content, a House of Lords report says. The House of Lords Communications Committee wants a digital authority to help laws keep pace with technology. Content moderation used by tech firms was ""unacceptably slow,"" it said. The Internet Association, whose members include Twitter and Amazon, said firms were committed to keeping users safe. ""Our members work hard to keep their services free of some of the most serious issues that the report mentions - from strong terms and conditions; to investment in hiring teams and improving systems for removing inappropriate content,"" a spokesman from the lobby group said. The report, Regulating in a Digital World, said: ""Self-regulation by online platforms which host user-generated content, including social media platforms, is failing. Their moderation processes are unacceptably opaque and slow."" The Lords Communication Committee chairman Lord Gilbert of Panteg said rule makers were failing to keep up with the speed at which technology was infiltrating every part of daily life. ""We have become so dependent on a very small number of companies and platforms. ""Tech companies have a special responsibility, yet they have not done enough to reduce online harm. ""Harmful, anti-social content - available freely on many platforms - is now greater than ever before,"" Lord Gilbert said. The report comes in the wake of high-profile data and privacy breaches, such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where Facebook users' profile data was harvested for third parties without their consent or knowledge. Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg faced US politicians over data and privacy breaches, but would not answer similar questions in the UK Lord Gilbert said he would like to see harsher penalties when tech companies broke rules, by giving any new authority the ability to fine tech companies a percentage of their global turnover. More than a dozen UK regulators currently have a role covering part of the digital world, but there is no government organisation that has complete oversight. The committee proposes that a so-called Digital Authority would have that oversight and include former tech company employees to make sure it stays ahead of the curve.

"Shamima Begum with her third child Jarrah, who died on Thursday Home Secretary Sajid Javid is facing criticism after the baby son of Shamima Begum died in a Syrian camp. Ms Begum left London to join the Islamic State group aged 15. Mr Javid revoked her British citizenship when the teenager asked to return. A family friend said the UK had failed to safeguard the child while Labour said his death was the result of a ""callous and inhumane"" decision. A UK government spokesman said the death of any child was ""tragic"". The spokesman said the government had consistently advised against travelling to Syria and would ""continue to do whatever we can to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism and travelling to dangerous conflict zones"". I apologise to Britain, says Shamima Begum's dad Why countries face a dilemma over IS children Where now for IS bride Shamima Begum? What was life like for the IS couple? Ms Begum, who left the UK in 2015 with two school friends, was found by a journalist from the Times in a Syrian refugee camp in mid-February. She said she had been living with her husband, a Dutch IS fighter, in IS's last stronghold and had previously lost two children, blaming the inhospitable conditions. Nine months pregnant, she told the paper she did not regret joining IS, but that she felt the ""caliphate"" was at an end. And speaking shortly after the birth of her son, Jarrah, she told the BBCshe wished her child to be British and to be raised in the UK. Jarrah died of pneumonia on Thursday, according to a medical certificate. He was less than three weeks old. Conservative MP and former justice minister Phillip Lee urged the government to ""reflect"" on its ""moral responsibility"" for the tragedy. He said that despite her ""abhorrent views"" the decision to remove Ms Begum's citizenship - and therefore deny her the chance of returning to the UK - seemed ""driven by populism and not by any principle I recognise"". Conditions in the camp were ""pretty appalling"", with a shortage of food, blankets and tents, said the BBC's Middle East correspondent Quentin Sommerville. Defence and security editor for the Daily Mail Larisa Brown told Newsnight there was no form of heating in the camp andthe tents did not have stoves to keep children warm in temperatures that fell to 3C or 4C at night,external. In three months, more than 100 people have died on the way or soon after arriving at the camp, with two-thirds of those dying aged under five. David Miliband, former foreign secretary and president of the International Rescue Committee, said the camp faced an emergency as 12,000 ""traumatised as well as deeply malnourished"" people fled IS rule. Dal Babu, a former Metropolitan Police chief superintendent and friend of Ms Begum's family, told BBC Newsnight: ""We've failed, as a country, to safeguard the child."" Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police after they left the UK After Ms Begum was stripped of her citizenship,her family wroteto the home secretary to say they planned to challenge the decision and asked for assistance to bring her baby to the UK. Ms Begum's sister, Renu Begum, said in the letter Jarrah was the ""one true innocent"" in the situation. As her child was born before she was deprived of UK citizenship by the Home Office, the baby would still be considered British. ""This was an entirely avoidable death of a British citizen,"" said Mr Babu. ""There was no attempt to help by the Home Office. I think it's shocking how the home secretary has treated this situation."" Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott also criticised the actions of the Home Office. She tweeted:,external""It is against international law to make someone stateless, and now an innocent child has died as a result of a British woman being stripped of her citizenship. This is callous and inhumane."" How many IS foreign fighters are left? Tales from inside the chaos left by IS Speaking to the BBC on Friday, before it was confirmed that the baby had died, Mr Javid said: ""Sadly there are probably many children, obviously perfectly innocent, who have been born in this war zone. ""I have nothing but sympathy for the children that have been dragged into this. ""This is a reminder of why it is so, so dangerous for anyone to be in this war zone."" BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said it might have been possible for the government to get the baby out of Syria, although that could have been ""politically difficult"". ""The government's position that it's impossible to go and get people out of these camps because it's too dangerous is repeatedly shown to be not entirely accurate, because journalists are able to get to these camps relatively safely. ""Working with the Red Crescent there for example, it should be possible to go and get people from the camps - if there was a political will."" This video can not be played ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" Kirsty McNeill, head of policy, advocacy and campaigns at the charity Save the Children, said ""all children associated with IS are victims of the conflict and must be treated as such"". ""It is possible the death of this baby boy and others could have been avoided. The UK and other countries of origin must take responsibility for their citizens inside north-east Syria,"" she added. But Professor Anthony Glees, director of the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham, said: ""The responsibility for this tragedy lies with the so-called Islamic State."" He said Shamima Begum also bears responsibility ""for making the choice to leave the safety of the United Kingdom and go and be a Jihadi bride"". Inan interview with the BBCafter the birth of Jarrah, Ms Begum said she did not regret travelling to Syria - although she added that she did not agree with everything the IS group had done. She added that she had never sought to be an IS ""poster girl"". ""I just want forgiveness really, from the UK,"" she told the BBC's Middle East correspondent Quentin Sommerville last month. ""Everything I've been through, I didn't expect I would go through that. ""Losing my children the way I lost them, I don't want to lose this baby as well and this is really not a place to raise children, this camp."" 'I didn't want to be IS poster girl' Why countries face a dilemma over IS children Who will take the IS couple? Where now for IS bride Shamima Begum?

"On Tuesday, MPs will pass their verdict on Prime Minister Theresa May's plan to take Britain out of the European Union on 29 March. Here is what you need to know about the vote. At 7pm on Tuesday evening, after a full day of debate. They are passing judgement on the deal Theresa May spent two years negotiating with the European Union. Brexit: What could happen next? This is the big one. If MPs vote the deal down, one of two things is likely to happen. The UK will either leave the EU on 29 March without a withdrawal agreement - or that departure date will be delayed. If they back the deal, the UK will leave the EU on 29 March but things will stay broadly as they are until December 2020, while the two sides thrash out a permanent trade deal. Yes - andby a massive margin. Mrs May said she secured ""legally binding"" changes to her Brexit deal on Monday, a day ahead of MPs voting on it. She said the first change could be used to start a ""formal dispute"" against the EU if it tried to keep the UK tied into the backstop - the safety net designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland - indefinitely. The second is a ""joint statement"" from the EU and the UK. It adds to the political declaration on the UK and EU's future relationship and commits to replacing the backstop with alternative arrangements by December 2020. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, the government's chief law officer, haspublished updated legal advice,externalon the prime minister's deal, saying the new provisions secured by Mrs May ""reduce the risk"" of the UK being ""indefinitely and involuntarily"" held  in the backstop. But his advice adds that ""the legal risk remains unchanged"" that the UK would have no legal means of exiting without EU agreement. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. If MPs vote down Mrs May's withdrawal agreement on Tuesday, then MPs have been promised a vote on whether the UK should leave without a deal or not. This is likely to take place on Wednesday. If they back a no-deal Brexit in this vote, then the UK will leave without a deal on 29 March. If they reject a no-deal Brexit then they could get a vote on Thursday on whether to request a delay to Brexit from the EU. Not necessarily. If Mrs May loses the vote on Tuesday by a narrow margin, she could ask the EU for a short technical delay to allow everyone to regroup and make one last push to get it ""over the line"". Mrs May could make that final push at the next EU summit on 22 March, with another Commons vote to follow, assuming she can get a delay to Brexit. Brexit: If not 29 March, then when? Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button The first thing to stress is that it is not a trade deal. It is simply an agreement to allow the UK to leave the EU in an orderly fashion, minimising disruption to businesses and citizens of the UK and EU nations. Things would carry on pretty much as usual for at least 21 months after the official departure date of 29 March. During that time, the two sides would try to hammer out a permanent trading relationship - the overall aim of those talks is set out in the political declaration on the future relationship between the UK and EU, which MPs are also voting on. The withdrawal agreement also commits the UK to paying a Â£39bn ""divorce bill"". UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, would also retain their residency and social security rights. The withdrawal agreement - what it all means The decision MPs make on Tuesday will shape the UK's economy and society for decades to come, influencing incomes, job prospects and much else besides. There may also be some more immediate consequences. Many fear a no-deal Brexit will cause chaos at ports, disruption to food and medical supplies and long-term economic damage, with big multinational companies moving out of the UK. Others say these fears are exaggerated and the UK will thrive when it has made a clean break from the EU. The ""Irish backstop"" clause. This is a bit of legal jargon that is meant to prevent the return of cameras and border guards along the 310 mile border between Ireland and Northern Ireland - the only land border between the EU and the UK. It would keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, avoiding the need for physical checks on vehicles passing through the border, which many fear could reignite the Northern Irish Troubles. It is only meant to kick in if the two sides have not agreed a trade deal by December 2020 - and it is meant to be temporary. But because there is no end date written into the agreement, and no way of quitting it without the EU's say-so, many MPs fear it will become permanent, effectively making a mockery of Brexit. These MPs want a time-limit on the backstop - something the EU has ruled out. The EU says the deal it struck with Mrs May is the best and only one available and it can't be rewritten. Mrs May used to say that too, until MPs rejected it in January. MPs are studying the additional legal assurances on the temporary nature of the backstop, agreed by Mrs May in 11th hour talks with EU officials, before deciding whether to vote for her deal or not. After months of questions about his position, Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he could support a new referendum, while continuing to push for his preferred option of a general election or Labour's own version of Brexit. Many Labour MPs from areas that voted Leave in the 2016 referendum could vote against it, however, reducing its chances of success. The Labour leadership also appears to be warming to the idea of a Norway-style deal with the EU, which is backed by a group of Conservative and Labour MPs. This would see the UK remain in the EU single market, which its supporters say would protect jobs. If Mrs May's deal is defeated on Tuesday, there could be moves to get MPs to back ""Common Market 2.0"", as its supporters call this plan. Opponents say it would not end the free movement of people or allow the UK to strike its own trade deals around the world.

"This video can not be played Yago Riedijk said he saw nothing wrong in marrying 15-year-old Shamima Begum. The Dutch husband of Shamima Begum, who joined the Islamic State group in Syria in 2015 aged 15, has said he wants her to return to the Netherlands with him. Yago Riedijk and Ms Begum married days after she arrived inside IS territory. Speaking to the BBC, he admitted fighting for the group but says he now wants to return home with his wife and their newborn son. Mr Riedijk, 27, is being held in a Kurdish detention centre in north-eastern Syria. He faces a six-year jail term for joining a terror organisation if he returns to the Netherlands. Who will take IS fighter and his teen bride? Begum family challenge Javid on citizenship How many IS foreign fighters are left? In an interview with the BBC's Middle East correspondent, Quentin Sommerville, Mr Riedijk said he rejected IS and had tried to leave the group. He told our correspondent that he was imprisoned in Raqqa and tortured after the extremists accused him of being a Dutch spy. Describing life under IS control, Mr Riedijk also said he attended the stoning of a woman for ""fornication"", saw piles of dead bodies in the city and lost an infant daughter to malnutrition. By BBC Middle East correspondent Quentin Sommerville He sits opposite me in a yellow plastic chair, 27 years old now, in a freezing interview room in a Kurdish detention centre. His guards have just removed his handcuffs. If I see Shamima, he asks me to ""tell her that I love her and have patience"". ""Hopefully soon we'll be together again and things will turn out alright, hopefully."" It seems unlikely that will happen anytime soon. Over the next hour, he paints a contradictory picture of an insulated home life, and a maelstrom of terror outside. Read more from Quentinhere. Ms Begum, now aged 19, escaped with her IS fighter husband from the town of Baghuz, the group's last territory in eastern Syria, as the caliphate crumbled. Mr Riedijk surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters, and Ms Begum and their newborn son, Jarrah, ended up among 39,000 people in the al-Hol refugee camp in northern Syria. She has now reportedly gone elsewhere. Mr Riedijk also told the BBC he saw nothing wrong with marrying Ms Begum - 15 at the time, while he was 23 - because it was ""her choice"". Ms Begum pictured on CCTV at Gatwick Airport in February 2015 Describing how he met the schoolgirl from east London in the women's centre in Raqqa, he said he was initially not interested because she was too young. He said: ""To be honest, when my friend came and said there was a girl who was interested in marriage, I wasn't that interested because of her age, but I accepted the offer anyway."" He added that she had seemed to be ""in a good state of mind"". Mr Riedijk, from Arnhem in the Netherlands, insisted: ""It was her own choice. She asked to look for a partner for her, and I was invited."" He conceded ""she was very young, maybe it would have been better for her to wait a bit"", before adding: ""But she didn't, she chose to get married and I chose to marry her."" This video can not be played Shamima Begum: ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" Ms Begum left the UK in February 2015 alongside Amira Abase, also 15 at the time, and Kadiza Sultana, who was 16. Ms Sultana is believed to have been killed in an air strike in 2016. The UK has revoked Ms Begum's citizenship on the grounds that she is a Bangladeshi national through her mother, who is a Bangladeshi citizen. But Bangladesh's ministry of foreign affairs has disputed this, saying Ms Begum is not a Bangladeshi citizen and that she will not be allowed into the country. And, last month, Ms Begum's family told the home secretary they were going to challenge his decision to revoke her UK citizenship. In the letter,seen by the BBC, Shamima Begum's sister Renu said they could not ""simply abandon her"" and asked for assistance in bringing her newborn baby to the UK. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile, said Ms Begumhad a ""right to return to Britain""- and called the decision to revoke her citizenship ""extreme"". What is Shamima Begum's legal status? Inside the chaos left by IS group's fall How do countries deal with IS returnees? Could defeated IS rebound? Although Mr Riedijk is on a terrorism watch list, his Dutch citizenship has not been revoked. However, BBC foreign correspondent Anna Holligan said Ms Begum would struggle to get her underage marriage recognised in the Netherlands, and any application for a residence permit would be jeopardised by the fact that she too was suspected of terrorism crimes. Their newborn son though, might be entitled to Dutch citizenship through his father, she added. Recently, the Dutch justice department has warned of the threat posed by jihadist women returning from abroad. It said even women and children, who were not trained and did not take part in hostilities, could pose a ""long-term potential threat"" because of exposure to IS ideology. Mr Riedijk was born and raised in Dutch suburbia but abandoned his life in 2014 to join IS. He was one of 300 Dutch men and women who travelled to Syria and Iraq, our correspondent said. Of those, some 135 Dutch nationals with ""jihadist intentions"" are still there, according to anti-terrorism officials. It is not known how many want to come back, but last week the Netherlands removed the citizenship of another Dutch jihadist, Outhmane B. The Dutch justice ministry has said those wishing to return will receive no government help. It added, however, that if Mr Riedijk turned himself in at a Dutch embassy or consulate he would be sent back to the Netherlands to serve his six-year prison term.

"For the time being, Theresa May is insisting the UK can and will still leave on 29 March Theresa May has bowed to pressure from a group of Tory MPs and ministers and agreed to give Parliament a vote on delaying the UK's departure from the EU on 29 March. This will take place only if MPs reject her Brexit deal for a second time when they vote on it next Tuesday - and then also say no to the UK leaving the EU without a comprehensive, legally binding agreement, the so-called no-deal scenario. With just 22 days to go, Parliament has yet to approve the terms of withdrawal negotiated with the EU. MPs will have another ""meaningful vote"" on Theresa May's deal on 12 March and insisted that if MPs back her, the UK can still leave as planned just over two weeks later. In the event of MPs backing a pause in the Brexit process, the PM has said she will seek the ""shortest possible"" delay, while also refusing to rule out the UK still leaving without a deal later in the year. So if not 29 March, when could the UK actually end up leaving? This video can not be played Theresa May: ""An extension cannot take no deal off the table."" The first thing to point out is that any decision to delay the UK's departure by extending the Article 50 process would have to be agreed by both the UK and every other EU member. The EU has sent out slightly mixed messages on the question, with some senior figures saying a delay would be sensible while others argue there would have to be a good reason for it. But assuming the EU agrees to it, the first alternative Brexit date that has been touted is 18 April, which happens to be Maundy Thursday. The thinking behind this is that it is also the last day in which the European Parliament can vote on issues before it breaks up ahead of May's Europe-wide elections - more about those later. May offers MPs Brexit delay vote Kuenssberg: Brexit delay from May not all 'simples' Brexit: All you need to know Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) also have to approve the deal although unlike MPs, who rejected the agreement by a margin of more than 200 votes, they have yet to consider it. If the UK and EU run out of time to come up with a solution to address MPs' concerns about the current deal  - and EU leaders won't hold their next summit until 22 March - or if Mrs May loses MV2 by a narrow margin, there could be a short ""technical"" delay to allow everyone to regroup and make one last push to get it ""over the line"". If the UK Parliament finally consents to the withdrawal agreement in late March or early April, it is thought that MEPs will soon follow suit - although expecting them to do so right at the last minute carries obvious risks. And would this tight-ish timetable give the UK enough time to prepare for an orderly departure? There is a lot of Brexit-related legislation to get through Parliament in a short time Irrespective of whether MPs agree to the deal, there are a number of other complicating factors. First of all, MPs wrote the 29 March exit date into UK law when theypassed the EU Withdrawal Bill last year. This would need to be superseded, although this is done relatively easily by way of a statutory instrument. Furthermore, Mrs May has promisedto enshrine the withdrawal agreement,externalin domestic legislation by passing an Act of Parliament. It normally takes months for bills to pass through the Commons and Lords. Although the PM has indicated the withdrawal and implementation bill could be fast-tracked, some MPs and peers may kick up a fuss saying two weeks does not leave enough time for proper scrutiny. Thus 23 May or thereabouts has emerged as a possible new Brexit day. This, the thinking goes, would allow the UK two further months to fully prepare itself for leaving. Please upgrade your browser It would also see the UK leave before the outcome of May's European elections, due to take place between the 23 and 26 May, in which it will not play any part. Simon Hart, a member of the Brexit Delivery Group of Tory MPs, has proposed tabling an amendment advocating a ""strictly time-limited"" delay until 23 May although this was withdrawn after Mrs May urged MPs not to ""bind her hands"". Can Brexit wait until after the summer holidays? If there are no signs of the two sides finding a solution to the thorny issue of the Irish backstop, then a slightly longer delay becomes a possibility. Pushing back Brexit by about three months to the end of June would not be ideal for either side. But it would be an admission that more time is needed for negotiations, particularly if the EU doesn't fancy, as has been reported, making further concessions that it can't be sure would be accepted by MPs. Leaving on 23 June, on the third anniversary of the Brexit referendum, would be particularly sweet for many Brexiteers although the issue of ratification by the European Parliament would still be outstanding. Newly elected MEPs from across Europe aren't due to take their seats until early July although they could conceivably convene a special session earlier or, possibly, approve the Brexit deal retrospectively. There will be a big incentive to get the whole thing done and dusted before the end of July, both for political and more worldly reasons - no-one will want to see their summer holiday plans disrupted if at all possible. Could British MEPs have ""observer status"" in Brussels until the UK leaves? Once you get past the end of July and the evenings start to draw in, that's when things get trickier. The EU may be willing to grant one extension to the Brexit process but a series of rolling delays is reportedly not to its liking and a lengthier hiatus may only happen if there were a general election or another referendum. That said, senior EU officials are reported to have mulled delaying Brexit until 2021 - in the hope the two sides will have negotiated their future relationship by then and this will sort out all the issues relating to the backstop. But this is likely to be unacceptable to Conservative MPs, and millions of Leave voters, as it would mean the UK was still part of the EU more than five years after it voted to leave in 2016. There is also the small matter of Europe's parliamentary elections. Could the UK remain in the EU for an indefinite period without sending representatives to Brussels and Strasbourg? Theresa May has suggested this would not be viable but experts, such as the Institute for Government, have pointed out that there may be ways round this dilemma - in the short term anyway. These could include the UK's existing MEPs being granted ""observer status"" with no voting rights or the UK sending national representatives, as Romania and Bulgaria did for four months after they joined in 2007. Another potential option would be for the UK to re-elect its 73 MEPs - whose seats would otherwise be re-allocated - on an interim basis but to hold the polls at a different time from the rest of the EU. But the cost of doing this would be controversial and would the Conservatives be willing to put up candidates when they were likely to be accused of betrayal by, among others, Nigel Farage's new Brexit party?

"Shamima Begum with her third child Jerrah, who died on Thursday The baby son of Shamima Begum - who fled London to join the Islamic State group - has died, a spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces has said. The group, which runs the camp where the teenager has been living, confirmed the death on Friday. The baby died of pneumonia, according to a medical certificate. He was less than three weeks old. A UK government spokesman said the death of any child was ""tragic and deeply distressing for the family"". The spokesman said the government had consistently advised against travelling to Syria and would ""continue to do whatever we can to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism and travelling to dangerous conflict zones"". Ms Begum left the UK in 2015 with two friends and was found in a Syrian refugee camp in mid-February. She wanted to return to Britain but was stripped of her citizenship. Her husband, a Dutch IS fighter called Yago Riedijk, is being held at a nearby prison and has been informed of the baby's death. Why countries face a dilemma over IS children Where now for IS bride Shamima Begum? What was life like for the IS couple? A paramedic working for the Kurdish Red Crescent in the camp told the BBC that the baby, called Jarrah, had been suffering from breathing difficulties. He was taken to a doctor on Thursday morning before being transferred to hospital, along with his mother, but died at 13:30 local time that day, the medical worker added. Ms Begum has since returned to the camp and her child was buried there yesterday. Ms Begum left Bethnal Green, east London, in 2015 to join the Islamic State group in Syria Speaking to the BBC before it was confirmed that the baby had died, Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Sadly there are probably many children, obviously perfectly innocent, who have been born in this war zone. ""I have nothing but sympathy for the children that have been dragged into this. This is a reminder of why it is so, so dangerous for anyone to be in this war zone."" Ms Begum, 19, gave birth to her son last month, shortly after being tracked down by a journalist in a Syrian refugee camp. She had reportedly left Baghuz - IS's last stronghold. Ms Begum said she had previously lost two other children and named her newborn son Jarrah after her firstborn. This video can not be played ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" As her child was born before she was deprived of UK citizenship by the Home Office, the baby would still be considered British. Mr Javidpreviously saidthat the revocation of Ms Begum's citizenship would not apply to her son, explaining: ""Children should not suffer, so if a parent does lose their British citizenship it does not affect the rights of their child."" The lawyer representing the family of Ms Begum, Tasnime Akunjee,also confirmed,externalthe death. Inan interview with the BBCafter the birth of Jarrah, Ms Begum said she did not regret travelling to Syria - although she added that she did not agree with everything the IS group had done. She also said that she never sought to be an IS ""poster girl"" and simply wished to raise her child quietly in the UK. Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police after they left the UK After Ms Begum was stripped of her citizenship,her family wroteto the home secretary to say they planned to challenge the decision and asked for assistance to bring her baby to the UK. Earlier this week, Mr Akunjeetweeted a screenshot of the reply,externalthat they had received from the Home Office. It told them that the possibility of bringing the baby to the UK was a matter for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and that they would need permission from Ms Begum. The FCO is obliged to consider requests for consular assistance, the letter added. BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said it might have been possible for the government to get the baby out of Syria, although that could have been ""politically difficult"". ""The government's position that it's impossible to go and get people out of these camps because it's too dangerous is repeatedly shown to be not entirely accurate, because journalists are able to get to these camps relatively safely. ""Working with the Red Crescent there for example, it should be possible to go and get people from the camps if there was a political will."" How many IS foreign fighters are left? Tales from inside the chaos left by IS Dal Babu, a former Metropolitan Police chief superintendent and friend of Ms Begum's family, told BBC Newsnight: ""We've failed, as a country, to safeguard the child. ""This was an entirely avoidable death of a British citizen. The family reached out to the Home Office, requested help, the Home Office sent a reply saying you've come to the wrong department. ""There was no attempt to help by the Home Office. I think it's shocking how the home secretary has treated this situation."" Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott also criticised the actions of the Home Office.She tweeted:,external""It is against international law to make someone stateless, and now an innocent child has died as a result of a British woman being stripped of her citizenship. This is callous and inhumane."" Shamima Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK four years ago Kirsty McNeill, head of policy, advocacy and campaigns at the charity Save the Children, said ""all children associated with IS are victims of the conflict and must be treated as such"". She added: ""It is possible the death of this baby boy and others could have been avoided. The UK and other countries of origin must take responsibility for their citizens inside north-east Syria.""

"This video can not be played Much of the country, including Caracas, was plunged into darkness A widespread power cut affecting much of Venezuela has continued ahead of planned protests on Saturday. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro and the US-backed opposition trying to oust him have blamed each other for the outage. Hospitals struggled to cope and at least one hospital patient died when her respirator stopped working. The power cuts, which started on Thursday, have reportedly been caused by problems at a major hydroelectric plant. Venezuela depends on its vast hydroelectric infrastructure, rather than its oil reserves, for its domestic electricity supply. But decades of underinvestment have damaged the major dams, and sporadic blackouts are commonplace. President Maduro, however, has blamed the outages on ""sabotage"". In a defiant tweet early on Saturday he vowed to battle the ""brutal aggression against our people"", adding: ""We will never surrender."" In pictures: Lights go out on Venezuela Venezuela crisis in nine charts Venezuela's exodus Power supplies in Caracas appeared to be erratic on Saturday morning. Traffic lights in some areas were back in action but the city's metro remained closed, reports said. Fourteen of Venezuela's 23 states are still affected by the outages, El Nacional newspaper reported. Opposition protesters confronted police in Caracas ahead of the march Venezuelans, meanwhile, are bracing themselves for a weekend of pro- and anti-government protests. Police were out in force on the road in Caracas where Saturday's opposition march was planned. Even before the rally began, some protesters were hit by pepper spray fired by officers, La Patilla news website said. On Friday, offices and school were closed to help efforts to restore electricity, Vice-President Delcy Rodriguez said. Some hospitals saw chaotic scenes as relatives tried to move patients in the dark to other medical facilities with emergency power generators. Many businesses in Caracas were closed on Friday In Caracas's University Hospital, 25-year-old patient Marielsi Aray died after her respirator stopped working. ""The doctors tried to help her by pumping manually, they did everything they could, but with no electricity, what were they to do?"" said her uncle Jose Lugo. Generators at a Caracas children's hospital failed, with staff reportedly working overnight using their mobile phones for light. ""The children were very scared,"" Emilse Arellano, whose child's dialysis had to be cancelled, told the AFP news agency. Mr Maduro accused the opposition of sabotage while his deputy, Ms Rodriguez, condemned what she called an ""imperial electrical war"". Mr GuaidÃ³ hit back, urging Venezuelans to demonstrate on Saturday ""against the usurping, corrupt and incompetent regime that has put our country in the dark"". Staff in some hospitals were forced to use mobile phones for light He said the blackout was the result of years of under-investment and told a gathering marking International Women's Day that it could not be normal that ""50% of hospitals in the country don't have an electric plant"". Mr Maduro has also called for a demonstration and tens of thousands of people are expected to participate in the two rallies. However the BBC's Will Grant in Caracas says the blackout has affected public transport and mobility in the capital city and may have an impact on turnout. They are nothing new. Critics say they have been getting worse since the nationalisation of the power grid in 2007. In 2016, the problem reached such a critical level that the government declared a 60-day nationwide state of emergency. This is the worst power cut in decades In an attempt to stem the country's chronic power shortages, the government has periodically enforced controlled blackouts, where they would switch the power off for up to six hours at a time. Critics say that far from helping, this has caused perishable food to go bad and crime to run rampant. And when unplanned blackouts - such as the latest one - have happened, officials have blamed a number of different outside forces, including animals such as iguanas entering hydroelectric substations. Mr Maduro took over the presidency when his late mentor Hugo Chavez died in 2013. In recent years Venezuela has experienced an economic collapse, with severe food shortages and inflation reaching at least 800,000% last year. The Maduro government is becoming increasingly isolated as more and more countries blame it for the economic crisis, which has prompted more than three million people to leave Venezuela. This video can not be played Juan GuaidÃ³ was greeted by thousands of supporters on his return on Monday Mr GuaidÃ³, who leads the opposition-controlled National Assembly, declared himself interim president on 23 January and has been at loggerheads with President Maduro ever since. He has been recognised as interim president by more than 50 countries but Mr Maduro retains the support of his close allies Russia, Cuba and China, among others.

"Police said they found evidence of ""witchcraft"" in the woman's home, including limes stuffed with written curses A 37-year-old mother has been jailed after becoming the first person in the UK to be convicted of female genital mutilation (FGM). The Ugandan woman mutilated her three-year-old daughter at their family home in east London in 2017. She was jailed for 11 years for the FGM and a further two years for indecent images and extreme pornography. Sentencing at the Old Bailey, Mrs Justice Whipple said the act was ""a barbaric and sickening crime"". ""FGM has long been against the law and let's be clear FGM is a form of child abuse"", she added. The mother was born in Uganda but has lived in the UK for a number of years. FGM is banned in both countries, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. The judge said it was not known why, contrary to her culture, the woman inflicted FGM on her child, although witchcraft was a possibility. Spells and curses intended to deter police investigations were found at the woman's home before her trial. During the trial, the woman claimed that in August 2017 her daughter climbed up to get a biscuit and ""fell on metal and it's ripped her private parts"". Medics alerted police to the girl's injuries after they treated her at Whipps Cross Hospital in Leytonstone. The child ""lost a significant amount of blood as a result of the injuries... delivered and inflicted on her"", jurors were told. Includes ""the partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons"" Practised in 30 countries in Africa and some countries in Asia and the Middle East An estimated three million girls and women worldwide are at risk each year About 125 million victims estimated to be living with the consequences It is commonly carried out on young girls, often between infancy and the age of 15 Often motivated by beliefs about what is considered proper sexual behaviour, to prepare a girl or woman for adulthood and marriage and to ensure ""pure femininity"" Dangers include severe bleeding, problems urinating, infections, infertility and increased risk of childbirth complications and newborn deaths Source:World Health Organization,external The woman's former partner, a 43-year-old Ghanaian man, was cleared of involvement in the FGM offence. But he pleaded guilty to two charges of possession of an indecent image of a child and two charges of possessing extreme pornography. Mrs Justice Whipple sentenced him to 11 months in prison, although he has already served his time on remand. While the parents were on bail, police searched the mother's home and said they found evidence of ""witchcraft"". Prosecutor Caroline Carberry QC said two cow tongues were ""bound in wire with nails and a small blunt knife"" embedded in them. Forty limes and other fruit were found containing pieces of paper with names written on them, including those of police officers and a social worker involved in the investigation. Police also found two cow tongues with metal screws in them Sentencing the woman, who cannot be named to protect the victim's identity, the judge said: ""[FGM] is a barbaric practice and a serious crime. It's an offence which targets women, particularly inflicted when they are young and vulnerable."" On the psychological effect on the victim, she told the defendant: ""This is a significant and lifelong burden for her to carry. ""You betrayed her trust in you as her protector."" The case is only the fourth FGM prosecution brought to court in the UK. The previous cases led to acquittals. John Cameron, head of the NSPCC's Childline, said: ""Some cultures consider FGM a necessary part of bringing up a young girl. There may even be pressures for families to conform. ""The truth is it is a horrific form of child abuse and a criminal offence which has no place in today's society. ""If we want to protect girls from this dangerous and potentially life changing practice we need to talk about FGM, encourage people to seek help and advice and report any concerns if they believe a child has been cut or is about to be."" The National Police Chiefs' Council lead for FGM, Commander Ivan Balhatchet, said: ""Female genital mutilation is a barbaric and violent crime - a violation of human rights - often with lifelong consequences, committed by the people children should be able to trust the most."" Lynette Woodrow, of the CPS, said: ""FGM is an extremely serious form of child abuse and today's sentence underlines that fact. ""We hope that this conviction encourages those who have experienced FGM, or have suspicions about FGM offences, to come forward knowing that we will treat everyone with sensitivity and respect.""

"Margaret Thatcher apparently used alternative medicines and was sent them by romance author Dame Barbara Cartland, newly released files show. Dame Barbara, who wrote more than 800 books and was Princess Diana's step-grandmother, sent the then-prime minister capsules to tackle tiredness. Baroness Thatcher is famously said to have slept for only four hours a night. Dame Barbara also sent supplements to tackle jetlag or travel sickness ahead of a trip to the Far East. The Margaret Thatcher Foundation is gradually overseeing the release of her private files. Also included among them is a briefing from a young David Cameron on the European single market. In this most recent batch of files released by the foundation, letters show that Dame Barbara corresponded with Baroness Thatcher fairly regularly and lunched with her. Dame Barbara,externalis best known for her historical romance fiction and was most prolific in the 1970s and 80s when she also appeared regularly on television. Even aged in her 80s, she was writing an average of 23 books a year. In one letter, dated 8 June 1989, she wrote to ""my dear prime minister"" after seeing her the night before. ""It is incredible, with all you do, how you can still look as though you were 25,"" she wrote. Dame Barbara enclosed a new product from the ""Health Movement"" in case Baroness Thatcher ever felt tired. The novelist told Baroness Thatcher the product ""takes oxygen to every part of the body, including the brain"" and that as someone aged nearly 88 herself, she found it ""fantastic"". And just a few weeks later, on 3 July 1989, Dame Barbara sent another product to the prime minister's diary secretary, Amanda Ponsonby, for her to give Mrs Thatcher to take on a long trip to the Far East. She said it would not induce sleep, but ""just stops that awful feeling in the head and ears"". In November of the same year, Baroness Thatcher wrote to the novelist after a ""wonderful luncheon"" and thanked her for a ""golden acorn"". It is not clear what this item was, but Baroness Thatcher wrote: ""I shall need it in the coming days!"" At the time, her chancellor had resigned the month before, and a leadership challenge had been launched. When Margaret Thatcher met Gazza How Thatcher was briefed on Sex Pistols The celebrities 'banned' from Thatcherâs party Thatcher was urged to soften image Elsewhere in the newly released files are references to Baroness Thatcher taking royal jelly and vitamin C. According to a profile in Vanity Fair magazine in June 1989, the former prime minister was also fond of ""electric baths"" in which 0.3 amps of electricity was run through water in a bid to stay youthful. Chris Collins, of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation, said he believed her interest in alternative medicines was genuine, though references in the archives were ""obscure, perhaps deliberately so"". The ""electric baths"" report generated a lot of attention in the world's media. He said Baroness Thatcher's press secretary Bernard Ingham could not treat lightly ""the impression of dottiness, of a woman 'slightly off her trolley'."" The files, available for the public to view from Monday at www.margaretthatcher.org, also include a briefing paper on the benefits of the coming European Single Market, written by a young David Cameron, who was then at the Conservative Research Department. ""We believe that creating a single community market will be good for Britain, good for Europe and good for the world,"" runs the opening quote, from the party's manifesto for the European elections in 1989. Pages initialled by ""DC"" set out how the single market, due to start in 1992, would help business, workers, consumers, savers, holidaymakers. It detailed the changes in different sectors of the economy and was extremely positive about the effect this would have. The files also reveal that Mrs Thatcher tried to refuse the resignation of her chancellor Nigel Lawson in October 1989, calling it ""an absurd proposition"" and a ""flimsy and unworthy proposal"". According to the note, she told him to ""go away and think again"". Documents also refer to a leadership challenge launched by Sir Anthony Meyer later that year. While Baroness Thatcher won the MPs' vote decisively that December, documents show at least one of her advisers feared this was ""the beginning of the end of the Thatcher era"". She left office in 1990, after 11 years as prime minister.

"Many in Syria are living in makeshift camps The UK government is to pledge an additional Â£100m for Syria crisis response this year, on top of the Â£300m already allocated for 2019. The Â£400m will support ongoing aid ""to those most in need"" both in Syria and in the neighbouring countries where many have fled since war broke out. More than 360,000 people have died in Syria's civil warwhich began in 2011. Funds will provide access to clean water, food, clothes and shelter, as well as emergency medical care. The UK has donated more than Â£2.8bn to the Syrian crisis since 2012, including more than 10 million vaccines and 140 million medical consultations. As well as causing hundreds of thousands of deaths, the war has left 1.5 million people with permanent disabilities, including 86,000 who have lost limbs. At least 6.2 million Syrians are internally displaced, while another 5.7 million have fled abroad, typically to neighbouring Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey. The latest pledge will be made at a conference titled the Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region, co-hosted by the EU and the UN in Brussels next week.

"A Lords committee wants tech companies to have one overarching regulator setting rules for user privacy, data and anti-social content Tech firms, such as Google and Facebook, must improve their ""inadequate"" responses to privacy and data breaches and anti-social content, a House of Lords report says. The House of Lords Communications Committee wants a digital authority to help laws keep pace with technology. Content moderation used by tech firms was ""unacceptably slow,"" it said. The Internet Association, whose members include Twitter and Amazon, said firms were committed to keeping users safe. ""Our members work hard to keep their services free of some of the most serious issues that the report mentions - from strong terms and conditions; to investment in hiring teams and improving systems for removing inappropriate content,"" a spokesman from the lobby group said. The report, Regulating in a Digital World, said: ""Self-regulation by online platforms which host user-generated content, including social media platforms, is failing. Their moderation processes are unacceptably opaque and slow."" The Lords Communication Committee chairman Lord Gilbert of Panteg said rule makers were failing to keep up with the speed at which technology was infiltrating every part of daily life. ""We have become so dependent on a very small number of companies and platforms. ""Tech companies have a special responsibility, yet they have not done enough to reduce online harm. ""Harmful, anti-social content - available freely on many platforms - is now greater than ever before,"" Lord Gilbert said. The report comes in the wake of high-profile data and privacy breaches, such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where Facebook users' profile data was harvested for third parties without their consent or knowledge. Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg faced US politicians over data and privacy breaches, but would not answer similar questions in the UK Lord Gilbert said he would like to see harsher penalties when tech companies broke rules, by giving any new authority the ability to fine tech companies a percentage of their global turnover. More than a dozen UK regulators currently have a role covering part of the digital world, but there is no government organisation that has complete oversight. The committee proposes that a so-called Digital Authority would have that oversight and include former tech company employees to make sure it stays ahead of the curve. The government is due to respond to its report within two months.

"Cemeren Yilmaz, 16, suffered massive internal injuries, a fractured skull and brain damage, a court heard The murder of a 16-year-old boy at the hands of a rival gang was filmed on Snapchat, a court has heard. Cemeren Yilmaz died following two cardiac arrests and brain damage after an attack in the Ashmead Road area of Bedford in September, a jury was told. He had told his brother he expected to be attacked by rival gang members, St Albans Crown Court heard. Aaron Miller, 20, of Tavistock Street, Bedford, and three 15-year-olds, who cannot be named, deny murder. Opening the case, Prosecutor Stuart Trimmer QC said the background to the case concerned the ""hostility"" between two rival Bedford gangs. He told the jury Cemeren met up with friends in Ashmead Road on 16 September, and at about 21:00 BST ran towards a group including one of the 15-year-old defendants, causing them to flee. Cemeren was seen later running away and clutching a bag, Mr Trimmer said. This may have caused the 15-year-old boy and his co-defendants ""to exact revenge,"" the QC suggested. Cemeren Yilmaz died the day after being stabbed, a jury was told After 22:00 Cemeren and Mr Miller exchanged punches and then the 15-year-old who had earlier run from the scene joined in the attack on Cemeren, Mr Trimmer said. The jury was told the pair were part of a group who chased Cemeren, who then fell to the pavement having been tripped or fallen. ""The Crown say they both aimed vicious kicks towards Cemeren, before the 15-year-old produces a knife and bends down and thrusts it towards Cemeren,"" he said. Cemeren stabbed Mr Miller in the back and ran away before being caught again and attacked by the pair while lying on the grass, the court heard. Mr Miller and the 15-year-old then made off and the other two 15-year-old defendants turned up with a hammer, using it on Cemeren as well as kicking him, and one of them recorded a Snapchat video of the attack on a mobile phone, the jury was told. Mr Trimmer said it was the combination of the two attacks that caused the death of Cemeren, who died in hospital the following day. The trial continues.

"This video can not be played Families of those who died have described the pain they have been through The pilot of a jet that crashed at the Shoreham Airshow killing 11 men has been found not guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence. Andrew Hill's ex-military jet exploded in a fireball on the A27 in Sussex on 22 August 2015. The former RAF pilot, 54, denied deliberately beginning a loop manoeuvre despite flying too low and too slowly. Karim Khalil QC, defending, argued Mr Hill had been suffering from ""cognitive impairment"" when the jet crashed. Mr Hill, from Sandon, near Buntingford, Hertfordshire, was also formally acquitted of a count - that was not put in front of the jury - of negligently or recklessly endangering the safety of an aircraft. The Old Bailey jury deliberated for seven hours over three days and there were gasps from the families in the courtroom with many in tears as the verdicts were read out. Shoreham pilot: 'Aviation fuel runs through his veins' Who were the Shoreham air crash victims? Judge Mr Justice Edis told the relatives: ""I am enormously impressed and grateful for the dignified way you have all behaved. ""I can see that you are upset and you are absolutely entitled to be but despite being upset you have behaved in a way which does you great credit."" This video can not be played The Hawker Hunter crashed into A27 in Shoreham In a statement Sue and Phil Grimstone, whose son Matthew died in the crash, said: ""There seems to be no justice for our son Matthew and all 11 men who died in such tragic circumstances. The couple said the case had raised questions about the safety of aerobatic air displays ""when there is now doubt concerning any pilot's ability to avoid becoming cognitively impaired"". They added: ""Matthew had no interest in air shows, he could not have cared less. Knowing he died because an aircraft was being flown for fun, for the entertainment of others makes it even harder to bear."" Oliver Morriss, nephew of victim Mark Reeves, said his family felt ""complete devastation at the most surprising not guilty verdict"". He added: ""We feel that the success of Mr Hill's defence of cognitive impairment could establish a worrying precedent and have far-reaching consequences."" On the steps of the court, Mr Hill read out the names of all 11 victims and said: ""A number of people were injured. I'm truly sorry for the part I played in their deaths and it's they I will remember for the rest of my life."" This video can not be played Pilot Andy Hill acquitted over Shoreham Airshow deaths The court had heard the Hawker Hunter jet ""disintegrated"" upon impact, creating a ""massive fireball"" when it hit the ground. Mr Hill, a British Airways captain at the time, had been performing a manoeuvre known as a bent loop before his jet crashed on to the A27. Prosecutor Tom Kark QC, acknowledged Mr Hill was an experienced pilot but said he had been known to take risks and the jet was ""probably as much as 1,000ft below the height required"" at the top of the loop. The Old Bailey was told that the defendant had a ""cavalier attitude to safety"". But Mr Hill said he took a ""very structured, disciplined approach"" to display flying and sometimes held back from flights he was not comfortable with carrying out. The former RAF instructor claimed he had blacked out in the air, having experienced ""cognitive impairment"" brought on by hypoxia possibly due to the effects of G-force. He ""miraculously escaped"" when the aircraft broke up and he was thrown into a ditch, the jury heard. He suffered head injuries and fractures to his ribs and spine and was placed in an induced coma before being discharged a month later. The prosecution argued Andy Hill was flying too low to complete a manoeuvre while performing at the Shoreham Airshow in 2015 Mr Hill told the Old Bailey he had no memory from three days before the crash to when he woke from his coma and had spent the last three years ""trying to resolve what happened"". In 2017 a report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch found the disaster was caused by pilot error after the plane was too slow and too low during the loop manoeuvre. Rebecca Smith from Irwin Mitchell lawyers, which represents 17 people affected by the crash, including some bereaved families and of the injured, said: ""Attention will now to turn to the inquest where the entirety of the Shoreham Airshow tragedy can be fully examined."" Sarah Stewart, a partner at Stewarts, who represent many of the bereaved families, called for a wider investigation. ""The bereaved families have had to painfully re-live the circumstances of their loved ones' death again and again. ""The families want answers and a verdict will go some way towards that. But it is only one part of the jigsaw."" The organisers of the Shoreham Airshow have denied any responsibility for the crash. Colin Baker, director of the event, said: ""I feel pretty satisfied that what we did in the preparation for the air show and during the air show was all that could be done. ""We very much regret what happened but I really don't think we could have done anything different prior to the accident to avoid it.""
