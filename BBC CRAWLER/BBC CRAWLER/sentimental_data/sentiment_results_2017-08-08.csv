"This video can not be played President Trump threatened a response 'like the world has never seen' US President Donald Trump says North Korea ""will be met with fire and fury"" if it threatens the US. His comments came after aWashington Post report,external, citing US intelligence officials, said Pyongyang had produced a nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside its missiles. This would mean the North is developing nuclear weapons capable of striking the US at a much faster rate than expected. The UN recently approved further economic sanctions against the country. The Security Councilunanimously agreedto ban North Korean exports and limit investments, prompting fury from North Koreaand a vowto make the ""US pay a price"". The heated rhetoric between the two leaders intensified after Pyongyang tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) in July, claiming it now had the ability to hit the US. Mr Trump told reporters on Tuesday: ""North Korea best not make any more threats to the US. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen."" Can the US defend itself against North Korea? N Korea: The possible solutions Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington: Donald Trump said that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ""has been very threatful, beyond a normal statement"". So he responded with language that goes well beyond a normal statement for any US president. Perhaps Mr Trump believes that no hyperbolic threats should go unmatched or that apocalyptic warnings are the only ones the North Korean leadership will understand. Perhaps he - intentionally or not - is pursuing a Nixonian ""madman"" style foreign policy, where adversaries will tread lightly to avoid triggering the wrath of an unpredictable US commander-in-chief. When the leader of the world's greatest superpower, the only nation ever to have used nuclear weapons on an enemy, talks of unprecedented ""fire and fury"", however, those words have consequences. During his presidential campaign Mr Trump criticised his predecessor Barack Obama for not enforcing a red line against Syria's use of chemical weapons. Now President Trump has drawn a fiery bright line of his own with North Korea - one that could commit the US to a perilous course of action if his words go unheeded. The Washington Post quoted an intelligence community report as saying it ""assesses North Korea has produced nuclear weapons for ballistic missile delivery, to include delivery by ICBM-class missiles"". This video can not be played North Korea's second intercontinental missile launched last month was ""seen from Japan"" It has previously been thought that the North was still years away from being able to fire a nuclear weapon, although it has long carried out separate nuclear tests and missile launches. North Korea said on Monday, two days after the UN sanctions were passed, that it would continue with its nuclear weapons programme. The state-run KCNA news agency said Pyongyang would ""not put our self-defensive nuclear deterrent on the negotiating table"" while it faces threats from the US. It threatened to make the US ""pay the price for its crime... thousands of times,"" referring to America's role in drafting the UN sanctions resolution.

"The singer of pop songs such as Shake It Off is expected to take the stand to testify Pop star Taylor Swift is ""absolutely certain"" she was groped by a Colorado radio DJ, a court has heard. Ms Swift, 27, accuses broadcaster David Mueller of slipping his hand under her dress while they posed backstage together at one of her 2013 concerts. Her lawyer said in his opening statement at the court in Denver, Colorado, that Mr Mueller had ""grabbed her rear end"". Mr Mueller sued the singer in September 2015, calling her allegation false. He said she had cost him his $150,000-a-year job as a host at country station KYGO-FM. Taylor Swift groping trial: What you need to know DJ denies groping Taylor Swift's 'bare bottom' at fan meet and greet Ms Swift - who was in court on Tuesday - countersued a month later, saying what occurred at the city's Pepsi Center was assault and battery. On Tuesday, jurors were shown a photograph of the alleged assault at a VIP room meet-and-great before the gig on 2 June 2013. In the picture, Mr Mueller and his then-girlfriend, Shannon Melcher, stand with Ms Swift in the middle. All are smiling, and Mr Mueller's right hand is hidden behind the Shake it Off singer. Mr Mueller's lawyer, Gabriel McFarland, said in his opening statement the image shows his client's hand ""is not underneath Miss Swift's skirt, and her skirt is not rumpled in any fashion"". Fans waited for hours for a chance to get inside the courtroom ""David Mueller unequivocally denies he touched her inappropriately in anyway,"" Mr McFarland said as his client looked on in court. ""Falsely accusing someone of inappropriate touching is equally offensive, equally wrong and should not be tolerated."" In his opening statement, Mr Mueller said he had only sued ""to clear his name and for lost earnings"", denying reports that he was seeking $3m in damages from the radio promotions director of his former station. But Ms Swift's attorney, Douglas Baldridge, said Mr Mueller had given seven accounts of what happened. He had also destroyed taped conversations about the incident with his bosses, said the lawyer. Mr Baldridge told the eight jurors: ""What's wrong with this picture? A woman gets assaulted, a woman reports it, and she gets sued."" He added: ""It's not inappropriate touching. It's assault."" On 3 June, Mr Mueller met his bosses. He was fired the next day on the basis he had violated a ""morals clause"", according to Mr McFarland. Ms Swift, who was 23 at the time of the incident, is suing Mr Mueller for the symbolic amount of $1. She was accompanied in court by her mother Andrea. Ms Swift also attended jury selection on Monday. Her fans, known as Swifties, waited outside court from the early hours for a chance to get one of the court's 32 public seats.

The son of a sharecropper, Glen Travis Campbell was born in Arkansas on 22 April 1936, the seventh of 12 children. His first guitar cost $7 and he taught himself to play. Campbell made his name in the music business as one of the top session guitarists in Los Angeles, and helped hone producer Phil Spector's famous Wall of Sound technique. He toured for three months in 1965 with the Beach Boys, filling in for singer Brian Wilson after he suffered a breakdown. Campbell played on hundreds of tracks including Daydream Believer by The Monkees, You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling by The Righteous Brothers, Strangers in the Night by Frank Sinatra and Viva Las Vegas by Elvis Presley. This video can not be played Glen Campbell's bandmate Carol Kaye says he couldn't read music, which he tried to hide But Campbell always wanted to make it under his own name. After a string of flops, in 1967 he finally found his distinctive country pop sound with hits like Gentle On My Mind and By the Time I Get to Phoenix. Wichita Lineman went to No 1 in the US, won a Grammy and became much requested by US soldiers fighting in Vietnam. By the end of the 1960s, Campbell was the fastest rising star in American pop with his own TV show, The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour. He also picked up a starring role alongside John Wayne in the original version of True Grit. Glen Campbell with his wife Kim (L) and daughter Ashley in Los Angeles in 2012 The peak of Glen Campbell's career was in 1975 when he topped the charts around the world with Rhinestone Cowboy. Despite another smash hit in 1977 - Southern Nights - his private life was in turmoil. Divorce, drink and drugs saw the clean-cut all-American hero fall from grace. A tempestuous relationship with 21-year-old country star Tanya Tucker was front-page news. Despite a relapse in 2003, when he was arrested for drunk-driving and his police mug shot was shown around the world, the last two decades had been more settled. Campbell backstage at the BBC's Top of the Pops in 1970 He remarried, started a new family and renewed his Christian faith, while a new generation discovered his music. ""I got down on my knees and prayed. And, eventually, I got rid of those demons,"" he said in an interview. Like his friend Johnny Cash, Campbell released acclaimed new albums with younger musicians, covering songs by contemporary artists like U2 and The Foo Fighters. In 2005 he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

"Mr Macron has been accused by critics of hypocrisy after vowing to stamp out political nepotism French President Emmanuel Macron is to abandon plans to create an official role of first lady for his wife Brigitte, according to reports. During his campaign, Mr Macron had said he wanted to create ""a real status"" for his wife. But an onlinepetition,externalagainst the move has gained almost 290,000 signatures.

In a TV interview during his presidential campaign, Mr Macron said that, if elected, he would want the role of first lady to be ""defined"". ""She [Brigitte Macron] will have a say on what she wants to be,"" he told TF1 in April. Should France have an official 'first lady'? The French constitution gives no official status to a president's spouse, although they are typically allocated an office in the ElysÃ©e Palace, an assistant or two, and security guards. Brigitte Macron has been married to the French President for 10 years Part of Mr Macron's campaign was based onstamping out nepotism in French politicsafter his conservative rival Francois Fillon was investigated overcontroversial paymentsto his wife.

French politician Thierry Mariana was one of several to publicly criticise the new French president for the move. ""Do as I say, not as I do,"" he said in atweet,externallast month.

"This video can not be played Chloe Ayling's lawyer says she thought the best thing to do was to be nice to her captor The alleged captor of British model Chloe Ayling held her because he needed to raise money for cancer treatment, Italian police documents have revealed. In his police testimony, Lukasz Herba said he got involved with the group behind the alleged kidnap near Milan because he had leukaemia. Ms Ayling's lawyer Francesco Pesce has said the 20-year-old was told she would be sold in the Middle East ""for sex"". Ms Ayling was allegedly held by a group called Black Death for five days. She came home on Sunday, after talking to police investigators, 26 days after she flew to Milan for a photo shoot. Italian police say she was attacked by two men, drugged with ketamine and abducted, apparently to be sold in an online auction. It is alleged the kidnappers attempted to sell her online for Â£230,000 and demanded her agent paid a ransom fee. Italian police released an image of suspect Lukasz Herba Mr Pesce said Ms Ayling, from Coulsdon, south London, had gone shopping with her captor because she had been threatened with death. ""She was told that people were there watching her and were ready to kill her if she tried anything,"" he said. ""So she thought that the best idea was to go along with it and be nice to her captor, because he told her he wanted to release her somehow and some time."" Mr Herba, a Polish national who lives in Oldbury, in the West Midlands, told police he had a change of heart once he met Ms Ayling, according to documents seen by the BBC. He told investigators he drove her to the British consulate in Milan and released her before the sale went ahead. This video can not be played Chloe Ayling: ""I've been through a terrifying experience"" Ms Ayling's police testimony says she had met him before - when he was her contact for an earlier photo shoot in Paris - where he introduced himself as Andre. He cancelled the shoot saying his camera had broken, and came to Paris airport to pay her taxi fare. She described being abducted in Milan and taken to a hideout by three or four men, but was watched over only by Herba, who slept beside her each night, as she was tied to furniture. Italian police said she was transported in a car to a house in Borgial, north-west of Turin, where she was handcuffed to a wooden chest of drawers in a bedroom for six days. Speaking on Sunday, Ms Ayling said she feared for her life throughout the ""terrifying experience"". ""I'm incredibly grateful to the Italian and UK authorities for all they have done to secure my safe release."" This video can not be played Carla Belluci, a friend of Ms Ayling, gives her reaction Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Tuesday, Ms Ayling's friend Carla Berlucci, who also runs a model agency, said girls in the industry had to take care. ""Safety is always first, safety is number one,"" she said. She described her friend, who she has known since Chloe was 15, as a ""good girl, a little bit naive"". Investigations into the case are being carried out by authorities in Italy, Poland and the UK. Italian officers have arrested Mr Herba on kidnapping charges. The UK's National Crime Agency said it had been working with the East Midlands Special Operations Unit (EMSOU) and the Italian authorities. A spokesman said: ""A house in the Oldbury area linked to Lukasz Pawel Herba was searched on 18 July by EMSOU officers with assistance from West Midlands Police.

"The phenomenon was seen in many parts of the west of England A rare ""pink rainbow"" was spotted in the west of England on Monday evening. The phenomenon, seen in Bristol, Taunton and Yate, has been described as an ""optical illusion"" by experts. People who photographed it described it as ""amazing,external"" and ""pretty,external"" on BBC Points West's Facebook page . BBC Weather presenter Simon King said there was no specific name for the phenomenon, which was caused by a regular rainbow and a pink sunset happening at the same time. ""We've got a regular rainbow, which is caused by water droplets in the atmosphere reflecting the sunlight into the spectrum of different colours,"" he said. ""The other thing is a pinkish sunset caused by sunlight having to pass through a lot more atmosphere - due to the low sun angle late in the day - hence the shortwave colours - violets, blues, greens - are diminished and we only see the pinks and reds, giving the rainbow a pinkish colour.""

"A man takes pictures of ""hate tweets"" reproduced by Shahak Shapira outside Twitter's Hamburg headquarters A German satirist who claims Twitter is failing to delete hate speech has captured the firm's attention offline - by stencilling the offending messages outside its Hamburg office. Shahak Shapira, who is Jewish, said he had reported 300 incidents of hate speech in six months, but Twitter had responded to just nine. A YouTube video has emerged,externalshowing Mr Shapira stencilling 30 tweets. ""Germany needs a final solution to Islam,"" reads one. ""Let's gas the Jews,"" says another, in reference to the Nazis' murder of six million Jews during World War Two. ""If Twitter forces me to see these things, then they'll have to see them too,"" the artist said in the video, posted on Monday. He described the comments as ""not just plain insults or jokes, but absolutely serious threats of violence"". They include statements that are homophobic, xenophobic, or involve holocaust denial. Shahak Shapira made stencils of the unpleasant tweets He said the nine responses he got from Twitter said the tweets did not violate the site's rules. ""I haven't received a single mail telling me a tweet was actually removed,"" he said. Mr Shapira explained in the video, titled #HeyTwitter, that he had made stencils of the hate-filled messages, then travelled to Hamburg to paint them in front of the platform's headquarters.

"There are tensions in republican areas of Belfast after the council moved in to restrict some anti-internment bonfires Extra police patrols are being deployed in Belfast after a series of attacks on officers, cars and property by youths in nationalist areas of the city. The troublebegan on Mondayafter council contractors removed material from an anti-internment bonfire in the Markets area, near the city centre. On Tuesday night, North Queen St was closed for a time due to a car on fire. The road is near a bonfire in the New Lodge and it is understood a number of petrol bombs were thrown on the road. However, police said the road had reopened to traffic shortly after 23:00 BST and was ""passable with care"". Bonfires are traditionally lit in some republican areas to mark the anniversary of the introduction of internment - detention without trial - on 9 August 1971. Council worker injured Belfast City Councilrecently passed a motionto say that contractors would remove material from bonfire that posed a risk to safety. However, on Tuesday evening the council told the BBC that it no longer has a contractor in place. On Monday, shortly after material was taken away from a bonfire in the Markets, a number of parked cars were set on fire and petrol bombs, stones and other missiles were thrown at police. Later that evening, trouble spread to other areas and a disused credit union building was set on fire in west Belfast. A former credit union was set on fire in west Belfast on Monday night Belfast City Council staff have also been targeted and on Tuesday, the council confirmed that one of its workers had been injured when a stone was thrown at a council vehicle. The member of staff received a cut to the head when the windscreen of their vehicle was smashed. A council spokesperson said it was one of two separate incidents in which stones were thrown at its vehicles. It also confirmed that some street cleansing and commercial waste collections were restricted in the Markets, New Lodge and Divis areas on Tuesday. Community centres in the New Lodge, Divis and Markets areas closed to the public at 17:00 BST. Belfast City Council workers cleaned up after a day of trouble in Belfast In a statement about Monday's attacks, the PSNI said officers had dealt with ""localised disorder caused by a small group of people"" - some as young as 12 - in the Markets, New Lodge and North Queen Street areas. Police are gathering evidence to bring those involved before the courts. They have also appealed for parents to be aware of their children's whereabouts. This video can not be played Cars were set on fire during Monday's unrest in Belfast Police helped the fire service to deal with Monday night's blaze, which started at about 21:00 BST at the former credit union on Ross Road in west Belfast. A bus was also damaged on the Falls Road a few hours later. Supt Andrea McMullan said: ""I would like to reassure the public that police patrols across Belfast will be increased over the coming days in an effort to curb this violence. ""I would also call on those with influence in local communities to exert some control in an effort to dissuade any repetition of this behaviour."" The police said it assisted the fire service in dealing with the blaze She described the attacks as ""senseless and unacceptable"". ""It achieves nothing - creating only inconvenience, disruption and misery for the local community,"" she added. Youths attack police and cars in Belfast Council backs Sinn FÃ©in bonfires motion On Monday afternoon, three cars were destroyed after they were set on fire and five other vehicles were damaged by stones and paint in the Markets. Later in the evening about 100 young people, including children aged 12, gathered in the area. Alliance councillor Emmet McDonough-Brown described the scenes in Belfast as ""disgraceful"" and said they must be ""condemned in the strongest terms"". ""The responsibility for last night's behaviour rests solely with the people who carried it out,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster. Young people threw stones and damaged cars during Monday's unrest ""The agreement to remove materials was agreed by all parties and I think this is not the first test of the issue."" Sinn FÃ©in councillor Deirdre Hargey said residents in the Markets area were ""completely disgusted"" at the trouble. Debris remains on Ross Road in west Belfast ""They don't want this and those involved in this disgusting behaviour are not representative of this community,"" she added. Ms Hargey said she did not expect the level of anti-social behaviour and vandalism and did not believe it was ""completely linked"" to Belfast City Council's decision to tackle dangerous bonfires. ""There have been ongoing incidents and I think a large part of those who have been involved in incidents either in the Markets, or especially in Divis, are involved in vandalism every other day of the year,"" she added. ""They have just used this as an opportunity or an excuse to carry out this type of behaviour that they do every other day."" She said she was concerned that there were ""older, more sinister elements involved in trying to encourage younger people into this activity"", but did not think they were dissident republicans.

"The Pacific island of Guam is home to the US Air Force's Andersen air base North Korea has said it is considering carrying out missile strikes on the US Pacific territory of Guam. The North's official news agency said on Tuesday the plan involved firing medium-to-long-range rockets at Guam, where US strategic bombers are based. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, flying into Guam, said there was no imminent threat from North Korea. He also defended President Donald Trump, who on Tuesday threatened Pyongyang with ""fire and fury"". Mr Tillerson said that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un did not understand diplomatic language, and a strong message was needed that he would understand. ""I think the president just wanted to be clear to the North Korean regime that the US... will defend itself and its allies,"" he said. On Wednesday, Mr Trump tweeted that the US nuclear arsenal was ""more powerful than ever before"",but added,externalhe was hopeful ""we will never have to use this power"". The recent exchanges mark a sharp rise in rhetoric between Washington and Pyongyang, but China has urged calm. The North Korea crisis in 300 words Analysis: Where do we go after 'fire and fury'? 'Caught in the cross fire' - What's the mood on Guam right now? A foreign ministry statement quoted by Reuters called on all sides to avoid words or actions which might escalate the situation and to make greater efforts to resolve the issue via talks. The UN recently approved further economic sanctions on North Korea, which Pyongyang said were a ""violent violation of our sovereignty"", warning the US would ""pay a price"". This video can not be played President Trump threatened a response 'like the world has never seen' On Wednesday, the official KCNA news agency said North Korea was ""carefully examining the operational plan for making an enveloping fire at the areas around Guam"" using its domestically made medium-to-long-range Hwasong-12 missiles. What damage could N Korea do without nuclear weapons? Pyongyang releases Canadian pastor The news agency reported a military statement issued on Tuesday, which probably came in response to US military drills in Guam. However, there has been no indication that any attack on Guam by North Korea is imminent. In a message to the public,external, the governor of Guam Eddie Baza Calvo said there was currently ""no threat"" to the island and the Marianas archipelago, but that Guam was ""prepared for any eventuality"". North Korea's statement is the latest stage in a heating up of rhetoric and tension. Pyongyang,which has tested nuclear devices five times, launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in July, claiming it now had the ability to hit mainland US. Will North Korea nuclear threat focus minds? Can the US defend itself? Possible ways forward for the outside world On Tuesday, media reports in the US claimed the North had achieved its goal of making a nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside its missiles. This video can not be played North Korea's second intercontinental missile launched last month was ""seen from Japan"" While not confirmed, this was seen as one of the last obstacles to North Korea being a fully nuclear-armed state. A report in theWashington Post,external, citing US intelligence officials, suggested North Korea was developing nuclear weapons capable of hitting the US at a much faster rate than expected. A Japanese government defence white paper also said the weapons programme had ""advanced considerably"" and that North Korea possibly now had nuclear weapons. North Korea's missile programme explained In response, President Trump warned North Korea to stop threatening the US, saying they would be ""met with fire and fury like the world has never seen"". However, veteran US Senator John McCain was sceptical about Mr Trump's statement, saying he was""not sure that President Trump is ready to act"",external. On the streets of Seoul, barely 50km (30 miles) from the border with North Korea, the latest developments have drawn mixed reactions. Kim Seong-su, 62, said he thought Pyongyang was bluffing to preserve its regime and justify its nuclear programme. But others are more concerned. Yeon Eui-sook says she finds the situation scary. ""I hope everyone can live in peace. Kim Jong-un keeps doing this and making us worry,"" she said. Analysts say the language from Pyongyang always gets more aggressive in August, when the US and South Korea conduct joint military exercises. But this time - with a US president who also uses strong words - the confrontation is getting even fiercer than usual. North Korea had reacted angrily after the fresh sanctions were announced on Saturday by the UN, in an attempt to pressure it into giving up its nuclear ambitions. The sanctions aim to reduce North Korea's export revenues by a third. KCNA said North Korea would retaliate and make ""the US pay a price"" for drafting the new measures. It called the sanctions a ""violent violation of our sovereignty"", the news agency said. Meanwhile on Wednesday the UK Foreign Office said it would ""continue to work with the US and our international partners to maintain pressure on North Korea"". ""We have been consistently clear and forthright in our condemnation of North Korea's destabilising and illegal behaviour, including through support for UN Security Council resolutions to bring in sanctions that will limit North Korea's ability to pursue its nuclear weapons programme,"" a spokesman said. A spokesman for Germany's foreign ministry, quoted by AFP, said it was watching the situation ""with the greatest concern"" and called on all sides to use restraint. The 541sq km (209 sq miles) volcanic and coral island in the Pacific between the Philippines and Hawaii. It is a ""non-incorporated"" US territory, with a population of about 163,000. That means people born in Guam are US citizens, have an elected governor and House Representative, but cannot vote for a president in US national elections. US military bases cover about a quarter of the island. About 6,000 personnel are based there and there are plans to move in thousands more. It was a key US base in World War Two, and remains a vital staging post for US operations, giving access to potential flashpoints like theSouth China Sea,the Koreasand theTaiwan Straits.

"The lighthouse was installed nearby to where the June 2016 attack occured Walt Disney World has unveiled a lighthouse memorial for a young boy who was killed by an alligator while on holiday at the Florida theme park. Two-year-old Lane Thomas Graves had been playing in the sand near the resort's Seven Seas Lagoon when he was dragged underwater by the creature. His parents and older sister had been visiting the Grand Floridian resort in June 2016 from the state of Nebraska. The lighthouse has been installed near to where the attack occurred. Wildlife officials classified the killing as a predatory attack, saying the boy did nothing to provoke the alligator. Lane Thomas Graves' father tried in vain to free him from the jaws of the alligator ""He was in the water not more than ankle deep,"" the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said in a report, describing how the boy had been gathering water for a sandcastle. His father, Matt Graves, jumped in the water to try to pry open the creature's mouth, but ""the alligator thrashed and broke Matt's grasp and went under the water,"" according to the report. A Disney spokesperson said they hoped the monument would spread awareness for the Lane Thomas Foundation, which also uses the lighthouse as its logo. Who is liable for alligator boy's death? ""The lighthouse sculpture has been installed to help spread awareness of the Lane Thomas Foundation, which was established to provide assistance and support to families whose children need organ transplants,"" Walt Disney World said in a statement. After the death, Disney was criticised for not having posted signs warning of the danger along the man-made lagoon, which borders Magic Kingdom. Public notices have now been added to the area, Florida media report. The Lane family announced a month after the boy's death that they would not sue Disney, and would instead ""solely be focused on the future health of our family"".

Four men, five women and three children were found hidden among the tyres after a Border Force officer spotted a pair of legs sticking out. Harris, 28, admitted assisting unlawful immigration at Canterbury Crown Court. Harris and Bethel, who was a passenger in the van, will be sentenced on 11 September. Live: More on this story and other news from Kent The 28-year-old mother-of-four claimed she had no idea the migrants were in the vehicle. Mother-of-four Katy Bethel (left) had denied the charge She told Maidstone Crown Court she and Harris had gone on a day trip, looking for a beach, but had got lost and left the van by the roadside as they went for a walk. The prosecution accused her of talking ""nonsense"". A Border Force officer was alerted when he spotted a pair of legs sticking out of the tyres The jury heard that in the four hours the pair were in France, they sent and received 67 messages and calls to and from an unknown number. Bethel, of Dial Road, Gillingham in Kent, said Harris, the father of two of her children, was using her phone on the trip to make calls and texts and she was unaware of their contents. Katy Bethel claimed she had no idea the migrants were in the van The couple were returning from Calais to Folkestone when they were stopped by customs officers. Both were charged with aiding and abetting unlawful immigration. Harris had previously pleaded guilty to the charge.

"Muhammad, who was caught on CCTV, told airport staff he did not know why the device was in his case A man has been found guilty of trying to smuggle a pipe bomb on to a plane at Manchester Airport. The ""crude improvised explosive device"" was found in Nadeem Muhammad's luggage as he passed security on 30 January. There have been calls for an inquiry after police initially failed to detect the device was ""potentially viable"" and he was allowed to board a plane. Muhammad was found guilty of possessing explosives with intent to endanger life at Manchester Crown Court. This video can not be played Questions have been raised over police and airport security The 43-year-old, of Tinline Street, Bury, was born in Pakistan and holds an Italian passport. He was attempting to board a Ryanair flight to Bergamo in northern Italy when the item was discovered. He told airport officials that someone else had put it in his luggage. The court heard how he was questioned by police but not arrested. He then returned to the airport on 5 February and flew to Italy. Muhammad intended to detonate the explosive device on a Ryanair flight, the court heard A forensic examination of the device, which was made from batteries, wire, masking tape and a marker pen tube, later found it was ""potentially viable"", the jury was told. It was found to contain nitroglycerin and nitrocellulose, which led to Muhammad's home in Italy being searched. After being questioned by Italian police, he was released and boarded a flight back to the UK on 12 February. He was arrested by UK officers shortly after it landed. Muhammad wept as the majority verdict of 10 to two was given in court. Speaking after the hearing, GMP's Supt Graeme Openshaw said based on the ""overall circumstances"", officers ""determined that there was not sufficient evidence or suspicion to arrest [Muhammad] and place restrictions on his movement"". He said once the device had been properly examined, he was ""arrested at the first opportunity"". ""We accept there were some errors with our assessment of the device on the day and we have already reviewed our practices,"" he added. But councillor Pat Karney, of Manchester City Council, said: ""There's something about this that doesn't sit right. ""The airport say there's no problem, the police come out with the usual line about lessons learned but I just don't get the narrative that everything worked well. ""Greater Manchester Council owns the airport and I'll be writing to our councillors who have responsibility for the airport to ask them to demand a full inquiry."" It was a very small device, but if Muhammad had been sitting near the window, it would have blown a hole in the fuselage and possibly caused the severe depressurisation of the cabin. The oxygen masks would have dropped down, there would have been a few burst eardrums and it would have been very uncomfortable, but I don't think it would have actually blown the plane apart - it could probably have limped home and landed. But the point is these things shouldn't happen and there are lessons to be learned from this. What I cannot understand is that not only did the security officer take the device off Muhammad, he was later allowed to board an aircraft. The police and the airport security need to understand that in the current situation, you cannot afford for a moment to relax the rules, you must be really diligent. The Crown Prosecution Service's Sue Hemming said Muhammad's motive ""remains unknown"", adding: ""However, it is clear that the consequences, had he been successful, could have been disastrous."" Muhammad's trial also heard that after the airport terminal's security chief Deborah Jeffrey was made aware of the device, she put it in her pocket before passing it on to police. She told the court a swab had revealed no evidence of explosives, so she pocketed it so it ""wouldn't go missing"". A spokesman for Manchester Airport said the actions of staff had ""prevented a potentially dangerous item from being taken on board an aircraft"". ""In this instance, the actions of our security team led to the detection of a suspicious device [and] following its detection, our team handed the passenger and the device over to the police to investigate further,"" he said. Muhammad will be sentenced on 23 August.

"Older people's income has received a massive boost from private and workplace pensions in the last 40 years, official statistics show. In 1977, only 45% of retired households received income from a private pension, compared with 80% last year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. As a result, the income gap between those only getting the state pension and other pensioners had grown. Overall, incomes have grown faster for older people than for the young. The disposable income of retired households grew at 2.8% a year since 1977 after accounting for the rising cost of living and changes to household composition, compared with growth of 2.1% in non-retired households. State pension age rise brought forward Reality Check: How much does pensions triple lock cost? Can the UK afford the state pension? Much of the recent debate over a generational divide has centred on the future of the state pension and the fairness of its ""triple-lock"" guarantee of annual rises. This ensures an increase in line with earnings, inflation, or 2.5%. Thisreport by the ONS,externalinstead puts a spotlight on the effect of other forms of pension for household incomes, particularly revealing the benefits of final-salary pensions. Excluding the state pension, it shows that those with a private pension had average pre-tax income (also including wages and investment returns) of Â£19,000, which is 14 times higher than those who did not receive any private or workplace pension income. Adding the state pension and the effect of taxation cuts the gap. However, the disposable income of retired households with a private pension in 2016 was still Â£27,800 - higher than the Â£17,200 of those without a private pension. State pension calculator - check your age and entitlement,external Pension poverty was rife in the 1970s. The ONS said that four-fifths of retired households had an income that was the equivalent of less than Â£10,000 now. Only 4% of retired households now have an income of less than Â£10,000. Workplace and private pensions have been key to that shift, but so have pensioner benefits including the state pension. Anna Dixon, chief executive at the Centre for Ageing Better, said: ""We have seen a dramatic and necessary reduction in pensioner poverty since the 1970s. Being financially secure is a key part of a good later life. ""However, these averages mask inequalities. In particular, the growing disparity between those who have been able to save into a private pension and those who have not."" So, incomes in the last 40 years have grown thanks to final-salary pensions, yet the next generations of pensioners are unlikely to have access to this type of pension. Separate figures published on Tuesday show that final-salary pension funds were in a collective deficit of Â£180bn by the end of July. Instead of being linked to their salary, their pension is much more likely to depend on the success of how savings are invested. Automatic enrolment means that workers aged 22 and over and earning at least Â£10,000 are signed up to a workplace pension. By the end of March, nearly 7.7 million people had been automatically enrolled into a pension scheme. Patrick Bloomfield, of Hymans Robertson, said that this was a good platform for pensioners of the future, but it currently ensured ""thoroughly inadequate levels of saving"". He said politicians' eyes were open to the need to increase this saving, but he argued that the state pension age needed to go up, and working lives extended, as we were all living for longer. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ""It's welcome news that the disposable income of retired households is increasing, but there is still more to do to ensure that tomorrow's pensioners have the income they want in later life. ""We have reformed the state pension to make it simpler and fairer and thanks to the introduction of automatic enrolment, over eight million people are saving or putting away more into a workplace pension.""

"Douglas Waymark was taking part in the Enduroman Arch 2 Arc challenge A man has died during an attempt to swim the English Channel as part of a gruelling triathlon. Douglas Waymark, 44 from Cheltenham, got into difficulty about half way across, 12 nautical miles from Dover. The coastguard received a radio call from a support vessel at about 21:20 BST on Monday. A search and rescue helicopter arrived within 10 minutes and airlifted the swimmer to William Harvey Hospital in Ashford, but he later died. The endurance athlete had been taking part in the Enduroman arch to arc triathlon. The challenge aims to connects London and Paris by running, swimming and cycling. Paying tribute on its website, Enduroman said:  ""Our friend Douglas Waymark sadly passed away swimming to France during stage two of his Solo Arch to Arc. ""He touched our hearts with his strength, organisation and quiet humour. ""He had gained massive respect amongst all who knew him. The Enduroman community will miss him and will never forget him. ""#26 will rest with Doug."" The event organiser also tweeted a picture of two t-shirts bearing Mr Waymark's name and said: ""Unique T shirts made for a unique person. R.I.P Doug."" The triathlon starts with an 87 mile run from London's Marble Arch to Dover. Then athletes must swim across the English Channel to the French coast. Finally, they finish with a 181-mile bike ride from Calais to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. The Channel Swimming and Piloting Federation facilitated the swim. The swimmer was about half way through his attempt when he became unwell Secretary Kevin Murphy said: ""He was a supreme athlete, pushing himself to the absolute limits. ""He knew the dangers, but he was doing what he absolutely loved."" Mr Murphy, who has swum the channel 34 times, said everything was done to mitigate the risks. ""My understanding is that he was speaking to the people on the boat and then suddenly rolled over, inert in the water, and was pulled out. ""Everything possible was done to try and revive him. ""It happened suddenly, there was no opportunity to persuade him to come out of the water."" Mr Waymark's sister, Jo Ikel, posted a tribute on Facebook saying: ""Douglas Waymark has not completed his Channel swim. ""Last night he felt he could no longer continue his quest and swam to the boat supporting him. ""He passed out and was taken by helicopter to a hospital in Ashford. At around midnight, he sadly died. ""We are all devastated but take comfort in him doing what he loved best to the very end."" Mr Waymark posted about the event on his own Facebook page Mr Waymark, who was originally from Swansea, set off from Shakespeare beach at 07:27 BST but began to struggle later in the day. Updating followers on Mr Waymark's progress throughout, Enduroman tweeted he was given painkillers around 17:00 BST. Swimming across the tide, he missed a feed and Enduroman said ""he doubts but pushes on"". The last 50 positions of Mr Waymark, uploaded via a tracker, show him swimming across the tide, then turning back The last word on his progress came at 20:30 BST, saying he was swimming on through cooling temperatures and fading light. Mr Waymark's tracker regularly posted his position online and the last data visible between 21:09 and 21:38 BST showed he had turned around and was heading back towards Dover.

"Adrian Pogmore had admitted four charges of misconduct A ""sex-obsessed"" police officer who used his force helicopter to film people having sex has been jailed. ""Team deviant"" Adrian Pogmore admitted four charges of misconduct in a public office. He was jailed for a year. Two other officers and two pilots werecleared of misconductfollowing a three-week trial at Sheffield Crown Court. Pogmore, 51, from Whiston in Rotherham, was described as ""a swinging and sex-obsessed air observer"". Sentencing him, Judge Peter Kelson QC told Pogmore: ""You spied on and recorded these naked people from a height of 1,000ft. ""You quite literally considered yourself above the law."" Read more about this and other stories from across Yorkshire The judge described Pogmore as a ""rogue police officer"" whose actions had been ""offensive and invasive"". ""In short, you used a Â£2m helicopter which costs something like 1,000 dollars (sic) an hour to run to advance your own sexual curiosities when it should have been detecting crime,"" he said. ""Instead of deterring and detecting crime, you were committing crime. ""So strong were your sexual urges that you were willing to take, and did take, substantial risks of being detected by your colleagues in the helicopter at the time."" The intrusive filming took place on four occasions between 2007 and 2012 when Pogmore was part of the South Yorkshire Police Air Support Unit. The footage included a couple sitting naked by a caravan and a woman sunbathing naked with her daughters. A couple who Pogmore knew were also filmed having sex on their patio. The judge said his actions had severely damaged public confidence in the police. One of the women filmed by Pogmore said in her victim statement: ""If you can't trust the police, who can you trust?"" The filming took place between 2007 and 2012 Pogmore had been described in court by other members of the air support unit as the ""team deviant"". In mitigation, John Ryder QC, said there was a macho culture in the air support unit which he categorised as ""coarse locker room humour rather than anything more sinister"". He said the defendant had admitted what he had done and felt a ""strong sense of shame"". ""He fully appreciates the seriousness of his behaviour,"" he said. ""It was utterly irresponsible. It was thoughtless and foolish. But it was not motivated by anything more sinister than that."" The judge said he took account of Pogmore's 22-year police service, which included a number of commendations, and said he found it an ""immensely difficult"" sentencing exercise. But he said Pogmore's actions were a ""gross abuse"" of trust and he had to impose a prison term. He had already been sacked by South Yorkshire Police in 2015 following an internal misconduct hearing.

"The street, palm trees, and pathways of the elite Presidio Terrace now belong to someone else Residents of a San Francisco private street where homes sell for millions of dollars have had the street itself bought from under them. Presidio Terrace is now owned by two investors, Tina Lam and Michael Cheng, who snapped up the private road for about $90,000 (Â£69,039, â¬76,203). The street - parking, pathways and all - was sold by the city over a $14-a-year tax which went unpaid for decades. Wealthy residents say they knew nothing about the sale until it was done. The result is that residents no longer own the road, pavements, trees, or any of the common land - and might have to pay its new owners for parking. The terrace, an oval-shaped private compound, is seen as one of the expensive city's most prestigious addresses. Like other US municipalities, the City of San Francisco regularly auctions off properties that owners have failed to pay taxes on. According to the city's website, San Francisco advises bidders that all sales are final and so they must thoroughly inspect the property for any damage and consult local zoning rules. Because maintenance is the duty of owners, privately owned roads can save money for cities. However, some cities discourage the practice, out of concern that private owners might at some point require taxpayer dollars to keep roadways functioning. Owners become legally liable for any accident or injury that occurs due to lax upkeep, such as not clearing snow or repairing potholes. Number 24, recently for sale, was listed at $6.5m. Number 26, an ""exceptional residence"" on the southern slope, was listed for $14.5m. ""Among San Francisco's many prestigious communities, there are few that offer the privilege of privacy amid the magnificence of nature,"" reads the blurb on one property ad. The agency was keen to point out that ""stone privacy walls and a round-the-clock security guard provide peace of mind"". But despite the affluence of the neighbourhood, it didn't pay its taxes - and so the city sold it at auction for defaulting on a $944 tax debt. The auction took place in 2015,the San Francisco Chronicle reported,external, but residents didn't know about it - it took place in an online auction among a mix of properties. ""We just got lucky,"" Mr Cheng told the newspaper. He and Ms Lam outbid dozens of others to buy the street without seeing it - and are deciding what to do with their investment. ""We could charge a reasonable rent on it,"" he said of the 120 lucrative parking spaces that they now own. But some residents believe their new landlords may be looking to sell the street back - at a profit - to the locals who believe they should still own it. You may also be interested in: Airbnb challenges San Francisco over rental law US skaters and police clash in San Francisco In a twist, the street is now owned by two investors of Asian origin - despite originally being governed by a ""racial covenant"" which prevented anyone except Caucasian whites buying property there (a provision made illegal decades ago). Mr Cheng is originally from Taiwan, and Ms Lam from Hong Kong. Mr Cheng toldthe Mercury News,externalnewspaper that he was considering building a home for himself and Ms Lam on the street, if land use rules allow it. But now, homeowners are asking the city to reverse the sale, portraying the deal as a money-making ploy - one the residents had not heard of until May, almost two years after the auction. Scott Emblidge, a lawyer for the homeowners' association, claimed the street is ""owned and controlled by the association"" in a letter to city authorities. ""The association was shocked. The property management firm was not aware of any sale or of any taxes owed,"" he said. ""It is hard to understand why anyone would buy this property for any amount. But perhaps the explanation is provided by Ms Lam's subsequent attempt to get the association to 'buy back' their property from her,"" it said. The document also lays out an explanation for how the bizarre turn of events occurred, citing information gleaned from the tax collector's office. The small tax bill for the common area was sent ""for many years"" to an address at Kearny Street in the city - an address apparently unknown to any of Presidio Terrace's inhabitants or property managers, Mr Emblidge wrote. Since the bills were never received, no-one paid them. And no notice of an impending sale was posted on the street or delivered to any resident, he said. He argued the sale was unlawful, and requested a hearing to rescind the sale. But speaking tothe San Francisco Chronicle,external, a spokeswoman for the tax office said everything had been above board. ""Ninety-nine percent of property owners in San Francisco know what they need to do, and they pay their taxes on time - and they keep their mailing address up to date,"" she told the paper. Ms Lam, meanwhile, denied any intent to exploit the residents, and said the pair are in no hurry to sell up. ""I really just wanted to own something in San Francisco because of my affinity for the city,"" she said.

This essentially means that it's going to a long road towards the elective conference in December when the ANC will be electing a new leader to replace the beleaguered Mr Zuma. The question is whether he will survive the last two years of his presidency. Some here tell me that he will not complete his second term. But we have heard these threats before and we have written his political obituary before only for the 75-year-old president to re-emerge like a rising phoenix from the ashes. The ANC's chief whip Jackson Mthembu said the party was planning to look into disciplining those who had voted against the president, South Africa'sTimesLive,externalwebsite reported. But the rebels were praised by opposition leaders, who have repeatedly called for votes against the president. The Democratic Alliance's Mmusi Maimane - who earlier said the vote was one between ""right and wrong; between good and evil"" - told reporters: ""I applaud the courageous ANC people who moved across and said we will vote with our conscience and we will vote for change."" Julius Malema, leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters, said the vote had proved South Africa's democracy works - and warned Mr Zuma it proved they could unseat him. Mr Zuma is due to step down as head of the ANC in December, ahead of the 2019 general election. He has endorsed his ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma as his successor. Also vying for the leadership is Cyril Ramaphosa, a former trade unionist and one of South Africa's wealthiest politicians.

" The Premier League is 25 years old on 15 August 2017. To mark the anniversary, BBC Sport has produced five pieces, each covering a five-year period in the competition's history. This is the second piece, focusing on the span from 1997-98 to the end of the 2001-02 campaign. Scroll down for written insight, a visual timeline, Mark Lawrenson's team of the era, a tailored tactics board and tables, before testing yourself with our Merlin sticker quiz. Five years on from its initiation, the Premier League finally had a rivalry to define it. From 1992 to 1997, Manchester United had won their four championships by a total of 29 points. The only team to break their grip, Blackburn Rovers, finished the following season seventh. Now, with Arsene Wenger established at Highbury and talented compatriots - such as Patrick Vieira, Nicolas Anelka and Emmanuel Petit - flooding in with him, Alex Ferguson no longer had it all his own way. United would lose the title to Arsenal by a point in 1998 and win it back by the same margin in 1999. The two clubs would finish in the top two places in four successive years. Both men spent significant amounts of money in the transfer market, although it would be the relative bargains that sealed their greatest triumphs: Anelka, bought for £500,000 and sold for £22m, scoring the goal that sealed the 1998 Double, Arsenal's first in 27 years; Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, picked up for £1.5m, turning in the late, late goal that won United the 1999 Champions League final and an unprecedented Treble. There were rivalries within the rivalry - not least Roy Keane v Vieira - but the model of the two managers was not dissimilar: a bedrock of British talent, a dominant goalkeeper, a midfield that mixed grace with menace and the sort of pace up front that no-one else could match. The enforcers - clashes between Keane (left) and Vieira (right) epitomised the fierce rivalry between Manchester United and Arsenal If Ferguson could be considered fortunate to have David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and the Neville brothers all maturing together, and Wenger was lucky to inherit a defence built around Tony Adams, Steve Bould, Lee Dixon and Nigel Winterburn, both men maximised the gifts at their disposal. And neither was quite as blessed as Petit, who in the space of two months won the Double with Arsenal, scored the final goal as France won the World Cup on home soil and then bagged £17,000 on a fruit machine in a Monte Carlo hotel. He gave the last of those prizes to charity. Not all were so fortuitous. Tottenham's attempt to ape their rivals with a foreign maverick manager of their own began with Christian Gross waving a Travelcard and ended with him waving goodbye nine ugly months later. The gap between haves and have-lesses was becoming starker with every season; all three of the promoted teams in 1997 were relegated a year later. Money was changing the game and changing players' outlooks. Somewhere in the mid-1990s, footballers stopped collecting the greatest hits of Phil Collins and Rod Stewart, and started getting into the sort of music most men of their age liked. While some stayed traditional (David Unsworth and his love of John Secada), you could go to the house of David James and be shown his Technics decks, even if he seldom used them. Nottingham Forest striker Paul McGregor formed a Britpop band called Merc. Michael Duberry would eulogise about the beats and voice of R&B producer Keith Sweat. Early in the Premier League's lifespan, Nottingham Forest midfielder Ian Woan had spent his summer break with his wife in her native USA. When two team-mates had joined them on the beach in old-fashioned 1980s-style swimming trunks, the Americans wearing board shorts and Bermudas had looked on in astonishment. By the late 1990s, footballers had gone from such fashion faux-pas to the catwalks. Dean Holdsworth modelled for Topman, his Wimbledon team-mate Stewart Castledine for DKNY, even if Chris Perry and Peter Fear did not get the call. Robbie Savage got a tattoo of the Armani logo. He has now had it removed. Glamour came to unlikely places. Bolton, who had started the decade at a ground old enough to have featured in a Lowry painting and low-key enough to have a supermarket behind one of the goals, saw global superstars such as Jay-Jay Okocha, Ivan Campo and Youri Djorkaeff strutting around their new 29,000 all-seater Reebok Stadium. Not all overseas signings were such a success. While the big wages and high hopes of Premier League owners had already seen Andrea Silenzi and Tomas Brolin stink out Forest and Leeds respectively, the flops kept coming as the money piled up. Before Zola, Di Canio and Vialli there was Andrea Silenzi - the first Italian to play in the Premier League Spurs chairman Alan Sugar called them ""Carlos Kickaballs"". Blackburn fans had other names for Corrado Grabbi, Aston Villa supporters choice words for Bosko Balaban. Some big names arrived and then never appeared, defender Winston Bogarde emblematic of a new sort of ambition: earning as much as you could while training and playing only for the reserves. Big names began to fall. Manchester City dropped to the third tier, Forest to the second. Sheffield Wednesday sank, yet to return, and Leeds - Peter Ridsdale's rented goldfish and all - were beginning a precipitous decline that would take them from the semi-finals of the Champions League towards insolvency. The audience was changing too, moving upmarket, getting older, becoming more corporate. Keane talked darkly of the prawn sandwich brigade. Players’ lifestyles moved with the times: the end of the old Tuesday Club at Arsenal, when the team would turn up for training in suits, the quicker to be out on the town later that day and filling their boots with beer; the disgust on Paolo di Canio’s face when the West Ham coach stopped off at a fish and chip shop on the way back south from an evening kick-off. The more significant move at Old Trafford came in 2002, when Ferguson changed his mind about retirement and signed on for more. If it was bad news for some of his players, it was worse yet for the club's rivals. Ferguson was only just getting started. 20 November 1997:Eyebrows are raised when Tottenham appoint Christian Gross to replace Gerry Francis, and the former Grasshoppers boss raises a smile when he arrives at his unveiling by underground, holds up his Travelcard and tells fans: “I want this to become my ticket to the dreams!” Spurs lose 6-1 to Chelsea in his second home game in charge and he is sacked three games into the next season. 17 January 1998:Georgian striker Temuri Ketsbaia produces the Premier League’s angriest celebration when he removes his shirt and kicks the advertising boards after scoring a late winner in Newcastle’s 2-1 victory over Bolton Wanderers. 14 March 1998:Manchester United entered March 11 points clear at the top of the Premier League, with their nearest contenders Arsenal having three games in hand. A solitary Marc Overmars goal sees Arsenal beat United at Old Trafford to swing the title race back in the Gunners' favour. Arsene Wenger's side go on to win the Double. 20 August 1998:Manchester United pay a club record £12.6m for Aston Villa striker Dwight Yorke. Yorke had demanded the transfer, with Aston Villa boss John Gregory saying: ""If I had had a gun I would have shot him."" Alex Ferguson had spotted something in Yorke, who plays his best football in tandem with fellow striker Andy Cole as United go on to win the Treble. 26 September 1998:Sheffield Wednesday striker Paolo di Canio reacts very badly to being shown a red card in a home fixture with Arsenal by pushing referee Paul Alcock. The official makes the moment even more memorable by tumbling comically to the turf. Italian Di Canio is fined £10,000 and banned for 11 games. 2 August 1999:Arsenal sell French striker Nicolas Anelka to Real Madrid for £22.3m - the highest fee involving a British club at the time. A day later, they re-invest £11m of that in Thierry Henry. It is a good move as Henry goes on to score 175 league goals for the Gunners. 17 November 1999:Arsenal announce plans to move to a new 60,000-seat stadium at Ashburton Grove, near Highbury - their home since 1913. The Gunners move into Emirates Stadium in 2006. 6 May 2000:Striker Kevin Phillips scores 30 league goals for Sunderland as they finish seventh in the Premier League. Phillips is the first, and remains the only, English player to win the European Golden Shoe award for the top scorer in Europe. 9 November 2000:Manchester United captain Roy Keane hits out at sections of the club's support for the poor home atmosphere they produce. “They have a few drinks and probably the prawn sandwiches, and they don't realise what's going on out on the pitch,"" he says. His mood is brightened as United claim a third straight title the following May. 23 November 2000:Leeds break the English transfer record by paying £18m for West Ham centre-back Rio Ferdinand. The England international would make another record move in July 2002, joining Manchester United for £29.1m. 16 December 2000:Paolo's redemption. Now a West Ham player, Di Canio catches the ball in the Everton box to end a Hammers attack after Toffees goalkeeper Paul Gerrard is grounded outside the box by an injury. The gesture, coming 811 days after the Italian's push on referee Alcock earns him Fifa's fair play award. 1 April 2001:Roy Keane deliberately fouls and inflicts a knee injury on Alf Inge Haaland in the Manchester derby. The injury ultimately ends Haaland’s career. Keane later admits in his autobiography that the foul was revenge for Haaland claiming Keane was faking injury when the Manchester United skipper damaged his cruciate ligament tackling the Norwegian in 1997. 3 July 2001:England defender Sol Campbell leaves Tottenham and crosses north London to join Arsenal on a free transfer after his Spurs contract expires. Tottenham fans react angrily towards Campbell, who goes on to win two Premier League titles and three FA Cups at the Gunners before moving to Portsmouth in 2006. 28 February 2002:Sir Alex Ferguson changes his mind about retiring as Manchester United manager at the end of the season and signs a new contract which will keep him at the club for at least another three seasons. United finish the season in third as Arsenal take the title. 12 July 2001:Argentina midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron joins Manchester United for a British record fee of £28.1m. Veron is a disappointment during his two years at Old Trafford before he leaves to join Chelsea in 2003. Built with Shorthand",Positive,0.8115985
"These students in Lahore are learning the officially approved version of Pakistan's history As Pakistan and India turn 70, those who were there for the birth of the two nations are getting old. At least two civil groups are racing against time to document as much of their oral history as possible for future generations. At a government-run school inside the historical Walled City of Lahore, a teacher lectures a class of 14-year-olds on the creation of Pakistan. ""Muslims were the rulers of this land, but they lost power to the British. They were then oppressed by both the British and the Hindus,"" Allah Rakha tells his class of 30 or so students. ""Hindus and Muslims are like fire and water. Their lifestyles and belief systems are totally incompatible,"" he says. To illustrate his point, he comes up with an example: ""Hindus rinse themselves in cow urine because they consider it sacred. For us, that is disgusting. For us, a cow is a Halal animal. ""So when the British were being driven out of India, Muslims said: 'We cannot be left at the mercy of the vile Hindu majority'. They said: 'We are two different nations and we need two separate countries'."" Allah Rakha teaches his students that Hindus and Muslims have incompatible lifestyles Allah Rakha has been teaching this officially approved version of history for well over 30 years. He gets particularly animated when he talks about the mass violence and chaos at the time of India's Partition in 1947. ""Muslims were raped and killed by Hindus. They were driven out of their homes. Their babies were thrown in rivers of blood,"" he tells his captivated young audience. A product of Pakistan's government education system, Allah Rakha firmly buys into the religiously inspired one-sided official narrative. It paints Muslims as victims and a Hindu-dominated India as their existential enemy, then and now. Schoolchildren in Pakistan are generally discouraged, even punished, for asking questions. And so, in all these years, it has never occurred to Allah Rakha that as a small part of the state's distorted security paradigm, he may have been doing a great disservice to young Pakistanis by sowing the seeds of religious hatred in their impressionable minds. To be clear, there was plenty of religious violence in 1947. But it wasn't one-sided. Muslims were victims but they were also perpetrators of killings and lootings of Sikhs and Hindus. All three major communities were guilty of appalling atrocities. Perhaps the biggest movement of people in history, outside war and famine. Two newly-independent states were created - India and Pakistan. About 12 million people became refugees. Between half a million and a million people were killed in religious violence. Tens of thousands of women were abducted. This article is part of a BBC series looking at Partition 70 years on. Read more: Partition 70 years on: The turmoil, trauma - and legacy The friendship that survived the division of a nation Cyril Radcliffe: The man who drew the partition line Special report: Partition - 70 years on Syed Afzal Haider, a retired judge, was 16 at the time. He recalls the scene outside the Lahore Railway Station. ""Nobody was on the road except for the army and the police officers. I found members of different communities, Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs, stabbed, lying on the street, and the stray dogs moving among them,"" he said. ""That was a very pitiable situation that human corpses are being treated like this by the animals."" Partition left hundreds of thousands dead as communities turned on each other, as here in Amritsar, and millions fled as refugees Syed Afzal Haider recalls seeing victims of all communities lying dead in the road Mr Haider is among the first generation of Pakistani citizens with an authentic personal account of those tumultuous events. His detailed testimony is now part of a US-based oral history project called the1947 Partition Archive.,external Starting in 2010, the digital archive project has so far collected 4,500 testimonies, making it the largest oral history project from South Asia. Partition was a seismic event. It affected millions of lives at the time and continues to shape the experiences of 1.6 billion people in South Asia. ""Other nations have been documenting the Holocaust, World War Two and the US bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima for decades,"" says Dr Guneeta Singh Bhalla, the founder of the project. ""Our region woke up to it a bit late but we are getting there."" The project started by crowd sourcing witness interviews through volunteers. Dr Bhalla likes to call them ""citizen historians"". ""Our youngest volunteer is 13 and eldest is 87. We offer them free online training. We empower them to start by documenting testimonies of family and relatives,"" she told me over the phone from California. Today, the 1947 Partition Archive has a global reach, with contributions collected from 12 countries, including US, Spain, Israel, Australia and Hong Kong. This treasure trove of citizen's voices comes in 22 languages, though much of it is in Urdu, Hindi, Punjabi, Bangla and other regional languages of the subcontinent. The digital project has recently partnered with Stanford University to make its audiovisual material available for online streaming. In Pakistan, it is collaborating with Habib University, a Liberal Arts University in Karachi and Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) to host their material locally for researchers, academics and journalists. Similar collaboration is under way with universities in India. Aaliyah Tayyebi says people can tell uplifting stories but rarely admit a role in the violence Aaliyah Tayyebi, senior project manager of a separate oral history project atCitizen Archive of Pakistan (CAP),external, says it is ""an emotional experience to listen to people dip into some of those difficult and sometimes forgotten memories"". ""For many, it's simply overwhelming. Some invariably broke down,"" she says. Set up in 2007 by Pakistan's Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker, Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy, CAP has collected more than 2,000 testimonies of people who endured the upheaval of 1947. ""When you listen to people who experienced partition first hand, a different kind of narrative emerges,"" says Aaliyah Tayyebi. ""It's much more personal and often vastly different from the officially-approved established narrative allowed in our history books."" But that doesn't mean it is always accurate. Researchers rarely come across those who perpetrated violence. ""When I talk to people about violence or riots, it's interesting that nobody ever talks about their involvement or their role in it,"" she says. ""Nobody ever says, yes, I went out and I killed people or I burned down houses or I was responsible for pushing my neighbours out because of their religion."" But it's not all grim, she says. Partition certainly brought out the worst in some people. But it also brought out the best among those who had together lived in peace as neighbours. ""We do get some amazing stories of solidarity, where people stick up for their terrified neighbours and provide them shelter; where they went out of their way to welcome refugees."" It's true that in South Asia, governments have been ambivalent about coming to terms with their violent past and preserving their shared heritage. But as she points out, it's too important a task to be left to the governments. And that's why grassroots citizen initiatives to document history from the perspective of the people who witnessed it become all the more significant.

"The claim:The UK sends Â£156m a week to Brussels. Reality Check verdict:The UK actually sent Â£252m a week to the EU in 2016 after the rebate had been deducted, some of which was spent on projects in the UK. On Monday, the Press Association (PA) wrote some analysis of Treasury data showing that the UK's weekly net contribution to the EU Budget in the past financial year was Â£156m, the lowest since 2011-12. Tuesday's i newspaper and several online publications compared that figure with the Â£350m a week that Vote Leave claimed the UK sent to the EU every week in 2014. But that is confusing the levels of contribution at different stages of the process. The figures used by PA came from a Treasury analysis published last month calledPublic Expenditure Statistical Analyses 2017 or Pesa for short,external- it's table C.1. The figure of Â£156m is what you get if you take the gross contribution and subtract the rebate and the amount spent by the EU on funding things in the UK such as supporting farmers and regional aid. So that's not, as the i and other headlines suggested, what we send to Brussels each week - it's what we send to Brussels minus some of what is spent in the UK. The Â£350m figure was also not what we sent to Brussels each week because the UK's rebate is deducted before the money is sent - the correct figure in 2014 for the amount sent was Â£276m a week.We covered this extensively at the time. Also, the Pesa figures cover financial years, unlike the calendar-year figures used in the referendum debate. PA described the Pesa figures as being the first figures to be published covering contributions during the period of the referendum in June 2016. That is also not correct. The figures for the calendar year 2016 werepublished in February,external- it's table 3.3. The weekly figure for the amount after the rebate has been deducted was actually Â£252m a week in 2016, down from Â£276m in 2014. That was indeed the lowest figure since 2012. From that, we can say that the comparable figure with the Â£350m for 2016 was Â£327m (although actually the 2014 figure wasn't Â£350m - Vote Leave rounded down from Â£361m).

"Are the days of airline pilots numbered? How comfortable would you feel getting on a pilotless plane? That is the question millions of people may have to ask themselves in the future if they want to jet off on holiday around the world. As we move closer to a world of driverless cars, which have already been on the road in some US cities and have also been tested in London, remotely controlled planes may be the next automated mode of transport. Plane manufacturer Boeing plans to test them in 2018. A survey by financial services firm UBS suggests that pilotless aircraft not be too popular, however, with 54% of the 8,000 people questioned saying they would be unlikely to take a pilotless flight. The older age groups were the most resistant with more than half of people aged 45 and above shunning the idea. Only 17% of those questioned said they would board such a plane, with more young people willing to give them a try and the 25 to 34 age group the most likely to step on board. One of the biggest debating points around the introduction of the planes is safety. While flying is generally regarded as one of the safest forms of travel, the UBS report suggested that pilotless planes would make it even more secure. It found that around 70% to 80% of the accidents that do occur are the result of human error, with crew fatigue responsible for 15% to 20% of those. However, Steve Landells, the British Airline Pilots Association's (Balpa) flight safety specialist, said: ""We have concerns that in the excitement of this futuristic idea, some may be forgetting the reality of pilotless air travel. ""Automation in the cockpit is not a new thing - it already supports operations. However, every single day pilots have to intervene when the automatics don't do what they're supposed to. ""Computers can fail, and often do, and someone is still going to be needed to work that computer."" It is also clear that if pilotless planes were to become the norm, then military levels of security both inside the plane and in communications would be vital. Acceptance of the concept would also be crucial to its success. Jarrod Castle, UBS's head of business services, leisure and travel research, told the BBC: ""It is a question of public perception and people being comfortable with the idea. ""Clearly a seven-hour flight carrying 200 to 300 people would be the last part of the evolution but we also feel that machines can gradually take over and then reduce the number of pilots in the cockpit from two to one over time."" Would you fly in a pilotless airliner? Drone technology used for pilotless fighter aircraft Will you need a driving licence in the age of self-driving cars? Driverless cars trial set for UK motorways in 2019 Watch: Driverless cars tested on London's roads CÃ©line Fornaro of UBS added: ""The smaller the plane and amount of passengers, the more realistic it is to see this. ""It is not just our view, companies like Airbus are trying to get into this world where you could have small helicopters carrying two or three people unmanned."" Air transport consultant John Strickland believes pilotless planes could definitely become a reality, as long as certain hurdles are overcome. ""It is conceivable but would be some way off in the future,"" he told the BBC. ""There would have to be an overall focus on safety and there would be a psychological barrier to get over to win the public's trust. ""We step on monorails at airports and travel in some driverless trains and cars, but the whole psychology of being in the air and not having humans at the front is quite a challenge."" UBS says airlines could save more than $26bn (Â£20bn) in pilot costs by introducing pilotless aircraft and added that such a move would save the business jet industry up to $3bn and civil helicopters about $2.1bn. More than $3bn would also be saved in lower insurance premiums and there would be chances of extra revenue from increased numbers of cargo and commercial flights.

"Sean Hannity taped a segment for his Fox show with Sean Spicer in January Did Fox News collude with the Trump administration to spread a malicious lie? That is the explosive allegation behind a lawsuit filed by Rod Wheeler, a former Fox contributor and police investigator. The story is complicated. Seth Rich was an ambitious 27-year-old who worked for the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Last summer he was murdered in Washington in what police think was a botched robbery attempt. Surfing the tide of social media in the most febrile atmosphere Washington has known for decades, Sean Hannity of Fox News promoted a conspiracy theory about the death. He claimed Rich was assassinated because he had shared classified information from Hillary Clinton's campaign with the website WikiLeaks. This theory was taken up by Alex Jones of InfoWars, and former House speaker for the Republicans, Newt Gingrich. Fox News retracted its story linking the death of Seth Rich to the leak of information to WikiLeaks Gingrich went on Fox News to say: ""It wasn't the Russians [who hacked the DNC's emails]. It was this young guy who was disgusted by the corruption of the DNC"". Why would Hannity and Gingrich advance this view? To hurt the reputation of Hillary Clinton and distract attention from claims that the Trump White House was in cahoots with Vladimir Putin's Kremlin. Fox News later retracted the story with the admission that the story was not ""subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting"". Hannity only abandoned his pursuit of the conspiracy when Rich's parents asked that their son's name not be continuously dishonoured. All this would be shocking enough, frankly, but things are so far gone in Trump's Washington that this story has inevitably developed further still. Wheeler's lawsuit alleges that Sean Spicer, former spokesman to the president, not only knew about Fox's story, but shared it with the president - who encouraged Fox to run with it. This despite the fact that on the day of publication - 16 May - Spicer told journalists he was ""not aware"" of it. Ed Butowsky, a Republican donor and Fox contributor, sent Rod Wheeler a text message saying: ""Not to add any more pressure but the President just read the article. He wants the article out immediately. It's now all up to you."" Butowsky says this text message was a joke. All the defendants in this case vehemently deny Wheeler's allegations. They are: 21st Century Fox; Fox News Channel, Fox News reporter Malia Zimmerman; and Ed Butowsky. This video can not be played The cartoons capturing the imagination of Trump's conservative base Donald Trump, media saviour Trump and the media - Is it war or love? Whether funny or not, and whatever the veracity of the allegations, we can already conclude the following. First, Spicer appears to have been confused or economical with the truth. The first rule of working in communications is - don't lie.  Spicer may have had the toughest job of any press officer in history; but he has now admitted to meeting Butowsky and Wheeler on 20 April, when he was informed of the story, so his plea of ignorance on 16 May is demonstrably false. Second, by any professional or moral standards, the exploitation by Fox News of a 27-year-old's death to seed a now widely-shared conspiracy theory, on the basis of zero evidence, is a disgrace. Third, we have re-confirmed how modern media works. Fox News is an enabler of alternative news media. The way broadcasting works is, you need pictures and sound to tell stories. With Fox devoting resources and so much airtime to the theories surrounding the murder of Seth Rich, the likes of Jones's InfoWars had plenty of material to work with. But there is one respect in which I don't share the shock of other journalists at this story - the fact that Spicer was informed of it. Obviously if he was economical with the truth that is a different matter. However, it is in the nature of political journalism that government apparatchiks develop close links, and spend time with, friendly journalists and media outlets. This happens all the time in Britain too, of course. Political journalists will patronise the pubs of Westminster with special advisers and ministers. They develop a certain intimate reciprocity. It's a form of clientism - gossip, tidbits and genuine revelations are shared on the understanding that favourable coverage may be received in return. And yes, prime ministers have been known to encourage advisers to encourage journalists to take a particular line. Put like that, it sounds seedy, doesn't it? Of course, many of the greatest political journalists are those who have nothing whatsoever to do with this kind of clientism. Yet in the normal course of events, it is unsurprising that Trump's press spokesman would have been told of various stories that Fox was cooking up. After all, as Republican David Frum once put it: ""Republicans originally thought that Fox worked for us, and now we're discovering we work for Fox."" Perhaps, if he were a man of immense moral standing, Spicer would have said at that 20 April meeting with Butowsky that it's not the business of journalists to spread pernicious falsehoods. Who knows, maybe he did. Is this collusion, as pundits everywhere are suggesting? As so often, the etymology is instructive. ""Collusion"" comes from the Latin for ""col"", meaning ""together"" and ""ludere"", meaning ""to play"". Hannity promoted a conspiracy theory about the death of 27-year old Seth Rich Republicans and Fox News play and work together all the time. If you want an example of collusion as in playing together, rather than alight on Spicer being kept informed about various Fox conspiracies, look at the comically sycophantic chat Hannity conducted with Donald Trump Junior about hismeeting with a Russian lawyer,external. Granted the chance to interrogate the president's son about contacts with foreign individuals seeking to influence the election of the most powerful person in the world, Hannity forfeited the chance to do a proper interrogation, playing the role of the supportive activist instead. Fox News may boast of the ""high degree of editorial scrutiny"" they apply, but this conversation - let's not call it an interview - was wholly devoid of journalistic rigour, and designed to get the president's son out of a hole. That's closer to my understanding of ""collusion"". Hannity starts the interview with: ""I will ask him every single question I can think of."" On the basis of what followed, and his insult to the memory of Seth Rich, Hannity isn't much of a thinker. Trump and the media - Is it war or love? Drawing cartoons for Trump's America.

"This video can not be played Ubrique is beautiful but remote The town of Ubrique in southern Spain is beautiful but remote. It doesn't have an airport or a train station and even buses are irregular. Its position, nestled at the bottom of a valley surrounded by big hills, means the easiest way to get there is by car. But even then drivers have to navigate winding and often steep roads. The town is around 75 miles south of Seville, nowhere near the world's fashion capitals of Milan, Paris, New York or London. Yet this collection of whitewashed houses, known as a pueblo blanco (white town) in Spanish, is where many of the top fashion brands source their leather goods. Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Hermes, Chanel, Chloe, Loewe and Carolina Herrera are all reported to use the artisans here to make things such as handbags, wallets and belts. The factory workers can't talk about the brands they produce goods for Yet almost none of these designers is willing to talk about it. Most of the secrecy comes from the fear of someone using the high end designs to produce cheap copycat products, a costly problem for luxury retailers. Juan Antonio Sanchez, manager at leather goods manufacturer Ranchel, says the big brands often have strict demands. ""We have to sign a contract of confidentiality, then the factory, the manager and every worker have to sign it. ""They have an individual contact and they cannot take pictures, they cannot take the designs or anything to do with the products,"" he explains. Mr Sanchez's firm, which was started by his father, has now been making leather items for over forty years. But the town's specialisation in leather goes back much further than this. Ubrique's focus on leather goes back centuries It started more than 200 years ago, initially with tanning leather. Eventually this evolved into the precise leatherwork which the town has become so well known for. Now the leather is bought in from elsewhere, already tanned and those in Ubrique focus on the more skilled manufacturing work. Today more than half the town's residents work in the leather trade, producing the majority of leather goods sold in the country as well as supplying many big overseas fashion houses. The techniques needed to produce such goods at the top end of the quality scale has been passed down from generation to generation. Mr Sanchez says most in the town learn these skills when they're young by watching their parents as they work. ""That technique it can only go from father to son, because it's very specialised. Kind of they have it in their blood,"" says Mr Sanchez. Many of the factories refuse to use an assembly line to speed up the manufacturing process It's these kind of skills, honed over generations,  which have drawn in the big brand names. Word of mouth is often how designers have found out about Ubrique. Jose Urrutia, founder of high end shoe and accessories firm La Portegna, says an acquaintance told him about the town. ""I asked them for some samples and I was blown away by the quality of the stuff they made,"" he says. For Mr Urrutia the town's history and the way the trade has been passed on through generations is also part of the attraction, because it helps him create a story around his brand. He says the idea for the firm came from his grandmother - a keen traveller who'd  befriended the writer Ernest Hemingway on her exotic round-the-world trips. Jose Urrutia says this kind of craftmanship is dying out Browsing her photos made Mr Urrutia nostalgic for a bygone era when items were special and treasured. He wanted to try and create the same feeling with his company's products. ""In Ubrique what they're very good at is helping you because they have tons of experience. They've been doing this for centuries."" He says this kind of slow but precise artisanship is dying out and increasingly hard to find elsewhere. ""The whole concept of craftmanship is dying. The beautiful thing about this place is that it's not just one street or a couple of houses. It's an entire village."" He acknowledges that he could find cheaper, larger manufacturers elsewhere, but says that's not the point. ""There's always been a notion of the economies of scale but that doesn't work that well here. A good bag needs x amount of hours. You can't cheat your way into it."" While some of the factories here have started to use an assembly line to speed up the manufacturing process, many have refused to compromise. Some in the town believe there should be a ""Made in Ubrique"" label Jorge Oliva Perez, general manager at local leather brand El Potro says a single worker still makes the entire bag, bar the cutting and the design. ""It's very important to hold onto these skills,"" says Jorge. Like many of those working here, Jorge would like this expertise officially recognised with  - a ""Made in Ubrique"" label. ""I think it's very important for our future,"" he says. The town's artisans are having to compete with cheaper rivals elsewhere It could also help the town with the ever present threat of cheaper rivals moving into their territory. It's already happened once. Around  a decade ago - at about the time of the financial crisis -  the manufacturers here suffered a dramatic drop in orders. Many of the big brands had decided to cut costs by switching supplier - in most cases shifting orders to China or elsewhere in Asia. While orders from cheaper brands continued, there was less work overall which meant some people lost their jobs and went into other industries. The fact the products are handmade means each one is subtly different Nonetheless, Ubrique's councillor for culture Jose Manuel Fernadez Rivera says most workers ""kept working because they knew that their quality was better and they were going to come back"". It turned out to be true. A year later, most of the big brands had returned. ""The Chinese learn very fast but we know that the quality, the detail that we give in every piece, which is what the brands ask for, they're not going to get that,"" he says. The other issue that drove the brands to return to a European manufacturer, was that a bag made in Asia was a tough sell to some of their biggest customers - those living in Hong Kong, China and Singapore. When they're paying hundreds, or in some cases thousands of euros, to buy a bag from a top Italian and French designer then they expect it to be made there not in their home country. And of course they also expect that artisan touch. ""In this business you have to work with your hands. Every product is different because you do it one by one,"" says Mr Sanchez.

"Late in 1876, so the story goes, a young man named John Warne Gates built a wire-fence pen in the middle of San Antonio, Texas. He rounded up some of the toughest and wildest longhorns in all of Texas. That's how he described them. Others say the cattle were a docile bunch. And there are those who wonder whether this particular story is true at all. But never mind. John Warne Gates - who would become known as ""Bet A Million Gates"" - took bets from onlookers as to whether the powerful beasts could break through the fragile-seeming wire. They couldn't. John Warne Gates was quick to see the potential of barbed wire in redefining the US landscape Even when Gates's sidekick, a Mexican cowboy, charged at the cattle howling Spanish curses and waving a burning brand in each hand, the wire held. Bet-A-Million Gates was selling a new kind of fence, and the orders soon came rolling in. The advertisements of the time touted it as ""The Greatest Discovery Of The Age"", patented by Joseph Glidden, of De Kalb Illinois. Gates described it more poetically: ""lighter than air, stronger than whiskey, cheaper than dust"". We simply call it barbed wire. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Calling it the greatest discovery of the age might seem hyperbolic, even allowing for the fact that the advertisers didn't know Alexander Graham Bell was about to be awarded a patent for the telephone. But while we accept the telephone as transformative, barbed wire wrought huge changes on the American West, and much more quickly. Joseph Glidden's design for barbed wire wasn't the first, but it was the best. Joseph Glidden's barbed wire would make his fortune Glidden's design is recognisably modern. The wicked barb is twisted around a strand of smooth wire, then a second strand of smooth wire is twisted together with the first to stop the barbs from sliding around. American farmers snapped it up. There was a reason they were so hungry for it. A few years earlier, President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Homestead Act of 1862. The act specified that any honest citizen - including women, and freed slaves - could lay claim to up to 160 acres (0.6 sq km) of land in America's western territories. All they had to do was build a home there and work the land for five years. The 1862 Homestead Act set out the rules on who could own land in the western territories It sounds simple. But the prairie was a vast and uncharted expanse of tall, tough grasses, a land suitable for nomads, not settlers. It had long been the territory of the Native Americans. After Europeans arrived and pushed west, the cowboys roamed free, herding cattle over the boundless plains. But settlers needed fences, not least to keep those free-roaming cattle from trampling their crops. And there wasn't a lot of wood - certainly none to spare for fencing in mile after mile of what was often called ""The American Desert"". Farmers tried growing thorn-bush hedges, but they were slow-growing and inflexible. Smooth wire fences didn't work either - the cattle simply pushed through them. Barbed wire changed what the Homestead Act could not. By the end of the Civil War, in 1865, 15,000 homestead claims had been established Until it was developed, the prairie was an unbounded space, more like an ocean than a stretch of arable land. Private ownership of land wasn't common because it wasn't feasible. Barbed wire also sparked ferocious disagreements. The homesteading farmers were trying to stake out their property - property that had once been the territory of various Native American tribes. No wonder those tribes called barbed wire ""the devil's rope"". The old-time cowboys also lived on the principle that cattle could graze freely across the plains - this was the law of the open range. The cowboys hated the wire: cattle would get nasty wounds and infections. When the blizzards came, the cattle would try to head south. Sometimes they got stuck against the wire and died in their thousands. Other cowmen adopted barbed wire, using it to fence off private ranches. And while barbed wire could enforce legal boundaries, many fences were illegal - attempts to commandeer common land for private purposes. As the wire's dominion spread, fights started to break out. The settlers' barbed wire fences inflamed tensions with Native Americans In the ""fence-cutting wars"", masked gangs such as the Blue Devils and the Javelinas cut the wires and left dire threats warning fence-owners not to rebuild. There were shootouts and some deaths. Eventually, the authorities clamped down. The fence-cutting wars ended, The barbed wire remained. ""It makes me sick,"" said one trail driver in 1883, ""when I think of onions and Irish potatoes growing where mustang ponies should be exercising and where four-year-old steers should be getting ripe for market."" And if the cowboys were outraged, the Native Americans suffered much more. These ferocious arguments on the frontier were reflected in a philosophical debate. The English 17th Century philosopher John Locke - a great influence on the founding fathers of the United States - puzzled over the problem of how anybody might legally come to own land. Once upon a time, nobody owned anything. Philosopher John Locke had a great influence on the founding fathers of the United States Locke argued that we all own our own labour. And if you mix your labour with the land that nature provides - for example, by ploughing the soil - then you've blended something you definitely own with something that nobody owns. By working the land, you've come to own it. Nonsense, said Jean-Jacques Rousseau, an 18th Century philosopher from Geneva who protested against the evils of enclosure. In his Discourse on Inequality, he lamented ""the first man who, having enclosed a piece of ground, bethought himself of saying, 'This is mine,' and found people simple enough to believe him."" This man, said Rousseau, ""was the real founder of civil society"". He did not intend that as a compliment. But it's certainly true that modern economies are built on the legal fact that most things - including land and property -  have an owner, usually a person or a corporation. The ability to own private property also gives people an incentive to invest in and improve what they own - whether that's a patch of land in the American Midwest, or an apartment in the Indian city of Kolkata (Calcutta), or even a piece of intellectual property such as the rights to Mickey Mouse. The warrior monks who invented banking How the invention of paper changed the world Why the falling cost of light matters The great intellectual property trade-off It's a powerful argument - and it was ruthlessly and cynically deployed by those who wanted to argue that Native Americans didn't really have a right to their own territory, because they weren't actively developing it in the style that Europeans saw fit. So the story of how barbed wire changed the West is also the story of how property rights changed the world. And it's also the story of how, even in a sophisticated economy, what the law says sometimes matters less than matters of simple practicality. The 1862 Homestead Act laid out the rules on who owned what in the western territories. But those rules didn't mean much before they were reinforced by barbed wire. Meanwhile, the barbed wire barons Gates and Glidden became rich - as did many others. The year that Glidden secured his barbed wire patent, 32 miles (51km) of wire were produced. Six years later, in 1880, the factory in De Kalb turned out 263,000 miles (423,000km) of wire, enough to circle the world 10 times over.

"People tie ribbon to fairy trees, like this one at Killary Harbour in County Galway, to ask for blessings and good luck Bad luck caused by disturbed fairy forts is causing dips in a major road between County Kerry and County Cork, an Irish member of parliament has said. Danny Healy-Raetold the Irish Times,externalthat issues with the N22 were caused by ""numerous fairy forts in the area"". The road had previously been repaired but problems had reappeared. Mr Healy-Rae said he shared local belief that ""there was something in these places you shouldn't touch"". He added that the road passed through an area that was rich in fairy folklore and magic. The N22 is the main road between Killarney in County Kerry and Cork. In Irish folklore, it is believed that disturbing areas, said to have strong connections to fairies, could bring bad luck or a curse. These areas include fairy forts, also known as raths or lios, which are the remains of hillforts or ancient circular dwellings, andfairy trees or thorn bushes. Some people believe that destroying or tampering with these forts, trees or bushes, could lead to them dying young or becoming seriously ill. This video can not be played Residents near Annacloy talk about what might happen to those who removed a 'fairy tree' in the area Mr Healy-Rae, an independent TD (Irish member of parliament) for County Kerry, said: ""I have a machine standing in the yard right now. And if someone told me to go out and knock a fairy fort or touch it, I would starve first."" The issue was raised at Kerry County Council, where Mr Healy-Rae's daughter, Maura, is a councillor, last week. She told a council meeting that her father was convinced fairies were in the area of the road problems. Mr Healy-Rae also raised the issue at Kerry County Council in 2007 when he was a councillor, asking if a dip in the N22 near Curraglass was caused by ""fairies at work"". The Irish Times reports that the council's road department replied that it was due to a ""deeper underlying subsoil/geotechnical problem"".

Francesco Pesce also told the BBC how Chloe Ayling, 20, had been acting under duress when she was taken shopping by her captor before she was freed. Ms Ayling was allegedly kidnapped by a group calling itself Black Death before she was released five days later. She came home on Sunday, 26 days after she flew to Milan for a photo shoot. There, Italian police say she was attacked by two men, drugged with ketamine and abducted, apparently to be sold in an online auction. It is alleged the kidnappers attempted to sell the model online for Â£230,000 and demanded her agent paid a ransom fee. This video can not be played Chloe Ayling's lawyer says she thought the best thing to do was to be nice to her captor Mr Pesce said Ms Ayling, from Coulsdon, south London, was told she was to be ""sold to somebody in the Middle East for sex"". He said she had gone shopping with her captor because she had been threatened with death. ""She was told that people were there watching her and were ready to kill her if she tried anything,"" he said. ""So she thought that the best idea was to go along with it and be nice to her captor, because he told her he wanted to release her somehow and some time."" Italian police released an image of suspect Lukasz Herba Speaking on Sunday, Ms Ayling said she feared for her life throughout the ""terrifying experience"". ""I'm incredibly grateful to the Italian and UK authorities for all they have done to secure my safe release."" Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Tuesday, Ms Ayling's close friend Carla Berlucci, who also runs a model agency, said girls in the industry had to take care. ""Safety is always first, safety is number one,"" she said. This video can not be played Carla Belluci, a close friend of Ms Ayling, gives her reaction She described her friend, who she has known since Chloe was 15, as a ""good girl, a little bit naive"". Investigations into the case are being carried out by authorities in Italy, Poland and the UK. Italian Police say she was transported in a car to a house in Borgial, north west of Turin, where she was handcuffed to a wooden chest of drawers in a bedroom for six days. She was finally released after being taken to the British consulate in Milan, Italian officials say. The officers said they had arrested Polish national Lukasz Herba, who lives in Oldbury in the West Midlands, on kidnapping charges. The UK's National Crime Agency said it had been working with the East Midlands Special Operations Unit (EMSOU) and the Italian authorities.

"Canada's first supervised injection site fought to stay open As the opioid crisis spreads across North America, the Canadian city of Vancouver is pioneering a radical approach to drug treatment - let addicts use. It's ""cheque day"" in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, and people are feeling good. Having just cashed their monthly social assistance stipend, many residents have flocked to the local street market, where vendors peddle everything from bootlegged DVDs to handmade crafts. But the marketplace is not the only place where money is changing hands. In the alleyways and squats that pepper the neighbourhood the drug economy is booming, and so are the overdoses. ""You come to work every day and you find out who has died,"" says Sarah Blyth, a community advocate who runs the street market. ""It is extremely depressing."" Heroin has been a part of the Downtown Eastside for as long as most people can remember. By the 1990s, needle-sharing among drug users in the city led to ""the most explosive epidemic of HIV ever observed outside of Sub-Saharan Africa,"" according to Aids researcher Dr Thomas Kerr. This early drug crisis led to the opening of North America's first supervised injection site, Insite. Now, as an opioid epidemic spreads, the Downtown Eastside has become an incubator for a variety of out-of-the-box drug treatments. Insite, the supervised injection site is right across from the market. Since opening its doors in 2003, the clinic has become an integral part of Vancouver's downtown. The space is gleaming and clinical - a far cry from the popular image of addicts huddled in a dirty alleyway. In June 2017 alone, Insite's injection room was visited about 10,600 times. In 14 years, no one has died of a drug overdose at Insite or any other supervised injection site in Vancouver. Founding director Chris Buchner says the facility provides ""dignity to people who are not afforded a lot of dignity in their day to day lives"". Mr Buchner began his career as an HIV activist in Montreal, and took on the role at Insite to treat ""problematic substance use not as a criminal action or a moral failure but as a health and social issue"". Patients are allowed to inject their own drugs at the clinic, while a nurse or doctor looks on. Insite helps connect drug users to other social services, like housing and mental-health resources, and provides detox services to help people get clean. Supplies at a new supervised injection site located in Surrey, BC Dozens of papers in peer-reviewed journals, including the British Medical Journal and the Lancet, support Insite's claims that such strategies reduce disease and public disorder and can actually help encourage people to get off drugs for good. This research has helped fuel an interest in opening up similar sites across North America. To date, Health Canada has licensed 16 supervised injection sites across the country. The American city of Seattle also hopes to open a clinic. Critics have accused Insite of giving up on addicts, but the clinic's current director Dr Mark Lysyshyn believes it is just the opposite. ""It is helping people when they need you, helping them stay alive until they get to the point where treatment or detox is an option for them,"" he says. But it was the spread of fentanyl, a deadly opioid between 50 and 100 times more powerful than heroin, that turned supervised injection from a medical experiment into a necessity. A person injects drugs at Area 62, which is run by the Overdose Prevention Society Nowhere has been hit harder than Vancouver. The city is projected to see 430 overdose deaths in 2017, nearly double from last year. Blyth remembers when things first started to take a turn, towards the start of 2016. Although overdoses have always been a problem in the alleyway behind the market, she says it got to the point where every morning there would be a new body. ""People were falling down all over the place,"" she says. Drugs kill nine in 24 hours in Vancouver The 100 words that triggered the opioid crisis Ms Blyth had been trained in how to administer Naloxone, an antidote to opioid overdoses, when she worked at a homeless shelter in the area. Soon, she found herself running to Insite to grab Naloxone kits every day. In the fall of 2016, she and a group of volunteers created the Overdose Prevention Society, a grassroots supervised injection site located between the street market and the alleyway, in what is now known as ""Area 62"". She helped train people to use Naloxone, and started crowdfunding to buy their own supplies. Sarah Blyth stands outside the Downtown Eastside street market Unlike Insite, which was granted a special exemption to the federal drug laws by the government, Area 62 was illegal when it first opened. Police turned a blind eye until Christmas 2016, when Vancouver's public health department agreed to issue them a license. ""We just said 'screw it, we are going to have a space',"" she says. ""And anyone who says we can't, we are just going to say we are saving lives, bugger off."" The Overdose Prevention Society is run out of trailers and tents. Most of the volunteers are from the area, and are either drug users themselves, or have family members who are. Blyth says that for many, saving other people's lives helps gives them a reason to stay clean. ""It gives them wind in their sails,"" she says. Robin Macintosh, a neighbourhood resident whose brother overdosed in 1993, says volunteering has given her life meaning. She counts the number of lives she's saved in the hundreds. ""This is my baby,"" she says. Just down the street from Area 62 is one of the most heavily guarded stashes of heroin in the city. But it's not a drug dealer's den. Rather, it is Providence Crosstown Clinic, the only medical facility in Canada prescribing heroin to addicts. Although diacetylmorphine - pure heroin - is prescribed by some UK doctors and in some parts of Europe, Crosstown is the only place in North America that helps addicts get their fix. The programme began in 2009, and is running at capacity with 130 patients. 'I get my heroin on the NHS',external Russell Cooper says prescription heroin from Providence Crosstown Clinic has saved his life Russell Cooper is one of them. A big burly guy with a leather vest, he looks like he would fit right in on the set of Sons of Anarchy, but he is patient and soft spoken, and says he understands why people might disagree with the controversial treatment. ""I do not blame them. Why should their tax dollars put out for people to just go get high?"" he says after his morning dose. ""All I can say to them is addiction is a very powerful thing."" Mr Cooper has been using for 30 years, since he tried heroin for the first time while in prison. It made him feel good - he liked it, and his friends used it. But when his fix wore off, he was left shaking and sweating, with only one thing on his mind - where could he find more heroin. When he got out of prison, he started dealing drugs to support his habit. He lost custody of his son and stayed in homeless shelters. He tried methadone treatment multiple times, sometimes going one or two whole years without using. But he always came back. The heroin-ravaged city fighting back Life in an open-air heroin camp ""The methadone is kind of just putting a blanket over it but sooner or later, you are going to start getting cold,"" he says. Cooper is the ideal candidate for this kind of programme, says Dr Scott MacDonald, lead physician at Crosstown. Prescription heroin is a last resort for people who have tried to quit many times before. Like Insite, Crosstown also connects people to social services in the city. That's really its purpose, says Dr MacDonald. By giving them stable doses of clean drugs, without the toxic fentanyl, addicts will be able to maintain their addiction and stay off the streets. Mr Cooper believes the programme has saved his life. He is out of a homeless shelter and living in his own apartment. He makes some money doing odd jobs in his building and helping a friend who works with racehorses. And he volunteers to go to children's schools, and educate them about the dangers of opioids. ""It could not be better. Things you never thought you would get,"" he says. The one thing he wants most is to reconnect with his 12-year-old son. ""The questions are starting to get harder and harder to answer,"" he says. ""I talked to his mom about it and she said the best thing for you to do is be honest."" Despite the number of addiction programmes in Vancouver, the rise of fentanyl-related deaths means health officials are always playing catch up. ""It feels a little bit like a bridge to nowhere sometimes,"" says Mr Buchner. Vancouver's downtown eastside He now works for suburban public health authority, Fraser Health, and says programmes that work in Downtown Eastside won't be as effective elsewhere. ""Unlike in Vancouver, where the vast majority of overdoses are centralised in five square blocks, in other communities they are spread out,"" he says. Most overdose deaths occur when someone takes drugs alone in their apartment, public health data shows, which means it's vital to connect with people before they use. Fraser Health has been deploying nurses to areas where there has been overdoses in the past, to distribute Naloxone kits and supervise injections in people's homes. But Mr Buchner says governments also need to invest in stable housing, mental health resources and education, so that people don't feel the need to use to begin with, he says. ""We can keep people alive, but when we keep people alive just to overdose again, why will we not build them housing?"" Dr Lysyshyn agrees the overdoses will slow when drug addicts are not treated as moral failures. ""We will never be able to supervise all the injections,"" he says. ""So ultimately the strategies about preventing this are not about Naloxone, they are about changing drug policy.""

"Kenneth Noye fled to Spain after he murdered Stephen Cameron in 1996 Road-rage killer Kenneth Noye is to be transferred to an open prison after the justice secretary accepted a Parole Board recommendation. Noye, 70, was convicted of murdering 21-year-old Stephen Cameron in an attack on the M25 in Kent in 1996. He wassentenced to life,externalwith a minimum term of 16 years in 2000. Last month the Parole Board said it was not directing Noye's release, butrecommended that he be transferredto ""open conditions"". Noye is expected to be moved to the open prison within about six weeks though no date has yet been set. A statement from the Ministry of Justice said: ""Public protection is our top priority and transfers to open conditions are made only after a thorough, expert, risk assessment carried out by the independent Parole Board."" Live: More on this story and other news from Kent Stephen Cameron was 21 when he was stabbed to death by Noye In 2015 the then Justice Secretary Michael Goverejected the Parole Board's recommendationfor Noye's transfer to an open prison. The BBC's Home Affairs Correspondent Danny Shaw said since then Noye has apparently ""expressed remorse and guilt and made progress in rehabilitation"". Earlier this year he won a High Court challenge against the refusal decision, which his counsel argued was ""unlawful and irrational"". The Parole Board can consider him for release in 2019. It could also choose to leave him in an open prison or transfer him back to closed conditions. Profile: Kenneth Noye Noye is one of Britain's most notorious criminals and was convicted in 1986 for his involvement in the 1983 Brink's-Mat heist - one of the UK's biggest robberies. He was sentenced to 14 years in jail and released just two years before the murder of Stephen Cameron. The electrician was stabbed to death on a slip road of the M25 at Swanley in Kent. Noye later claimed he killed Mr Cameron in self-defence during a road-rage fight. He went on the run after the killing, but was arrested in Spain in 1998 and extradited back to the UK. He was jailed in 2000 with a minimum term set at 16 years in 2002 by the then Home Secretary David Blunkett.

"This video can not be played Ubrique is beautiful but remote The town of Ubrique in southern Spain is beautiful but remote. It doesn't have an airport or a train station and even buses are irregular. Its position, nestled at the bottom of a valley surrounded by big hills, means the easiest way to get there is by car. But even then drivers have to navigate winding and often steep roads. The town is around 75 miles south of Seville, nowhere near the world's fashion capitals of Milan, Paris, New York or London. Yet this collection of whitewashed houses, known as a pueblo blanco (white town) in Spanish, is where many of the top fashion brands source their leather goods. Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Hermes, Chanel, Chloe, Loewe and Carolina Herrera are all reported to use the artisans here to make things such as handbags, wallets and belts. The factory workers can't talk about the brands they produce goods for Yet almost none of these designers is willing to talk about it. Most of the secrecy comes from the fear of someone using the high end designs to produce cheap copycat products, a costly problem for luxury retailers. Juan Antonio Sanchez, manager at leather goods manufacturer Ranchel, says the big brands often have strict demands. ""We have to sign a contract of confidentiality, then the factory, the manager and every worker have to sign it. ""They have an individual contact and they cannot take pictures, they cannot take the designs or anything to do with the products,"" he explains. Mr Sanchez's firm, which was started by his father, has now been making leather items for over forty years. But the town's specialisation in leather goes back much further than this. Ubrique's focus on leather goes back centuries It started more than 200 years ago, initially with tanning leather. Eventually this evolved into the precise leatherwork which the town has become so well known for. Now the leather is bought in from elsewhere, already tanned and those in Ubrique focus on the more skilled manufacturing work. Today more than half the town's residents work in the leather trade, producing the majority of leather goods sold in the country as well as supplying many big overseas fashion houses. The techniques needed to produce such goods at the top end of the quality scale has been passed down from generation to generation. Mr Sanchez says most in the town learn these skills when they're young by watching their parents as they work. ""That technique it can only go from father to son, because it's very specialised. Kind of they have it in their blood,"" says Mr Sanchez. Many of the factories refuse to use an assembly line to speed up the manufacturing process It's these kind of skills, honed over generations,  which have drawn in the big brand names. Word of mouth is often how designers have found out about Ubrique. Jose Urrutia, founder of high end shoe and accessories firm La Portegna, says an acquaintance told him about the town. ""I asked them for some samples and I was blown away by the quality of the stuff they made,"" he says. For Mr Urrutia the town's history and the way the trade has been passed on through generations is also part of the attraction, because it helps him create a story around his brand. He says the idea for the firm came from his grandmother - a keen traveller who'd  befriended the writer Ernest Hemingway on her exotic round-the-world trips. Jose Urrutia says this kind of craftmanship is dying out Browsing her photos made Mr Urrutia nostalgic for a bygone era when items were special and treasured. He wanted to try and create the same feeling with his company's products. ""In Ubrique what they're very good at is helping you because they have tons of experience. They've been doing this for centuries."" He says this kind of slow but precise artisanship is dying out and increasingly hard to find elsewhere. ""The whole concept of craftmanship is dying. The beautiful thing about this place is that it's not just one street or a couple of houses. It's an entire village."" He acknowledges that he could find cheaper, larger manufacturers elsewhere, but says that's not the point. ""There's always been a notion of the economies of scale but that doesn't work that well here. A good bag needs x amount of hours. You can't cheat your way into it."" While some of the factories here have started to use an assembly line to speed up the manufacturing process, many have refused to compromise. Some in the town believe there should be a ""Made in Ubrique"" label Jorge Oliva Perez, general manager at local leather brand El Potro says a single worker still makes the entire bag, bar the cutting and the design. ""It's very important to hold onto these skills,"" says Jorge. Like many of those working here, Jorge would like this expertise officially recognised with  - a ""Made in Ubrique"" label. ""I think it's very important for our future,"" he says. The town's artisans are having to compete with cheaper rivals elsewhere It could also help the town with the ever present threat of cheaper rivals moving into their territory. It's already happened once. Around  a decade ago - at about the time of the financial crisis -  the manufacturers here suffered a dramatic drop in orders. Many of the big brands had decided to cut costs by switching supplier - in most cases shifting orders to China or elsewhere in Asia. While orders from cheaper brands continued, there was less work overall which meant some people lost their jobs and went into other industries. The fact the products are handmade means each one is subtly different Nonetheless, Ubrique's councillor for culture Jose Manuel Fernadez Rivera says most workers ""kept working because they knew that their quality was better and they were going to come back"". It turned out to be true. A year later, most of the big brands had returned. ""The Chinese learn very fast but we know that the quality, the detail that we give in every piece, which is what the brands ask for, they're not going to get that,"" he says. The other issue that drove the brands to return to a European manufacturer, was that a bag made in Asia was a tough sell to some of their biggest customers - those living in Hong Kong, China and Singapore. When they're paying hundreds, or in some cases thousands of euros, to buy a bag from a top Italian and French designer then they expect it to be made there not in their home country. And of course they also expect that artisan touch. ""In this business you have to work with your hands. Every product is different because you do it one by one,"" says Mr Sanchez.

"Melissa Fehr's bone marrow transplant meant she had to take many medications Tens of millions of chronically ill people around the world rely on repeat prescriptions, but getting the drugs they need can be a time-consuming and frustrating process. Now apps, automation and home delivery services are making their lives easier. When Melissa Fehr came home from hospital after undergoing a major bone marrow procedure, she says she was carrying ""two enormous bags of medication"". There were drugs to guard against infection, and other drugs to combat the side effects of other drugs, she says. A bout of shingles was ""horrible ... it was just constant pain, so I was prescribed five or six different pain killers"", she says. ""It was at that point I realised I needed an app to manage things, because some of them were five times a day, some were three times a day, some were within an hour of eating, some were 'you can't eat'...it was all over the place."" So she went online and found an app that gave her an alert every time she needed to take one of her medications and recorded each time she took something. ""I've been using it for years,"" she says. Echo monitors your medication-taking and sends replacement drugs in the post But an added complication was getting doctors to sign off repeat prescriptions and then going to the pharmacy to fulfil the order. She would often have to do this in person each time, despite having the same prescription each month. Even surgeries that had electronic prescription capability would sometimes fall down on their communications when the prescribing doctor went on holiday, says Ms Fehr. This was frustrating and wasted a lot of her time. Now the revamped Echo app keeps tabs on her medications consumption, automatically re-orders the drugs for her and sends them to her by post. ""It's been an absolute life-saver,"" she says. Seven years after the transplant operation Ms Fehr, who was born in Perry County, Pennsylvania but now lives in London, is running marathons and recently won several medals at the World Transplant Games. Stephen Bourke, who founded Echo along with partner and chief executive Sai Lakshmi, says there are at least 50 million unnecessary GP appointments each year. Technology is removing much of the hassle of renewing subscriptions ""It's all about reducing paperwork,"" says Mr Bourke, who also needs regular prescriptions for his own anti-anxiety medicine. ""My doctors don't need to see me for a repeat prescription - it's a waste of time if they do,"" he says. Online pharmacies such as Pharmacy2U, LloydsPharmacy and Boots will also handle repeat prescriptions and send the drugs to your home, but Mr Bourke says there are very few services that also help patients manage how they take the medicines. ""Research shows that around a third to half of all medications are not taken as directed - it's a big problem,"" he says. ""We turn these directions into reminders that people can understand using natural language processing; we get rid of all the irrelevant stuff."" And not all pharmacies deliver, so the app acts like a one-stop-shop for all a patient's repeat prescription needs, says Mr Bourke. Better drugs, faster: The potential of AI-powered humans Electric trucks and vans cut pollution faster than cars How Bitcoin is infiltrating the $60bn global art market Will live streaming of player data improve sport for fans? Innovation in this area is being helped by the UK National Health Service's (NHS) Electronic Prescription Service (EPS), which has been rolled out over the last few years. It enables doctors to send prescriptions direct to pharmacies electronically without any need for paper. So far, approaching 6,900 GP [general practitioner] practices and 11,700 pharmacies have signed up, and nearly 1.3 billion items have been dispensed and claimed to date, says NHS Digital. More than half of all prescriptions issued in England are now done electronically. ""The EPS messaging system is embedded into the prescribing and dispensing systems used by doctors and pharmacies and these systems work seamlessly together,"" says Richard Ashcroft, programme director, digital medicines at NHS Digital. ""Eventually EPS will remove the need for most paper prescriptions."" ""What do you mean, you're out of stock?"" Could these days soon be over? Patients have to make fewer trips to pharmacies and wait for less time when they're there, while a doctor's practice saves an average of 80 minutes a day not having to write out repeat prescriptions, says NHS Digital. Such efficiencies have saved the NHS Â£137m; doctors' practices Â£328m; pharmacies Â£59m; and patients Â£75m, between 2013 and 2016, NHS Digital says. But start-ups like Echo and others face formidable competition from established players such as Emis and TPP, which dominate the software market for doctors in England, as well as from the big retail pharmacy chains. ""We think there needs to be more competition,"" says Mr Bourke, whose app has been downloaded more than 45,000 times. In the US, around 40 million adults take more than five prescription medications a day, says PillPack chief executive TJ Parker. Each PillPack packet lists the medications inside and the date and time they should be taken So his company spent three-and-a-half years building a platform, PharmacyOS, to handle every aspect of the repeat prescription process: prescribing, dispensing, delivering, billing, handling insurance claims, as well as pill-taking monitoring. ""We always made the promise that we'd make this really simple and easy,"" says Mr Parker. While large retail pharmacies like Walgreens, Boots, and Walmart now offer same-day delivery of medicines in the US, ""they aren't offering an end-to-end service like us"", he says. PillPack is now making about $100m in revenues, says Mr Parker, who adds that the PharmacyOS platform will enable the company to expand from serving ""tens of thousands of customers, to millions"". Rivals like Phil.us are also providing competition in this area. The good news for the millions of patients on repeat prescriptions around the world is that innovative tech is at least making one aspect of their lives that bit easier.

"If the seven-year-old boy ate normally, protein would accumulate in his blood in dangerous concentrations The family of a seven-year-old boy whose condition could cause brain damage have won a High Court challenge over an NHS decision not to fund a life-changing drug. The child, ""S"", has a rare condition that means he cannot break down an amino acid, and he is autistic, which makes controlling his diet difficult. A judge quashed the funding decision and sent it for reconsideration. NHS England said it will reconsider but the ruling will not affect other cases. The parents of the boy, who has phenylketonuria or PKU, want a drug called Kuvan to help him metabolise phenylalanine, an amino acid found in some proteins, which would cost about Â£100 a day. If the boy ate normally, protein would accumulate in his blood in dangerous concentrations. But Mrs Justice Andrews said: ""Whilst this judgment is bound to give rise to a degree of optimism, I must caution against raising hopes too high. ""The fact that this claim for judicial review has succeeded does not mean that there will necessarily be a favourable outcome to this IFR (individual funding request) application."" The boy's father said: ""We are very pleased that the court has ordered that NHS England reconsider their decision not to fund Kuvan for our son. ""It's been a very difficult two years for our whole family and we are hoping that the funding will be granted soon, so that our son's quality of life can be improved significantly."" An NHS consultant who was treating S, at Birmingham Children's Hospital, first applied to NHS England by an IFR for funding for Kuvan on the grounds the boy's case was ""exceptional"". The boy's father told the court that the management of his condition had become more difficult over time because he had grown more interested in normal foods since going to school and seeing other children eat. He would be able to get a proportion of vitamins and minerals from ordinary food if he was prescribed the drug. S's father said the NHS's decision was ""extremely frustrating, unfair and inhumane"". ""No family should have to fight with the NHS for over 18 months to ensure that their child is given proper treatment,"" he said. ""It is clear to me they do not want to fund this life-changing drug."" Mrs Justice Andrews quashed the decision at London's High Court The family's counsel, Ian Wise QC, told the court that differing reasons had been given by NHS England for repeatedly refusing the funding for the drug. He said this left S at risk of the consequences of poorly-controlled PKU. Jenni Richards QC, for NHS England, told the court that the main part of PKU treatment was dietary control, even with Kuvan. She said S's consultant acknowledged that the boy's overall development in terms of neurological impairment would mostly be affected by the severity of his autism rather than his PKU. By Michelle Roberts, BBC News PKU can be managed by following a strict diet that limits foods containing phenylalanine - the amino acid these patients have difficulty with. Child S also has autism, and his parents say controlling his condition through diet alone, avoiding or limiting foods like eggs, meat, fish and cheese, is too challenging. The drug Kuvan is a treatment that provides the body with a substance that helps break down phenylalanine, but it only helps some people with PKU. Even if the medication does help, patients still need to control their diet. The drug is also expensive - costing about Â£100 a day. NHS England, which take into account a drug's cost versus benefit when making prescribing decisions, has so far refused to fund Kuvan for child S. In her ruling, the judge said if the term ""clinical effectiveness"" was properly interpreted, the evidence that the drug was clinically effective was ""overwhelming"". ""Given that the supposed absence of evidence of clinical effectiveness was the specific reason given... for turning down the application, that is such a material error that it suffices in and of itself to warrant quashing the decision and sending it back for reconsideration,"" she said. The judge said the funding panel ""could still lawfully decide to refuse funding"". ""It is their decision, and their decision alone; and provided it is taken on the basis of the correct interpretation of the IFR policy, and a proper understanding of the case put before the panel and the supporting evidence, it will not be open to challenge,"" she said. The lawyer for the boy's family, Peter Todd, of Hodge Jones and Allen solicitors, said: ""Although no mandatory order for funding was made, it would be wholly extraordinary if the IFR panel was to, once again, find reason to not fund this life-changing drug for a child. ""My clients have felt increasingly disillusioned with NHS England, and frustrated by their constantly changing reasons to not fund the treatment. ""We hope that the panel will now take prompt action and secure the funding to ensure that [the boy's] long-term health is no longer endangered."" An NHS England spokesman said: ""We note that the judge accepted that NHS England had met its statutory duties under the Children Act and rejected the assertion that NHS England was acting in breach of the Human Rights Act. ""While the outcome of this case is limited to the particular circumstances of this funding request and does not have any wider implications for how NHS England makes decisions regarding the funding of treatments, we will of course take a further look at the IFR in question in the light of any further information provided to us.""

"The air monitoring station at Jungfraujoch, in Switzerland, has detected the Italian emissions for nine years Potent, climate-warming gases are being emitted into the atmosphere but are not being recorded in official inventories, aBBC investigationhas found. Air monitors in Switzerland have detected large quantities of one gas coming from a location in Italy. However, the Italian submission to the UN records just a tiny amount of the substance being emitted. Levels of some emissions from India and China are so uncertain that experts say their records are plus or minus 100%. These flaws posed a bigger threat to the Paris climate agreement than US President Donald Trump's intention to withdraw, researchers told BBC Radio 4'sCounting Carbonprogramme. Among the key provisions of the Paris climate deal, signed by 195 countries in December 2015, is the requirement that every country, rich or poor, has to submit an inventory of its greenhouse-gas emissions every two years. Under UN rules, most countries produce ""bottom-up"" records, based on how many car journeys are made or how much energy is used for heating homes and offices. Scientist Dr Stefan Reimann has been recording high levels of warming gases over the Swiss Alps But air-sampling programmes that record actual levels of gases, such as those run by the UK and Switzerland, sometimes reveal errors and omissions. In 2011, Swiss scientists firstpublished their data,externalon levels of a gas called HFC-23 coming from a location in northern Italy. Between 2008 and 2010, they had recorded samples of the chemical, produced in the refrigeration and air conditioning industries, which is 14,800 times more warming to the atmosphere than CO2. Now the scientists, at the Jungfraujoch Swiss air monitoring station, have told the BBC the gas is still going into the atmosphere. ""Our estimate for this location in Italy is about 60-80 tonnes of this substance being emitted every year. Then we can compare this with the Italian emission inventory, and that is quite interesting because the official inventory says below 10 tonnes or in the region of two to three tonnes,"" said Dr Stefan Reimann, from the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology. ""They actually say it is happening, but they don't think it is happening as much as we see. ""Just to put it into perspective, this greenhouse gas is thousands of times stronger than CO2. ""So, that would be like an Italian town of 80,000 inhabitants not emitting any CO2."" The Italian environment agency told the BBC its inventory was correct and complied with UN regulations and it did not accept the Swiss figures. Another rare warming gas, carbon tetrachloride, once popular as a refrigerant and a solvent but very damaging to the ozone layer, has been banned in Europe since 2002. Coal use in China has been subject to major revisions in the country's statistics But Dr Reimann told Counting Carbon: ""We still see 10,000-20,000 tonnes coming out of China every year."" ""That is something that shouldn't be there. ""There is actually no Chinese inventory for these gases, as they are banned and industry shouldn't be releasing them anymore."" China's approach to reporting its overall output of warming gases to the UN is also subject to constant and significant revisions. Its last submission ran to about 30 pages - the UK's, by contrast, runs to several hundred. Back in 2007, China simply refused to accept, in official documents, that it had become the largest emitter of CO2. ""I was working in China in 2007,"" said Dr Angel Hsu, from Yale University. ""I would include a citation and statistics that made this claim of China's position as the number one emitter - these were just stricken out, and I was told the Chinese government doesn't yet recognise this particular statistic so we are not going to include it."" Areport in 2015 suggested one error in China's statisticsamounted to 10% of global emissions in 2013. The BBC investigation also discovered vast uncertainties in carbon emissions inventories, particularly in developing countries. Methane, the second most abundant greenhouse gas after CO2, is produced by microbe activity in marshlands, in rice cultivation, from landfill, from agriculture and in the production of fossil fuels. Global levels have been rising in recent years, and scientists are unsure why. For a country such as India, home to 15% of the world's livestock, methane is a very important gas in their inventory - but the amount produced is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. There are huge uncertainties over methane emissions from India and other countries ""What they note is that methane emissions are about 50% uncertain for categories like ruminants, so what this means is that the emissions they submit could be plus or minus 50% of what's been submitted,"" said Dr Anita Ganesan, from the University of Bristol, who has overseen air monitoring research in the country. ""For nitrous oxide, that's 100%."" There are similar uncertainties with methane emissions in Russia, of between 30-40%, according to scientists who work there. ""What we're worried about is what the planet experiences, never mind what the statistics are,"" said Prof Euan Nisbet, from Royal Holloway, University of London. ""In the air, we see methane going up. The warming impact from that methane is enough to derail Paris."" The rules covering how countries report their emissions are currently being negotiated. But Prof Glen Peters, from the Centre for International Climate Research, in Oslo, said: ""The core part of Paris [is] the global stock-takes which are going to happen every five years, and after the stock-takes countries are meant to raise their ambition, but if you can't track progress sufficiently, which is the whole point of these stock-takes, you basically can't do anything. ""So, without good data as a basis, Paris essentially collapses. It just becomes a talkfest without much progress."" Follow Matt onTwitter,externaland onFacebook,external.

"The company that assisted the couple had initially insisted that the pair's Everest conquest claims were true Two police officers have been sacked after an inquiry found their claim to be the first Indian couple to climb Everest was fake. Dinesh and Tarakeshwari Rathod said last year that they had successfully reached the 8,850m (29,035ft) summit. But police in Maharashtra state on Monday confirmed the couple had ""morphed photographs"" to show a successful ascent on 23 May. The inquiry was launched after the pair'sclaims were queried by climbers. Additional Commissioner Sahebrao Patil told the PTI news agency that the couple ""shared misleading information"" and ""brought disrepute to the Maharashtra Police department"". It's not clear if the couple will also face charges. Human cost of clamour to conquer Everest Everest climbers worried about oxygen theft Everest's Hillary Step: Has it gone or not? Nepalese authorities alsoimposed a 10-year mountaineering banlast year on the couple after concluding that their claim was fake. The country's tourism department had initially certified their ascent but rescinded that decision after conducting an investigation. It is alleged that these photos which purportedly show Dinesh and Tarakeshwari Rathod also did not belong to them Mr and Mrs Rathod initially told reporters that their pictures were real. But a climber based in the southern Indian city of Bangalore, Satyarup Sidhantha, later told the media that the photographs presented by the Rathods as ""proof"" of their climb actually belonged to him. Suspicions were further aroused because of the time lag between the day the Rathods claimed to have reached the summit and their news conference announcing their achievement. It was alleged that the couple could not possibly have reached the summit so soon after they were seen to have arrived at the base camp, and that the photos appeared to show them in two different sets of clothes and boots while on the climb. Many of those who have succeeded in scaling the 8,848m (29,029ft) mountain have subsequently gone on to have lucrative careers as motivational speakers and authors. Mountaineering is a major source of income for impoverished Nepal. More than 450 people, including more than 250 foreigners, climbed Everest during the spring season last year. It followed two consecutive years of poor weather - made worse by the Nepal earthquake of 2015 - which resulted in almost all Everest attempts being abandoned.

"Forces within his own party are now trying to bring down South African President Jacob Zuma South Africa is up in arms. Marches are being organised in support of President Jacob Zuma, as deafening protests call on him to step down. The president has survived several votes of no-confidence in the past - the latest on 8 August - even though this time it was not just the opposition who were trying to unseat him. Within the governing ANC, some are disgusted at the scandal surrounding their leader and have said they are facing a campaign of intimidation aimed at propping him up. It may not be enough. A public outcry erupted after a series of leaked emails appeared to show the extent to which President Zuma's billionaire friends, the Gupta family, exerted influence. Although the emails have not been independently verified, the alleged corruption they point to has coined a new name, ""state capture"". The family also stand accused of hiring a British PR firm to distract attention from the allegations by blaming the country's problems on white-owned businesses, or ""white monopoly capital"". Both the Guptas and President Zuma deny wrongdoing. But as it has raised the toxic subject of race once again, the scandal has brought South Africa to the brink. And it's not ""Zuma must go"" that the crowds are chanting - it's ""the Zuptas must go"". ""The Guptas are the most hated family in South Africa"" says journalist Micah Reddy. He writes for the online news site AmaBhungane, which has played a crucial role in unveiling the murky interactions between the family and the Zumas by publishing ""the Gupta leaks"". These are more than 100,000 leaked emails between the family and their associates, which it is claimed suggest a complex web of government contracts, as well as alleged kickbacks and money laundering. This video can not be played Andrew Harding reports on allegations of high-level corruption in South Africa involving a British PR company So, who are the Guptas? The three Gupta brothers moved to South Africa from India in 1993. Since then, the family has become very close to President Zuma. They have also become billionaires - and for many people in South Africa, it's hard not to connect the two. The Guptas started with a relatively small computer business, but in the space of two decades they have come to own coal and uranium mines, technology businesses, arms and manufacturing interests as well as a TV station and a national newspaper. The Guptas' influence on Jacob Zuma was cemented in 2007, when Zuma became the leader of the ANC. New laws in South Africa at the time made it essential for big companies to have black directors, particularly if they wanted to win government contracts. In a masterstroke, the Guptas appointed a very young and relatively inexperienced Duduzane Zuma, the son of the future president, to the boards of a number of their companies. 2005: Charged with corruption overmulti-billion dollar 1999 arms deal- charges dropped shortly before he becomes president in 2009 2016: Court orders he should be charged with 786 counts of corruption over the deal - he has appealed 2005: Charged withraping family friend - acquittedin 2006 2016: Court rules he breached his oath of office by using government money to upgradeprivate home in Nkandla- he has repaid the money 2017: Public protector said he should appoint judge-led inquiry into allegations heprofiteered from relationship with wealthy Gupta family- he denies allegations, as have the Guptas No inquiry appointed yet The Guptas and their links to Zuma South Africa's anti-corruption crusader How President Zuma's Nkandla home has grown Since then, they have also employed President Zuma's wife and daughter, and are alleged to have paid for a lavish wedding for Duduzane, as well as a number of extravagant perks, including a palatial flat in Dubai. The Guptas' interests are now seen as being so intertwined with the Zumas that they are known in South Africa as ""the Zuptas"". The Guptas also deny wrongdoing, and say they are victims of racism and xenophobia. The family are seen to have a grip on the levers of power in South Africa, including influencing the hiring and firing of ministers. Julius Malema has led the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters since he was thrown out of the ANC in 2013. He says he has seen the Gupta family's influence on President Zuma since 2011, when he was still an ANC insider. ""They have bought a country for themselves. They have bought a president who dines with them, who takes instructions from them. He doesn't even take instructions from his own party, but he takes instructions from that family,"" he told the BBC. Julius Malema, a former ANC member, believe the Guptas have more influence than the president's political colleagues He recounts an instance when the Guptas announced who the next sports minister would be long before the cabinet had been told. This chimes with the very public allegation from former Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas, that he was offered 600m Rand (Â£34m; $45m) by the Gupta family to be the next finance minister - as long as he did their bidding. The Gupta family have denied this account, and within a month, the deputy finance minister had been sacked. Guptas deny South Africa bribe meeting A damning report from the public protector, the government ombudsman in South Africa, also accused the Guptas and President Zuma of colluding to win government contracts at inflated prices, to exert influence on ministers to help Gupta-owned businesses, and to earn kickbacks from international companies by promising them access to South African markets. The report also indicates that the alleged influence is not only exerted at the ministerial level. Whole boards of state-owned companies are said to have been sacked and replaced with ""Gupta-friendly"" candidates. This is perhaps the most dangerous aspect of ""state capture"". It's not only the alleged misuse of billions of rands of public money; the most devastating effect may yet prove to be the erosion of trust in public institutions. Law-enforcement groups charged with investigating corruption now face claims of infiltration by ""Gupta lackeys"". Atul Gupta, who runs the family's media empire, is adamant that the long list of allegations is just ""perception mongering"" on behalf of ""white monopoly capital"". This term for the white businesses who benefited from the head start they got under apartheid, and are still the biggest players in the South African economy, used to be an academic label confined to textbooks, but over the last year, it's become a furious buzzword all over social media. Many protesters are highly critical of the Gupta family Could this be the work of the British PR firm, Bell Pottinger? Hired by the Gupta family to raise awareness of ""economic apartheid"" in South Africa, they set up a social media campaign and advised on political messaging and speeches that blamed unemployment and inequality in South Africa on white-owned businesses. Bell Pottinger deny responsibility for the racial tensions that have followed, althoughthey have sacked the member of staff in charge of the account and launched an internal investigation. The company says it considers the social media campaign to have been ""inappropriate and offensive"" and that ""senior management have been misled about what has been done."" After the revelations in the Gupta leaks and the critical report by the public protector's office, a political backlash has begun. Politicians from all parties, including Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, have called for corruption money to be returned to the people of South Africa. Civil Society groups are organising conferences and marches to fight ""state capture"", and President Zuma faces a vote of no confidence. For the Guptas, this could be a moment of reckoning. The opposition parties have accused them of ""treason"". If President Zuma loses, Atul Gupta confesses that they might sell up their business interests. ""I decided a year ago that we might like to sell this company's shares because of so much restriction financially on our family, but I would like to stay in South Africa forever,"" he told the BBC. In the meantime, the chants of ""the Zuptas must go"" grow louder. Secret ballot for Zuma no-confidence vote South Africa's Gupta scandal.

"This video can not be played 'I kept my chemotherapy a secret' A number of UK women from South Asian backgrounds who have cancer hide it because of a perceived stigma about the disease, the BBC has learned. One woman chose to ""suffer on [her] own"" through chemotherapy for fear of her family's reaction, and questioned whether God was punishing her. Experts said others were seeking help too late, causing preventable deaths. In one case a woman sought treatment only when her breast was rotten. She later died as the cancer had spread. Pravina Patel, who told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme about her own experience, stumbled upon a lump in her breast when she was 36. She grew up in a strict Indian community where even talking about the disease was considered shameful. When she was diagnosed, she decided to hide it. ""I just thought if people hear the fact that I've got cancer, they're going to think it's a death sentence,"" she said. She remembered worrying that people would say she had lived a ""bad life"" and God was punishing her for it. Ms Patel continued to keep the disease a secret when seeking treatment, saying she felt ""extremely lonely"" during chemotherapy. ""I was going through chemo sessions on my own... I had some very dark days,"" she explained. Researcher Pooja Saini says some women are afraid having cancer ""might affect their children because no one would want to marry them"" Pooja Saini, the lead researcher at CLAHRC North-West Coast, a research arm of the NHS that looks into health inequalities, said her own review into the issue ""really surprised"" her. ""Some women went to the extent of not even having treatment because, if they went, people would know as they'd lose their hair,"" she explained. She added others ""feared it might affect their children because no-one would want to marry them"". It is difficult to say how widespread the problem was, because little information has been collected on ethnicity and mortality. But in 2014, research from Bridgewater NHS found Asian women between 15 and 64 years old had a significantly reduced survival rate for breast cancer of three years. Ms Saini said her research suggests the influence of men in the family and elders in the wider community may be contributing to the issue. ""If they didn't think women should go for screening, then they didn't go,"" she said. The stigma surrounding cancer in South Asian communities spans different forms of the disease. Ms Patel said there was a reluctance for women to go for a smear test because they did not want to be ""defiled"" or be considered ""no longer pure"". She has now completed her chemotherapy and is in remission. Ms Patel and her husband got divorced during her treatment - something she says was partly because of cultural expectations about how a wife should be. Madhu Agarwal says many South Asian women are seeking help too late Some experts are concerned that women are suffering unnecessarily. South Asian women are more likely to be from poor, deprived backgrounds, meaning their levels of awareness of cancer are likely to be lower. National screening statistics show people from ethnic minority communities do not go for screening as much as their white counterparts. Madhu Agarwal, a cancer support manager who has worked in the field of cancer for more than 30 years, fears this is leading to South Asian women dying unnecessarily. ""Because of the ignorance of not presenting early, not examining the breasts... the disease has already spread [when they do seek help] and it's very difficult to manage it with treatment. ""Then the mortality is high, so there is a stigma attached - that when you get cancer you're going to die."" She said one of her patients had come for treatment so late that her breast was ""fungating"" and ""rotten"". She recalled: ""It was smelling so much that you couldn't even sit next to it."" The woman - who had young children - died because the cancer had by then spread to other parts of her body, Ms Agarwal explained. Samina Hussain says one of her family told her to wear the hijab to hide her cancer The Victoria Derbyshire programme has heard several other accounts of the effects the stigma surrounding cancer can have. Samina Hussain said one of her family told her to wear hijab to hide her cancer, saying ""you can cover this up now"". Iyna Butt said her aunt refused chemotherapy as she felt ""God had given [cancer] to her"". Ms Saini is now calling for more data on screening uptake by ethnicity to be recorded, so findings can be used to provide more tailored support to communities. Public Health England's screening director Anne Mackie said when Ms Saini's research is published it will look to implement its suggestions. ""We've got every reason to believe that will help save women from [South] Asian backgrounds' lives as well as others from deprived backgrounds,"" she said.

"This video can not be played The chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives tells Today that when a system is under pressure mistakes can happen More than 40% of maternity wards in England closed their doors to expectant mothers at least once in 2016, data obtained by the Labour Party suggests. Responding to a Freedom of Information request, 42 out of 96 trusts said they had shut maternity wards temporarily on a total of 382 occasions. The most common reasons given were too few staff and not enough beds. The government said closures are ""well rehearsed"" and it was ""misleading"" to say they were down to staff shortages. The Royal College of Midwives said that sometimes it was right to close a unit and divert new admissions - when the safety of mothers and babies already being treated in the hospital might be compromised, for example. But doing so on a regular basis could reflect underlying problems with the number of expert staff. The data shows that in 2016 maternity units were closed on 382 separate occasions, compared with 375 in 2015 and 225 in 2014. Some were closed overnight, while other closures lasted more than 24 hours. Forty of the 136 hospital trusts in England did not respond to requests for information. Those that did included: Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust closed its maternity unit on 30 occasions in 2016, citing ""insufficient midwifery staffing for workload"" Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust closed its unit five times, once for 14.5 hours to ""maintain safety and staffing levels"" East Cheshire NHS Trust closed its maternity unit for eight hours, citing ""full cot occupancy"" in the neo-natal unit Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust closed its maternity unit 10 times, because of capacity, high activity and staffing Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""These findings show the devastating impact which Tory underfunding is having for mothers and children across the country. ""The uncertainty for so many women just when they need the NHS most is unthinkable."" Sean O'Sullivan, from the Royal College of Midwives, said the figures highlighted the pressures on  maternity services in England, where there was a shortage of 3,500 full-time midwives. ""If units are regularly and persistently having to close their doors, it suggests there is an underlying problem around capacity and staffing levels that needs immediate attention."" He also said it was upsetting and distressing for women to be diverted to other hospitals when they were in labour. National Childbirth Trust senior policy adviser Elizabeth Duff said it was ""appalling"" that pregnant women ""are pushed from pillar to post in the throes of labour"". ""New maternity policy in England stresses the need for locally based services which must have enough midwives so that women are not turned away in labour,"" she said. A Department of Health spokesperson said there were now more than 2,000 additional midwives compared with May 2010. There are also 6,500 midwives currently in training. ""Temporary closures in NHS maternity units are well rehearsed safety measures, which we expect trusts to use to safely manage peaks in admissions,"" the spokesman said. ""To use these figures as an indication of safe staffing issues, particularly when a number of them could have been for a matter of hours, is misleading because maternity services are unable to plan the exact time and place of birth for all women in their care.""

"Millarworld was founded by Mark Millar from Coatbridge almost 15 years ago A Scottish comic book company has been bought by streaming giant Netflix. Millarworld, founded by Mark Millar from Coatbridge, includes his portfolio of characters and stories such as Kick-Ass, Kingsman, and Old Man Logan. Mr Millar said he was still ""blinking"" over the news. He said it was only the third time a comic book purchase on this scale had ever happened, with Warner Bros buying DC Comics in 1968, and Disney buying Marvel in 2009. Mr Millar, who lives in Glasgow, started Millarworld as a creator-owned comic-book company nearly 15 years ago. He runs the company with his wife Lucy Millar. It is the first ever company acquisition in Netflix's history. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Mr Millar said: ""I'm so in love with what Netflix is doing and excited by their plans. ""Netflix is the future and Millarworld couldn't have a better home."" Netflix said the acquisition was a natural progression in the company's effort to work directly with prolific and skilled creators and to acquire intellectual property and ownership of stories. Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos said Mr Millar was ""as close as you can get to a modern day Stan Lee"" - the co-creator of Spider-Man and other Marvel characters. He said: ""Mark has created a next-generation comics universe, full of indelible characters living in situations people around the world can identify easily with. ""We look forward to creating new Netflix Originals from several existing franchises as well as new super-hero, anti-hero, fantasy, sci-fi and horror stories Mark and his team will continue to create and publish."" Netflix and Mr Millar will bring Millarworld's portfolio to life through films, series and kids' shows available exclusively to Netflix members globally. Millarworld is to continue to create and publish new stories and character franchises under the Netflix label. Mr Millar previously worked at Marvel for eight years where he developed the comic books and story arcs that inspired the first Avengers movie, Captain America: Civil War, and Logan (Wolverine). In a statement on his website he said: ""Over the years, Millarworld has amassed 20 different franchises working with the world's greatest artists and now Millarworld has been bought by the hottest, most exciting entertainment company on the planet. ""To say this is the best thing that ever happened in our professional lives would be an understatement."" Netflix is the world's leading Internet entertainment platform with 104 million members in more than 190 countries.

"There are tensions in republican areas of Belfast after the council moved in to restrict some anti-internment bonfires Extra police patrols are being deployed in Belfast after a series of attacks on officers, cars and property by youths in nationalist areas of the city. The troublebegan on Mondayafter council contractors removed material from an anti-internment bonfire in the Markets area, near the city centre. On Tuesday night, North Queen St was closed for a time due to a car on fire. The road is near a bonfire in the New Lodge and it is understood a number of petrol bombs were thrown on the road. However, police said the road had reopened to traffic shortly after 23:00 BST and was ""passable with care"". Bonfires are traditionally lit in some republican areas to mark the anniversary of the introduction of internment - detention without trial - on 9 August 1971. Council worker injured Belfast City Councilrecently passed a motionto say that contractors would remove material from bonfire that posed a risk to safety. However, on Tuesday evening the council told the BBC that it no longer has a contractor in place. On Monday, shortly after material was taken away from a bonfire in the Markets, a number of parked cars were set on fire and petrol bombs, stones and other missiles were thrown at police. Later that evening, trouble spread to other areas and a disused credit union building was set on fire in west Belfast. A former credit union was set on fire in west Belfast on Monday night Belfast City Council staff have also been targeted and on Tuesday, the council confirmed that one of its workers had been injured when a stone was thrown at a council vehicle. The member of staff received a cut to the head when the windscreen of their vehicle was smashed. A council spokesperson said it was one of two separate incidents in which stones were thrown at its vehicles. It also confirmed that some street cleansing and commercial waste collections were restricted in the Markets, New Lodge and Divis areas on Tuesday. Community centres in the New Lodge, Divis and Markets areas closed to the public at 17:00 BST. Belfast City Council workers cleaned up after a day of trouble in Belfast In a statement about Monday's attacks, the PSNI said officers had dealt with ""localised disorder caused by a small group of people"" - some as young as 12 - in the Markets, New Lodge and North Queen Street areas. Police are gathering evidence to bring those involved before the courts. They have also appealed for parents to be aware of their children's whereabouts. This video can not be played Cars were set on fire during Monday's unrest in Belfast Police helped the fire service to deal with Monday night's blaze, which started at about 21:00 BST at the former credit union on Ross Road in west Belfast. A bus was also damaged on the Falls Road a few hours later. Supt Andrea McMullan said: ""I would like to reassure the public that police patrols across Belfast will be increased over the coming days in an effort to curb this violence. ""I would also call on those with influence in local communities to exert some control in an effort to dissuade any repetition of this behaviour."" The police said it assisted the fire service in dealing with the blaze She described the attacks as ""senseless and unacceptable"". ""It achieves nothing - creating only inconvenience, disruption and misery for the local community,"" she added. Youths attack police and cars in Belfast Council backs Sinn FÃ©in bonfires motion On Monday afternoon, three cars were destroyed after they were set on fire and five other vehicles were damaged by stones and paint in the Markets. Later in the evening about 100 young people, including children aged 12, gathered in the area. Alliance councillor Emmet McDonough-Brown described the scenes in Belfast as ""disgraceful"" and said they must be ""condemned in the strongest terms"". ""The responsibility for last night's behaviour rests solely with the people who carried it out,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster. Young people threw stones and damaged cars during Monday's unrest ""The agreement to remove materials was agreed by all parties and I think this is not the first test of the issue."" Sinn FÃ©in councillor Deirdre Hargey said residents in the Markets area were ""completely disgusted"" at the trouble. Debris remains on Ross Road in west Belfast ""They don't want this and those involved in this disgusting behaviour are not representative of this community,"" she added. Ms Hargey said she did not expect the level of anti-social behaviour and vandalism and did not believe it was ""completely linked"" to Belfast City Council's decision to tackle dangerous bonfires. ""There have been ongoing incidents and I think a large part of those who have been involved in incidents either in the Markets, or especially in Divis, are involved in vandalism every other day of the year,"" she added. ""They have just used this as an opportunity or an excuse to carry out this type of behaviour that they do every other day."" She said she was concerned that there were ""older, more sinister elements involved in trying to encourage younger people into this activity"", but did not think they were dissident republicans.

"Lord Neuberger is retiring next month but says he is thinking of the dilemmas judges will face after Brexit Britain's most senior judge has told the government it must provide more clarity about how UK law will be developed after Brexit. Currently, UK legislation is subject to rulings made by the EU's highest court, the European Court of Justice. Lord Neuberger said Parliament must be ""very clear"" in telling the judges what to do about decisions of the ECJ after the UK leaves the EU. He said judges should not be blamed for misinterpretations if it is unclear. Prime Minister Theresa May has insisted the ECJ should have no jurisdiction over the UK after Britain leaves the EU. UK courts will continue to interpret ECJ case law - even after Brexit. What is the European Court of Justice? Lord Neuberger, who will step down as Supreme Court president next month, told the BBC that judges need more guidance on how they should do just that. ""If [the government] doesn't express clearly what the judges should do about decisions of the ECJ after Brexit, or indeed any other topic after Brexit, then the judges will simply have to do their best."" ""But to blame the judges for making the law when parliament has failed to do so would be unfair,"" he added. He said all judges ""would hope and expect Parliament to spell out how the judges would approach that sort of issue after Brexit, and to spell it out in a statute"". This video can not be played Leave campaigner Owen Paterson tells Today UK should set up body to mirror the ECJ The ECJ is in effect the EU's Supreme Court, overseeing the application and interpretation of EU law. Its rulings are binding on all member states. When the UK leaves the EU, the ECJ will continue to develop law on everything from consumer rights to discrimination - from things like compensation for airline passengers to transgender rights. The government's Repeal Bill states that UK courts do not have to pay any heed to decisions of the ECJ after the UK has left the EU - but any court ""may do so if it considers it appropriate"". Brexiteers, such as ex-Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, want the authority of the ECJ expunged as soon as possible after Brexit. He has called the court ""an illegitimate challenge to our sovereignty"". Opponents point out the apparent contradiction of that position, saying any British company or organisation doing business in the EU is subject to the jurisdiction of the ECJ. The EU's position document that deals with governance issues around the withdrawal agreement says all Court of Justice rulings would be enforceable in the UK. The government has said its repeal Bill - also known as the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill - will ensure that historic judgements of the ECJ will be given the same binding or precedent status in our courts as decisions of our own Supreme Court. These judgments extend some rights in areas including the calculation of holiday pay for UK workers. The Supreme Court rarely departs from one of its own decisions and so historic rulings of the ECJ will be binding upon it in almost all situations. Lord Neuberger will be succeeded as President of the Supreme Court by Lady Hale in September But Lord Neuberger said he was more concerned about post-Brexit rulings of the ECJ, adding: ""If the UK parliament says we should take into account decisions of the ECJ then we will do so. ""If it says we shouldn't then we won't. Basically we will do what the statute says."" Lord Neuberger, who will be replaced in his position by Baroness Hale, also expressed his concerns about cuts to legal aid, which was largely removed for most family cases in 2013. He said: ""I appreciate there are demands on government finance and money is short, but if people have a right to go to court to defend their position or enforce their rights then if they cannot do so the rule of law is undermined and we are all in a very unhappy situation."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, former Conservative minister Owen Paterson, who campaigned to leave the EU, suggested a new UK body with specialist British lawyers to adjudicate on the interpretation of EU law. ""You cannot leave the judges flapping around without clear guidance and I would suggest we set up our own body which would parallel and mirror and be in symmetry with the ECJ,"" he said. A government spokesman said: ""We have been clear that as we leave the EU, the direct jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK must come to an end. ""However, we want to provide maximum certainty so the Repeal Bill will ensure that for future cases, UK courts continue to interpret EU-derived law using the ECJ's case law, as it exists on the day we leave the EU.""

"Firms could face fines of up to Â£17m or 4% of global turnover if they fail to protect themselves from cyber-attacks, the government has warned. The crackdown is aimed at making sure essential services such as water, energy, transport and health firms are safeguarded against hacking attempts. Firms will also be required to show they have a strategy to cover power failures and environmental disasters. Digital Minister Matt Hancock said any fines would be a last resort. They would not apply to firms which had put safeguards in place but still suffered an attack, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said. Mr Hancock, who is launching a consultation on the plans, said: ""We want the UK to be the safest place in the world to live and be online, with our essential services and infrastructure prepared for the increasing risk of cyber-attack."" The DCMS said firms that take cyber-security seriously should already have measures in place to prevent attacks or systems failures. It said the consultation was aimed at determining how to implement the Network and Information Systems (NIS) directive which becomes law across the EU next May. It is separate from theGeneral Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), which are aimed at protecting data, rather than services. The GDPR will replace the UK's Data Protection Act 1998 from 25 May next year and the government has confirmed that the UK's decision to leave the EU will not change this. Earlier this year, NHS services across England and Scotland were hit by a large-scale cyber-attack that disrupted hospital and GP appointments. And the threat to firms from cyber-attacks appears to have grown. Nearly half (46%) of British businesses discovered at least one cyber-security breach or attack in the past year,a government survey earlier this year found. That proportion rose to two-thirds among medium and large companies. Most often, these breaches involved fraudulent emails being sent to staff or security issues relating to viruses, spyware or malware.

"Those who believe in a higher being are instinctively considered more moral, a new study claims Atheists ""are broadly perceived as potentially morally depraved and dangerous"" - even in secular countries. According to a new study, some atheists even have an in-built ""anti-atheist bias"" when it comes to judging a person's morality. But anti-atheist bias was strongest where there are high numbers of believers, like the United Arab Emirates, United States and India. Only New Zealand and Finland did not exhibit a clear bias against atheists. Pakistan's secret atheists The study, put together by an international team and published in the journalNature Human Behaviour,external, took into account the responses of more than 3,000 people across 13 countries and five continents. Those who took part were asked whether an imagined person, who tortured animals as a child before becoming a teacher and then killing five homeless people, was more likely to be religious or atheist. Across the study group, it was found people were twice as likely to believe the killer was an atheist. Study co-author Will Gervais, a psychology professor at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, told news agency AFP:  ""It is striking that even atheists appear to hold the same intuitive anti-atheist bias. ""I suspect that this stems from the prevalence of deeply entrenched pro-religious norms. Even in places that are currently quite overtly secular, people still seem to intuitively hold on to the believe that religion is a moral safeguard.""
